95932878	satanstoe or the littlepage manuscripts   a tale of the colony   by j fenimore cooper   the only amaranthine flower on earth is virtue the only treasure truthspenser      preface  every chronicle of manners has a certain value when customs are connected with principles in their origin development or end such records have a double importance and it is because we think we see such a connection between the facts and incidents of the littlepage manuscripts and certain important theories of our own time that we give the former to the world  it is perhaps a fault of your professed historian to refer too much to philosophical agencies and too little to those that are humbler the foundations of great events are often remotely laid in very capricious and uncalculated passions motives or impulses chance has usually as much to do with the fortunes of states as with those of individuals or if there be calculations connected with them at all they are the calculations of a power superior to any that exists in man  we had been led to lay these manuscripts before the world partly by considerations of the above nature and partly on account of the manner in which the two works we have named satanstoe and the chainbearer relate directly to the great new york question of the day antirentism which question will be found to be pretty fully laid bare in the third and last book of the series these three works which contain all the littlepage manuscripts do not form sequels to each other in the sense of personal histories or as narratives while they do in that of principles the reader will see that the early career the attachment the marriage c of mr cornelius littlepage are completely related in the present book for instance while those of his son mr mordaunt littlepage will be just as fully given in the chainbearer its successor it is hoped that the connection which certainly does exist between these three works will have more tendency to increase the value of each than to produce the ordinary effect of what are properly called sequels which are known to lessen the interest a narrative might otherwise have with the reader each of these three books has its own hero its own heroine and its ownpictureof manners complete though the latter may be and is more or less thrown into relief by its pendants  we conceive no apology is necessary for treating the subject of antirentism with the utmost frankness agreeably to our views of the matter the existence of true liberty among us the perpetuity of the institutions and the safety of public morals are all dependent on putting down wholly absolutely and unqualifiedly the false and dishonest theories and statements that have been boldly advanced in connection with this subject in our view new york is at this moment much the most disgraced state in the union notwithstanding she has never failed to pay the interest on her public debt and her disgrace arises from the fact that her laws are trampled underfoot without any efforts at all commensurate with the object being made to enforce them if words and professions can save the character of a community all may yet be well but if states like individuals are to be judged by their actions and the tree is to be known by its fruit god help us  for ourselves we conceive that true patriotism consists in laying bare everything like public vice and in calling such things by their right names the great enemy of the race has made a deep inroad upon us within the last ten or a dozen years under cover of a spurious delicacy on the subject of exposing national ills and it is time that they who have not been afraid to praise when praise was merited should not shrink from the office of censuring when the want of timely warnings may be one cause of the most fatal evils the great practical defect of institutions like ours is the circumstance that what is everybodys business is nobodys business a neglect that gives to the activity of the rogue a very dangerous ascendency over the more dilatory correctives of the honest man     chapter i    look you   who comes here a young man and an old in solemn talk    as you like it   it is easy to foresee that this country is destined to undergo great and rapid changes those that more properly belong to history history will doubtless attempt to record and probably with the questionable veracity and prejudice that are apt to influence the labours of that particular muse but there is little hope that any traces of american society in its more familiar aspects will be preserved among us through any of the agencies usually employed for such purposes without a stage in a national point of view at least with scarcely such a thing as a book of memoirs that relates to a life passed within our own limits and totally without light literature to give us simulated pictures of our manners and the opinions of the day i see scarcely a mode by which the next generation can preserve any memorials of the distinctive usages and thoughts of this it is true they will have traditions of certain leading features of the colonial society but scarcely any records and should the next twenty years do as much as the last towards substituting an entirely new race for the descendants of our own immediate fathers it is scarcely too much to predict that even these traditions will be lost in the whirl and excitement of a throng of strangers under all the circumstances therefore i have come to a determination to make an effort however feeble it may prove to preserve some vestiges of household life in new york at least while i have endeavoured to stimulate certain friends in new jersey and farther south to undertake similar tasks in those sections of the country what success will attend these last applications is more than i can say but in order that the little i may do myself shall not be lost for want of support i have made a solemn request in my will that those who come after me will consent to continue this narrative committing to paper their own experience as i have here committed mine down as low at least as my grandson if i ever have one perhaps by the end of the latters career they will begin to publish books in america and the fruits of our joint family labours may be thought sufficiently matured to be laid before the world  it is possible that which i am now about to write will be thought too homely to relate to matters much too personal and private to have sufficient interest for the public eye but it must be remembered that the loftiest interests of man are made up of a collection of those that are lowly and that he who makes a faithful picture of only a single important scene in the events of single life is doing something towards painting the greatest historical piece of his day as i have said before the leading events of my time will find their way into the pages of far more pretending works than this of mine in some form or other with more or less of fidelity to the truth and real events and real motives while the humbler matters it will be my office to record will be entirely overlooked by writers who aspire to enrol their names among the tacituses of former ages it may be well to say here however i shall not attempt the historical mood at all but content myself with giving the feelings incidents and interests of what is purely private life connecting them no farther with things that are of a more general nature than is indispensable to render the narrative intelligible and accurate with these explanations which are made in order to prevent the person who may happen first to commence the perusal of this manuscript from throwing it into the fire as a silly attempt to write a more silly fiction i shall proceed at once to the commencement of my proper task  i was born on the 3d may 1737 on a neck of land called satanstoe in the county of west chester and in the colony of new york a part of the widely extended empire that then owned the sway of his sacred majesty george ii king of great britain ireland and france defender of the faith and i may add the shield and panoply of the protestant succession god bless him before i say anything of my parentage i will first give the reader some idea of the locus in quo and a more precise notion of the spot on which i happened first to see the light  a neck in west chester and long island parlance means something that might be better termed a head and shoulders if mere shape and dimensions are kept in view peninsula would be the true word were we describing things on a geographical scale but as they are i find it necessary to adhere to the local term which is not altogether peculiar to our county by the way the neck or peninsula of satanstoe contains just four hundred and sixtythree acres and a half of excellent west chester land and that when the stone is hauled and laid into wall is saying as much in its favour as need be said of any soil on earth it has two miles of beach and collects a proportionate quantity of seaweed for manure besides enjoying near a hundred acres of saltmeadow and sedges that are not included in the solid ground of the neck proper as my father major evans littlepage was to inherit this estate from his father capt hugh littlepage it might even at the time of my birth be considered old family property it having indeed been acquired by my grandfather through his wife about thirty years after the final cession of the colony to the english by its original dutch owners here we had lived then near half a century when i was born in the direct line and considerably longer if we included maternal ancestors here i now live at the moment of writing these lines and here i trust my only son is to live after me  before i enter into a more minute description of satanstoe it may be well perhaps to say a word concerning its somewhat peculiar name the neck lies in the vicinity of a wellknown pass that is to be found in the narrow arm of the sea that separates the island of manhattan from its neighbour long island and which is called hell gate now there is a tradition that i confess is somewhat confined to the blacks of the neighbourhood but which says that the father of lies on a particular occasion when he was violently expelled from certain roystering taverns in the new netherlands made his exit by this wellknown dangerous pass and drawing his foot somewhat hastily from among the lobsterpots that abound in those waters leaving behind him as a print of his passage by that route the hogs back the pot and all the whirlpools and rocks that render navigation so difficult in that celebrated strait he placed it hurriedly upon the spot where there now spreads a large bay to the southward and eastward of the neck just touching the latter with the ball of his great toe as he passed downeast from which part of the country some of our people used to maintain he originally came some fancied resemblance to an inverted toe the devil being supposed to turn everything with which he meddles upsidedown has been imagined to exist in the shape and swells of our paternal acres a fact that has probably had its influence in perpetuating the name  satanstoe has the place been called therefore from time immemorial as time is immemorial in a country in which civilized time commenced not a century and a half ago and satanstoe it is called today i confess i am not fond of unnecessary changes and i sincerely hope this neck of land will continue to go by its old appellation as long as the house of hanover shall sit on the throne of these realms or as long as water shall run and grass shall grow there has been an attempt made to persuade the neighbourhood quite lately that the name is irreligious and unworthy of an enlightened people like this of west chester but it has met with no great success it has come from a connecticut man whose father they say is a clergyman of the standing order so called i believe because they stand up at prayers and who came among us himself in the character of a schoolmaster this young man i understand has endeavoured to persuade the neighbourhood that satanstoe is a corruption introduced by the dutch from devils town which in its turn was a corruption from dibbleston the family from which my grandfathers fatherinlaw purchased having been as he says of the name of dibblee he has got halfadozen of the more sentimental part of our society to call the neck dibbleton but the attempt is not likely to succeed in the long run as we are not a people much given to altering the language any more than the customs of our ancestors besides my dutch ancestors did not purchase from any dibblee no such family ever owning the place that being a bold assumption of the yankee to make out his case the more readily  satanstoe as it is little more than a good farm in extent so it is little more than a particularly good farm in cultivation and embellishment all the buildings are of stone even to the hogsties and sheds with wellpointed joints and field walls that would do credit to a fortified place the house is generally esteemed one of the best in the colony with the exception of a few of the new school it is of only a story and a half in elevation i admit but the rooms under the roof are as good as any of that description with which i am acquainted and their finish is such as would do no discredit to the upper rooms of even a york dwelling the building is in the shape of an l or two sides of a parallelogram one of which shows a front of seventyfive and the other of fifty feet twentysix feet make the depth from outside to outside of the walls the best room had a carpet that covered twothirds of the entire dimensions of the floor even in my boyhood and there were oilcloths in most of the better passages the buffet in the diningroom or smallest parlour was particularly admired and i question if there be at this hour a handsomer in the county the rooms were wellsized and of fair dimensions the larger parlours embracing the whole depth of the house with proportionate widths while the ceilings were higher than common being eleven feet if we except the places occupied by the larger beams of the chamber floors  as there was money in the family besides the neck and the littlepages had held the kings commissions my father having once been an ensign and my grandfather a captain in the regular army each in the earlier portion of his life we always ranked among the gentry of the county we happened to be in a part of westchester in which were none of the very large estates and satanstoe passed for property of a certain degree of importance it is true the morrises were at morrisania and the felipses or philipses as these bohemian counts were then called had a manor on the hudson that extended within a dozen miles of us and a younger branch of the de lanceys had established itself even much nearer while the van cortlandts or a branch of them too dwelt near kingsbridge but these were all people who were at the head of the colony and with whom none of the minor gentry attempted to vie as it was therefore the littlepages held a very respectable position between the higher class of the yeomanry and those who by their estates education connections official rank and hereditary consideration formed what might be justly called the aristocracy of the colony both my father and grandfather had sat in the assembly in their time and as i have heard elderly people say with credit too as for my father on one occasion he made a speech that occupied eleven minutes in the deliverya proof that he had something to say and which was a source of great but i trust humble felicitation in the family down to the day of his death and even afterwards  then the military services of the family stood us in for a great deal in that day it was something to be an ensign even in the militia and a far greater thing to have the same rank in a regular regiment it is true neither of my predecessors served very long with the kings troops my father in particular selling out at the end of his second campaign but the military experience and i may add the military glory each acquired in youth did them good service for all the rest of their days both were commissioned in the militia and my father actually rose as high as major in that branch of the service that being the rank he held and the title he bore for the last fifteen years of his life  my mother was of dutch extraction on both sides her father having been a blauvelt and her mother a van busser i have heard it said that there was even a relationship between the stuyvesants and the van cortlandts and the van bussers but i am not able to point out the actual degree and precise nature of the affinity i presume it was not very near or my information would have been more minute i have always understood that my mother brought my father thirteen hundred pounds for dowry currency not sterling which it must be confessed was a very genteel fortune for a young woman in 1733 now i very well know that six eight and ten thousand pounds sometimes fall in in this manner and even much more in the high families but no one need be ashamed who looks back fifty years and finds that his mother brought a thousand pounds to her husband  i was neither an only child nor the eldestborn there was a son who preceded me and two daughters succeeded but they all died in infancy leaving me in effect the only offspring for my parents to cherish and educate my little brother monopolised the name of evans and living for some time after i was christened i got the dutch appellation of my maternal grandfather for my share of the family nomenclature which happened to be corneliuscorny was consequently the diminutive by which i was known to all the whites of my acquaintance for the first sixteen or eighteen years of my life and to my parents as long as they lived corny littlepage is not a bad name in itself and i trust they who do me the favour to read this manuscript will lay it down with the feeling that the name is none the worse for the use i have made of it  i have said that both my father and grandfather each in his day sat in the assembly my father twice and my grandfather only once although we lived so near the borough of west chester it was not for that place they sat but for the county the de lanceys and the morrises contending for the control of the borough in a way that left little chance for the smaller fishes to swim in the troubled water they were so certain to create nevertheless this political elevation brought my father out as it might be before the world and was the means of giving him a personal consideration he might not have otherwise enjoyed the benefits and possibly some of the evils of thus being drawn out from the more regular routine of our usually peaceable lives may be made to appear in the course of this narrative  i have ever considered myself fortunate in not having been born in the earlier and infant days of the colony when the interests at stake and the events by which they were influenced were not of a magnitude to give the mind and the hopes the excitement and enlargement that attend the periods of a more advanced civilization and of more important incidents in this respect my own appearance in this world was most happily timed as any one will see who will consider the state and importance of the colony in the middle of the present century new york could not have contained many less than seventy thousand souls including both colours at the time of my birth for it is supposed to contain quite a hundred thousand this day on which i am now writing in such a community a man has not only the room but the materials on which to figure whereas as i have often heard him say my father when he was born was one of less than half of the smallest number i have just named i have been grateful for this advantage and i trust it will appear by evidence that will be here afforded that i have not lived in a quarter of the world or in an age when and where and to which great events have been altogether strangers  my earliest recollections as a matter of course are of satanstoe and the domestic fireside in my childhood and youth i heard a great deal said of the protestant succession the house of hanover and king george ii all mixed up with such names as those of george clinton gen monckton sir charles hardy james de lancey and sir danvers osborne his official representatives in the colony every age has its old and its last wars and i can well remember that which occurred between the french in the canadas and ourselves in 1744 i was then seven years old and it was an event to make an impression on a child of that tender age my honoured grandfather was then living as he was long afterwards and he took a strong interest in the military movements of the period as was natural for an old soldier new york had no connection with the celebrated expedition that captured louisbourg then the gibraltar of america in 1745 but this could not prevent an old soldier like capt littlepage from entering into the affair with all his heart though forbidden to use his hand as the reader may not be aware of all the secret springs that set public events in motion it may be well here to throw in a few words in the way of explanation  there was and is little sympathy in the way of national feeling between the colonies of new england and those which lie farther south we are all loyal those of the east as well as those of the southwest and south but there is and ever has been so wide a difference in our customs origins religious opinions and histories as to cause a broad moral line in the way of feeling to be drawn between the colony of new york and those that lie east of the byram river i have heard it said that most of the emigrants to the new england states came from the west of england where many of their social peculiarities and much of their language are still to be traced while the colonies farther south have received their population from the more central counties and those sections of the island that are supposed to be less provincial and peculiar i do not affirm that such is literally the fact though it is well known that we of new york have long been accustomed to regard our neighbours of new england as very different from ourselves whilst i dare say our neighbours of new england have regarded us as different from themselves and insomuch removed from perfection  let all this be as it may it is certain new england is a portion of the empire that is set apart from the rest for good or for evil it got its name from the circumstance that the english possessions were met on its western boundary by those of the dutch who were thus separated from the other colonies of purely anglosaxon origin by a wide district that was much larger in surface than the mother country itself i am afraid there is something in the character of these anglosaxons that predisposes them to laugh and turn up their noses at other races for i have remarked that their natives of the parent land itself who come among us show this disposition even as it respects us of new york and those of new england while the people of the latter region manifest a feeling towards us their neighbours that partakes of anything but the humility that is thought to grace that christian character to which they are particularly fond of laying claim  my grandfather was a native of the old country however and he entered but little into the colonial jealousies he had lived from boyhood and had married in new york and was not apt to betray any of the overweening notions of superiority that we sometimes encountered in nativeborn englishmen though i can remember instances in which he would point out the defects in our civilization and others in which he dwelt with pleasure on the grandeur and power his own island i dare say this was all right for few among us have ever been disposed to dispute the just supremacy of england in all things that are desirable and which form the basis of human excellence  i well remember a journey capt hugh littlepage made to boston in 1745 in order to look at the preparations that were making for the great expedition although his own colony had no connection with this enterprise in a military point of view his previous service rendered him an object of interest to the military men then assembled along the coast of new england it has been said the expedition against louisbourg then the strongest place in america was planned by a lawyer led by a merchant and executed by husbandmen and mechanics but this though true as a whole was a rule that had its exceptions there were many old soldiers who had seen the service of this continent in the previous wars and among them were several of my grandfathers former acquaintances with these he passed many a cheerful hour previously to the day of sailing and i have often thought since that my presence alone prevented him from making one in the fleet the reader will think i was young perhaps to be so far from home on such an occasion but it happened in this wise my excellent mother thought i had come out of the smallpox with some symptoms that might be benefited by a journey and she prevailed on her fatherinlaw to let me be of the party when he left home to visit boston in the winter of 17445 at that early day moving about was not always convenient in these colonies and my grandfather travelling in a sleigh that was proceeding east with some private stores that had been collected for the expedition it presented a favourable opportunity to send me along with my venerable progenitor who very goodnaturedly consented to let me commence my travels under his own immediate auspices  the things i saw on this occasion have had a material influence on my future life i got a love of adventure and particularly of military parade and grandeur that has since led me into more than one difficulty capt hugh littlepage my grandfather was delighted with all he saw until after the expedition had sailed when he began to grumble on the subject of the religious observances that the piety of the puritans blended with most of their other movements on the score of religion there was a marked difference i may say there is still a marked difference between new england and new york the people of new england certainly did and possibly may still look upon us of new york as little better than heathens while we of new york assuredly did and for anything i know to the contrary may yet regard them as canters and by necessary connection hypocrites i shall not take it on myself to say which party is right though it has often occurred to my mind that it would be better had new england a little less selfrighteousness and new york a little more righteousness without the self still in the way of pounds shillings and pence we will not turn our backs upon them any day being on the whole rather the most trustworthy of the two as respects money more especially in all such cases in which our neighbours goods can be appropriated without having recourse to absolutely direct means such at any rate is the new york opinion let them think as they please about it on the other side of byram  my grandfather met an old fellowcampaigner at boston of the name of hight major hight as he was called who had come to see the preparations too and the old soldiers passed most of the time together the major was a jerseyman and had been somewhat of a freeliver in his time retaining some of the propensities of his youth in old age as is apt to be the case with those who cultivate a vice as if it were a hothouse plant the major was fond of his bottle drinking heavily of madeira of which there was then a good stock in boston for he brought some on himself and i can remember various scenes that occurred between him and my grandfather after dinner as they sat discoursing in the tavern on the progress of things and the prospects for the future had these two old soldiers been of the troops of the province in which they were it would have been major and captain at every breath for no part of the earth is fonder of titles than our eastern brethren 1 whereas i must think we had some claims to more true simplicity of character and habits notwithstanding new york has ever been thought the most aristocratical of all the northern colonies having been intimate from early youth my two old soldiers familiarly called each other joey and hodge the latter being the abbreviation of one of my grandfathers names roger when plain hugh was not used as sometimes happened between them hugh roger littlepage i ought to have said was my grandfathers name  i should like these yankees better if they prayed less my old friend said the major one day after they had been discussing the appearances of things and speaking between the puffs of his pipe i can see no great use in losing so much time by making these halts to pray when the campaign is fairly opened  it was always their way joey my grandfather answered taking his time as is customary with smokers i remember when we were out together in the year 17 that the new england troops always had their parsons who acted as a sort of second colonels they tell me his excellency has ordered a weekly fast for public prayers during the whole of this campaign  ay master hodge praying and plundering so they go on returned the major knocking the ashes out of his pipe preparatory to filling it anew an employment that gave him an opportunity to give vent to his feelings without pausing to puffay master hodge praying and plundering so they go on now do you remember old watson who was in the massachusetts levies in the year 12old tom watson he that was a sub under barnwell in our tuscarora expedition  my grandfather nodded his head in assent that being the only reply the avocation of smoking rendered convenient just at that moment unless a sort of affirmatory grunt could be construed into an auxiliary  well he has a son going in this affair and old tom or colonel watson as he is now very particular to be called is down here with his wife and two daughters to see the ensign off i went to pay the old fellow a visit hodge and found him and the mother and sisters all as busy as bees in getting young toms baggage ready for a march there lay his whole equipment before my eyes and i had a favourable occasion to examine it at my leisure  which you did with all your might or youre not the joe hight of the year 10 said my grandfather taking his turn with the ashes and the tobaccobox  old hight was now puffing away like a blacksmith who is striving to obtain a white heat and it was some time before he could get out the proper reply to this halfassertion halfinterrogatory sort of remark  you may be sure of that he at length ejaculated when certain of his light he proceeded to tell the whole story stopping occasionally to puff lest he should lose the vantage ground he had just obtained what dye think of halfadozen strings of red onions for one item in a subalterns stores  my grandfather grunted again in a way that might very well pass for a laugh  youre certain they were red joey he finally asked  as red as his regimentals then there was a jug filled with molasses that is as big as yonder demijohn glancing at the vessel which contained his own private stores but i should have thought nothing of these a large empty sack attracting much of my attention i could not imagine what young tom could want of such a sack but on broaching the subject to the major he very frankly gave me to understand that louisbourg was thought to be a rich town and there was no telling what luck or providenceyes by georgehe called it providencemight throw in his son tommys way now that the sack was empty and had an easy time of it the girls would put his bible and hymnbook in it as a place where the young man would be likely to look for them i dare say hodge you never had either bible or hymnbook in any of your numerous campaigns  no nor a plundersack nor a molassesjug nor strings of red onions growled my grandfather in reply  how well i remember that evening a vast deal of colonial prejudice and neighbourly antipathy made themselves apparent in the conversation of the two veterans who seemed to entertain a strange sort of contemptuous respect for their fellowsubjects of new england who in their turn i make not the smallest doubt paid them off in kindwith all the superciliousness and reproach and with many grains less of the respect  that night major hight and capt hugh roger littlepage both got a little howcomeyouso drinking bumpers to the success of what they called the yankee expedition even at the moment they were indulging in constant side hits at the failings and habits of the people these marks of neighbourly infirmity are not peculiar to the people of the adjacent provinces of new york and of new england i have often remarked that the english think and talk very much of the french as the yankees speak of us while the french so far as i have been able to understand their somewhat unintelligible languagewhich seems never to have a beginning nor an endtreat the english as the puritans of the old world as i have already intimated we were not very remarkable for religion in new york in my younger days while it would be just the word were i to say that religion was conspicuous among our eastern neighbours i remember to have heard my grandfather say he was once acquainted with a col heathcote an englishman like himself by birth and a brother of a certain sir gilbert heathcote who was formerly a leading man in the bank of england this col heathcote came among us young and married here leaving his posterity behind him and was lord of the manor of scarsdale and mamaroneck in our county of west chester well this col heathcote told my grandfather speaking on the subject of religion that he had been much shocked on arriving in this country at discovering the neglected condition of religion in the colony more especially on long island where the people lived in a sort of heathenish condition being a man of mark and connected with the government the society for the propagation of the gospel in foreign parts applied to him to aid it in spreading the truths of the bible in the colony the colonel was glad enough to comply and i remember my grandfather said his friend told him of the answer he returned to these good persons in england i was so struck with the heathenish condition of the people on my arriving here he wrote to them that commanding the militia of the colony i ordered the captains of the different companies to call their men together each sunday at sunrise and to drill them until sunset unless they would consent to repair to some convenient place and listen to morning and evening prayer and to two wholesome sermons read by some suitable person in which case the men were to be excused from drill 2 i do not think this would be found necessary in new england at least where many of the people would be likely to prefer drilling to preaching  but all this gossip about the moral condition of the adjacent colonies of new york and new england is leading me from the narrative and does not promise much for the connection and interest of the remainder of the manuscript  footnote 1 it will be remembered mr littlepage wrote more than seventy years ago when this distinction might exclusively belong to the east but the west has now some claim to it also  footnote 2 on the subject of this story the editor can say he has seen a published letter from col heathcote who died more than a century since at mamaroneck west chester co in which that gentleman gives the society for the propagation of the gospel an account of his proceedings that agrees almost verbatim with the account of the matter that is here given by mr cornelius littlepage the house in which col heathcote dwelt was destroyed by fire a short time before the revolution but the property on which it stood and the present building belong at this moment to his greatgrandson the rt rev wm heathcote de lancey the bishop of western new york on the subject of the plunder the editor will remark that a near connection whose grandfather was a major at the taking of louisbourg and who was subsequently one of the first brigadiers appointed in 1775 has lately shown him a letter written to that officer during the expedition by his father in which blended with a great deal of pious counsel and some really excellent religious exhortation is an earnest inquiry after the plundereditor     chapter ii    i would there were no age between ten and threeandtwenty   or that youth would sleep out the rest    winters tale   it is not necessary for me to say much of the first fourteen years of my life they passed like the childhood and youth of the sons of most gentlemen in our colony at that day with this distinction however there was a class among us which educated its boys at home this was not a very numerous class certainly nor was it always the highest in point of fortune and rank many of the large proprietors were of dutch origin as a matter of course and these seldom if ever sent their children to england to be taught anything in my boyhood i understand that a few are getting over their ancient prejudices in this particular and begin to fancy oxford or cambridge may be quite as learned schools as that of leyden but no van in my boyhood could have been made to believe this many of the dutch proprietors gave their children very little education in any way or form though most of them imparted lessons of probity that were quite as useful as learning had the two things been really inseparable for my part while i admit there is a great deal of knowledge going up and down the land that is just of the degree to trick a fellowcreature out of his rights i shall never subscribe to the opinion which is so prevalent among the dutch portion of our population and which holds the doctrine that the schools of the new england provinces are the reason the descendants of the puritans do not enjoy the best of reputations in this respect i believe a boy may be well taught and made all the honester for it though i admit there may be and is such a thing as training a lad in false notions as well as training him in those that are true but we had a class principally of english extraction that educated its sons well usually sending them home to the great english schools and finishing at the universities these persons however lived principally in town or having estates on the hudson passed their winters there to this class the littlepages did not belong neither their habits nor their fortunes tempting them to so high a flight for myself i was taught enough latin and greek to enter college by the rev thomas worden an english divine who was rector of st judes the parish to which our family properly belonged this gentleman was esteemed a good scholar and was very popular among the gentry of the county attending all the dinners clubs races balls and other diversions that were given by them within ten miles of his residence his sermons were pithy and short and he always spoke of your halfhour preachers as illiterate prosers who did not understand how to condense their thoughts twenty minutes were his gauge though i remember to have heard my father say he had known him preach all of twentytwo when he compressed down to fourteen my grandfather invariably protested he was delightful  i remained with mr worden until i could translate the two first aeneids and the whole of the gospel of st matthew pretty readily and then my father and grandfather the last in particular for the old gentleman had a great idea of learning began to turn over in their minds the subject of the college to which i ought to be sent we had the choice of two in both of which the learned languages and the sciences are taught to a degree and in a perfection that is surprising for a new country these colleges are yale at new haven in connecticut and nassau hall which was then at newark new jersey after having been a short time at elizabethtown but which has since been established at princeton mr worden laughed at both said that neither had as much learning as a secondrate english grammarschool and that a lowerform boy at eton or westminster could take a masters degree at either and pass for a prodigy in the bargain my father who was born in the colonies and had a good deal of the right colony feeling was nettled at this i remember while my grandfather being oldcountry born but colony educated was at a loss how to view the matter the captain had a great respect for his native land and evidently considered it the paradise of this earth though his recollections of it were not very distinct but at the same time he loved old york and west chester in particular where he had married and established himself at satans toe or as he spelt it and as we all have spelt it now this many a day satanstoe i was present at the conversation which decided the question as regarded my future education and which took place in the common parlour around a blazing fire about a week before christmas the year i was fourteen there were present capt hugh roger major evans my mother the rev mr worden and an old gentleman of dutch designation and extraction of the name of abraham van valkenburgh but who was familiarly called by his friends brom follock or col follock or volleck as the last happen to be more or less ceremonious or more or less dutch follock i think however was the favourite pronunciation this col van valkenburgh was an old brothersoldier of my fathers and indeed a relation a sort of a cousin through my greatgrandmother besides being a man of much consideration and substance he lived in rockland just across the hudson but never failed to pay a visit to satanstoe at that season of the year on the present occasion he was accompanied by his son dirck who was my friend and just a year my junior  vell denthe colonel commenced the discourse by saying as he tapped the ashes out of his pipe for the second time that evening having first taken a draught of hot flip a beverage much in vogue then as well as nowvell den evans vat is your intention as to ter poy vill he pe collegelarnt like as his grantfater or only schoollarnt like as his own fater the allusion to the grandfather being a pleasantry of the colonels who insisted that all the oldcountry born were collegelarnt by instinct  to own the truth brom my father answered this is a point that is not yet entirely settled for there are different opinions as to the place to which he shall be sent even admitting that he is to be sent at all  the colonel fastened his full projecting blue eyes on my father in a way that pretty plainly expressed surprise  vat den is dere so many colleges dat it is hart to choose he said  there are but two that can be of any use to us for cambridge is much too distant to think of sending the boy so far cambridge was in our thoughts at one time but that is given up  vhere den ist camprige demanded the dutchman removing his pipe to ask so important a question a ceremony he usually thought unnecessary  it is a new england collegenear boston not half a days journey distant i fancy  dont sent cornelius dere ejaculated the colonel contriving to get these words out alongside of the stem of the pipe  you think not col follock put in the anxious mother may i ask the reason for that opinion  too much suntay matam littlepagethe poy wilt be spilt by ter ministers he will go away an honest lat and come pack a rogue he will larn how to bray and to cheat  hoity toity my noble colonel exclaimed the rev mr worden affecting more resentment than he felt then you fancy the clergy and too much sunday will be apt to convert an honest youth into a knave  the colonel made no answer continuing to smoke very philosophically though he took occasion while he drew the pipe out of his mouth in one of its periodical removals to make a significant gesture with it towards the rising sun which all present understood to mean down east as it is usual to say when we mean to designate the colonies of new england that he was understood by the rev mr worden is highly probable since that gentleman continued to turn the flip of one vessel into another by way of more intimately blending the ingredients of the mixture quite as coolly as if there had been no reflection on his trade  what do you think of yale friend brom asked my father who understood the dumbshow as well as any of them  no tifference evans dey all breaches and brays too much goot men have no neet of so much religion vhen a man is really goot religion only does him harm i mean yankee religion  i have another objection to yale observed capt hugh roger which is their english  och exclaimed the coloneldeir english is horriple wuss dan ast to us tutch  well i was not aware of that observed my father they are english sir as well as ourselves and why should they not speak the language as well as we  why toes not a yorkshireman or a cornishman speak as veil as a lonnoner i tell you what evans ill pet the pest gamecock on ter neck against the veriest tunghill the parson hast ter presitent of yale calls p e e n pen ant roof ruffand so on  my birds are all game put in the divine i keep no other breed  surely mr worden you do not countenance cockfights by your presence my mother said using as much of reproach in her manner as comported with the holy office of the party she addressed and with her own gentle nature the colonel winked at my father and laughed through his pipe an exploit he might have been said to perform almost hourly my father smiled in return for to own the truth he had been present at such sports on one or two occasions when the parsons curiosity had tempted him to peep in also but my grandfather looked grave and much in earnest as for mr worden himself he met the imputation like a man to do him justice if he were not an ascetic neither was he a whining hypocrite as is the case with too many of those who aspire to be disciples and ministers of our blessed lord  why not madam littlepage mr worden stoutly demanded there are worse places than cockpits for mark me i never betno not on a horserace even and that is an occasion on which any gentleman might venture a few guineas in a liberal frank way there are so few amusements for people of education in this country madam littlepage that one is not to be too particular if there were hounds and hunting now as there are at home you should never hear of me at a cockfight i can assure you  i must say i do not approve of cockfights rejoined my mother meekly and i hope corny will never be seen at one nonevernever  dere youre wrong matam littlepage the colonel remarked for ter sight of ter spirit of ter cocks wilt give ter boy spirit himself my tirck dere goes to all in ter neighbourhood and he is a gamecock himself let me tell you come tirckcomecockadoodledoo  this was true all round as i very well knew young as i was dirck who was as slowmoving as dullseeming and as antimercurial a boy to look at as one could find in a thousand was thorough game at the bottom and he had been at many a main as he had told me himself how much of his spirit was derived from witnessing such scenes i will not take on me to affirm for in these later times i have heard it questioned whether such exhibitions do really improve the spectators courage or not but dirck had pluck and plenty of it and in that particular at least his father was not mistaken the colonels opinion always carried weight with my mother both on account of his dutch extraction and on account of his wellestablished probity for to own the truth a text or a sentiment from him had far more weight with her than the same from the clergyman she was silenced on the subject of cockfighting for the moment therefore which gave capt hugh roger further opportunity to pursue that of the english language the grandfather who was an inveterate lover of the sport would have cut in to that branch of the discourse but he had a great tenderness for my mother whom everybody loved by the way and he commanded himself glad to find that so important an interest had fallen into hands as good as those of the colonel he would just as soon be absent from church as be absent from a cockfight and he was a very good observer of religion  i should have sent evans to yale had it not been for the miserable manner of speaking english they have in new england resumed my grandfather and i had no wish to have a son who might pass for a cornish man we shall have to send this boy to newark in new jersey the distance is not so great and we shall be certain he will not get any of your roundhead notions of religion too col brom you dutch are not altogether free from these distressing follies  debble a pit growled the colonel through his pipe for no devotee of liberalism and latitudinarianisrn in religion could be more averse to extrapiety than he the colonel however was not of the dutch reformed he was an episcopalian like ourselves his mother having brought this branch of the follocks into the church and consequently he entered into all our feelings on the subject of religion heart and hand perhaps mr worden was a greater favourite with no member of the four parishes over which he presided than with col abraham van valkenburgh  i should think less of sending corny to newark added my mother was it not for crossing the water  crossing the water repeated mr worden the newark we mean madam littlepage is not at home the jersey of which we speak is the adjoining colony of that came  i am aware of that mr worden but it is not possible to get to newark without making that terrible voyage be tween new york and powles hook no sir it is impossible and every time the child comes home that risk will have to be run it would cause me many a sleepless night  he can go by tobbs ferry matam littlepage quietly observed the colonel  dobbs ferry can be very little better than that by powles hook rejoined the tender mother a ferry is a ferry and the hudson will be the hudson from albany to new york so water is water  as these were all selfevident propositions they produced a pause in the discourse for men do not deal with new ideas as freely as they deal with the old  dere is a way evans as you and i know py experience resumed the colonel winking again at my father to go rount the hudson altogeter to pe sure it is a long way and a pit in the woots but petter to untertake dat than to haf the poy lose his larnin ter journey might be made in two monts and he none the wuss for ter exercise ter major and i were never heartier dan when we were operating on the het waters of the hutson i will tell corny the roat  my mother saw that her apprehensions were laughed at and she had the good sense to be silent the discussion did not the less proceed until it was decided after an hour more of weighing the pros and the cons that i was to be sent to nassau hall newark new jersey and was to move from that place with the college whenever that event might happen  you will send dirck there too my father added as soon as the affair in my case was finally determined it would be a pity to separate the boys after they have been so long together and have got to be so much used to each other their characters are so identical too that they are more like brothers than very distant relatives  dey will like one anoter all de petter for pein a little tifferent den answered the colonel drily  dirck and i were no more alike than a horse resembles a mule  ay but dirck is a lad who will do honour to an educationhe is solid and thoughtful and learning will not be thrown away on such a youth was he in england that sedate lad might get to be a bishop  i want no pishops in my family major evans nor do i want any great larnin none of us ever saw a college and we have got on fery vell i am a colonel and a memper my fater was a colonel and a memper and my grandfeter woult have peen a colonel and a memper but dere vast no colonels and no mempers in his time though tirck yonter can be a colonel and a memper witout crosting dat terriple ferry that frightens matam littlepage so much  there was usually a little humour in all col follock said and did though it must be owned it was humour after a very dutch model dutchbuilt fun as mr worden used to call it nevertheless it was humour and there was enough of holland in all the junior generations of the littlepages to enjoy it my father understood him and my mother did not hear the last of the terriple ferry until not only i but the college itself had quitted newark for the institution made another remove to princeton the place where it is now to be found some time before i got my degree  you have got on very well without a college education as all must admit colonel answered mr worden but there is no telling how much better you would have got on had you been an a m you might in the last case have been a general and a member of the kings council  dere ist no yeneral in ter colony the commanderinchief and his majestys representatif excepted returned the colonel we are no yankees to make yenerals of ploughmen  hereupon the colonel and my father knocked the ashes out of their pipes at the same instant and both laugheda merriment in which the parson my grandfather my dear mother and i myself joined even a negro boy who was about my own age and whose name was jacob or jaap but who was commonly called yaap grinned at the remark for he had a sovereign contempt for yankee land and all it contained almost as sovereign a contempt as that which yankee land entertained for york itself and its dutch population dirck was the only person present who looked grave but dirck was habitually as grave and sedate as if he had been born to become a burgomaster  quite right brom cried my father colonels are good enough for us and when we do make a man that even we are a little particular about his being respectable and fit for the office nevertheless learning will not hurt corny and to college he shall go let you do as you please with dirck so that matter is settled and no more need be said about it  and it was settled and to college i did go and that by the awful powles hook ferry in the bargain near as we lived to town i paid my first visit to the island of manhattan the day my father and myself started for newark i had an aunt who lived in queen street not a very great distance from the fort and she had kindly invited me and my father to pass a day with her on our way to new jersey which invitation had been accepted in my youth the world in general was not as much addicted to gadding about as it is now getting to be and neither my grandfather nor my father ordinarily went to town their calls to the legislature excepted more than twice a year my mothers visits were still less frequent although mrs legge my aunt was her own sister mr legge was a lawyer of a good deal of reputation but he was inclined to be in the opposition or espoused the popular side in politics and there could be no great cordiality between one of that frame of mind and our family i remember we had not been in the house an hour before a warm discussion took place between my uncle and my father on the question of the right of the subject to canvass the acts of the government we had left home immediately after an early breakfast in order to reach town before dark but a long detention at the harlem ferry compelled us to dine in that village and it was quite night before we stopped in queen street my aunt ordered supper early in order that we might get early to bed to recover from our fatigue and be ready for sightseeing next day we sat down to supper therefore in less than an hour after our arrival and it was while we were at table that the discussion i have mentioned took place it would seem that a party had been got up in town among the disloyal and i might almost say the disaffected which claimed for the subject the right to know in what manner every shilling of the money raised by taxation was expended this very obviously improper interference with matters that did not belong to them on the part of the ruled was resisted by the rulers and that with energy inasmuch as such inquiries and investigations would naturally lead to results that might bring authority into discredit make the governed presuming and prying in their dispositions and cause much derangement and inconvenience to the regular and salutary action of government my father took the negative of the proposition while my uncle maintained its affirmative i well remember that my poor aunt looked uneasy and tried to divert the discourse by exciting our curiosity on a new subject  corny has been particularly lucky in having come to town just as he has since we shall have a sort of galaday tomorrow for the blacks and the children  i was not in the least offended at being thus associated with the negroes for they mingled in most of the amusements of us young people but i did not quite so well like to be ranked with the children now i was fourteen and on my way to college notwithstanding this i did not fail to betray an interest in what was to come next by my countenance as for my father he did not hesitate about asking an explanation  the news came in this morning by a fastsailing sloop that the patroon of albany is on his way to new york in his coachandfour and with two outriders and that he may be expected to reach town in the course of tomorrow several of my acquaintances have consented to let their children go out a little way into the country to see him come in and as for the blacks you know it is just as well to give them permission to be of the party as half of them would otherwise go without asking it  this will be a capital opportunity to let corny see a little of the world cried my father and i would not have him miss it on any account besides it is useful to teach young people early the profitable lesson of honouring their superiors and seniors  in that sense it may do growled my uncle who though so much of a latitudinarian in his political opinions never failed to inculcate all useful and necessary maxims for private life the patroon of albany being one of the most respectable and affluent of all our gentry i have no objections to cornys going to see that sight and i hope my dear you will let both pompey and caesar be of the party it wont hurt the fellows to see the manner in which the patroon has his carriage kept and horses groomed  pompey and caesar were of the party though the latter did not join us until pompey had taken me all round the town to see the principal sights it being understood that the patroon had slept at kingsbridge and would not be likely to reach town until near noon new york was certainly not the place in 1751 it is today nevertheless it was a large and important town even when i went to college containing not less than twelve thousand souls blacks included the town hall is a magnificent structure standing at the head of broad street and thither pompey led me even before my aunt had come down to breakfast i could scarcely admire that fine edifice sufficiently which for size architecture and position has scarcely now an equal in all the colonies it is true that the town has much improved within the last twenty years but york was a noble place even in the middle of this century after breakfast pompey and i proceeded up broadway commencing near the fort at the bowling green and walking some distance beyond the head of wall street or quite a quarter of a mile nor did the town stop here though its principal extent is or was then along the margin of the east river trinity church i could hardly admire enough either for it appeared to me that it was large enough to contain all the churchpeople in the colony 3 it was a venerable structure which had then felt the heats of summer and the snows of winter on its roofs and walls near half a century and it still stands a monument of pious zeal and cultivated taste there were other churches belonging to other denominations of course that were well worthy of being seen to say nothing of the markets i thought i never should tire of gazing at the magnificence of the shops particularly the silversmiths some of which must have had a thousand dollars worth of plate in their windows or otherwise in sight i might say as much of the other shops too which attracted a just portion of my admiration  about eleven the number of children and blacks that were seen walking towards the bowery road gave us notice that it was time to be moving in that direction we were in the upper part of broadway at the time and pompey proceeded forthwith to fall into the current making all the haste he could as it was thought the traveller might pass down towards the east river and get into queen street before we could reach the point at which he would diverge it is true the old town residence of stephen de lancey which stood at the head of broadway just above trinity 4 had been converted into a tavern and we did not know but the patroon might choose to alight there as it was then the principal inn of the town still most people preferred queen street and the new city tavern was so much out of the way that strangers in particular were not fond of frequenting it caesar came up much out of breath just as we got into the country  quitting broadway we went along the country road that then diverged to the east but which is now getting to contain a sort of suburb and passing the road that leads into queen street we felt more certain of meeting the traveller whose carriage we soon learned had not gone by as there were and are several taverns for country people in this quarter most of us went quite into the country proceeding as far as the villas of the bayards de lanceys and other persons of mark of which there are several along the bowery road our party stopped under some cherrytrees that were not more than a mile from town nearly opposite to lt gov de lanceys countryhouse 5 but many boys c went a long long way into the country finishing the day by nutting and gathering apples in the grounds of petersfield and rosehill the country residences of the stuyvesant and watt or as the last is now called the watts families i was desirous of going thus far myself for i had heard much of both of those grand places but pompey told me it would be necessary to be back for dinner by halfpast one his mistress having consented to postpone the hour a little in order to indulge my natural desire to see all i could while in town  we were not altogether children and blacks who were out on the bowery road that daymany tradesmen were among us the leathern aprons making a goodly parade on the occasion i saw one or two persons wearing swords hovering round in the lanes and in the woodsproof that even gentlemen had some desire to see so great a person as the patroon of albany pass i shall not stop to say much of the transit of the patroon he came by about noon as was expected and in his coachandfour with two outriders coachman c in liveries as is usual in the families of the gentry and with a team of heavy black dutchlooking horses that i remember caesar pronounced to be of the true flemish breed the patroon himself was a sightly welldressed gentleman wearing a scarlet coat flowing wig and cocked hat and i observed that the handle of his sword was of solid silver but my father wore a sword with a solid silver handle too a present from my grandfather when the former first entered the army 6 he bowed to the salutations he received in passing and i thought all the spectators were pleased with the noble sight of seeing such an equipage pass into the town such a sight does not occur every day in the colonies and i felt exceedingly happy that it had been my privilege to witness it  a little incident occurred to myself that rendered this day long memorable to me among the spectators assembled along the road on this occasion were several groups of girls who belonged to the better class and who had been induced to come out into the country either led by curiosity or by the management of the different sable nurses who had them in charge in one of these groups was a girl of about ten or possibly of eleven years of age whose dress air and mien early attracted my attention i thought her large bright full blue eye particularly winning and boys of fourteen are not altogether insensible to beauty in the other sex though they are possibly induced oftener to regard it in those who are older than in those who are younger than themselves pompey happened to be acquainted with silvy the negress who had the care of my little beauty to whom he bowed and addressed as miss anneke anna cornelia abbreviated anneke i thought a very pretty name too and some little advances were made towards an acquaintance by means of an offering of some fruit that i had gathered by the wayside things were making a considerable progress and i had asked several questions such as whether miss anneke had ever seen a patroon which was the greatest personage a patroon or a governor whether a nobleman who had lately been in the colony as a military officer or the patroon would be likely to have the finest coach when a butchers boy who was passing rudely knocked an apple out of annekes hand and caused her to shed a tear  i took fire at this unprovoked outrage and lent the fellow a dig in the ribs that gave him to understand the young lady had a protector my chap was about my own age and weight and he surveyed me a minute with a species of contempt and then beckoned me to follow him into an orchard that was hard by but a little out of sight in spite of annekes entreaties i went and pompey and caesar followed we had both stripped before the negroes got up for they were in a hot discussion whether i was to be permitted to fight or not pompey maintained it would keep dinner waiting but caesar who had the most bottom as became his name insisted as i had given a blow i was bound to render satisfaction luckily mr worden was very skilful at boxing and he had given both dirck and myself many lessons so that i soon found myself the best fellow i gave the butchers boy a bloody nose and a black eye when he gave in and i came off victor not however without a facer or two that sent me to college with a reputation i hardly merited or that of a regular pugilist  when i returned to the road after this breathing anneke 7 had disappeared and i was so shy and silly as not to ask her family name from caesar the great or pompey the little  footnote 3 the intelligent reader will of course properly appreciate the provincial admiration of mr littlepage who naturally fancied his own best was other peoples best the trinity of that day was burned in the great fire of 1776 the edifice that succeeded it at the peace of 1783 has already given place to a successor that has more claim to be placed on a level with modern english town churcharchitecture than any other building in the union when another shall succeed this which shall be as much larger and more elaborated than this is compared to its predecessor and still another shall succeed which shall bear the same relation to that then the country will possess an edifice that is on a level with the firstrate gothic cathedralarchitecture of europe it would be idle to pretend that the new trinity is without faults some of which are probably the result of circumstances and necessity but if the respectable architect who has built it had no other merit he would deserve the gratitude of every man of taste in the country by placing churchtowers of a proper comparative breadth dignity and proportions before the eyes of its population the diminutive

onnakay i believeeditor     chapter iii    believe me thou talkest of an admirable conceited fellow has   he any unbraided wares    prythee bring him in and let him approach singing    winters tale   i have no intention of taking the reader with me through college where i remained the usual term of four years these four years were not idled away as sometimes happens but were fairly improved i read all of the new testament in greek several of ciceros orations every line of horace satires and odes four books of the iliad tully de oratore throughout besides paying proper attention to geography mathematics and other of the usual branches moral philosophy in particular was closely attended to senior year as well as astronomy we had a telescope that showed us all four of jupiters moons in other respects nassau might be called the seat of learning one of our class purchased a secondhand copy of euripides in town and we had it in college all of six months though it was never my good fortune to see it as the young man who owned it was not much disposed to let profane eyes view his treasure nevertheless i am certain the copy of the work was in college and we took good care to let the yale men hear of it more than once i do not believe they ever saw even the outside of an euripides as for the telescope i can testify of my own knowledge having seen the moons of jupiter as often as ten times with my own eyes aided by its magnifiers we had a tutor who was expert among the stars and who it was generally believed would have been able to see the ring of saturn could be have found the planet which as it turned out he was unable to do  my four college years were very happy years the vacations came often and i went home invariably passing a day or two with my aunt legge in going or coming the acquisition of knowledge was always agreeable to me and i may say it without vanity i trust at this time of life i got the third honour of my class we should have graduated four but one of our class was compelled to quit us at the end of junior year on account of his health he was an unusually hard student and it was generally admitted that he would have taken the first honour had he remained we were thought to acquit ourselves with credit at the commencement although i afterwards heard my grandfather tell mr worden that he was of opinion the addresses would have been more masculine and commendable had less been said of the surprising growth prosperity and power of the colonies he had no objection to the encouragement of a sound healthful patriotic feeling but to him it appeared that something more novel might have better pleased the audience this may have been true as all three of us had something to say on the subject and it is a proof how much we thought alike that our language was almost as closely assimilated as our ideas  as for the powles hook ferry it was an unpleasant place i will allow though by the time i was junior i thought nothing of it my mother however was glad when it was passed for the last time i remember the very first words that escaped her after she had kissed me on my final return from college were well heaven be praised corny you will never again have any occasion to cross that frightful ferry now college is completely done with my poor mother little knew how much greater dangers i was subsequently called on to encounter in another direction nor was she minutely accurate in her anticipations since i have crossed the ferry in question several times in later life the distances not appearing to be as great of late years as they certainly seemed to be in my youth  it was a feather in a young mans cap to have gone through college in 1755 which was the year i graduated it is true the university men who had been home for their learning were more or less numerous but they were of a class that held itself aloof from the smaller gentry and most of them were soon placed in office adding the dignity of public trusts to their acquisitionsthe former in a manner overshadowing the latter but i was nearer to the body of the community and my position admitted more of comparative excellence as it might be no one thinks of certain habits opinions manners and tastes in the circle where they are expected to be found but it is a different thing where all or any of these peculiarities form the exception i am afraid more was anticipated from my college education than has ever been realized but i will say this for my alma mater that i am not conscious my acquisitions at college have ever been of any disadvantage to me and i rather think they have in some degree at least contributed to the little success that has attended my humble career  i kept up my intimacy with dirck follock during the whole time i remained at college he continued the classics with mr worden for two years after i left the school but i could not discover that his progress amounted to anything worth mentioning the master used to tell the colonel that dircks progress was slow and sure and this did not fail to satisfy a man who had a constitutional aversion to much of the headoverheels rate of doing things among the english population col follock as we always called him except when my father or grandfather asked him to drink a glass of wine or drank his health in the first glass after the cloth was removed when he was invariably styled col van valkenburgh at full length but col follock was quite content that his son and heir should know no more than he knew himself after making proper allowances for the difference in years and experience by the time i returned home however a material change had been made in the school mr worden fell heir to a moderate competency at home and he gave up teaching a business he had never liked accordingly it was even thought he was a shade less zealous in his parochial duties after the acquisition of this fifty pounds sterling ayear than he had previously been though i am far from insisting on the facts being so at any rate it was not in the power of £50 per annum to render mr worden apathetic on the subject of the church for he continued a most zealous churchman down to the hour of his death and this was something even admitting that he was not quite so zealous as a christian the church being the repository of the faith if not the faith itself it follows that its friends are akin to religion though not absolutely religious i have always liked a man the better for being what i call a sound warmhearted churchman though his habits may have been a little free  it was necessary to supply the place left vacant by the emigration of mr worden or to abandon a school that had got to be the nucleus of knowledge in westchester there was a natural desire at first to obtain another scholar from home but no such person offering a yale college graduate was accepted though not without sundry rebellions and plenty of distrust the moment he appeared col follock and major nicholas oothout another respectable dutch neighbour withdrew their sons and from that hour dirck never went to school again it is true westchester was not properly a dutch county like rockland and albany and orange and several others along the river but it had many respectable families in it of that extraction without alluding to such heavy people as the van cortlandts felipses beekmans and two or three others of that stamp most of our important county families had a different origin as in the case of the morrises of morrisania and of the manor of fordham the pells of pelham the heathcotes of mamanneck the branch of the de lanceys at west farms the jays of rye c c all these came of the english or the huguenot stock among these last more or less dutch blood was to be found however though dutch prejudices were a good deal weakened although few of these persons sent their boys to this school they were consulted in the selection of a master and i have always supposed that their indifference was the cause that the county finally obtained the services of a yankee from yale  the name of the new pedagogue was jason newcome or as he pronounced the latter appellation himself noocome as he affected a pedantic way of pronouncing the last syllable long or as it was spelt he rather called himself noocomb instead of newcome as is the english mode whence he soon got the nickname of jason old comb among the boys the lank orderly arrangement of his jetblack and somewhat greasylooking locks contributing their share towards procuring for him the sobriquet as i believe the french call it as this mr newcome will have a material part to play in the succeeding portions of this narrative it may be well to be a little more minute in his description  i found jason fully established in the school on my return from college i remember we met very much like two strange birds that see each other for the first time on the same dunghill or two quadrupeds in their original interview in a common herd it was new haven against newark though the institution after making as many migrations as the house of loretto finally settled down at princeton a short time before i took my degree i was consequently entitled to call myself a graduate of newarka sort of scholar that is quite as great a curiosity in the country as a queen annes farthing or a book printed in the fifteenth century i remember the first evening we two spent in company as well as if the meeting occurred only last night it was at satanstoe and mr worden was present jason had a liberal supply of puritanical notions which were bred inandin in his moral and i had almost said in his physical system nevertheless he could unbend and i did not fail to observe that very evening a gleam of covert enjoyment on his sombre countenance as the hotstuff the cards and the pipes were produced an hour or two before suppera meal we always had hot and comfortable this covert satisfaction however was not exhibited without certain misgiving looks as if the neophyte in these innocent enjoyments distrusted his right to possess his share i remember in particular when my mother laid two or three new clean packs of cards on the table that jason cast a stealthy glance over his shoulder as if to make certain that the act was not noted by the minister or the neighbours the neighbourswhat a contemptible being a man becomes who lives in constant dread of the comments and judgments of these social supervisors and what a wretch the habit of deferring to no principle better than their decision has made many a being who has had originally the materials of something better in him than has been developed by the surveillance of ignorance envy vulgarity gossiping and lying in those cases in which education social position opportunities and experience have made any material difference between the parties the man who yields to such a government exhibits the picture of a giant held in bondage by a pigmy i have always remarked too that they who are best qualified to sit in this neighbourhoodtribunal generally keep most aloof from it as repugnant to their tastes and habits thus leaving its decisions to the portion of the community least qualified to make such as are either just or enlightened  i felt a disposition to laugh outright at the manner in which jason betrayed a sneaking consciousness of crime as he saw my meek innocent simpleminded just and warmhearted mother lay the cards on the table that evening his sense of guilt was purely conventional while my mothers sense of innocence existed in the absence of false instruction and in the purity of her intentions one had been taught no exaggerated and false notion of sinnay a notion that is impious as it is clearly impious in man to torture acts that are perfectly innocent per se into formal transgressions of the law of godwhile the other had been educated under the narrow and exaggerated notions of a provincial sect and had obtained a species of conscience that was purely dependent on his miserable schooling i heard my grandfather say that jason actually showed the white of his eyes the first time he saw mr worden begin to deal and he still looked the whole time we were at whist as if he expected some one might enter and tell of his delinquency i soon discovered that jason had a much greater dread of being told of than of doing such things as taking a hand at whist or drinking a glass of punch from which i inferred his true conscience drew perceptible distinctions between the acts and the penalties he had been accustomed to see inflicted on them he was much disposed to a certain sort of frailty but it was a sneaking disposition to the last  but the amusing part of the exhibition that first evening of our acquaintance was mr wordens showing off his successors familiarity with the classics jason had not the smallest notion of quantity and he pronounced the latin very much as one would read mohawk from a vocabulary made out by a hunter or a savant of the french academy as i had received the benefit of mr wordens own instruction i could do better and generally my knowledge of the classics went beyond that of jasons the latters english too was long a source of amusement with us all though my grandfather often expressed strong disgust at it even col follock did not scruple to laugh at newcomes english which as he frequently took occasion to say hat a ferry remarkaple sount to it as this peculiarity of jasons extended a good way into the anglosaxon race in the part of the country in which he was born it may be well to explain what i mean a little more at large  jason was the son of an ordinary connecticut farmer of the usual associations and with no other pretension to education than such as was obtained in a common school or any reading which did not include the scriptures some halfdozen volumes of sermons and polemical works all the latter of which were vigorously as well as narrowly onesided and a few books that had been expressly written to praise new england and to undervalue all the rest of the earth as the family knew nothing of the world beyond the limits of its own township and an occasional visit to hartford on what is called electionday jasons early life was necessarily of the most contracted experience his english as a matter of course was just that of his neighbourhood and class of life which was far from being either very elegant or very doric but on this rustic provincial or rather hamlet foundation jason had reared a superstructure of new haven finish and proportions as he kept school before he went to college while he was in college and after he left college the whole energies of his nature became strangely directed to just such reforms of language as would be apt to strike the imagination of a pedagogue of his calibre in the first place he had brought from home with him a great number of sounds that were decidedly vulgar and vicious and with these in full existence in himself he had commenced his system of reform on other people as is common with all tyros he fancied a very little knowledge sufficient authority for very great theories his first step was to improve the language by adapting sound to spelling and he insisted on calling angel angel because an spelt an chamber chamber for the same reason and so on through a long catalogue of similarly constructed words  english he did not pronounce as lish but as english for instance and nothing anglicè nuthing as nothing or perhaps it were better to say nawthin while jason showed himself so much of a purist with these and many other words he was guilty of some of the grossest possible mistakes that were directly in opposition to his own theory thus while he affectedly pronounced none nun as known he did not scruple to call stone stun and home hum the idea of pronouncing clerk as it should be or clark greatly shocked him as it did to call hearth harth though he did not hesitate to call this good earth of ours the arth been he pronounced ben of course and roof he called ruff in spite of all his purism  from the foregoing specimens half a dozen among a thousand the reader will get an accurate notion of this weakness in jasons character it was heightened by the fact that the young man commenced his education such as it was late in life and it is rare indeed that either knowledge or tastes thus acquired are entirely free from exaggeration though jason was several years my senior like myself he was a recent graduate and it will be easy enough to imagine the numberless discussions that took place between us on the subject of our respective acquisitions i say respective instead of mutual acquisitions because there was nothing mutual about it or them neither our classics our philosophy nor our mathematics would seem to have been the same but each man apparently had a science or a language of his own and which had been derived from the institution where he had been taught in the classics i was much the strongest particularly in the quantities but jason had the best of it in mathematics in spite of his conceit his vulgarity his english his provincialism and the awkwardness with which he wore his tardily acquired information this man had strong points about him and a native shrewdness that would have told much more in his favour had it not been accompanied by a certain evasive manner that caused one constantly to suspect his sincerity and which often induced those who were accustomed to him to imagine he had a sneaking propensity that rendered him habitually hypocritical jason held new york in great contempt a feeling he was not always disposed to conceal and of necessity his comparisons were usually made with the state of things in connecticut and much to the advantage of the latter to one thing however he was much disposed to defer and that was money connecticut had not then nor has it now a single individual who would be termed rich in new york and jason spite of his provincial conceit spite of his overweening notions of moral and intellectual superiority could no more prevent this profound deference for wealth than he could substitute for a childhood of vulgarity and neglect the grace refinement and knowledge which the boys of the more fortunate classes in life obtain as it might be without knowing it yes jason bowed down to the golden calf in spite of his puritanism his love of liberty his pretension to equality and the general strut of his disposition and manner  such is an outline of the character and qualifications of the man whom i found on my return from college at the head of mr wordens school we soon became acquainted and i do not know which got the most ideas from the other in course of the first fortnight our conversation and arguments were free almost to rudeness and little mercy was shown to our respective prejudices jason was ultra leveling in his notions of social intercourse while i had the opinions of my own colony in which the distinctions of classes are far more strongly marked than is usual in new england out of boston and its immediate association still jason deferred to names as well as money though it was in a way very different from my own new england was and is loyal to the crown but having the right to name many of its own governors and possessing many other political privileges through the charters that were granted to her people in order to induce them to settle that portion of the continent they do not always manifest the feeling in a way to be agreeable to those who have a proper reverence for the crown among other points growing out of this difference in training jason and i had sundry arguments on the subject of professions trades and callings it was evident he fancied the occupation of a schoolmaster next in honour to that of a clergyman the clergy formed a species of aristocracy according to his notions but no man could commence life under more favourable auspices than by taking a school the following dialogue occurred between us on this subject and i was so much struck with the novelty of my companions notions as to make a note of it as soon as we parted  i wonder your folks dont think of giving you suthin to do corny commenced jason one day after our acquaintance had ripened into a sort of belligerent intimacy youre near nineteen now and ought to begin to think of bringing suthin in to pay for all the outgoings  by your folks jason meant the family of littlepage and the blood of that family quickened a little within me fit the idea of being profitably employed in the manner intimated because i had reached the mature and profitable age of nineteen  i do not understand you exactly mr newcome by your bringing something in answered i with dignity enough to put a man of ordinary delicacy on his guard  bringing suthin in is good english i hope mr littlepage i mean that your edication has cost your folks enough to warrant them in calling on you for a little interest how much do you suppose now has been spent on your edication beginning at the time you first went to mr worden and leaving off the day you quitted newark  really i have not the smallest notion the subject has never crossed my mind  did the old folks never say anything to you about itnever foot up the total  i am sure it is not easy to see how this could be done for i could not help them in the least  but your fathers books would tell that as doubtless it all stands charged against you  stands charged against mehow sir do you imagine my father makes a charge in a book against me whenever he pays a few pounds for my education  certainly how else could he tell how much you have hadthough on reflection as you are an only child it does not make so much difference you probably will get all in the end  and had i a brother or a sister do you imagine mr newcome each shilling we spent would be set down in a book as charges against us  how else in natur could it be known which had had the most or any sort of justice be done between you  justice would be done by our common fathers giving to each just as much of his own money as he might see fit what is it to me if he chose to give my brother a few hundred pounds more than he chose to give to me the money is his and he may do with it as he choose  an hundred pounds is an awful sight of money exclaimed jason betraying by his countenance how deeply he felt the truth of this if you have had money in such large sums so much the more reason why you should set about doing suthin to repay the old gentleman why not set up a school  sir  why not set up a school i say you might have had this of mine had you been a little older but once in fast in with me still schools are wanted and you might get a tolerable good recommend i dare say your tutor would furnish a certificate  this word recommend was used by jason for recommendation the habit of putting verbs in the places of substantives and vice versa being much in vogue with him  and do you really think that one who is destined to inherit satanstoe would act advisedly to set up a school recollect mr newcome that my father and grandfather have both borne the kings commission and that the last bears it at this very moment through his representative the governor  what of all that what better business is there than keeping a good school if you are high in your notions get to be made a tutor in that new jersey college recollect that a tutor in a college is somebody i did hope for such a place but having a governors son against me as a candidate there was no chance  a governors son a candidate for a tutorship in a college you are pleased to trifle with me mr newcome  its true as the gospel you thought some smaller fish put me down but he was the son of the governor but why do you give that vulgar name to your fathers farmsatanstoe is not decent yet corny ive heard you use it before your own mother  that you may hear every day and my mother use it too before her own son what fault do you find with the name of satanstoe  faultin the first place it is irreligious and profane then it is ungenteel and vulgar and only fit to be used in low company moreover it is opposed to history and revelation the evil one having a huff if you will but no toes such a name couldnt stand a fortnight before public opinion in new england  yes that may be very true but we do not care enough for his satanic majesty in the colony of new york to treat him with so much deference as for the huffs as you call them  why what do you call em mr littlepage  hoofs mr newcome that is the new york pronunciation of the word  i care nothing for york pronunciation which everybody knows is dutch and full of corruptions youll never do anything worth speaking of in this colony corny until you pay more attention to your schools  i do not know what you call attention mr jason unless we have paid it already here i have the caption or rather preamble of a law on that very subject that i copied out of the statutebook on purpose to show you and which i will now read in order to prove to you how things really stand in the colony  read away rejoined jason with an air of sufficient disdain  read i did and in the following sententious and comprehensive language vizwhereas the youth of this colony are found by manifold experience to be not inferior in their natural geniuses to the youth of any other country in the world therefore be it enacted c 8  there sir i said in exultation you have chapter and verse for the true character of the rising generation in the colony of new york  and what does that preamble lead to demanded jason a little staggered at finding the equality of our new york intellects established so clearly by legislative enactment  it is the preamble to an act establishing the free schools of new york in which the learned languages have now been taught these twenty years and you will please to remember that another law has not long been passed establishing a college in town  well curious laws sometimes do get into the statutebooks and a body must take them as he finds them i dare say connecticut might have a word to say on the same subject if you would give her a chance have you heard the wonderful news from philadelphia corny that has just come among us  i have heard nothing of late for you know i have been over in rockland with dirck follock for the last two weeks and news never reaches that family or indeed that county  no that is true enough answered jason drily news and a dutchman have no affinity or attraction as we would say in philosophy though there is gravitation enough on one side ha boy  here jason laughed outright for he was always delighted whenever he could get a sidehit at the children of holland whom he appeared to regard as a race occupying a position between the human family and the highest class of the unintellectual animals but it is unnecessary to dwell longer on this dialogue my object being merely to show the general character of jasons train of thought in order to be better understood when i come to connect his opinions with his acts  dirck and myself were much together after my return from college i passed weeks at a time with him and he returned my visits with the utmost freedom and goodwill each of us had now got his growth and it would have done the heart of frederick of prussia good to have seen my young friend after he had ended his nineteenth year in stature he measured exactly six feet three and he gave every promise of filling up in proportion dirck was none of your roundlyturned apollobuilt fellows but he had shoulders that his little short solid but dumpylooking mother who was of the true stock could scarcely span when she pulled his head down to give him a kiss which she did regularly as dirck told me himself twice each year that is to say christmas and newyear his complexion was fair his limbs large and well proportioned his hair light his eyes blue and his face would have been thought handsome by most persons i will not deny however that there was a certain ponderosity both of mind and body about my friend that did not very well accord with the general notion of grace and animation nevertheless dirck was a sterling fellow as true as steel as brave as a gamecock and as honest as noonday light  jason was a very different sort of person in many essentials in figure he was also tall but he was angular loosejointed and swingingslouching would be the better word perhaps still he was not without strength having worked on a farm until he was near twenty and he was as active as a cat a result that took the stranger a little by surprise when he regarded only his loose quavering sort of build in the way of thought jason would think two feet to dircks one but i am far from certain that it was always in so correct a direction give the dutchman time he was very apt to come out right whereas jason i soon discovered was quite liable to come to wrong conclusions and particularly so in all matters that were a little adverse and which affected his own apparent interests dirck moreover was one of the bestnatured fellows that breathed it being almost impossible to excite him to anger when it did come however the earthquake was scarcely more terrific i have seen him enraged and would as soon encounter a wildboar in an open field as run against his course while in the fit  modesty will hardly permit me to say much of myself i was wellgrown active strong for my years and i am inclined to think reasonably welllooking though i would prefer that this much should be said by any one but myself dirck and i often tried our manhood together when youngsters and i was the better chap until my friend reached his eighteenth year when the heavy metal of the young dutch giant told in our struggles after that period was past i found dirck too much for me in a close gripe though my extraordinary activity rendered the inequality less apparent than it might otherwise have proved i ought not to apply the term of extraordinary to anything about myself but the word escaped me unconsciously and i shall let it stand one thing i will say notwithstanding let the reader think of it as he may i was goodnatured and welldisposed to my fellowcreatures and had no greater love of money than was necessary to render me reasonably discreet  such is an outline of the characters and persons of three of the principal actors in the scenes i am about to relate scenes that will possess some interest for those who love to read accounts of adventures in a new country however much they may fail in interesting others when i speak of the condition and events of the more civilized condition of society that was enjoyed even in my youth in such old counties as westchester and such towns as york  footnote 8 this quotation would seem to be accurate and it is somewhat curious to trace the reason why a preamble so singular should have been prefixed to the law was it not owing to the oftrepeated and bold assertions of europeans that man deteriorated in this hemisphere any american who has been a near observer of european opinion even in our day must have been frequently amused at the expression of surprise and doubt that so often escapes the residents of the old world when they discover anything that particularly denotes talent coming from the new i make little question that this extraordinary preamble is a sort of indirect answer to an imputation that was known to be as general in that age as it was felt to be unjust my own experience would lead me to think native capacity more abundant in america than in the midland countries of europe and quite as frequently met with as in italy itself and i have often heard teachers both english and french admit that their american and westindia scholars were generally the readiest and cleverest in their schools the great evil under which this country labours in this respect is the sway of numbers which is constantly elevating mediocrity and spurious talent to high places in america we have a higher average of intelligence while we have far less of the higher class and i attribute the latter fact to the control of those who have never enjoyed the means of appreciating excellenceeditor     chapter iv    let us then be up and doing   with a heart for any fate   still achieving still pursuing   learn to labour and to wait    longfellow   the spring of the year i was twenty dirck and myself paid our first visit to town in the characters of young men although satanstoe was not more than fiveandtwenty miles from new york by the way of kingsbridge the road we always travelled in order to avoid the ferry it was by no means as common to visit the capital as it has since got to be i know gentlemen who pass in and out from our neighbourhood now as often as once a fortnight or even once a week but thirty years since this was a thing very seldom done my dear mother always went to town twice a year in the spring to pass easter week and in the autumn to make her winter purchases my father usually went down four times in the course of the twelve months but he had the reputation of a gadabout and was thought by many people to leave home quite as much as he ought to do as for my grandfather old age coming on he seldom left home now unless it were to pay stated visits to certain old brother campaigners who lived within moderate distances and with whom he invariably passed weeks each summer  the visit i have mentioned occurred some time after easter a season of the year that many of our country families were in the habit of passing in town to have the benefit of the daily services of old trinity as the hebrews resorted to jerusalem to keep the feast of the passover my mother did not go to town this year on account of my fathers gout and i was sent to supply her place with my aunt legge who had been so long accustomed to have one of the family with her at that season that i was substituted dirck had relatives of his own with whom he staid and thus every thing was rendered smooth in order to make a fair start my friend crossed the hudson the week before and after taking breath at satanstoe for three days we left the neck for the capital mounted on a pair of as good roadsters as were to be found in the county and that is saying a good deal for the morrises and de lanceys and van cortlandts all kept racers and sometimes gave us good sport in the autumn over the county course west chester to say no more than she deserved was a county with a spirited gentry and one of which no colony need be ashamed  my mother was a tenderhearted parent and full of anxiety in behalf of an only child she knew that travelling always has more or less of hazard and was desirous we should be off betimes in order to make certain of our reaching town before the night set in highway robbers heaven be praised were then and are still unknown to the colonies but there were other dangers that gave my excellent parent much concern all the bridges were not considered safe the roads were and are yet very circuitous and it was possible to lose ones way while it was said persons had been known to pass the night on harlem common an uninhabited waste that lies some seven or eight miles on our side of the city my mothers first care therefore was to get dirck and myself off early in the morning in order to do which she rose with the light gave us our breakfasts immediately afterwards and thus enabled us to quit satanstoe just as the sun had burnished the eastern sky with its tints of flamecolour  dirck was in high goodhumour that morning and to own the truth corny did not feel the depression of spirits which according to the laws of propriety possibly ought to have attended the first really free departure of so youthful an adventurer from beneath the shadows of the paternal roof we went our way laughing and chatting like two girls just broke loose from boardingschool i had never known dirck more communicative and i got certain new insights into his feelings expectations and prospects as we rode along the colonys highway that morning that afterwards proved to be matters of much interest with us both we had not got a mile from the chimneytops of satanstoe ere my friend broke forth as follows  i suppose you have heard corny what the two old gentlemen have been at lately  your father and minei have not heard a syllable of any thing new  they have been suing out before the governor and council a joint claim to that tract of land they bought of the mohawks the last time they were out together on service in the colony militia  i ought to mention here that though my predecessors had made but few campaigns in the regular army each had made several in the more humble capacity of a militia officer  this is news to me dirck i answered why should the old gentlemen have been so sly about such a thing  i cannot tell you lest they thought silence the best way to keep off the yankees you know my father has a great dread of a yankees getting a finger into any of his bargains he says the yankees are the locusts of the west  but how came you to know any thing about it dirck  i am no yankee corny  and your father told you on the strength of this recommendation  he told me as he tells me most things that he thinks it best i should know we smoke together and then we talk together  i would learn to smoke too if i thought i should get any useful information by so doing  dere is much to be larnt from ter pipe said dirck dropping into a slightly dutch accent as frequently happened with him when his mind took a secret direction towards holland though in general he spoke english quite as well as i did myself and vastly better than that miracle of taste and learning and virtue and piety mr jason newcome ab of yale and prospective president of that or some other institution  so it would seem if your father is telling you secrets all the time you are smoking together but where is this land dirck  it is in the mohawk countryor rather it is in the country near the hampshire grants and at no great distance from the mohawk country  and how much may there be of it  forty thousand acres and some of it of good rich flats they say such as a dutchman loves  and your father and mine have purchased all this land in company you sayshare and share alike as the lawyers call it  just so  pray how much did they pay for so large a tract of land  dirck took time to answer this question he first drew from his breast a pocketbook which he opened as well as he could under the motion of his roadster for neither of us abated his speed it being indispensable to reach town before dark my friend succeeded at length in putting his hand on the paper he wanted which he gave to me  there he said that is a list of the articles paid to the indians which i have copied and then there have been several hundred pounds of fees paid to the governor and his officers  i read from the list as follows the words coming out by jerks as the trotting of my horse permitted fifty blankets each with yellow strings and yellow trimmings ten iron pots four gallons each forty pounds of gunpowder seven muskets twelve pounds of small beads ten strings of wampum fifty gallons of rum pure jamaica and of high proof a score of jewsharps and three dozen first quality englishmade tomahawks  well dirck i cried as soon as through reading this is no great matter to give for forty thousand acres of land in the colony of new york i dare say a hundred pounds currency 250 would buy every thing here even to the rum and the first quality of englishmade tomahawks  ninetysix pounds thirteen shillings seven pence tree fartins was the footing of the whole bill answered dirck deliberately preparing to light his pipe for he could smoke very conveniently while trotting no faster than at the rate of six miles the hour  i do not find that dear for forty thousand acres i suppose the muskets and rum and other things were manufactured expressly for the indian trade  not they corny you know how it is with the old gentlementhey are as honest as the day  so much the better for them and so much the better for us but what is to be done with this land now they own it  dirck did not answer until we had trotted twenty rods for by this time the pipe was at work and the moment that smoke was seen he kept his eye on it until he saw a bright light in front of his nose  the first thing will be to find it corny when a patent is signed and delivered then you must send forth some proper person to find the land it covers i have heard of a gentleman who got a grant of ten thousand acres five years since and though he has had a hunt for it every summer since he has not been able to find it yet to be sure ten thousand acres is a small object to look for in the woods  and our fathers intend to find this land as soon as the season opens  not so fast corny not so fast that was the scheme of your fathers welsh blood but mine takes matters more deliberately let us wait until next year he said and then we can send the boys by that time too the war will take some sort of a shape and we shall know better how to care for the children the subject has been fairly talked over between the two patentees and we are to go early next spring not this  the idea of landhunting was not in the least disagreeable to me nor was it unpleasant to think that i stood in reversion or as heir to twenty thousand acres of land in addition to those of satanstoe dirck and i talked the matter over as we trotted on until both of us began to regret that the expedition was so far in perspective  the war to which dirck alluded had broken out a few months before our visit to town a mr washington of virginiathe same who has since become so celebrated as the col washington of braddocks defeat and other events at the southhaving been captured with a party of his men in a small work thrown up in the neighbourhood of the french somewhere on the tributaries of the ohio a river that is known to run into the mississippi a vast distance to the west i knew very little then nor do i know much now of these remote regions beyond the fact that there are such places and that they are sometimes visited by detachments warparties hunters and other adventurers from the colonies to me it seems scarce worth fighting about such distant and wild territory for ages and ages must elapse before it can be of any service for the purposes of civilization both dirck and myself regretted that the summer would be likely to go by without our seeing the enemy for we came of families that were commonly employed on such occasions we thought both our fathers might be out though even that was a point that still remained under discussion  we dined and baited at kingsbridge intending to sup in town while the dinner was cooking dirck and i walked out on the heights that overlook the hudson for i knew less of this noble river than i wished to know of it we conversed as we walked and my companion who knew the river much better than myself having many occasions to pass up and down it between the village of haverstraw and town in his frequent visits to his relatives below gave me some useful information  look here corny said dirck after betraying a good deal of desire to obtain a view of some object in the distance along the riverside look here corny do you see yonder house in the little bay below us with the lawn that extends down to the water and that noble orchard behind it  i saw the object to which dirck alluded it was a house that stood near the river but sheltered and secluded with the lawn and orchard as described though at the distance of some two or three miles all the beauties of the spot could not be discovered and many of them had to be received on the faith of my companions admiration still i saw very plainly all the principal objects named and among others the house the orchard and the lawn the building was of stoneas is common with most of the better sort of houses in the countrywas long irregular and had that air of solid comfort about it which it is usual to see in buildings of that description the walls were not whitewashed according to the lively tastes of our dutch fellowcolonists who appear to expend all their vivacity in the pipe and the brush but were left in their native grey a circumstance that rendered the form and dimensions of the structure a little less distinct at a first glance than they might otherwise have proved as i gazed at the spot however i began to fancy it a charm to find the picture thus sobered down and found a pleasure in drawing the different angles and walls and chimneys and roofs from this background by means of the organ of sight on the whole i thought the little sequestered bay the wooded and rocky shores the small but well distributed lawn the orchard with all the other similar accessories formed together one of the prettiest places of the sort i had ever seen thinking so i was not slow in saying as much to my companion i was thought to have some taste in these matters and had been consulted on the subject of laying out grounds by one or two neighbours in the county  whose house is it dirck i enquired and how came you to know anything about it  that is lilacsbush answered my friend and it belongs to my mothers cousin herman mordaunt  i had heard of herman or as it is pronounced harmar mordaunt he was a man of considerable note in the colony having been the son of a major mordaunt of the british army who had married the heiress of a wealthy dutch merchant whence the name of herman which had descended to the son along with the money the dutch were so fond of their own blood that they never failed to give this mr mordaunt his christian name and he was usually known in the colony as herman mordaunt further than this i knew little of the gentleman unless it might be that he was reputed rich and was admitted to be in the best society though not actually belonging to the territorial or political aristocracy of the colony  as herman mordaunt is your mothers cousin i suppose dirck i resumed that you have been at lilacsbush and ascertained whether the inside of the house is as pleasant and respectable as the outside  often corny while madam mordaunt lived my mother and i used to go there every summer the poor lady is now dead but i go there still  why did you not ride on as far as lilacsbush and levy a dinner on your relations i should think herman mordaunt would feel hurt were he to learn that an acquaintance or a relation had put up at an inn within a couple of miles of his own house i dare say he knows both major and capt littlepage and i protest i shall feel it necessary to send him a note of apology for not calling these things ought not to be done dirck among persons of a certain stamp and who are supposed to know what is proper  this would be all right enough corny had herman mordaunt or his daughter been at lilacsbush but they live in crown street in town in winter and never come out here until after the pinkster holidays let them come when they may  oh he is as great a man as that is hea town and country house after all i do not know whether it would do to be quite so free with one of his standing as to go to dine with him without sending notice  nonsense corny who hesitates about stopping at a gentlemans door when he is travelling herman mordaunt would have given us a hearty welcome and i should have gone on to lilacsbush did i not know that the family is certain to be in town at this season easter came early this year and tomorrow will be the first day of the pinkster holidays as soon as they are over herman mordaunt and anneke will be out here to enjoy their lilacs and roses  oh ho there is an anneke as well as the old gentleman pray how old may miss anneke be master dirck  as this question was asked i turned to look my friend in the face and i found that his handsome smooth fair dutch lineaments were covered with a glow of red that it was not usual to see extended so far from his ruddy cheeks dirck was too much of a man however to turn away or to try to hide blushes so ingenuous but he answered stoutly  my cousin anneke mordaunt is just turned of seventeen and ill tell you what corny  welli am listening with both ears to hear your whatout with it man both ears are open  why anneke onnakay is one of the very prettiest girls in the colonywhat is more she is as sweet and gootdirck grew dutch as he grew animatedas she is pretty  i was quite astounded at the energy and feeling with which this was said dirck was such a matteroffact fellow that i had never dreamed he could be sensible to the passion of love nor had i ever paused to analyze the nature of our own friendship we liked each other in the first place most probably from habit then we were of characters so essentially different that our attachment was influenced by that species of excitement which is the child of opposition as we grew older dircks good qualities began to command my respect and reason entered more into my affection for him i was well convinced that my companion could and would prove to be a warm friend but the possibility of his ever becoming a lover had not before crossed my mind even then the impression made was not very deep or lasting though i well remember the sort of admiration and wonder with which i gazed at his flushed cheek animated eye and improved mien for the moment dirck really had a commanding and animated air  why anneke is one of the prettiest girls in the colony my friend had exclaimed  and your cousin  my second cousinher mothers father and my mothers mother were brother and sister  in that case i shall hope to have the honour of being introduced one of these days to miss anneke mordaunt who is just turned of seventeen and is one of the prettiest girls in the colony and is as good as she is pretty  i wish you to see her corny and that before we go home dirck replied all his philosophy or phlegm whichever the philosophy of other people may term it returning come let us go back to the inn our dinner will be getting cold  i mused on my friends unusual manner as we walked back towards the inn but it was soon forgotten in the satisfaction produced by eating a good substantial meal of broiled ham with hot potatoes boiled eggs a beefsteak done to a turn with the accessions of pickles coldslaw applepie and cider this is a common new york tavern dinner for the wayfarer and i must say i have got to like it often have i enjoyed such a repast after a sharp forenoons ride ay and enjoyed it more than i have relished entertainments at which have figured turkies oysters hams hashes and other dishes that have higher reputations even turtlesoup for which we are somewhat famous in new york has failed to give me the same delight  dirck to do him justice ate heartily for it is not an easy matter to take away his appetite as usual i did most of the talking and that was with our landlady who hearing i was a son of her muchesteemed and constant customer major littlepage presented herself with the dessert and cheese and did me the honour to commence a discourse her name was light and light was she certain to cast on everything she discussed that is to say innkeepers light which partakes somewhat of the darkness that is so apt to overshadow no small portion of the minds of her many customers  pray mrs light i asked when there was an opening which was not until the good woman had exhausted her breath in honour of the littlepages do you happen to know anything of a family hereabouts of the name of mordaunt  do i happen to know sirwhy mr littlepage you might almost as well have asked me if i had ever heard of a van cortlandt or a philipse or a morris or any other of the gentry hereabouts mr mordaunt has a countryplace and a very pretty one it is within two miles and a half of us and he and madame mordaunt never passed our door when they went into the country to see madame van cortlandt without stopping to say a word and leave a shilling the poor lady is dead but there is a young image of her virtues that is coming ater her that will be likely to do some damage in the colony she is modesty itself sir so i thought it could do her no harm the last time she was here just to tell her she ought to be locked up for the thefts she was likely to commit if not for them she had committed already she blushed sir and looked for all the world like the shell of the most delicate boiled lobster you ever laid eyes on she is truly a charming young lady  thefts of hearts you mean of course my good mrs light  of nothing else sir young ladies are apt to steal hearts you know my word for it miss anneke will turn out a great robber after her own fashion you know sir  and whose hearts is she likely to run away with pray i should be pleased to hear the names of some of the sufferers  lord sirshe is too young to have done much yet but wait a twelvemonth and ill answer the question  i could see all this time that dirck was uneasy and had some amusement in watching the workings of his countenance my malicious intentions however were suddenly interrupted as if to prevent further discourse and at the same time further espionage my young friend rose from table ordering the horses and the bill  during the ride to town no more was said of lilacsbush herman mordaunt or his daughter anneke dirck was silent but this was his habit after dinner and i was kept a good deal on the alert in order to find the road which crossed the common it being our desire to go in that direction it is true we might have gone into town by the way of bloomingdale greenwich the meadows and the collect and so down past the common upon the head of broadway but my mother had particularly desired we would fall into the bowery lane passing the seats that are to be found in that quarter and getting into queen street as soon as possible by taking this course she thought we should be less likely to miss our way within the town itself which is certainly full of narrow and intricate passages my uncle legge had removed into duke street in the vicinity of hanover square and queen street i well knew would lead us directly to his door queen street indeed is the great artery of new york through which most of its blood circulates  it was drawing towards night when we trotted up to the stable where we left our horses and obtaining a black to shoulder our portmanteaus we began to thread the mazes of the capital on foot new york was certainly even in 1757 a wonderful place for commerce vessels began to be seen some distance east of fly market and there could not have been fewer than twenty ships brigs and schooners lying in the east river as we walked down queen street of course i include all descriptions of vessels that go to sea in this estimate at the present moment it is probable twice that number would be seen there dirck and i stopped more than once involuntarily to gaze at the exhibitions of wealth and trade that offered themselves as we went deeper into the town my mother had particularly cautioned me against falling into this evidence of country habits and i felt much ashamed at each occurrence of the weakness but i found it irresistible at length my friend and i parted he to go to the residence of his aunt while i proceeded to that of mine before separating however we agreed to meet next morning in the fields at the head of broadway on the common which as it was understood was to be the scene of the pinkster sports  my reception in duke street was cordial both on the part of my uncle and on the part of my aunt the first being a goodhearted person though a little too apt to run into extravagance on the subject of the rights of the rabble i was pleased with the welcome i received enjoyed an excellent hot supper to which we sat down at halfpast eight my aunt being fond of town hours both dining and supping a little later than my mother as being more fashionable and genteel 9 as i was compelled to confess fatigue after so long a ride as soon as we quitted the table i retired to my own room  the next day was the first of the three that are devoted to pinkster the great saturnalia of the new york blacks although this festival is always kept with more vivacity at albany than in york it is far from being neglected even now in the latter place i had told my aunt before i left her i should not wait for breakfast but should be up with the sun and off in quest of dirck in order that we might enjoy a stroll along the wharves before it was time to repair to the common where the fun was to be seen accordingly i got out of the house betimes though it was an hour later than i had intended for i heard the rattling of cups in the little parlour the sign that the table was undergoing the usual process of arrangement for breakfast it then occurred to me that most if not all of the servants seven in number would be permitted to enjoy the holiday and that it might be well if i took all my meals that day in the fields running back to the room i communicated this intention to juno the girl i found doing pompeys work and left the house on a jump there was no great occasion for starving i thought in a town as large and as full of eatables as new york and the result fully justified this reasonable opinion  just as i got into hanover square i saw a greyheaded negro who was for turning a penny before he engaged in the amusements of the day carrying two pails that were scoured to the neatness of dutch fastidiousness and which were suspended from the yoke he had across his neck and shoulders he cried white winewhite wine in a clear sonorous voice and i was at his side in a moment white wine was and is still my delight of a morning and i bought a delicious draught of the purest and best of a communipaw vintage eating a cake at the same time thus refreshed i proceeded into the square the beauty of which had struck my fancy as i walked through it the previous evening to my surprise whom should i find in the very centre of queen street gaping about him with a most indomitable connecticut air but jason newcome a brief explanation let me into the secret of his presence his boys had all gone home to enjoy the pinkster holiday with the black servants of their respective families and jason had seized the opportunity to pay his first visit to the great capital of the colony he was on his travels like myself  and what has brought you down here i demanded the pedagogue having already informed me that he had put up at a tavern in the suburbs where horsekeeping and lodgings were reasonable the pinkster fields are up near the head of broadway on the common  so i hear answered jason but i want to see a ship and all the sights this way in the first place it will be time enough for pinkster two or three hours hence if a christian ought even to look at such vanities can you tell me where i am to find hanover square corny  you are in it now mr newcome and to my fancy a very noble area it is  this hanover square repeated jason why its shape is not that of a square at all it is nearer a triangle  what of that sir by a square in a town one does not necessarily understand an area with four equal sides and as many right angles but an open space that is left for air and beauty there are air and beauty enough to satisfy any reasonable man a square may be a parallelogram or a triangle or any other shape one pleases  this then is hanover squarea new york square or a nassau hall square corny but not a yale college square take my word for it it is so small moreover  smallthe width of the street at the widest end must be near a hundred feet i grant you it is not half that at the other end but that is owing to the proximity of the houses  ay it is all owing to the proximity of the houses as you call it now according to my notion hanover square of which a body hears so much talk in the country ought to have had fifty or sixty acres in it and statues of the whole house of brunswick besides why is that nest of houses left in the middle of your square  it is not sir the square ceases when it reaches them they are too valuable to be torn down although there has been some talk of it my uncle legge told me last evening that those houses have been valued as high as twelve thousand dollars and some persons put them as high as six thousand pounds  this reconciled jason to the houses for he never failed to defer to money come in what shape it would it was the only source of human distinction that he could clearly comprehend though he had some faint impressions touching the dignity of the crown and the respect due to its representatives  corny said jason in an under tone and taking me by the arm to lead me aside though no one was near like a man who has a great secret to ask or to communicate what was that i saw you taking for your bitters a little while ago  bitters i do not understand you jason nothing bitter have i tasted today nor can i say i have any great wish to put anything bitter into my mouth  why the draught you got from the nigger who is now coming back across the square as you call it and which you seemed to enjy particularly i am dry myself and should wonderfully like a drink  oh that fellow sells white wine and you will find it delicious if you want your bitters as you call them you cannot do better than stop him and give him a penny  will he let it go so desperate cheap as that demanded jason his eyes twinkling with a sort of bitters expectation  that is the stated price stop him boldly there is no occasion for all this connecticut modesty here uncle this gentleman wishes a cup of your white wine  jason turned away in alarm to see who was looking on and when the cup was put into his hand he shut his eyes determined to gulp its contents at a swallow in the most approved bitters style about half the liquor went down his throat the rest being squirted back in a small white stream  buttermilk by jingo exclaimed the disappointed pedagogue who expected some delicious combination of spices with rum st jingo was the only saint and a darnation or darn you were the only oaths his puritan education ever permitted him to use  footnote 9 the dinner of the last half century is in one sense but a substitute for the petits soupers of the century or two that preceded it is so entirely rational and natural that the cultivated and refined should meet for the purposes of social enjoyment after the business of the day has terminated that the supper has only given place to the same meal under another name and at hours little varying from those of the past the parisian dines at halfpast six remaining at table until eight the englishman later in all his hours and more ponderous in all his habits sits down to table about the time the frenchman gets up quitting it between nine and ten the italian pays a tribute to his climate and has his early dinner and light supper both usually alone the habits of the country carrying him to the opera and the conversazione for social communion but what is the american a jumble of the same senseless contradictions in his social habits as he is fast getting to be in his political creeds and political practices a being that is in transitu pressed by circumstances on the one side and by the habit of imitation on the other unwilling almost unable to think and act for himself the only american who is temporarily independent in such things is the unfledged provincial fresh from his village conceit and village practices who until corrected by communion with the world fancies the southeast corner of the northwest parish in the town of hebron in the county of jericho and the state of connecticut to be the only portion of this globe that is perfection if he should happen to keep a school or conduct a newspaper the community becomes in a small degree the participant of his rare advantages and vast experienceeditor     chapter v    heres your fine clams   as white as snow   on rockaway these clams do grow    new york cries   it was some time before jasons offended dignity and disappointment would permit him to smile at the mistake and we had walked some distance towards old slip where i was to meet dirck before the pedagogue even opened his lips then the only allusion he made to the white wine was to call it a plaguy dutch cheat for jason had implicitly relied on having that peculiar beverage of his caste known as bitters what he meant by a dutch cheat i do not know unless he thought the buttermilk was particularly dutch and this buttermilk an imposition  dirck was waiting for me at the old slip and on inquiry i found he had enjoyed his draught of white wine as well as myself and was ready for immediate service we proceeded along the wharves in a body admiring the different vessels that lined them about nine oclock all three of us passed up wall street on the stoops of which no small portion of its tenants were already seated enjoying the sight of the negroes as with happy shining faces they left the different dwellings to hasten to the pinkster field our passage through the street attracted a good deal of attention for being all three strangers it was not to be supposed we could be thus seen in a body without exciting a remark such a thing could hardly have been expected in london itself  after showing jason the city hall trinity church and the city tavern we went out of town taking the direction of a large common that the kings officers had long used for a paradeground and which has since been called the park though it would be difficult to say why since it is barely a paddock in size and certainly has never been used to keep any animals wilder than the boys of the town a park i suppose it will one day become though it has little at present that comports with my ideas of such a thing on this common then was the pinkster ground which was now quite full of people as well as of animation  there was nothing new in a pinkster frolic either to dirck or to myself though jason gazed at the whole procedure with wonder he was born within seventy miles of that very spot but had not the smallest notion before of such a holiday as pinkster there are few blacks in connecticut i believe and those that are there are so ground down in the puritan mill that they are neither fish flesh nor redherring as we say of a nondescript no man ever heard of a festival in new england that had not some immediate connection with the saints or with politics  jason was at first confounded with the noises dances music and games that were going on by this time ninetenths of the blacks of the city and of the whole country within thirty or forty miles indeed were collected in thousands in those fields beating banjoes singing african songs drinking and worst of all laughing in a way that seemed to set their very hearts rattling within their ribs everything wore the aspect of goodhumour though it was goodhumour in its broadest and coarsest forms every sort of common game was in requisition while drinking was far from being neglected still not a man was drunk a drunken negro indeed is by no means a common thing the features that distinguish a pinkster frolic from the usual scenes at fairs and other merrymakings however were of african origin it is true there are not now nor were there then many blacks among us of african birth but the traditions and usages of their original country were so far preserved as to produce a marked difference between this festival and one of european origin among other things some were making music by beating on skins drawn over the ends of hollow logs while others were dancing to it in a manner to show that they felt infinite delight this in particular was said to be a usage of their african progenitors  hundreds of whites were walking through the fields amused spectators among these last were a great many children of the better class who had come to look at the enjoyment of those who attended them in their own ordinary amusements many a sable nurse did i see that day chaperoning her young master a young mistress or both together through the various groups demanding of all and receiving from all the respect that one of these classes was accustomed to pay to the other  a great many young ladies between the ages of fifteen and twenty were also in the field either escorted by male companions or what was equally as certain of producing deference under the dare of old female nurses who belonged to the race that kept the festival we had been in the field ourselves two hours and even jason was beginning to condescend to be amused when unconsciously i got separated from my companions and was wandering through the groups by myself as i came on a party of young girls who were under the care of two or three wrinkled and greyheaded negresses so respectably attired as to show at once they were confidential servants in some of the better families as for the young ladies themselves most were still of the age of school girls though there were some of that equivocal age when the bud is just breaking into the opening flower and one or two that were even a little older young women in forms and deportment though scarcely so in years one of a party of two of the last appeared to me to possess all the grace of young womanhood rendered radiant by the ingenuous laugh the lighthearted playfulness and the virgin innocence of sweet seventeen she was simply but very prettily dressed and everything about her attire air carriage and manner denoted a young lady of the better class who was just old enough to feel all the proprieties of her situation while she was still sufficiently youthful to enjoy all the fun as she came near me it seemed as if i knew her but it was not until i heard her sweet mirthful voice that i recollected the pretty little thing in whose behalf i had taken a round with the butchers boy on the bowery road near six years before as her party came quite near the spot where i stood what was only conjecture at first was reduced to a certainty  in the surprise of the moment happening to catch the eye of the young creature i was emboldened to make her a low bow at first she smiled like one who fancies she recognises an acquaintance then her face became scarlet and she returned my bow with a very ladylike but at the same time a very distant curtsey upon which bending her blue eyes to the ground she turned away seemingly to speak to her companion after this i could not advance to speak though i was strongly in hopes the old black nurse who was with her would recognise me for she had manifested much concern about me on the occasion of the quarrel with the young butcher this did not occur and old katrinke as i heard the negress called jabbered away explaining the meaning of the different ceremonies of her race to a cluster of very interested listeners without paying any attention to me the tongues of the pretty little things went as girls tongues will go though my unknown fair one maintained all the reserve and quiet of manner that comported with her young womanhood and apparent condition in life  dere miss anneke exclaimed katrinke suddenly dere come a genttleum dat will bring a pleasure i know  anneke i repeated mentally and gentleman that will cause pleasure by his appearance can it be dirck i thought sure enough dirck it proved to be who advanced rapidly to the group making a general salute and finishing by shaking my beautiful young strangers hands and addressing her by the name of cousin anneke this then was annie mordaunt as the young lady was commonly called in the english circles the only child and heiress of herman mordaunt of crown street and of lilacsbush well dirck has more taste than i had ever given him credit for just as this thought glanced through my mind my figure caught my friends eye and with a look of pride and exultation he signed to me to draw nearer though i had managed to get pretty near as it was already  cousin anneke said dirck who never used circumlocution when direct means were at all available this is corny littlepage of whom you have heard me speak so often and for whom i ask one of your best curtsies and sweetest smiles  miss mordaunt was kind enough to comply literally both curtsying and smiling precisely as she had been desired to do though i could see she was also slightly disposed to laugh i was still making my bow and mumbling some unintelligible compliment when katrinke gave a little exclamation and using the freedom of an old and confidential servant she eagerly pulled the sleeve of her young mistress and hurriedly whispered something in her ear anneke coloured turned quickly towards me bent her eyes more boldly and steadily on my faceand then it was that i fancied the sweetest smile which mortal had ever received or that with which i had just before been received was much surpassed  mr littlepage i believe is not a total stranger cousin dirck she said katrinke remembers him as a young gentleman who once did me an important service and now i think i can trace the resemblance myself i allude to the boy who insulted me on the bowery road mr littlepage and your handsome interference in my behalf  had there been twenty boys miss mordaunt an insult to you would have been resented by any man of ordinary spirit  i do not know that any youth who was suddenly put to his wits to be polite or sentimental or feeling could have done a great deal better than that so anneke thought too i fancy for her colour increased rendering her ravishingly lovely and she looked surprisingly pleased  yes put in dirck with energylet twenty or a hundred try it if they please anneke men or boys and theyll find those that will protect you  you for one of course cousin dirck rejoined the charming girl holding out her hand towards my friend with a frankness i could have dispensed with in her but you will remember mr littlepage or master littlepage as he then was was a stranger and i had no such claim on him as i certainly have on you  well corny it is odd you never said a word of this to me when i was showing him lilacsbush and talking of you and of your father not a word did he say on the subject  i did not then know it was miss mordaunt i had been so fortunate as to serve but here is mr newcome at your elbow follock and dying to be introduced as he sees i have been  anneke turned to smile and curtsey again to jason who made his bow in a very schoolmaster sort of a fashion while i could see that the circumstance i had not boasted of my exploit gave it new importance in the sweet creatures eyes as for jason he had no sooner got along with the introductionthe first i fancy he had ever gone regularly throughthan profiting by some questions miss mordaunt was asking dirck about his mother and the rest of the family he came round to me drew me aside by a jerk of the sleeve and gave me to understand he had something for my private ear  i did not know before that you had ever kept school corny he half whispered earnestly  how do you know it now mr newcome since the thing never happened  how comes it then that this young woman called you master littlepage  bah jason wait a year or two and you will begin to get truer notions of us new yorkers  but i heard her with my own earsmaster littlepage as plain as words were ever called  well then miss mordaunt must be right and i have forgotten the affair i must once have kept a womans school somewhere in my younger days but forgotten it  now this is nothing nawthin as expressed but you desperate york pride corny but i think all the better of you for it why as it could not have taken place after you went to college you must have got the start of even me but the rev mr worden is enough to start a youth with a large capital if he be so minded i admit he does understand the dead languages it is a pity he is so very dead in religious matters  wellwelli will tell you all about it another time you perceive now that miss mordaunt wishes to move on and does not like to quit us too abruptly let us follow  jason complied and for an hour or two we had the pleasure of accompanying the young ladies as they strolled among the booths and different groups of that singular assembly as has been said most of the blacks had been born in the colony but there were some native africans among them new york never had slaves on the system of the southern planters or in gangs of hundreds to labour in the fields under overseers and who lived apart in cabins of their own but our system of slavery was strictly domestic the negro almost invariably living under the same roof with the master or if his habitation was detached as certainly sometimes happened it was still near at hand leaving both races as parts of a common family in the country the negroes never toiled in the field but it was as ordinary husbandmen and in the cases of those who laboured on their own property or as tenants of some extensive landford the black did his work at his masters side then all or nearly all our household servants were and still are blacks leaving that department of domestic economy almost exclusively in their hands with the exception of those cases in which the white females busied themselves also in such occupations united to the usual supervision of the mistresses among the dutch in particular the treatment of the negro was of the kindest character a trusty field slave often having quite as much to say on the subject of the tillage and the crops as the man who owned both the land he worked and himself  a party of native africans kept us for half an hour the scene seemed to have revived their early associations and they were carried away with their own representation of semisavage sports the americanborn blacks gazed at this group with intense interest also regarding them as so many ambassadors from the land of their ancestors to enlighten them in usages and superstitious lore that were more peculiarly suited to their race the last even endeavoured to imitate the acts of the first and though the attempt was often ludicrous it never failed on the score of intention and gravity nothing was done in the way of caricature but much in the way of respect and affection  lest the habits of this generation should pass away and be forgotten of which i see some evidence i will mention a usage that was quite common among the dutch and which has passed in some measure into the english families that have formed connections with the children of holland two of these intermarriages had so far brought the littlepages within the pale that the usage to which i allude was practised in my own case the custom was this when a child of the family reached the age of six or eight a young slave of the same age and sex was given to him or her with some little formality and from that moment the fortunes of the two were considered to be within the limits of their respective pursuits and positions as those of man and wife it is true divorces do occur but it is only in cases of gross misconduct and quite as often the misconduct is on the side of the master as on that of the slave a drunkard may get in debt and be compelled to part with his blacks this one among the rest but this particular negro remains with him as long as anything remains slaves that seriously misbehave are usually sent to the islands where the toil on the sugar plantations proves a very sufficient punishment  the day i was six a boy was given to me in the manner i have mentioned and he remained not only my property but my factotum to this moment it was yaap or jacob the negro to whom i have already had occasion to allude anneke mordaunt whose grandmother was of a dutch family it will be remembered had with her there in the pinkster field a negress of just her own age who was called mari not mary or maria but the last as it would be pronounced without the final a this mari was a buxom glistening smoothfaced laughing redlipped pearltoothed blackeyed hussy that seemed born for fun and who was often kept in order by her more sedate and wellmannered young mistress with a good deal of difficulty my fellow was on the ground somewhere too for i had given him permission to come to town to keep pinkster and he was to leave satanstoe in a sloop within an hour after i left it myself the wind had been fair and i made no question of his having arrived though as yet i had not seen him  i could have accompanied anneke and her party all day through that scene of unsophisticated mirth and felt no want of interest her presence immediately produced an impression even the native africans moderating their manner and lowering their yells as it might be the better to suit her more refined tastes no one in our set was too dignified to laugh but jason the pedagogue it is true often expressed his disgust at the amusements and antics of the negroes declaring they were unbecoming human beings and otherwise manifesting that disposition to hypercriticism which is apt to distinguish one who is only a tyro in his own case  such was the state of things when mari came rushing up to her young mistress with distended eyes and uplifted hands exclaiming on a key that necessarily made us all sharers in the communication  oh miss annekewhat you tink miss anneke could you ever spose sich a ting miss anneke  tell me at once mari what it is you have seen or heard and leave off these silly exclamations said the gentle mistress with a colour that proved she was unused to her own girls manner  who could tink it miss anneke dese here werry niggers have sent alle way to deir own country and have had a lion cotched for pinkster  this was news indeed if true not one of us all had ever seen a lion wild animals then being exceedingly scarce in the colonies with the exception of those that were taken in our own woods i had seen several of the small brown bears and many a wolf and one stuffed panther in my time but never supposed it within the range of possibilities that i could be brought so near a living lion inquiry showed nevertheless that mari was right with the exception of the animals having been expressly caught for the occasion it was the beast of a showman who was also the proprietor of a very active and amusing monkey the price of admission was a quarter of a dollar for adult whites children and negroes going in for halfprice these preliminaries understood it was at once settled that all who could muster enough of money and courage should go in a body and gaze on the king of beasts i say of courage for it required a good deal for a female novice to go near a living lion  the lion was kept in a cage of course which was placed in a temporary building of boards that had been erected for the pinkster field as we drew near the door i saw that the cheeks of several of the pretty young creatures who belonged to the party of anneke began to turn pale a sign of weakness that singular as it may appear very sensibly extended itself to most of their attendant negresses mari did not flinch however and when it came to the trial of that sex she and her mistress were the only two who held out in the original resolution of entering some time was thrown away in endeavouring to persuade two or three of her older companions to go in with her but finding it useless with a faint smile miss mordaunt calmly said  well gentlemen mari and myself must compose the female portion of the party i have never seen a lion and would not by any means miss this opportunity we shall find my friends waiting for such portions of us as shall not be eaten on our return  we were now near the door where stood the man who received the money and gave the tickets it happened that dirck had been stopped by a gentleman of his acquaintance who had just left the building and who was laughingly relating some incident that had occurred within i stood on one side of anneke jason on the other while mari was close in the rear  a quarter for each gentleman and the lady said the doorkeeper and a shilling for the wench  on this hint jason to my great surprise for usually he was very backward on such occasions drew out a purse and emptying some silver into his hand he said with a flourish  permit me missit is an honour i covet a quarter for yourself and a shilling for mari  i saw anneke colour and her eye turn hastily towards dirck before i had time to say anything or to do anything in fact she answered steadily  give yourself no trouble mr newcome mr littlepage will do me the favour to obtain tickets for me  jason had the money in his fingers and i passed him and bought the tickets while he was protesting  it gave him pleasurehe was proud of the occasionanother time her brother could do the same for his sisters and he had six and other matters of the sort  i simply placed the tickets in annekes hand who received them with an expression of thanks and we all passed dirck inquiring of his cousin as he came up if he should get her tickets i mention this little incident as showing the tact of woman and will relate all that pertains to it before i proceed to other things anneke said nothing on the subject of her tickets until we had left the booth when she approached me and with that grace and simplicity which a wellbred woman knows how to use on such an occasion and quietly observed  i am under obligations to you mr littlepage for having paid for my ticketsthey cost three shillings i believe  i bowed and had the pleasure of almost touching miss mordaunts beautiful little hand as she gave me the money at this instant a jerk at my elbow came near causing me to drop the silver it was jason who had taken this liberty and who now led me aside with a earnestness of manner it was not usual for him to exhibit i saw by the portentous look of the pedagogues countenance and his swelling manner that something extraordinary was on his mind and waited with some little curiosity to learn what it might be  why what in human natur corny do you mean he cried almost angrily did ever mortal man hear of a gentlemans making a lady pay for a treat do you know you have made miss anneke pay for a treat  a treat mr newcome  yes a treat mr corny littlepage how often do you think young ladies will accompany you to shows and balls and other sights if you make them pay  then a laugh of derision added emphasis to jasons words  paycould i presume to think miss mordaunt would suffer me to pay money for her or for her servant  you almost make me think you a natral young men always pay for young women and no questions asked did you not remark how smartly i offered to pay for this miss and how well she took it until you stepped forward and cut me outi bore it for it saved me three ninepences  i observed how miss mordaunt shrunk from the familiarity of being called miss and how unwilling she was to let you buy the tickets and that i suspect was solely because she saw you had some notion of what you call a treat  i cannot enter into the philosophy of the thing but certainly nothing is more vulgar in english to address a young lady as miss without affixing a name whereas i know it is the height of breeding to say mademoiselle in french and am told the spaniards italians and germans use its synonyme in the same manner i had been indignant at jasons familiarity when he called annekethe pretty annekemiss and felt glad of an occasion to let him understand how i felt on the subject  what a child you be ater all corny exclaimed the pedagogue who was much too goodnatured to take offence at a trifle you a bachelor of arts but this matter must be set right if it be only for the honour of my school folksjason never blundered on the words one or people in this sensefolks may think that you have been in the school since it has been under my care and i wouldnt for the world have it get abroad that a youth from my school had neglected to treat a lady under such circumstances  conceiving it useless to remonstrate with me any further jason proceeded forthwith to anneke with whom he begged permission to say a word in private so eager was my companion to wipe out the stain and so surprised was the young lady who gently declined moving more than a step that the conference took place immediately under my observation neither of the parties being aware that i necessarily heard or saw all that passed  you must excuse corny miss jason commenced producing his purse again and beginning to hunt anew for a quarter and a shilling he is quite young and knows nawthin worth speaking of of the ways of mankind ah here is just the moneythree ninepennies or three york shillings here miss excuse corny and overlook it all when he is older he will not make such blunders  i am not certain that i understand you sir exclaimed anneke who had shrunk back a little at the miss and who now saw jason hold out the silver with a surprise she took no pains to conceal  this is the price of the ticketsyes thats all nawthin else on honour corny you remember was so awful dumb as to let you pay just as if you had been a gentleman  anneke now smiled and glancing at me at the same instant a bright blush suffused her face though the meaning of my eye as i could easily see strongly tempted her to laugh  it is very well as it is mr newcome though i feel much indebted to your liberal intentions she said turning to rejoin her friends it is customary in new york for ladies to pay themselves for everything of this nature when i go to connecticut i shall feel infinitely indebted to you for another such offer  jason did not know what to make of it he long after insisted that the young lady was huffed as he called it and that she had refused to take the money merely because she was thus offended  there is a manner you know corny he said of doing even a genteel thing and that is to do it genteelly i much doubt if a genteel thing can be done ungenteelly one thing im thankful for and that is that she dont know that you ever were at the seminarian institute in your life such being the appellation jason had given to that which mr worden had simply called a boys school to return to the booth  the lion had many visitors and we had some difficulty in finding places as a matter of course anneke was put in front most of the men who were in the booth giving way to her with respectful attention unfortunately the young lady wore an exceedingly pretty shawl in which scarlet was a predominant colour and that which occurred has been attributed to this circumstance though i am far from affirming such to have been literally the case anneke from the first manifested no fear but the circle pressing on her from without she got so near the cage that the beast thrust a paw through and actually caught hold of the shawl drawing the alarmed girl quite up to the bars i was at annekes side and with a presence of mind that now surprises me i succeeded in throwing the shawl from the precious creatures shoulders and of fairly lifting her from the ground and setting her down again at a safe distance from the beast all this passed so soon that half the persons present were unconscious of what had occurred until it was all over and what astonishes me most is that i do not retain the least recollection of the pleasure i ought to have felt while my arm encircled anneke mordaunts slender waist and while she was altogether supported by me the keeper interfered immediately and the lion relinquished the shawl looking like a disappointed beast when he found it did not contain its beautiful owner  anneke was rescued before she had time fully to comprehend the danger she had been in even dirck could not advance to her aid though he saw and comprehended the imminent risk ran by the being he loved best in the world but dirck was always so slow i must do jason the credit to say that he behaved well though so situated as to be of no real use he rushed forward to assist anneke and remained to draw away the shawl as soon as the keeper had succeeded in making the lion relinquish his hold but all this passed so rapidly as to give little opportunity for noting incidents  anneke was certainly well frightened by this adventure with the lion as was apparent by her changing colour and a few tears that succeeded still a glass of water and a minute or two seated in a chair were sufficient to restore her selfcomposure and she remained with us for half an hour examining and admiring her terrible assailant  and here let me add for the benefit of those who have never had an opportunity of seeing the king of beasts that he is a sight well worthy to behold i have never viewed an elephant which travelled gentlemen tell me is a still more extraordinary animal though i find it difficult to imagine anything finer in its way than the lion which came so near injuring sweet anne mordaunt i question if any of us were aware of the full extent of the danger she ran until we began to reflect on it coolly after time and leisure were afforded as soon as the commotion naturally produced at first had subsided the incident seemed forgotten and we left the booth after a long visit expatiating on the animal and its character apparently in forgetfulness of that which by one blow of his powerful paw the lion might have rendered fatal to one of the very sweetest and happiest innocents of the whole province but for the timely and merciful interposition of a kind providence  after the little affair of the tickets i walked on with anneke who declared her intention of quitting the field her escape beginning to affect her spirits and she was afraid that some particularly kind friend might carry an exaggerated account of what had happened to her father dirck offered to accompany her home for mr mordaunt kept no carriage or at least nothing that was habitually used as a town equipage we had all gone as far as the verge of the common with anneke when the sweet girl stopped looked at me earnestly and while her colour changed and tears rose to her eyes she said  mr littlepage i am just getting to be fully conscious of what i owe to you the thing passed so suddenly and i was so much alarmed that i did not know how to express myself at the time nor am i certain that i do now believe me notwithstanding that i never can forget this morning and i beg of you if you have a sister to carry to her the proffered friendship of anneke mordaunt and tell her that her own prayers in behalf of her brother will not be more sincere than mine  before i could recollect myself so as to make a suitable answer anneke had curtsied and walked away with her handkerchief to her eyes     chapter vi    nay be brief   i see into thy end and am almost   a man already    cymbeline   as dirck accompanied miss mordaunt to her fathers house in crown street 10 i took an occasion to give jason the slip being in no humour to listen to his lectures on the proprieties of life and left the pinkster field as fast as i could notwithstanding the size and importance of new york a holiday like this could not fail to draw great crowds of persons to witness the sports in 1757 james de lancey was at the head of the government of the province as indeed he had been in effect for much of his life and i remember to have met his chariot carrying the younger children of the family to the field on my way into the town as the day advanced carriages of one sort and another made their appearance in broadway principally conveying the children of their different owners all these belonged to people of the first mark and i saw the ship that denotes the arms of livingston the lance of the de lanceys the burning castle of the morrises and other armorial bearings that were well known in the province carriages certainly were not as common in 1757 as they have since become but most of our distinguished people rode in their coaches chariots or phaetons or conveyances of some sort or other when there was occasion to go so far out of town as the common which is the site of the present park the roads on the island of manhattan were very pretty and picturesque winding among rocks and through valleys being lined with groves and copses in a way to render all the drives rural and retired here and there one came to a countryhouse the residence of some person of importance which by its comfort and snugness gave all the indications of wealth and of a prudent taste mr speaker nicoll had 11 occupied a dwelling of this sort for a long series of years that was about a league from town and which is still standing as i pass it constantly in travelling between satanstoe and york i never saw the patentee myself as he died long before my birth but his house near town still stands as i have said a memorial of past ages  the whole town seemed alive and everybody had a desire to get a glance at the sports of the pinkster field though the more dignified and cultivated had selfdenial enough to keep aloof since it would hardly have comported with their years and stations to be seen in such a place the war had brought many regiments into the province however and i met at least twenty young officers strolling out to the scene of amusement as i walked into town i will confess i gazed at these youths with admiration and not entirely without envy as they passed me in pairs laughing and diverting themselves with the grotesque groups of blacks that were occasionally met coming in from their sports these young men i knew had enjoyed the advantages of being educated at home some of them quite likely in the universities and all of them amid the high civilization and taste of england i say all of them too hastily as there were young men of the colonies among them who probably had not enjoyed these advantages the easy air selfpossession and quiet what shall i call itinsolence would be too strong a word and a term that i the son and grandson of old kings officers would not like to apply and yet it comes nearest to what i mean as applicable to the covert manner of these young menbut whatever it was that peculiar air of metropolitan superiority over provincial ignorance and provincial dependence which certainly distinguished all the younger men of this class had an effect on me i find it difficult to describe i was a loyal subject loved the kingmost particularly since he was so identified with the protestant successionloved all of the bloodroyal and wished for nothing more than the honour and lustre of the english crown one thus disposed could not but feel amicably towards the kings officers yet i will confess there were moments when this air of illconcealed superiority this manner that so much resembled that of the master towards the servant the superior to the dependent the patron to the client gave me deep offence and feelings so bitter that i was obliged to struggle hard to suppress them but this is anticipating and is interrupting the course of my narrative i am inclined to think there must always be a good deal of this feeling where the relation of principal and dependant exists as between distinct territories  i was a good deal excited and a little fatigued with the walk and the incidents of the morning and determined to proceed at once to duke street and share the cold dinner of my aunt for few private families in york that depended on regular cooks for their food had anything served warm on their tables for that and the two succeeding days here and there a white substitute was found it is true and we had the benefit of such an assistant at halfpast one it was the english servant of a col mosely an officer of the army who was intimate at my uncles and who had had the civility to offer a man for this occasion i afterwards ascertained that many officers manifested the same kind spirit towards various other families in which they visited on terms of friendship  marriages between young english officers and our pretty delicate york belles were of frequent occurrence and i had felt a twinge or two on the subject of anneke that morning as i passed the youths of the 55th 60th or loyal americans 17th and other regiments that were then in the province  my aunt was descending from the drawingroom in dinner dressfor that no lady ever neglects even though she dines on a cold dumpling as i opened the streetdoor mrs legge was not coming down alone to take her seat at table but having some extra duty to perform in consequence of the absence of most of her household she was engaged in that service seeing me however she stopped on the landing of the stains and beckoned me to approach  corny she said what have you been doing my child to have drawn this honour upon you  honouri am ignorant of having even received any what can you mean my dear aunt  here is herman mordaunt waiting to see you in the drawingroom he asked particularly for youwishes to see youexpresses his regrets that you are not in and talks only of you   in which case i ought to hasten up stairs in order to receive him as soon as possible i will tell you all about it at dinner auntexcuse me now  away i went with a beating heart to receive a visit from annekes father i can scarcely give a reason why this gentleman was usually called when he was spoken of and sometimes when he was spoken to herman mordaunt unless indeed it were that being in part of dutch extraction the name which denoted the circumstance hermanuspronounced by the hollanders hermaanus was used by a portion of the population in token of the fact and adopted by others in pure compliance but herman mordaunt was he usually styled and this too in the way of respect and not as coarseminded persons affect to speak of their superiors or in a way to boast of their own familiarity i should have thought it an honour at my time of life to receive a visit from herman mordaunt but my heart fairly beat as i have said as i went hastily up stairs to meet annekes father  my uncle was not in and i found my visitor waiting for me alone in the drawingroom aware of the state of the family and of all families indeed during pinkster he had insisted on my aunts quitting him while he looked over some new books that had recently been received from home among which was a new and very handsome edition of the spectator a work that enjoys a just celebrity throughout the colonies  mr mordaunt advanced to receive me with studied politeness yet a warmth that could not well be counterfeited the instant i approached nevertheless his manner was easy and natural and to me he appeared to be the highestbred man i had ever seen  i am thankful that the debt of gratitude i owe you my young friend he said at once and without preface of any sort unless that of manner be so received is due to the son of a gentleman i so much esteem as evans littlepage a loyal subject an honest man and a wellconnected and welldescended gentleman like him may well be the parent of a brave youth who does not hesitate to face even lions in defence of the weaker sex  i cannot affect to misunderstand you sir i answered and i sincerely congratulate you that matters are no worse though you greatly overrate the danger i doubt if even a lion would have the heart to hurt miss mordaunt were she in his power  i think this was a very pretty speech for a youth of twenty and i confess i look back upon it even now with complacency if i occasionally betray weakness of this character i beg the reader to recollect that i am acting in the part of an honest historian and that it is my aim to conceal nothing that ought to be known  herman mordaunt did not resume his seat on account of the lateness of the hour halfpast one but he made me professions of friendship and named friday the first moment when he could command the services of his domestics when i should dine with him the army had introduced later hours than was usual and this invitation was given for three oclock it being said at the time as i well remember that persons of fashion in london sat down to table even later than this after remaining with me five minutes herman mordaunt took his leave of course i accompanied him to the door where we parted with many bows  at dinner i told my uncle and aunt all that had occurred and was glad to hear them both speak so favourably of my new acquaintances  herman mordaunt might be a much more considerable man than he is observed my uncle were he disposed to enter into public life he has talents a good education a very handsome estate and is wellconnected in the colony certainly some say at home also  and anneke is a sweet young thing added my aunt and since corny was to assist any young lady i am heartily glad it was anneke she is an excellent creature and her mother was one of my most intimate friends as she was of my sister littlepage too you must go and inquire after her health this evening corny such an attention is due after what has passed all round  did i wish to comply with this advice out of all question and yet i was too young and too little at my ease to undertake this ceremony without many misgivings luckily dirck came in in the evening and my aunt repeating her opinion before my friend he at once declared it was altogether proper and that he thought anneke would have a right to expect it as he offered to be my companion we were soon on our way to crown street in which mr mordaunt owned and inhabited a very excellent house we were admitted by mr mordaunt himself not one of his blacks having yet returned from the pinkster field  dirck appeared to be on the best terms not only with herman mordaunt but with his charming daughter i had observed that the latter always called him cousin dirck and i hardly knew whether to interpret this as a sign of particular or of family regard that dirck was fonder of anneke mordaunt than of any other human being i could easily see and i confess that the discovery already began to cause uneasiness i loved dirck and wished he loved any one else but the very being i feared he did  herman mordaunt showed me the way up the noble wide mahoganygarnished staircase of his dwelling and ushered us into a very handsome though not very large but welllighted drawingroom there sat anneke his daughter in the loveliness of her maiden charms a little more dressed than usual perhaps for she had three or four young and lovely girls with her and five or six young men among whom were no less than three scarlet coats  i shall not attempt to conceal my weakness only twenty inexperienced and unaccustomed to town society i felt awkward and unpleasantly the instant i entered the room nor did the feeling subside during the first halfhour anneke came forward one or two steps to meet me and i could see she was almost as much confused as i was myself she blushed as she thanked me for the service i had rendered and expressed her satisfaction that her father had been fortunate enough to find me at home and had had an opportunity of saying a little of what he felt on the occasion she then invited me to be seated naming me to the company and telling me who two or three of the young ladies were from these last i received sundry approving smiles which i took as so many thanks for serving their friend while i could not help seeing that i was an object of examination to most of the men present the three officers in particular looked at me the most intently and the longest  i trust your little accident which could have been of no great moment in itself since you escaped so well did not have the effect to prevent you from enjoying the rare fun of this pinkster affair said one of the scarlet coats as soon as the movement caused by my reception had subsided  you call it a little accident mr bulstrode returned anneke with a reproachful shake of her pretty head but i can assure you it is not a trifle to a young lady to find herself in the paws of a lion  serious accident then since i see you are resolved to consider yourself a victim rejoined the other but not serious enough i trust to deprive you of the fun  pinkster fields and pinkster frolics are no novelties to us sir as they occur every season and i am just old enough not to have missed one of them all for the last twelve years  we heard you had been out put in another redcoat whom i had heard called billings accompanied by a little army of what bulstrode called the light infantry  here three or four of the other young ladies joined in the discourse at once protesting against mr bulstrodes placing their younger sisters in the army in so cavalier a manner an accusation that mr bulstrode endeavoured to parry by declaring his hopes of having them all not only in the army but in his own regiment one day or other at this there was a certain amount of mirth and various protestations of an unwillingness to enlist in which i was glad to see that neither anneke nor her most intimate friend mary wallace saw fit to join i liked their reserve of manner far better than the girlish trifling of their companions and i could see that all the men respected them the more for it there was a good deal of general and disjointed conversation that succeeded which i shall not pretend to follow or relate but confine myself to such observations as had a bearing on matters that were connected with myself  as none of the young soldiers were addressed by their military titles such things never occurring in the better circles as i now discovered and least of all in those connected with the army i was not able at the time to ascertain the rank of the three redcoats though i afterwards ascertained that the youngest was an ensign of the name of harris a mere boy and the younger son of a member of parliament the next oldest billings was a captain and was said to be a natural son of a nobleman while bulstrode was actually the oldest son of a baronet of three or four thousand a year and had already bought his way up as high as a majority though only fourandtwenty this last was a handsome fellow too nor had i been an hour in his company before i saw plainly enough that he was a strong admirer of anneke mordaunt the other two evidently admired themselves too much to have any very lively feelings on the subject of other persons as for dirck younger than myself and diffident as well as slow by nature he kept himself altogether in the background conversing most of the time with herman mordaunt on the subject of farming  we had been together an hour and i had acquired sufficient ease to change my seat and to look at a picture or two which adorned the walls and which were said to be originals from the old world for to own the truth the art of painting has not made much progress in the colonies we have painters it is true and one or two are said to be men of rare merit the ladies being very fond of sitting to them for their portraits but these are exceptions at a future day when critics shall have immortalized the names of a smybert and a watson and a blackburn the people of these provinces will become aware of the talents they once possessed among them and the grandchildren of those who neglected these men of genius in their dayay their descendants to the latest generationswill revenge the wrongs of merit and talent to the end of civilized time it is a failing of colonies to be diffident of their own opinions but i have heard gentlemen who were educated at home and who possessed cultivated and refined tastes affirm that the painters of europe when visiting this hemisphere have retained all their excellence and have painted as freely and as well under an american as under a european sun as for a sister art the thespian muse had actually made her appearance among us five years before the time of my visit to town in 1757 or in 1752 a theatre having actually been built and opened in nassau street in 1753 with a company under the care of the celebrated hallam and his family this theatre i had been dying to visit while it stood for as yet i had never witnessed a theatrical performance but my mothers injunctions prevented me from entering it while at college when you are old enough corny she used to say you shall have my permission to go as often as is proper but you are now of an age when shakspeare and rowe might unsettle your latin and greek my task of obedience had not been very difficult inasmuch as the building in nassau street the second regular theatre ever erected in british america was taken down and a church erected in its place 12 the comedians went to the islands and had not reappeared on the continent down to the period of which i am now writing nor did their return occur until the following year that they were expected however and that a new house had been built for them in another part of the town i was aware though month after month passed away and the muchexpected company did not appear i had understood however that the large military force collecting in the colony would be likely to bring them back soon and the conversation soon took a turn that proved how much interest the young the gay and the fair felt in the result i was still looking at a picture when mr bulstrode approached me and entered into conversation it will be remembered that this gentleman was four years my senior that he had been at one of the universities was the heir to a baronetcy knew the world had risen to a majority in the army and was by nature as well as training agreeable when he had a mind to be and genteel these circumstances i could not but feel gave him a vast advantage over me and i heartily wished that we stood anywhere but in the presence of anneke mordaunt as he thus saw fit to single me out for invidious comparison by a sort of têteàtête or aside still i could not complain of his manner which was both polite and respectful though i could scarce divest myself of the idea that he was covertly amusing himself the whole time  you are a fortunate man mr littlepage he commenced in having had it in your power to do so important a service to miss mordaunt we all envy you your luck while we admire your spirit and i feel certain the men of our regiment will take some proper notice of it miss anneke is in possession of half our hearts and we should be still more heartless to overlook such a service  i muttered some halfintelligible answer to this compliment and my new acquaintance proceeded  i am almost surprised mr littlepage he added that a man of your spirit does not come among us in times as stirring as these they tell me both your father and grandfather served and that you are quite at your ease you will find a great many men of merit and fashion among us and i make no doubt they would contribute to make your time pass agreeably enough large reinforcements are expected and if you are inclined for a pair of colours i think i know a battalion in which there are a vacancy or two and which will certainly serve in the colonies it would afford me great pleasure to help to further your views should you be disposed to turn them towards the army  now all this was said with an air of great apparent frankness and sincerity which i fancied was only the more visible from the circumstance that anneke was so seated as unavoidably to hear every word of what was said i observed that she even turned her eyes on me as i made my answer though i did not dare so far to observe her in turn as to note their expression  i am very sensible mr bulstrode of the liberality and kindness of your intentions i answered steadily enough for pride came to my assistance though i fear it will not be in my power to profit by it at once if ever my grandfather is still living and he has much influence over me and my fortune and i know it is his wish that i should remain at satanstoe  where demanded bulstrode with more quickness and curiosity than strictly comported with goodbreeding perhaps  satanstoe i do not wonder you smile for it has an odd sound but it is the name my grandfather has given the family place in westchester given i have said though translated would be better as i understand the present appellation is pretty literally rendered into english from the dutch  i like the name exceedingly mr littlepage and i feel certain i should like your good old honest anglosaxon grandfather but pardon me it is his wish you should remain at satansfoot  satanstoe sir we do not aspire to the whole foot it is my grandfathers wish that i remain at home until of age which will not be now for some months  by way of keeping you out of satans footsteps i suppose well these old gentlemen are often right should you alter your views however my dear littlepage do not forget me but remember you can count on one who has some little influence and who will ever be ready to exert it in the behalf of one who has proved so serviceable to miss mordaunt sir harry is a martyr to the gout and talks of letting me stand in his place at the dissolution in that case my wishes will naturally carry more weight i like that name of satanstoe amazingly  i am infinitely obliged to you mr bulstrode though i will confess i have never looked forward to rising in the world by taxing my friends one may own that he has had some hopes founded on merit and honesty  poh pohmy dear littlepage honesty is a very pretty thing to talk about but i suppose you remember what juvenal says on that interesting subjectprobitas laudatur et alget i dare say you are fresh enough from college to remember that comprehensive sentiment  i have never read juvenal mr bulstrode and never wish to if such be the tendency of what he teaches  juvenal was a satirist you know interrupted bulstrode a little hastily for by this time he too had ascertained that anneke was listening and he betrayed some eagerness to get rid of so flagitious a sentiment and satirists speak of things as they are rather than as they ought to be i dare say rome deserved all she got for the moralists give a very sad account of her condition of all the large capitals of which we have any account london is the only town of even tolerable manners  what young bulstrode would have ventured to say next it is out of my power to guess for a certain miss warren who was of the company and who particularly affected the youth luckily called out at this critical instant  your attention one moment if you please mr bulstrode is it true that the gentlemen of the army have been getting the new theatre in preparation and that they intend to favour us with some representations a secret something like this has just leaked out from mr harris who even goes so far as to add that you can tell us all about it  mr harris must be put under an arrest for this though i hear the colonel let the cat out of the bag at the lt governors table as early as last week  i can assure you mr bulstrode anneke observed calmly that i have heard rumours to this effect for quite a fortnight you must not blame mr harris solely for your whole regiment has been hinting to the same purpose far and near  then the delinquent will escape this time i confess the charge we have hired the new theatre and do intend to solicit the honour of the ladies coming to hear me murder cato and scrub a pretty climax of characters you will admit miss mordaunt  i know nothing of scrub though i have read mr addisons play and think you have no need of being ashamed of the character of cato when is the theatre to open  we follow the sable gentry as soon as st pinkster has received his proper share of attention we shall introduce domcato and mr scrub to your acquaintance  all the young ladies but anneke and her friend mary wallace laughed two or three repeating the words st pinkster as if they contained something much cleverer than it was usual to hear a general burst of exclamations expressions of pleasure and of questions and answers followed in which two or three voices were heard at the same moment during which time anneke turned to me who was standing near her at the spot occupied by bulstrode a minute before and seemed anxious to say something  do you seriously think of the army mr littlepage she asked changing colour at the freedom of her own question  in a war like this no one can say when he may be called on to go out i answered but only as a defender of the soil if at all  i thought anneke mordaunt seemed pleased with this answer after a short pause she resumed the dialogue  of course you understand latin mr littlepage although you have not been at the universities  as it is taught in our own colleges miss mordaunt  and that is sufficient to tell me what mr bulstrodes quotation meansif it be proper for me to hear  he would hardly presume to use even a latin saying in your presence that is unfit for your ear the maxim which mr bulstrode attributes to juvenal simply means that honesty is praised and starves  i thought that something like displeasure settled on the fair polished brow of miss mordaunt who i could soon see possessed much character and high principles for one of her tender years she said nothing however though she exchanged a very meaning glance with her friend mary wallace her lips were moved and i fancied i could trace the formation of the sounds honesty is praised and starves  and you are to be cato i hear mr bulstrode cried one of the young ladies who thought more of a scarlet coat i fancy than was for her own good how very charming will you play the character in regimentals or in mohairin a modern or in an ancient dress  in my robe de chambre a little altered for the occasion unless st pinkster and his sports should suggest some more appropriate costume answered the young man lightly  are you quite aware what feast pinkster is asked anneke a little gravely  bulstrode actually changed colour for it had never crossed his mind to inquire into the character of the holiday and to own the truth the manner in which it is kept by the negroes of new york never would enlighten him much on the subject  that is information for which i perceive i am now about to be indebted to miss mordaunt  then you shall not be disappointed mr bulstrode pinkster is neither more nor less than the festival of whitsunday or the feast of pentecost i suppose we shall now hear no more of your saint  bulstrode took this little punishment which was very sweetly but quite steadily uttered with perfect goodhumour and with a manner so rebuked as to prove that anneke possessed great control over him he bowed in submission and she smiled so kindly that i wished the occasion for the little pantomime had not occurred  our ancestors miss mordaunt never heard of any pinkster you will remember and that must explain my ignorance he said meekly  but some of mine have long understood it and observed the festival answered anneke  ay on the side of hollandbut when i presume to speak of our ancestors i mean those which i can claim the honour of boasting as belonging to me in common with yourself  are you and mr bulstrode then related i asked as it might be involuntarily and almost too abruptly  anneke replied however in a way to show that she thought the question natural for the circumstances and not in the least out of place  my grandfathers mother and mr bulstrodes grandfather were brother and sister was the quiet answer  this makes us a sort of cousins according to those dutch notions which he so much despises though i fancy it would not count for much at home  bulstrode protested to the contrary stating that he knew his father valued his relationship to mr mordaunt by the earnest manner in which he had commanded him to cultivate the acquaintance of the family the instant he reached new york i saw by this the footing on which the formidable major was placed in the family everybody seeming to be related to anneke mordaunt but myself i took an occasion that very evening to question the dear girl on the subject of her dutch connections giving her a clue to mine but with all our industry and some assistance from herman mordaunt who took an interest in such a subject as it might be ex officio we could make out no affinity worth mentioning  footnote 10 now liberty street  footnote 11 the person meant here was william nicoll esquire patentee of islip a large estate on long island that is still in the family under a patent granted in 1683 this gentleman was a son of mr secretary nicoll who is supposed to have been a relative of col nicoll the first english governor mr speaker nicoll as the son was called in consequence of having filled that office for nearly a generation was the direct ancestor of the nicolls of islip and shelter island as well as of a branch long settled at stratford connecticut the house alluded to by mr littlepage as a relic of antiquity in his dayamerican antiquity be it rememberedwas standing a few years since if it be not still standing at the point of junction between the old boston road and the new road and nearly opposite to tha termination of the long avenue that led to rosehill originally a seat of the watts the house stood a short distance above the present union square and not far from that of the present gramercy it was or is a brickhouse of one story with a small courtyard in front the house of refuge being at a little distance on its right if still standing it must now be one of the oldest buildings of any sort in a town of 400000 souls as mr speaker nicoll resigned the chair in 1718 this house must be at least a hundred and thirty or forty years old and it may be questioned if a dozen as old public of private can be found on the whole island  as the regular family residences of the nicolls were in suffolk or on their estates it is probable that the abode mentioned was in a measure owing to an intermarriage with the watts as much as to the necessity of the speakers passing so much time at the seat of governmenteditor  footnote 12 the church is now 1845 being converted into a postoffice     chapter vii    sir valentino i care not for her i    i hold him but a fool that will endanger   his body for a girl that loves him not    i claim her not and therefore she is thine    two gentlemen of verona   i saw anne mordaunt several times either in the street or in her own house between that evening and the day i was to dine with her father the morning of the last named day mr bulstrode favoured me with a call and announced that he was to be of the party in crown street and that the whole company was to repair to the theatre to see his own cato and scrub in the evening  by giving yourself the trouble to call at the crown and bible kept hardby here in hanover square or queen street by honest hugh gaine you will find a package of tickets for yourself mr and mrs legge and your relative mr dirck follock as i believe the gentleman is called these dutch have extraordinary patronymics you must admit littlepage  it may appear so to an englishman though our names are quite as odd to strangers but dirck van valkenburgh is not a kinsman of mine though he is related to the mordaunts your relatives  well its all the same i knew he was related to somebody that i know and i fancied it was to yourself i am sure i never see him but i wish he was in our grenadier company  dirck would do honour to any corps but you know how it is with the dutch families mr bulstrode they still retain much of their attachment to holland and do not as often take service in the army or navy as we of english descent  i should have thought a century might have cooled them off a little from their veneration of the meadows of holland it is the opinion at home that new york is a particularly well affected colony  so it is as i hear from all sides as respects the dutch among ourselves i have heard my grandfather say that the reign of king william had a powerful influence in reconciling them to the new government but since his day that they are less loyal than formerly the van valkenburghs notwithstanding pass for as good subjects as any that the house of hanover possesses on no account would i injure them in your opinion  good or bad we shall hope to see your friend who is a connection in some way as you believe of the mordaunts you will get but a faint idea of what one of the royal theatres is littlepage by this representation of ours though it may serve to kill time but i must go to rehearsal we shall meet at three  here my gay and gallant major made his bow and took his leave i proceeded on to the sign of the crown and the bible where i found a large collection of people coming in quest of tickets as the élite of the town would not of themselves form an audience sufficiently large to meet the towering ambition of the players more than half the tickets were sold the money being appropriated to the sick families of soldiersthose who were not entitled to receive aid from government it was deemed a high compliment to receive tickets gratis though all who did made it a point to leave a donation to the fund with mr gaine receiving my package i quitted the shop and it being the hour for the morning promenade i went up wall street to the mall as trinity church walk was even then called here i expected to meet dirck and hoped to see anneke for the place was much frequented by the young and gay both in the mornings and in the evenings the bands of different regiments were stationed in the churchyard and the company was often treated to much fine martial music some few of the more scrupulous objected to this desecration of the churchyard but the army had everything pretty much in its own way as they were supposed to do nothing but what was approved of at home the dissenters were little heeded nor do i think the army would have greatly cared had they been more numerous  i dare say there were fifty young ladies promenading the churchwalk when i reached it and nearly as many young men in attendance on them no small portion of the last being scarletcoats though the mohairs had their representatives there too a few bluejackets were among us also there being two or three kings cruisers in port as no one presumed to promenade the mall who was not of a certain stamp of respectability the company was all gaily dressed and i will confess that i was much struck with the air of the place the first time i showed myself among the gay idlers the impression made on me that morning was so vivid that i will endeavour to describe the scene as it now presents itself to my mind  in the first place there was the noble street quite eighty feet in width in its narrowest part and gradually expanding as you looked towards the bay until it opened into an area of more than twice that width at the place called the bowlinggreen 13 then came the fort crowning a sharp eminence and overlooking everything in that quarter of the town in the rear of the fort or in its front taking a water view lay the batteries that had been built on the rocks which form the southwestern termination of the island over these rocks which were black and picturesque and over the batteries they supported was obtained a view of the noble bay dotted here and there with some speck of a sail or possibly with some vessel anchored on its placid bosom of the two rows of elegant houses most of them of brick and with very few exceptions principally of two stories in height it is scarcely necessary to speak as there are few who have not heard of and formed some notion of broadway a street that all agree is one day to be the pride of the western world  in the other direction i will admit that the view was not so remarkable the houses being principally of wood and of a somewhat ignoble appearance nevertheless the army was said to frequent those habitations quite as much as they did any other in the place after reaching the common or present park where the great boston road led off into the country the view was just the reverse of that which was seen in the opposite quarter here all was inland and rural it is true the new bridewell had been erected in that quarter and there was also a new gaol both facing the common and the kings troops had barracks in their rear but high abrupt conical hills with low marshy land orchards and meadows gave to all that portion of the island a peculiarly novel and somewhat picturesque character many of the hills in that quarter and indeed all over the widest part of the island are now surmounted by countryhouses as some were then including petersfield the ancient abode of the stuyvesants or that farm which by being called after the old dutch governors retreat has given the name of bowery or bouerie to the road that led to it as well as the boweryhouse as it was called the country abode of the then lieutenant governor james de lancey mount bayard a place belonging to that respectable family mount pitt another that was the property of mrs jones the wife of mr justice jones a daughter of james de lancey and various other mounts houses hills and places that are familiar to the gentry and people of new york  but the reader can imagine for himself the effect produced by such a street as broadway reaching very nearly half a mile in length terminating at one end in an elevated commanding fort with its background of batteries rocks and bay and at the other with the common on which troops were now constantly parading the bridewell an i gaol and the novel scene i have just mentioned nor is trinity itself to be forgotten this edifice one of the noblest if not the most noble of its kind in all the colonies with its gothic architecture statues in carved stone and flanking walls was a close accessory of the view giving to the whole grandeur and a moral 14  as has been said i found the mall crowded with young persons of fashion and respectability this mall was near a hundred yards in length and it follows that there must have been a goodly show of youth and beauty the fine weather had commenced spring had fairly opened pinkster blossoms the wild honeysuckle had been seen in abundance throughout the week and everything and person appeared gay and happy  i could discover that my person in this crowd attracted attention as a stranger i say as a stranger for i am unwilling to betray so much vanity as to ascribe the manner in which many eyes followed me to any vain notion that i was known or admired still i will not so far disparage the gifts of a bountiful providence as to leave the impression that my face person or air was particularly disagreeable this would not be the fact and i have now reached a time of life when something like the truth may be told without the imputation of conceit my mother often boasted to her intimates that corny was one of the bestmade handsomest most active and genteelest youths in the colony this i know for such things will leak out but mothers are known to have a remarkable weakness on the subject of their children as i was the sole surviving offspring of my dear mother who was one of the besthearted women that ever breathed it is highly probable that the notions she entertained of her son partook largely of the love she bore me it is true my aunt legge on more than one occasion has been heard to express a very similar opinion though nothing can be more natural than that sisters should think alike on a family matter of this particular nature more especially as my aunt legge never had a child of her own to love and praise  let all this be as it may well stared at was i as i mingled among the idlers on trinity church walk on the occasion named as for myself my own eyes were bent anxiously on the face of every pretty delicate young creature that passed in the hope of seeing anneke i both wished and dreaded to meet her for to own the truth my mind was dwelling on her beauty her conversation her sentiments her grace her gentleness and withal her spirit a good deal more than half the time i had some qualms on the subject of dirck i will confess but dirck was so young that his feelings could not be much interested after all and then anneke was a second cousin and that was clearly too near to marry my grandfather had always put his foot down firmly against any connection between relations that were nearer than third cousins and i now saw how proper were his reasons if they were even farther removed so much the better he said and so much the better it was  if the reader should ask me why i dreaded to meet anne mordaunt under such circumstances i might be at a loss to give him a very intelligible answer i feared even to see the sweet face i sought and oh how soft serene and angellike it was at that budding age of seventeenbut though i almost feared to see it when at last i saw her i had so anxiously sought approaching me arm and arm with mary walface having bulstrode next herself and harris next her friend my eyes were instantly averted as if they had unexpectedly lighted on something disagreeable i should have passed without even the compliment of a bow had not my friends been more at their ease and more accustomed to the free ways of town life than i happened to be myself  hows this cornelius coeur de lion exclaimed bulstrode stopping thus causing the whole party to stop with him or to appear to wish to avoid me will you not recognise us though it is not an hour since you and i parted i hope you found the tickets and when you have answered yes i hope you will turn and do me the honour to bow to these ladies  i apologized i am afraid i blushed for i detected anneke looking at me as i thought with some little concern as if she pitied my awkward country embarrassment as for bulstrode i did not understand him at that time it exceeding my observation to be certain whether he considered me of sufficient importance or not to feel any concern on my account in his very obvious suit with anneke nevertheless as he treated me with cordiality and respect while he dealt with me so frankly there was not room to take offence of course i turned and walked back with the party after had properly saluted the ladies and mr harris  coeur de lion is a better name for a soldier than for a civilian said anneke as we moved forward and however much mr littlepage may deserve the title i am not certain mr bulstrode he would not prefer leaving it among you gentlemen who serve the king  i am glad of this occasion mr littlepage to enlist you on my side in a warfare i am compelled to wage with miss anne mordaunt said the major gaily it is on the subject of the great merit of us poor fellows who have crossed the wide atlantic in order to protect the colonies new york among the number and their people miss mordaunt and miss wallace inclusively from the grasp of their wicked enemies the french the former young lady has a way of reasoning on the matter to which i cannot assent and i am willing to choose you as arbitrator between us  before mr littlepage accept the office it is proper he should know its duties and responsibilities said anneke smiling in the first place he will find mr bulstrode with loud professions of attachment to the colonies much disposed to think them provinces that owe their very existence to england while i maintain it is english men and that it is not england that have done so much in america as for new york mr littlepage and especially as for you and me we can also say a word in favour of holland i am very proud of my dutch connections and dutch descent  i was much gratified with the as for you and me though i believe i cared less for holland than she did herself i made an answer much in the vein of the moment but the conversation soon changed to the subject of the military theatre that was about to open  i shall dread you as a critic cousin annie so bulstrode often termed anneke as i soon discovered i find you are not too well disposed to us of the cockade and i think you have a particular spite to our regiment i know that billings and harris too hold you in the greatest possible dread  they then feel apprehensive of a very ignorant critic for i never was present at a theatrical entertainment in my life anneke answered with perfect simplicity so far as i can learn there never has been but one season of any regular company in this colony and that was when i was a very little and a very young girlas i am now neither very large nor very old as a young woman  you see littlepage with how much address my cousin avoids adding and very uninteresting and very ugly and very disagreeable and very much unsought and fifty other things she might add with such perfect truth and modesty but is it true that the theatre was open only one season here  so my father tells me though i know very little of the facts themselves tonight will be my first appearance in front of any stage mr bulstrode as i understand it will be your first appearance on it  in one sense the last will be true though not altogether in another as a schoolboy i have often played schoolboy fashion but this is quite a new thing with us to be amateur players  it may seem ungrateful when you are making so many efforts principally to amuse us young ladies i feel convinced to inquire if it be quite as wise as it is novel i must ask this as a cousin you know henry bulstrode to escape entirely from the imputation of impertinence  really anneke mordaunt i am not absolutely certain that it is our manners are beginning to change in this respect however and i can assure you that various noblemen have permitted sports of this sort at their seats the custom is french as you probably know and whatever is french has much vogue with us during times of peace sir harry does not altogether approve of it and as for my lady mother she has actually dropped more than one discouraging hint on the subject in her letters  the certain proof that you are a most dutiful son perhaps when sir harry and lady bulstrode learn your great success however they will overlook the field on which your laurels have been won but our hour has come mary we have barely time to thank these gentlemen for their politeness and to return in season to dress i am to enact a part myself at dinner as i hope you will all remember  saying this anneke made her curtsies in a way to preclude any offer of seeing her home and went her way with her silent but sensiblelooking and pretty friend bulstrode took my arm with an air of easy superiority and led the way towards his own lodgings which happened to be in duke street harris joined another party making it a point to be always late at dinner  that is not only one of the handsomest but she is one of the most charming girls in the colonies littlepage my companion exclaimed as soon as we had departed speaking at the same time with an earnestness and feeling i was far from expecting were she in england she would make one of the first women in it by the aid of a little fashion and training and very little would do too for there is a charm in her naiveté that is worth the art of fifty women of fashion  fashion is a thing that any one may want who does not happen to be in vogue i answered notwithstanding the great degree of surprise i felt as for training i can see nothing but perfection in miss mordaunt as she is and should deprecate the lessons that produced any change  i believe it was now bulstrodes turn to feel surprise for i was conscious of his casting a keen look into my face though i did not like to return it my companion was silent for a minute then without again adverting to anneke he began to converse very sensibly on the subject of theatres and plays i was both amused and instructed for mr bulstrode was an educated and a clever man and a strange feeling came over the spirit of my dream even then as i listened to his conversation this man i thought admires anne mordaunt and he will probably carry her with him to england and obtain for her that fashion and training of which he has just spoken with his advantages of birth air fortune education and military rank he can scarcely fail in his suit should he seriously attempt one and it will be no more than prudent to command my own feelings lest i become the hopeless victim of a serious passion young as i was all this i saw and thus i reasoned and when i parted from my companion i fancied myself a much wise man than when we had met we separated in duke street with a promise on my part to call at the majors lodgings half an hour later after dressing and walk with him to herman mordaunts door  it is fortunate that it is the fashion of new york to walk to a dinner party said bulstrode as he again took my arm on our way to crown street for these narrow streets must be excessively inconvenient for chariots though i occasionally see one of them as for sedan chairs i detest them as things unfit for a man to ride in  many of our leading families keep carnages and they seem to get along well enough i answered nevertheless it is quite in fashion even for ladies to walk i understand that many perhaps most of your auditors will walk to the playhouse door this evening  they tell me as much said bulstrode curling his lip a little in a way i did not exactly like notwithstanding there will be many charming creatures among them and they shall be welcome well littlepage i do not despair of having you among us for to be candid without wishing to boast i think you will find the th as liberal a set of young men as there is in the service there is a wish to have the mohairs among us instead of shutting ourselves up altogether in scarlet then your father and grandfather have both served and that will be a famous introduction  i protested my unfitness for such an amusement never having seen such an exhibition in my life but to this my companion would not listen and we picked our way as well as we could through william street up wall and then by nassau into crown herman mordaunt owning a new house that stood not far from broadway in the latter street this was rather in a remote part of the town but the situation had the advantage of good air and as a place extends it is necessary some persons should live on its skirts  i wish my good cousin did not live quite so much in the suburbs said bulstrode as he knocked in a very patrician manner it is not altogether convenient to go quite so much out of ones ordinary haunts in order to pay visits i wonder mr mordaunt came so far out of the world to build  yet the distances of london must be much greater though there you have coaches  true but not a word more on this subject i would not have anneke fancy i ever find it far to visit her  we were the last but one the tardy mr harris making it a point always to be the last we found anneke mordaunt supported by two or three ladies of her connection and a party of quite a dozen assembled as most of those present saw each other every day and frequently two or three times a day the salutations and compliments were soon over and herman mordaunt began to look about him to see who was wanting  i believe everybody is here but mr harris the father observed to his daughter interrupting some of mr bulstrodes conversation to let this fact be known shall we wait for him my dear he is usually so uncertain and late  yet a very important man put in bulstrode as being entitled to lead the lady of the house to the table in virtue of his birthright so much for being the fourth son of an irish baron do you know harriss father has just been ennobled  this was news to the company and it evidently much increased the doubts of the propriety of sitting down without the young man in question  failing of this son of a new irish baron i suppose you fancy i shall be obliged to give my hand to the eldest son of an english baronet said anneke smiling so as to take off the edge of a little irony that i fancy just glimmered in her manner  i wish to heaven you would anne mordaunt whispered bulstrode loud enough for me to hear him so that the heart were its companion  i thought this both bold and decided and i looked anxiously at anneke to note the effect but she evidently received it as trifling certainly betraying no emotion at a speech i thought so pointed i wished she had manifested a little resentment then she was so very young to be thus importuned  dinner had better be served sir she calmly observed to her father mr harris is apt to think himself illtreated if he do not find everybody at table it would be a sign his watch was wrong and that he had come half an hour too soon  herman mordaunt nodded assent and left his daughters side to give the necessary order  i fancy harris will regret this said bulstrode i wish i dared repeat what he had the temerity to say to me on this very subject no later than yesterday  of the propriety of so doing mr bulstrode must judge for himself though repetitions of this nature are usually best avoided  no the fellow deserves it so i will just tell you and mr littlepage in confidence you must know as his senior in years and his senior officer in the bargain i was hinting to harris the inexpediency of always being so late at dinner and here is my gentlemans answeryou know said he that excepting my lord loudon the commanderinchief the governor and a few public officers i shall now take precedence of almost every man here and i find if i go early to dinner i shall have to hand in all the elderly ladies and to take my place at their sides whereas if i go a little late i can steal in alongside of their daughters now on the present occasion he will be altogether a loser the lady of the house not yet being quite fifty  i had not given mr harris credit for so much ingenuity said anneke quietly but here he is to claim his rights  ay the fellow has remembered your age and quite likely your attractions  dinner was announced at that instant and all eyes were turned on harris in expectation that he would advance to lead anneke down stairs the young man even more youthful than myself had a good deal of mauvaise honte for though the son of an irish peer of two months creation the family was not strictly irish and he had very little ambition to figure in this manner from what i saw of him subsequently i do believe that nothing but a sense of duty to his order made him respect these privileges of rank at all and that he would really just as soon go to a dinnertable last as first in the present case however he was soon relieved by herman mordaunt who had been educated at home and understood the usages of the world very well  gentlemen he said i must ask you to waive the privileges of rank in favour of mr cornelius littlepage today this good company has met to do honour especially to his courage and devotion to his fellowcreatures and he will do me the favour to hand miss mordaunt down stairs  herman mordaunt then pointed out to the hon mr harris the next lady of importance and to mr bulstrode a third after which all the rest took care of themselves as for myself i felt my face in a glow at this unexpected order and scarcely dared to look at anneke as we led the way to the diningroom door so much abashed was i that i scarce touched the tips of her slender little fingers and a tremour was in the limb that performed this office the whole time it was thus employed of course my seat was next to that of the young and lovely mistress of the house at this banquet  what shall i say of the dinner it was the very first entertainment of the sort at which i had ever been present though i had acquired some of the notions of town habits on such occasions at my aunt legges table to my surprise there was soup a dish that i never saw at satanstoe except in the most familiar way while here it was taken by every one seemingly as a matter of course everything was elegant and admirably cooked abundance however was the great feature of the feast as i have heard it said is apt to be the case with most new york entertainments nevertheless i have always understood that in the way of eating and drinking the american colonies have little reason to be ashamed  could i have foreseen this dinner miss mordaunt i said when everybody was employed and i thought there was an opening to say something to my beautiful neighbour it would have made my father very happy to have sent a sheepshead to town for the occasion  anneke thanked me and then we began to converse about the game westchester was and is still famous for partridges snipe quails ducks and meadowlarks and i understood expatiating on such a subject as well as the best of them all the littlepages were shots and i have known my father bag ten brace of woodcock among the wet thickets of satanstoe of a morning and this with merely a second class dog and only one both bulstrode and harris listened to what i said on this subject with great attention and it would soon have been the engrossing discourse had not anneke pleasantly said  all very well gentlemen but you will remember that neither miss wallace nor i shoot  except with the arrows of cupid answered bulstrode gaily with these you do so much execution between you emphasizing the words so as to make me look foolish for i sat between them that you ought to be condemned to hear nothing but fowling conversation for the next year  this produced a laugh a little at my expense i believe though i could see that anneke blushed while mary wallace smiled indifferently but as the healths now began there was a truce to trifling and a serious thing it is to drink to everybody by name at a large table serious i mean to a new beginner yet herman mordaunt went through it with a grace and dignity that i think would have been remarked at a royal banquet the ladies acquitted themselves admirably omitting no one and even harris felt the necessity of being particular with this indispensable part of goodbreeding so well done was this part of the ceremony that i declare i believe everybody had drunk to everybody within five minutes after herman mordaunt commenced and it was very apparent that there was more ease and true gaiety after all had got through than there had previously been  but the happy period of every dinnerparty is after the cloth is removed with the dark polished mahogany for a background the sparkling decanters making their rounds the fruit and cake baskets the very scene seems to inspire one with a wish for gaiety herman mordaunt called for toasts as soon as the cloth disappeared with a view i believe of putting everybody at ease and to render the conversation more general he was desired to set the example and immediately gave miss markham who as i was told was a single lady of forty with whom he had carried on a little flirtation annekes turn came next and she chose to give a sentiment notwithstanding all bulstrodes remonstrances who insisted on a gentleman he did not succeed however anneke very steadily gave the thespian corps of the h may it prove as successful in the arts of peace as in its military character it has often proved itself to be in the art of war much applause followed this toast and harris was persuaded by bulstrode to stand up and say a few words for the credit of the regiment such a speechit reminded me of the horse that was advertised as a show in london about this time and which was said to have its tail where its head ought to be but bulstrode clapped his hands and cried hear at every other word protesting that the regiment was honoured as much in the thanks as in the sentiment harris did not seem displeased with his own effort and presuming on his rank he drank without being called on to the fair of new york eminent alike for beauty and wit may they only become as merciful as they are victorious  bravo again cried bulstrodeharris is fairly inspired and is growing better and better had he said imminent instead of eminent it would be more accurate as their frowns are as threatening as their smiles are bewitching  is that to pass for your sentiment mr bulstrode and are we to drink it demanded herman mordaunt  by no means sir i have the honour to give lady dolly merton  who lady dolly was nobody knew i believe though we of the colonies always drank a titled person who was known to be at home with a great deal of respectful attention not to say veneration other toasts followed and then the ladies were asked to sing anneke complied with very little urging as became her position and never did i hear sweeter strains than those she poured forth the air was simple but melody itself and the sentiment had just enough of the engrossing feeling of woman in it to render it interesting without in the slightest degree impairing its fitness for the virgin lips from which it issued bulstrode i could see was almost entranced and i heard him murmur an angel by heavens he sang himself a love song full of delicacy and feeling and in a way to show that he had paid much attention to the art of music harris sang too as did mary wallace the former much as he spoke the last plaintively and decidedly well even herman mordaunt gave us a strain and my turn followed singing was somewhat of a forte with me and i have reason to think i made out quite as well as the best of them i know that anneke seemed pleased and i saw tears in her eyes as i concluded a song that was intended to produce just such an effect  at length the youthful mistress of the house arose reminding her father that he had at table the principal performer of the evening by way of a caution when three or four of us handed the ladies to the drawingroom door instead of returning to the table i entered the room and bulstrode did the same under the plea of its being necessary for him to drink no more on account of the work before him  footnote 13 mr cornelius littlepage betrays not a little of provincial admiration as the reader will see i have not thought it necessary to prune these passages their causes being too familiar to leave any danger of their insertions being misunderstood admiration of broadway certainly not more than a thirdclass street as streets go in the old world is so very common among us as to need no apologyeditor  footnote 14 the provincial admiration of mr cornelius littlepage was not quite as much in fault as respects the church as the superciliousness of our more modern tastes and opinions may lead us to suspect the church that was burned in 1776 was a larger edifice than that just pulled down and in many respects was its superioreditor     chapter viii    odds bodikins man much better use   every man after his desert and who shall scape   whipping use them after your own honour   and dignity the less they deserve the more   merit is in your bounty    hamlet   harris will be hors de combat bulstrode soon observed unless i can manage to get him from the tableyou know he is to play marcia this evening and though a little wine will give him fire and spirit for the part too much will impair its feminine beauties addison never intended that the virtuous marcia in towering above her sex was to be picked out of a kennel or from under a table harris is a true irish peer when claret is concerned  all the ladies held up their hands and protested against mr harris being permitted to act a travestie on their sex as yet no one had known how the characters were to be cast beyond the fact that bulstrode himself was to play cato for great care had been taken to keep the bills of the night from being seen in order that the audience might have the satisfaction of finding out who was who for themselves at the close of each piece a bill was to be sent round among the favoured few telling the truth as anneke declared that her father never locked in his guests and had faithfully promised to bring up everybody for coffee in the course of half an hour it was determined to let things take their own way  sure enough at the end of the time mentioned herman mordaunt appeared with all the men from the table harris was not tipsy as i found was very apt to be the case with him after dinner but neither was he sober according to bulstrodes notion he may have had just fire enough to play the virtuous marcia in a few minutes he hurried the ensign off declaring that like hamlets ghost their hour had come at seven the whole party left the house in a body to walk to the theatre herman mordaunt did not keep a proper town equipage and if he had it would not have contained a fourth of our company in this however we were not singular as nine in ten of the audience that night i mean nine in ten of the gentle sex went to the theatre on foot  instead of going directly down crown street into maiden lane which would have been the nearest way to the theatre we went out into broadway and round by wall street the walking being better and the gutters farther from the ladies the centre of the street being at no great distance from the houses in the narrower passages of the town we found a great many welldressed people moving in the same direction with ourselves herman mordaunt remarked that he had never before seen so many hoops cardinals cocked hats and swords in the streets at once as he saw that evening all the carriages in town rolled past us as we went down wall street and by the time we reached william street the pavements resembled a procession more than anything else as every one was in full dress the effect was pleasing and the evening being fine most of the gentlemen carried their hats in their hands in order not to disturb their curls thus giving to the whole the air of a sort of vast drawingroom i never saw a more lovely creature than anneke mordaunt appeared as she led our party on this occasion the powder had got a little out of her fine auburn hair and on the part of the head that was not concealed by a cap that shaded half her beautiful face it seemed as if the rich covering bestowed by nature was about to break out of all restraint and shade her bust with its exuberance her negligée was a rich satin flounced in front while the lace that dropped from her elbows seemed as if woven by fairies expressly for a fairy to wear she had paste buckles in her shoes and i thought i had never beheld such a foot as was occasionally seen peeping from beneath her dress while she walked daintily yet with the grace of a queen at my side i do not thus describe anneke with a view of inducing the reader to fancy her stately and repulsive on the contrary winning ease and natural grace were just as striking in her manner as were beauty and sentiment and feeling in her countenance more than once as we walked side by side did i become painfully conscious how unworthy i was to fill the place i occupied i believe this humility is one of the surest signs of sincere love  at length we reached the theatre and were permitted to enter all the front seats were occupied by blacks principally in new york liveries that is to say with cuffs collars and pocketflaps of a cloth different from the coat though a few were in lace these last belonged to the topping families several of which gave colours and ornaments almost as rich as those that i understand are constantly given at home i well remember that two entire boxes were retained by servants in shoulderknots and much richer dresses than common one of whom belonged to the lt governor and the other to my lord loudon who was then commanderinchief as the company entered these domestics disappeared as is usual and we all took our seats on the benches thus retained for us bulstrodes care was apparent in the manner in which he had provided for anneke and her party which i will take it on myself to say was one of the most striking for youth and good looks that entered the house that evening  great was the curiosity and deep the feeling that prevailed among the younger portion of the audience in particular as party after party was seated that important evening the house was ornamented as a theatre and i thought it vast in extent though herman mordaunt assured me it was no great things in that point of view as compared with most of the playhouses at home but the ornaments and the lights and the curtain the pit the boxes the gallery were all so many objects of intense interest few of us said anything but our eyes wandered over all with a species of delight that i am certain can be felt in a theatre only once annekes sweet face was a picture of youthful expectation an expectation however in which intelligence and discretion had their full share the orchestra was said to have an undue portion of wind instruments in it though i perceived ladies all over the house including those in our own box returning the bows of many of the musicians who i was told were amateurs from the army and the drawingrooms of the town  at length the commanderinchief and the lt governor entered together occupying the same box though two had been provided their attendants having recourse to the second the commotion produced by these arrivals had hardly subsided when the curtain arose and a new world was presented to our view of the playing i shall not venture to say much though to me it seemed perfection bulstrode gained great applause that night and i understand that divers gentlemen who had either been educated at home or who had passed much time there declared that his cato would have done credit to either of the royal theatres his dress appeared to me to be everything it should be though i cannot describe it i remember that syphax wore the uniform of a colonel of dragoons and juba that of a general officer and that there was a good deal of criticism expended and some offence taken because the gentlemen who played these parts came out in wool and with their faces blacked it was said in answer to these feelings that the characters were africans and that any one might see by casting his eyes at the gallery that africans are usually black and that they have woolly hair a sort of proof that i imagine only aggravated the offence 15 apart from this little mistake everything went off well even marcia it is true that some evilinclined person whispered that the virtuous marcia was a little howcameyouso but bulstrode afterwards assured me that his condition helped him along amazingly and that it added a liquid lustre to his eyes that might otherwise have been wanting the highheeled shoes appeared to trouble him but some persons fancied it gave him a pretty tottering in his walk that added very much to the deception on the whole the piece went off surprisingly as i could see by lord loudon and the lt governor both of whom seemed infinitely diverted herman mordaunt smiled once or twice when he ought to have looked grave but this i ascribed to a want of practice of late years in scenic representations he certainly was a man of judgment and must have known the proper moments to exhibit particular emotions  during the interval between the play and the farce the actors came among us to receive the homage they merited and loud were the plaudits that were bestowed on them annekes bright eyes sparkled with pleasure as she admitted without reserve to bulstrode the pleasure she had received and confessed she had formed no idea hitherto of the beauty and power of a theatrical representation aided as was this by the auxiliaries of lights dress and scenery it is true the women had been a little absurd and the virtuous marcia particularly so but the fine sentiments of addison which though as herman mordaunt observed they had all the accuracy and all the stiffness of a pedantic age were sufficiently beautiful and just to cover the delinquencies of the hon mr harris she hoped the afterpiece would be of the same general character that they might all enjoy it as much as they had the play itself  the other young ladies were equally decided in their praise though it struck me that anneke felt the most on the occasion that the major had obtained a great advantage by his efforts i could not but see and the folly of my having any pretensions with one who was courted by such a rival began to impress itself on my imagination with a force i found painful but the bell soon summoned away the gallant actors in order to dress for the farce  the long interval that occurred between the two pieces gave ample opportunity for visiting ones acquaintances and to compare opinions i went to my aunts box and found her well satisfied though less animated than the younger ladies in the expression of her pleasure my uncle was altogether himself goodnatured but not disposed to award any indiscreet amount of praise  pretty well for boys corny he said though the youngster who acted marcia had better been at school i do not know his name but he completely took all the virtue out of marcia he must have studied her character from some of the ladies who follow the camp  my dear uncle how differently you think from all in our box that gentleman is the hon mr harris who is only eighteen and has a pair of colours in the th and is a son of lord ballybannon or ballysomething else and is said to have the softest voice in the army  ay and the softest head too ill answer for it i tell you corny the hon mr ballybilly who is only eighteen and has a pair of colours in the th and the softest voice in the army had better been at school instead of undermining the virtue of the virtuous marcia as he has so obviously done bulstrode did well enough capitally well for an amateur and must be a firstrate fellow by the way janethat was my aunts namethey tell me he is likely to marry that exceedingly pretty daughter of herman mordaunt and make her lady bulstrode one of these days  why not mr leggeanne mordaunt is as sweet a girl as there is in the colony and is very respectably connected they even say the mordaunts are of a high family at home mary wallace told me that herman mordaunt and sir henry bulstrode are themselves related and you know my dear how intimate the mordaunts and the wallaces are  not ii know nothing of their intimacies though i dare say it may be all true mordaunts father was an english gentleman of some family i have always heard though he was as poor as a churchmouse when he married one of our dutch heiresses and as for herman mordaunt himself he proved he had not lost the instinct by marrying another though she did not happen to be dutch here comes anneke to inherit it all and ill answer for it that care is had that she shall marry an heir  well mr bulstrode is an heir and the eldest son of a baronet i am always pleased when one of our girls makes a good connection at home for it does the colony credit it is an excellent thing corny to have our interest well sustained at homeespecially before the privy council they tell me  well i am not answered my uncle i think it more to the credit of the colony for its young women to take up with its young men and its young men with its young women i wish anne mordaunt had been substituted for the hon ballyshannon tonight she would have made a thousand times better virtuous marcia  you surely would not have had a young lady of respectability appear in public in this way mr legge  my uncle said something to this for he seldom let jane get the better of it for want of an answer but as i left the box i did not hear his reply it seemed then to be settled in the minds of most persons that bulstrode was to marry anneke i cannot describe the new shock this opinion gave me but it seemed to make me more fully sensible of the depth of the impression that had been made on myself in the intercourse of a single week the effect was such that i did not return to the party i had left but sought a seat in a distant part of the theatre though one in which i could distinctly see those i had abandoned  the beaux stratagem soon commenced and bulstrode was again seen in the character of scrub those who were most familiar with the stage pronounced his playing to be excellentfar better in the footman than in the roman senator the play itself struck me as being as broad and coarse as could be tolerated but as it had a reputation at home where it had a great name our matrons did not dare to object to it i was glad to see the smiles soon disappear from annekes face however and to discover that she found no pleasure in scenes so unsuited to her sex and years the short quick glances that were exchanged between anneke and mary wallace did not escape me and the manner in which they both rose as soon as the curtain dropped told quite plainly the haste they were in to quit the theatre i reached their boxdoor in time to assist them through the crowd  not a word was said by any of us until we reached the street where two or three of miss mordaunts female friends became loud in the expression of their satisfaction neither anneke nor mary wallace said anything and so well did i understand the nature of their feelings that i made no allusion whatever to the farce as for the others they did but chime in with what appeared to be the common opinion and were to be pitied rather than condemned it was perhaps the more excusable in them to imagine such a play right inasmuch as they must have known it was much extolled at home a fact that gave any custom a certain privilege in the colonies a mother country has much of the same responsibility as a natural mother herself since its opinions and example are apt to be quoted in the one case by the dependant in justification of its own opinions and conduct as it is by the natural offspring in the other  i fancy notwithstanding this sort of responsibility gives the ministers or people of england very little trouble since i never could discover any sensitiveness to their duties on this score we all went in at herman mordaunts after walking to the house as we had walked from it and were made to take a light supper including some delicious chocolate just as we sat down to table bulstrode joined us to receive the praises he had earned and to enjoy his triumph he got a seat directly opposite to mine on annekes left hand and soon began to converse  in the first place he cried you must all admit that tom harris did wonders tonight as miss marcia cato i had my own trouble with the rogue for there is no precedent for a tipsy marcia but we managed to keep him straight and that was the nicest part of my management let me assure you  yes observed herman mordaunt drily i should think keeping tom harris straight after dinner an exploit of no little difficulty but a task that would demand a very judicious management indeed  you were pleased to express your satisfaction with the performance of cato miss mordaunt said bulstrode in a very deferential and solicitous manner but i question if the entertainment gave you as much pleasure  it certainly did not had the representation ended with the first piece i am afraid i should too much regret that we are without a regular stage but the farce will take off much of the keenness of such regrets  i fear i understand you cousin anne and greatly regret that we did not make another choice returned bulstrode with a humility that was not usual in his manner even when addressing anneke mordaunt but i can assure you the play has great vogue at home and the character of scrub in particular has usually been a prodigious favourite i see by your look however that enough has been said but after having done so much to amuse this good company tonight i shall feel authorised to call on every lady present at least for a song as soon as the proper moment arrives perhaps i have a right to add a sentiment and a toast  and songs and toasts and sentiments we had as usual the moment we had done eating it was and indeed is rather more usual to indulge in this innocent gaiety after supper than after dinner with us and that night everybody entered into the feeling of the moment with spirit herman mordaunt gave miss markham as he had done at dinner and this with an air so determined as to prove no one else would ever be got out of him  there is a compact between miss markham and myself to toast each other for the remainder of our lives cried the master of the house laughing and we are each too honest ever to violate it  but miss mordaunt is under no such engagement put in a certain mr benson who had manifested much interest in the beautiful young mistress of the house throughout the day and i trust we shall not be put off by any such excuse from her  it is not in rule to ask two of the same race for toasts in succession answered herman mordaunt there is mr bulstrode dying to give us another english belle  with all my heart said bulstrode gaily this time it shall be lady betty boddington  married or single bulstrode inquired billings as i thought with some little point  no matter which so long as she be a beauty and a toast i believe it is now my privilege to call on a lady and i beg a gentleman from miss wallace  there had been an expression of pained surprise at the trifling between billings and bulstrode in annekes sweet countenance for in the simplicity of our provincial habits we of the colonies did not think it exactly in rule for the single to toast the married or vice versa but the instant her friend was thus called on it changed for a look of gentle concern mary wallace manifested no concern however but gave mr francis fordham  ay frank fordham with all my heart cried herman mordaunt i hope he will return to his native country as straightforward honest and good as he left it  mr fordham is then abroad inquired bulstrode i thought the name new to me  if being at home can be called being abroad he is reading law at the temple  this was the answer of mary wallace who looked as if she felt a friendly interest in the young templar but no more she now called on dirck for his lady throughout the whole of that day dircks voice had hardly been heard a reserve that comported well enough with his youth and established diffidence this appeal however seemed suddenly to arouse all that there was of manhood in him and that was not a little i can tell the reader when there was occasion to use it dircks nature was honesty itself and he felt that the appeal was too direct and the occasion too serious to admit of duplicity he loved but one esteemed but one felt for one only and it was not in his nature to cover his preference by any attempt at deception after colouring to the ears appearing distressed he made an effort and pronounced the name ofanneke mordaunt  a common laugh rewarded this blunder common with all but the fair creature who had extorted this involuntary tribute and myself who knew dircks character too well not to understand how very much he must be in earnest thus to lay bare the most cherished secret of his heart the mirth continued some time herman mordaunt appearing to be particularly pleased and applauding his kinsmans directness with several bravos very distinctly uttered as for anneke i saw she looked touched while she looked concerned and as if she would be glad to have the thing undone  after all dirck much as i admire your spirit and plain dealing boy cried herman mordaunt miss wallace can never let such a toast pass she will insist on having another  ii protest i am well pleased with it and ask for no other exclaimed the lady in question no toast can be more agreeable to me than anneke mordaunt and i particularly like the quarter from which this comes  if friends can be trusted in a matter of this nature put in bulstrode with a little pique mr follock has every reason to be contented had i known however that the customs of new york allowed a lady who is present to be toasted that gentleman would not have had the merit of being the first to make this discovery  nor is it said herman mordaunt and dirck must hunt up another to supply my daughters place  but no other was forthcoming from the stores of dirck follocks mind had he a dozen names in reserve not one of them would he have produced under circumstances that might seem like denying his allegiance to the girl already given but he could not name any other female so after some trifling the company attributing dircks hesitation to his youth and ignorance of the world abandoned the attempt desiring him to call on anneke herself for a toast in turn  cousin dirck van valkenburgh said anneke with the greater selfpossession and ease of her sex though actually my friends junior by more than two years laying some emphasis at the same time on the word cousin  there exclaimed dirck looking exultingly at bulstrode you see gentlemen and ladies that it is permitted to toast a person present if you happen to respect and esteem that person  by which sir we are to understand how much miss mordaunt respects and esteems mr dirck van valkenburgh answered bulstrode gravely i am afraid there is only too much justice in an opinion that might at the first blush seem to savour of selflove  an imputation i am far from denying returned anneke with a steadiness that showed wonderful selfcommand did she really return any of dircks attachment my kinsman gives me as his toast and i give him as mine is there anything unnatural in that  here there was an outbreak of raillery at annekes expense which the young lady bore with a calmness and composure that at first astonished me but when i came to reflect that she had been virtually at the head of her fathers house for several years and that she had always associated with persons older than herself it appeared more natural for it is certain we can either advance or retard the character by throwing a person into intimate association with those who by their own conversation manners or acquirements are most adapted for doing either in a few minutes the interruption was forgotten by those who had no interest in the subject and the singing commenced i had obtained so much credit by my attempt at dinner that i had the extreme gratification of being asked to sing another song by anneke herself of course i complied and i thought the company seemed pleased as for my young hostess i knew she looked more gratified with my song than with the afterpiece and that i felt to be something dirck had an occasion to renew a little of the ground lost by the toast for he sang a capital comic song in low dutch it is true not half the party understood him but the other half laughed until the tears rolled down their cheeks and there was something so droll in my friends manner that everybody was delighted the clocks struck twelve before we broke up  i staid in town but a day or two longer meeting my new acquaintances every day and sometimes twice aday however on trinity church walk i paid visits of leavetaking with a heavy heart and most of all to anneke and her father  i understood from follock said herman mordaunt when i explained the object of my call that you are to leave town tomorrow miss mordaunt and her friend miss wallace go to lilacsbush this afternoon for it is high time to look after the garden and the flowers many of which are now in full bloom i shall join them in the evening and i propose that you young men take a late breakfast with us on your way to westchester a cup of coffee before you start and getting into your saddle at six will bring all right i promise you that you shall be on the road again by one which will give you plenty of time to reach satanstoe before dark  i looked at anneke and fancied that the expression of her countenance was favourable dirck left everything to me and i accepted the invitation this arrangement shortened my visit in crown street and i left the house with a lighter heart than that with which i had entered it it is always so agreeable to get an unpleasant duty deferred  next day dirck and i were in the saddle at six precisely and we rode through the streets just as the blacks were washing down their stoops and sidewalks though there were but very few of the last in my youth this is a commodious improvement and one that it is not easy to see how the ladies could dispense with and which is now getting to be pretty common all the new streets i see being provided with the convenience  it was a fine may morning and the air was full of the sweet fragrance of the lilac in particular as we rode into the country just as we got into the bowery lane a horseman was seen walking out of one of the bystreets and coming our way he no sooner caught sight of two travellers going in his own direction than he spurred forward to join us being alone and probably wishing company as it would have been churlish to refuse to travel in company with one thus situated we pulled up walking our horses until the stranger joined us when to our surprise it turned out to be jason newcome the pedagogue was as much astonished when he recognised us as we were in recognising him and i believe he was a little disappointed for jason was so fond of making acquaintances that it was always a pleasure to him to be thus employed it appeared that he had been down on the island to visit a relative who had married and settled in that quarter and this was the reason we had not met since the morning of the affair of the lion of course we trotted on together neither glad nor sorry at having this particular companion  i never could explain the process by means of which jason wound his way into everybodys secrets it is true he had no scruples about asking questions putting those which most persons would think forbidden by the usages of society with as little hesitation as those which are universally permitted the people of new england have a reputation this way and i remember to have heard mr worden account for the practice in the following way everything and everybody was brought under rigid church government among the puritans and when a whole community gets the notion that it is to sit in judgment on every act of one of its members it is quite natural that it should extend that right to an inquiry into all his affairs one thing is certain our neighbours of connecticut do assume a control over the acts and opinions of individuals that is not dreamed of in new york and i think it very likely that the practice of pushing inquiry into private things has grown up under this custom  as one might suppose jason whenever baffled in an attempt to obtain knowledge by means of inquiries more or less direct sought to advance his ends through conjectures taking those that were the most plausible if any such could be found but putting up with those that had not even this questionable recommendation if nothing better offered he was consequently for ever falling into the grossest errors for necessarily making his conclusions on premises drawn from his own ignorance and inexperience he was liable to fall into serious mistakes at the very outset nor was this the worst the tendency of human nature not being very directly to charity the harshest constructions were sometimes blended with the most absurd blunders in his mind and i have known him to be often guilty of assertions that had no better foundation than these conjectures which might have subjected him to severe legal penalties  on the present occasion jason was not long in ascertaining where we were bound this was done in a manner so characteristic and ingenious that i will attempt to relate it  why youre out early this morning gentlemen exclaimed jason affecting surprise what in natur has started you off before breakfast  so as to be certain not to lose our suppers at satanstoe this evening i answered  suppers why you will almost reach home jason would call this word hum by dinnertime that is your york dinnertime perhaps you mean to call by the way  perhaps we do mr newcorne there are many pleasant families between this and satanstoe  i know there be theres the great mr van cortlandts at yonkers perhaps you mean to stop there  no sir we have no such intention  then theres the rich count philipss on the river that would be no great matter out of the way  its farther than we intend to turn  oh so you do intend to turn a bit aside well theres that mr mordaunt whose daughter you pulled out of the lions pawshe has a house near kingsbridge called lilacsbush  and how did you ascertain that jason  by asking do you think i would let such a thing happen and not inquire a little about the young lady nothing is ever lost by putting a few questions and inquiring round and i did not forget the rule in her case  and you ascertained that the young ladys father has a place called lilacsbush in this neighbourhood  i did and a queer york fashion it is to give a house a name just as you would a christian being that must be a roman catholic custom and some way connected with idolatry  out of all doubt it is far better to say for instance that we are going to breakfast at mr mordauntseses than to say we intend to stop at lilacsbush  oh you be be you well i thought it would turn out that some such place must have started you off so early it will be a desperate late breakfast corny  it will be at ten ooclock jason and that is rather later than common but our appetites will be so much the better  to this jason assented and then commenced a series of manoeuvres to be included in the party this we did not dare to do however and all jasons hints were disregarded until growing desperate by our evasions he plumply proposed to go along and we as plumply told him we would take no such liberty with a man of herman mordaunts years position and character i do not know that we should have hesitated so much had we considered jason a gentleman but this was impossible the custom of the colony admitted of great freedom in this respect being very different from what it is at home by all accounts in these particulars but there was always an understanding that the persons one brought with him should be of a certain stamp and class in life recommendations to which jason newcome certainly had no claim  the case was getting to be a little embarrassing when the appearance of herman mordaunt himself fortunately removed the difficulty jason was not a man to be thrown off very easily but here was one who had the power and who showed the disposition to set things right herman mordaunt had ridden down the road a mile or two to meet us intending to lead us by a private and shorter way to his residence than that which was already known to us he no sooner saw that jason was of our company than he asked that as a favour which our companion would very gladly have accepted as a boon  footnote 15 in england othello is usually played as a black while in america he is played as a nondescript or of no colour that is ordinarily seen it is not clear that england is nearer right than america however the moor not being a negro any more than he is of the colour of a dried herringeditor     chapter ix    i questiond love whose early ray   so heavenly bright appears   and love in answer seemd to say   his light was dimmd by tears    heber   it was not long after the explanation occurred as respects jason and the invitation was given to include him in our party before herman mordaunt opened a gate and led the way into the fields a very tolerable road conducted us through some woods to the heights and we soon found ourselves on an eminence that overlooked a long reach of the hudson extending from haverstraw to the north as far as staten island to the south a distance of near forty miles on the opposite shore rose the walllike barrier of the palisadoes lifting the tableland on their summits to an elevation of several hundred feet the noble river itself fully threequarters of a mile in width was unruffled by a breath of air lying in one single extended placid sheet under the rays of a bright sun resembling molten silver i scarce remember a lovelier morning everything appearing to harmonize with the glorious but tranquil grandeur of the view and the rich promises of a bountiful nature the trees were mostly covered with the beautiful clothing of a young verdure the birds had mated and were building in nearly every tree the wildflowers started up beneath the hoofs of our horses and every object far and near seemed to my young eyes to be attuned to harmony and love  this is a favourite ride of mine in which anneke often accompanies me said herman mordaunt as we gained the commanding eminence i have mentioned my daughter is a spirited horsewoman and is often my companion in these morning rides she and mary wallace should be somewhere on the hills at this moment for they promised to follow me as soon as they could dress for the saddle  a cry of something like wild delight burst out of dirck and the next moment he was galloping away for an adjoining ridge on the top of which the beautiful forms of the two girls were just then visible embellished by neatlyfitting habits and beavers with drooping feathers i pointed out these charming objects to herman mordaunt and followed my friend at halfspeed in a minute or two the parties had joined  never had i seen anneke mordaunt so perfectly lovely as she appeared that morning the exercise and air had deepened a bloom that was always rich and her eyes received new lustre from the glow on her cheeks though expected i thought she received us as particularly acceptable guests while mary wallace manifested more than an usual degree of animation in her reception jason was not forgotten but was acknowledged as an old acquaintance and was properly introduced to the friend  you frequently take these rides mr mordaunt tells me i said reining my horse to the side of that of annekes as the whole party moved on and i regret that satanstoe is so distant as to prevent our oftener meeting of a morning we have many noted horsewomen in westchester who would be proud of such an acquisition  i know several ladies on your side of harlem river anneke answered and frequently ride in their company but none so distant as any in your immediate neighbourhood my father tells me he used often to shoot over the fields of satanstoe when a youth and still speaks of your birds with great affection  i believe our fathers were once brothersportsmen mr bulstrode has promised to come and imitate their good example now you have had time to reflect on the plays you have seen do you still feel the same interest in such representations as at first  i only wish there was not so much to condemn i think mr bulstrode might have reached eminence as a player had not fortune put it in one sense beyond his reach as an elder son and a man of family  mr bulstrode they tell me is not only the heir of an old baronetcy but of a large fortune  such are the facts i believe do you not think it creditable to him mr littlepage that one so situated should come so far to serve his king and country in a rude war like this of our colonies  i was obliged to assent though i heartily wished that annekes manner had been less animated and sincere as she put the question still i hardly knew what to think of her feelings towards that gentleman for otherwise she always heard him named with a calmness and selfpossession that i had observed was not shared by all her young companions when there was occasion to allude to the gay and insinuating soldier i need scarcely say it was no disadvantage to mr bulstrode to be the heir of a baronetcy in an english colony somehow or other we are a little apt to magnify such accidental superiority at a distance from home and i have heard englishmen themselves acknowledge that a baronet was a greater man in new york than a duke was in london these were things that passed through my mind as i rode along at annekes side though i had the discretion not to give utterance of my thoughts  herman mordaunt rode in advance with jason and he led the party by pretty bridlepaths along the heights for nearly two miles occasionally opening a gate without dismounting until he reached a point that overlooked lilacsbush which was soon seen distant from us less than half a mile  here we are on my own domain he said as he pulled up to let us join him that last gate separating me from my nearest neighbour south these hills are of no great use except as early pastures though they afford many beautiful views  i have heard it predicted i remarked that the time would come some day when the banks of the hudson would contain many such seats as that of the philipses at yonkers and one or two more like it that i am told are now standing above the highlands  quite possibly it is not easy to foretell what may come to pass in such a country i dare say that in time both towns and seats will be seen on the banks of the hudson and a powerful and numerous nobility to occupy the last by the way mr littlepage your father and my friend col follock have been making a valuable acquisition in lands i hear having obtained a patent for an extensive estate somewhere in the neighbourhood of albany  it is not so very extensive sir there being only some forty thousand acres of it altogether nor is it very near albany by what i can learn since it must lie at a distance of some forty miles or more from that town next winter however dirck and myself are to go in search of the land when we shall learn all about it  then we may meet in that quarter of the country i have affairs of importance at albany which have been too long neglected and it has been my intention to pass some months at the north next season and early in the season too we may possibly meet in the woods  you have been at albany i suppose mr mordaunt  quite often sir the distance is so great that one has not much inducement to go there unless carried by affairs however as has been my case i was at albany before my marriage and have had various occasions to visit it since  my father was there when a soldier and he tells me it is a part of the province well worth seeing at all events i shall encounter the risk and fatigue next season for it is useful to young persons to see the world dirck and myself may make the campaign should there be one in that direction  i fancied anneke manifested some interest in this conversation but we rode on and soon alighted at the door of lilacsbush bulstrode was not in the way and i had the supreme pleasure of helping miss mordaunt to alight when we paused a moment before entering the house to examine the view i have given the reader some idea of the general appearance of the place but it was necessary to approach it in order to form a just conception of its beauties as its name indicated the lawn house and outbuildings were all garnished or buried in lilacs the whole of which were then in full blossom the flowers filled the air with a species of purple light that cast a warm and soft radiance even on the glowing face of anneke as she pointed out to me the magical effect i know no flower that does so much to embellish a place as the lilac on a large scale common as it is and familiar as we have become with its hues and its fragrance  we enjoy the month our lilacs are out beyond any month in the year said anneke smiling at my surprise and delight and we make it a point to pass most of it here you will at least own mr littlepage that lilacsbush is properly named  the effect is more like enchantment than anything else i cried i did not know that the simple modest lilac could render anything so very beautiful  simplicity and modesty are such charms in themselves sir as to be potent allies observed the sensible but taciturn mary wallace  to this i assented of course and we all followed mr mordaunt into the house i was as much delighted with the appearance of things in the interior of lilacsbush as i had been with the exterior everywhere it seemed to me i met with the signs of annekes taste and skill i do not wish the reader to suppose that the residence itself was of the very first character and class for this it could not lay claim to be still it was one of those staid storyandahalf dwellings in which most of our first families were and are content to dwell in the country very much resembling the good old habitation at satanstoe in these particulars the furniture however was of a higher townfinish than we found it necessary to use and the little parlour in which we breakfasted was a model for an eatingroom the buffets in the corners were so well polished that one might see his face in them the cellarets were ornamented with plated hinges locks etc and the table itself shone like a mirror i know not how it was but the china appeared to me richer and neater than common under annekes pretty little hand while the massive and highlyfinished plate of the breakfast service was such as could be wrought only in england in a word while everything appeared rich and respectable there was a certain indescribable air of comfort gentility and neatness about the whole that impressed me in an unusual manner  mr littlepage tells me anneke observed herman mordaunt while we were at breakfast that he intends to make a journey to the north next winter and it may be our good fortune to meet him there the th expects to be ordered up as high as albany this summer and we may all renew our songs and jests with bulstrode and his gay companions among the dutchmen  i was charmed with this prospect of meeting anneke mordaunt at the north and took occasion to say as much though i was afraid it was in an awkward and confused manner  i heard as much as this sir while we were riding answered the daughter i hope cousin dirck is to be of the party  cousin dirck assured her he was and we discussed in anticipation the pleasure it must give to old acquaintances to meet so far from home not one of us herman mordaunt excepted had ever been one hundred miles from his or her birthplace as was ascertained on comparing notes i was the greatest traveller princeton lying between eighty and ninety miles from satanstoe as the road goes  perhaps i come nearer to it than any of you put in jason for my late journey on the island must have carried me nearly that far from danbury but ladies i can assure you a traveller has many opportunities for learning useful things as i know by the difference there is between york and connecticut  and which do you prefer mr newcome asked anneke with a somewhat comical expression about her laughing eyes  that is hardly a fair question miss no reproof could break jason of this vulgarism since it might make enemies for a body to speak all of his mind in such matters there are comparisons that should never be made on account of circumstances that overrule all common efforts new york is a great colonya very great colony miss but it was once dutch as everybody knows begging mr follocks pardon and it must be confessed connecticut has from the first enjoyed almost unheardof advantages in the moral and religious character of her people the excellence of her lands and the purityjason called this word poority but that did not alter the sentimentthough i must say once for all it is out of my power to spell every word as this man saw fit to pronounce itof her people and church  herman mordaunt looked up with surprise at this speech but dirck and i had heard so many like it that we saw nothing out of the way on this particular occasion as for the ladies they were too wellbred to glance at each other as girls sometimes will but i could see that each thought the speaker a very singular person  you find then a difference in customs between the two colonies sir said herman mordaunt  a vast difference truly sir now there was a little thing happened about your daughter squire mordaunt the very first time i saw herthe present was the second interviewthat could no more have happened in connecticut than the whole of the province could be put into that teacup  to my daughter mr newcome  yes sir to your own daughter miss that sits there looking as innocent as if it had never come to pass  this is so extraordinary sir that i must beg an explanation  you may well call it extrornary for extrornary it would be called all over connecticut and ill never give up that york if this be a york usage is or can be right in such a matter at least  i entreat you to be more explicit mr newcome  why sir you must know corny here and i and dirck there went in to see the lion about which no doubt youve heard so much and corny paid for misss ticket well that was all right enough but  surely anneke you have not forgotten to return to mr littlepage the money  listen patiently my dear sir and you will get the whole story my delinquencies and debts included if any there are  thats just what she did squire mordaunt and i maintain there is not the man in all connecticut that would have taken it if ladies cant be treated to sights and other amusements i should like to know who is to be so  herman mordaunt at first looked gravely at the speaker but catching the expression of our eyes he answered with the tact of a perfectly wellbred man as he certainly was on all occasions that put him to the proof  you must overlook miss mordaunts adhering to her own customs mr newcome on account of her youth and her little knowledge of any world but that immediately around her when she has enjoyed an opportunity of visiting danbury no doubt she will improve by the occasion  but corny sirthink of cornys falling into such a mistake  as for mr littlepage i must suppose he labours under somewhat of the same disadvantage we are less gallant here than you happen to be in connecticut hence our inferiority at some future day perhaps when society shall have made a greater progress among us our youths will come to see the impropriety of permitting the fair sex to pay for anything even their own ribands i have long known sir that you of new england claim to treat your women better than they are treated in any other portion of the inhabited world and it must be owing to that circumstance hat they enjoy the advantage of being treated for nothing  with this concession jason was apparently content how much of this provincial feeling arising from provincial ignorance have i seen since that time it is certain that our fellowsubjects of the eastern provinces are not addicted to hiding their lights under bushels but make the most of all their advantages that they are superior to us of york in some respects i am willing enough to allow but there are certainly points on which this superiority is far less apparent as for jason he was entirely satisfied with the answer of herman mordaunt and often alluded to the subject afterwards to my prejudice and with great selfcomplacency to be sure it is a hard lesson to beat into the head of the selfsufficient colonist that his own little corner of the earth does not contain all that is right and just and good and refined  i left lilacsbush that day deeply in love i hold it to be unmanly to attempt to conceal it anneke had made a lively impression on me from the very first but that impression had now gone deeper than the imagination and had very sensibly touched the heart perhaps it was necessary to see her in the retirement of the purely domestic circle to give all her charms their just ascendency while in town i had usually met her in crowds surrounded by admirers or other young persons of her own sex and there was less opportunity for viewing the influence of nature and the affections on her manner with mary wallace at her side however there was always one on whom she could exhibit just enough of these feelings to bring out the loveliness of her nature without effort or affectation anne mordaunt never spoke to her friend without a change appearing in her manner affection thrilled in the tones of her voice confidence beamed in her eye and esteem and respect were to be gathered from the expectation and deference that shone in her countenance mary wallace was two years the oldest and these years taken in connection with her character entitled her to receive this tribute from her nearest associate but all these feelings flowed spontaneously from the heart for never was an intercourse between two of the sex more thoroughly free from acting  it was a proof that passion was getting the mastery over me that i now forgot dirck his obvious attachment older claims and possible success i know not how it was or why it was but it was certain that herman mordaunt had a great regard for dirck van valkenburgh the affinity may have counted for something and it was possible that the father was already weighing the advantages that might accrue from such a connection col follock had the reputation of being rich as riches were then counted among us and the young fellow himself in addition to a fine manly figure that was fast developing itself into the frame of a youthful hercules had an excellent temper and a good reputation still this idea never troubled me of dirck i had no fears while bulstrode gave me great uneasiness from the first i saw all his advantages may have even magnified them while those of my near and immediate friend gave me no trouble whatever it is possible had dirck presented himself oftener or more distinctly to my mind a feeling of magnanimity might have induced me to withdraw in time and leave him a field to which he had the earliest claim but after the morning at lilacsbush it was too late for any such sacrifice on my part and i rode away from the house at the side of my friend as forgetful of his interest in anneke as if he had never felt any magnanimity and i had no further connection in relation to my pretensions to anneke mordaunt  well commenced jason as soon as we were fairly in the saddle these mordaunts are even a notch above your folks corny there was more silver vessels in that room where we ate than there is at this moment in all danbury the extravagance amounts to waste the old gentleman must be desperate rich dirck  herman mordaunt has a good estate and very little of it has gone for plate jason that which you saw is old and came either from holland or england one home or the other  oh holland is no home for me boy depend on it all that plate is not put there for nothing if the truth could be come at this herman mordaunt as you call him though i do not see why you cannot call him squire mordaunt like other folks but this mr mordaunt has some notion i conclude to get his daughter off on one of these rich english officers of whom there happen to be so many in the province just at this time i never saw the gentleman but there was one bulstrode named pretty often this forenoonjasons morning always terminated at his usual breakfast hourand i rather conclude he will turn out to be the chap in the long run such is my calculation and they dont often fail  i saw a quick surprised start in dirck but i felt such a twinge myself that there was little opportunity to inquires into the state of my friends feelings at this coarse but unexpected remark  have you any particular reason mr newcome for venturing such an opinion i asked a little sternly  come dont let us out here in the highway begin to mister one another you are corny dirck is dirck and i am jason the shortest way is commonly the best way and i like givennames among friends have i any particular reasonyes plenty on em and them thats good in the first place no man has a daughterdarter à la jasonthat he does not begin to think of setting her out in the world accordin to his abilities then as i said before these folks from home hum are awful rich and rich husbands are always satisfactory to parents whatever they may be to children besides some of these officers will fall heirs to titles and that is a desperate temptation to a woman all over the world i hardly think there is a young woman in danbury that could hold out agin a real title  it has always struck me as singular that the people of jasons part of the provinces should entertain so much profound respect for titles no portion of the world is of simpler habits nor is it easier to find any civilized people among whom there is greater equality of actual condition which one would think must necessarily induce equality of feeling than in connecticut at this very moment notwithstanding these facts the love of title is so great that even that of serjeant is often prefixed to the name of a man on his tombstone or in the announcement of his death or marriage and as for the militia ensigns and lieutenants there is no end to them deacon is an important title which is rarely omitted and wo betide the man who should forget to call a magistrate esquire no such usages prevail among us or if they do it is among that portion of the people of this colony which is derived from new england and still retains some of its customs then in no part of the colonies is english rank more deferred to than in new england generally notwithstanding most of those colonies possess the right to elect nearly every officer they have among them i allow that we of new york defer greatly to men of birth and rank from home and it is right we should so do but i do not think our deference is as great or by any means as general as it is in new england it is possible the influence of the dutch may have left an impression on our state of society though i have been told that the colonies farther south exhibit very much the same characteristics as we do ourselves on this head 16  we reached satanstoe a little late in consequence of the delay at lilacsbush and were welcomed with affection and warmth my excellent mother was delighted to see me at home again after so long an absence and one which she did not think altogether without peril when it was remembered that i had passed a whole fortnight amid the temptations and fascinations of the capital i saw the tears in her eyes as she kissed me again and again and felt the gentle warm embrace as she pressed me to her bosom in maternal thanksgiving  of course i had to render an account of all i had seen and done including pinkster the theatre and the lion i said nothing however of the mordaunts until questioned about them by my mother quite a fortnight after dirck had gone across to rockland one morning as i sat endeavouring to write a sonnet in my own room that excellent parent entered and took a seat near my table with the familiarity the relation she bore me justified she was knitting at the time for never was she idle except when asleep i saw by the placid smile on her face which heaven bless her was still smooth and handsome that something was on her mind that was far from disagreeable and i waited with some curiosity for the opening that excellent mother how completely did she live out of herself in all that had the most remote bearing on my future hopes and happiness  finish your writing my son commenced my mother for i had instinctively striven to conceal the sonnet finish your writing until you have done i will be silent  i have done now mother twas only a copy of verses i was endeavouring to write outyou knowthat iswrite out you know  i did not know you were a poet corny returned my mother smiling still more complacently for it is something to be the parent of a poet  ii a poet motherid sooner turn schoolmaster than turn poet yes id sooner be jason newcome himself than even suspect it possible i could be a poet  well never mind people never turn poets i fancy with their eyes open but what is this i hear of your having saved a beautiful young lady from the jaws of a lion while you were in town and why was i left to learn all the particulars from mr newcome  i believe my face was of the colour of scarlet for it felt as if it were on fire and my mother smiled still more decidedly than ever speak i could not have spoken to be thus smiled on by anneke  there is nothing to be ashamed of corny in rescuing a young lady from a lion or in going to her fathers to receive the thanks of the family the mordaunts are a family any one can visit with pleasure was the battle between you and the beast a very desperate conflict my child  poh motherjason is a regular dealer in marvels and he makes mountains of molehills in the first place for jaws you must substitute paws and for a young lady her shawl  yes i understand it was the shawl but it was on her shoulders and could not have been disengaged time enough to save her had you not shown so much presence of mind and courage as for the jaws i believe that was my mistake for mr newcome certainly said claws  well mother have it your own way i was of a little service to a very charming young woman and she and her father were civil to me as a matter of course herman mordaunt is a name we all know and as you say his is a family that any man may be proud of visiting ay and pleased too  how odd it is corny added my mother in a sort of musing soliloquizing wayyou are an only child and anneke mordaunt is also an only child as dirck follock has often told me  then dirck has spoken to you frequently of anneke before this mother  time and again they are relations you must have heard as indeed you are yourself if you did but know it  ii related to anneke mordaunt without being too near  my dear mother smiled again while i felt sadly ashamed of myself at the next instant i believe that a suspicion of the truth as respects my infant passion existed in that dear parents mind from that moment  certainly related corny and i will tell you how my greatgreatgrandmother alida van der heyden was a first cousin of herman mordaunts greatgreatgrandmother by his mothers side who was a van kleeck so you see you and anneke are actually related  just near enough mother to put one at ease in their house and not so near as to make relationship troublesome  they tell me my child that anneke is a sweet creature  if beauty and modesty and grace and gentleness and spirit and sense and delicacy and virtue and piety can make any young woman of seventeen a sweet creature mother then anneke is sweet  my dear mother seemed surprised at my warmth but she smiled still more complacently than ever instead of pursuing the subject however she saw fit to change it by speaking of the prospects of the season and the many reasons we all had for thankfulness to god i presume with a womans instinct she had learned enough to satisfy her mind for the present  the summer soon succeeded to the may that proved so momentous to me and i sought occupation in the fields occupation however would not do anneke was with me go where i would and glad was i when dirck about midsummer in one of his periodical visits to satanstoe proposed that we should ride over and make another visit to lilacsbush he had written a note to say we should be glad to ask a dinner and beds if it were convenient for a day a short distance ahead and he waited the answer at the neck this answer arrived duly by mail and was everything we could wish herman mordaunt offered us a hearty welcome and sent the grateful intelligence that his daughter and mary wallace would both be present to receive us i envied dirck the manly feeling which had induced him to take this plain and respectable course to his object  we went across the country accordingly and reached lilacsbush several hours before dinner anneke received us with a bright suffusion of the face and kind smiles though i could not detect the slightest difference in her manners to either to both was she gracious gentle attentive and ladylike no allusion was made to the past except a few remarks that were given on the subject of the theatre the officers had continued to play until the th had been ordered up the river when bulstrode billings harris virtuous marcia and all had proceeded to albany in company anneke thought there was about as much to be displeased with as there was to please in these representations though her removal to the country had prevented her seeing more than three of them all it was admitted all round however that bulstrode played admirably and it was even regretted by certain persons that he should not have been devoted to the stage  we passed the night at lilacsbush and remained an hour or two after breakfast next morning i had carried a warm invitation from both my parents to herman mordaunt to ride over with the young ladies and taste the fish of the sound and the visit was returned in the course of the month of september my mother received anneke as a relation though i believe that both herman mordaunt and his daughter were surprised to learn that they came within even the wide embrace of dutch kindred they did not seem displeased however for the family name of my mother was good and no one need have been ashamed of affinity to her on her own account our guests did not remain the night but they left us in a sort of a chaise that herman mordaunt kept for country use about an hour before sunset i mounted my horse and rode five miles with the party on its way back and then took my leave of anneke as it turned out for many many weary months  the year 1757 was memorable in the colonies by the progress of the war and as much so in new york as in any other province montcalm had advanced to the head of lake george had taken fort william henry and a fearful massacre of the garrison had succeeded this bold operation left the enemy in possession of champlain and the strong post of ticonderoga was adequately garrisoned by a formidable force a general gloom was cast over the political affairs of the colony and it was understood that a great effort was to be made the succeeding campaign to repair the loss rumour spoke of large reinforcements from home and of greater levies in the colonies themselves than had been hitherto attempted lord loudon was to return home and a veteran of the name of abercrombie was to succeed him in the command of all the forces of the king regiments began to arrive from the west indies and in the course of the winter of 17578 we heard at satanstoe of the gaieties that these new forces had introduced into the town among other things a regular corps of thespians had arrived from the west indies  footnote 16 as respects the love of titles that are derived from the people there is nothingopposed to strict republican or if the reader will democratic principles since it is deferring to the power that appoints and manifests a respect for that which the community chooses to elevate but the deference to english rank mentioned by mr littlepage is undeniably greater among the mass in new england than it is anywhere else in this country at this very moment one leading new york paper edited by new england men during the last controversy about the indemnity to be paid by france actually styled the due de broglie his grace like a grub street cockneya mode of address that would astonish that respectable statesman quite as much as it must have amused every man of the world who saw it i have been much puzzled to account for this peculiarityunquestionably one that exists in the countrybut have supposed it must be owing to the diffusion of information which carries intelligence sufficiently far to acquaint the mass with leading social features without going far enough to compensate for a provincial position and provincial habits perhaps the exclusively english origin of the people may have an influence the writer has passed portions of two seasons in switzerland and excluding the small forest cantons he has no hesitation in saying that the habits and general notions of connecticut are more inherently democratical than those of any part of that country notwithstanding he thinks a nobleman particularly an english nobleman is a far greater man in new england than he is among the real middlestate families of new yorkeditor     chapter x    dear hastypudding what unpromised joy   expands my heart to meet thee in savoy   doomd oer the world through devious paths to roam   each clime my country and each house my home   my soul is soothd my cares have found an end   i greet my longlost unforgotten friend    barlow   the winter was soon drawing to a close and my twentyfirst birthday was past my father and col follock who came over to smoke more than usual that winter with my father began to talk of the journey dirck and i were to take in quest of the patent maps were procured calculations were made and different modes of proceeding were proposed by the various members of the family i will acknowledge that the sight of the large coarse parchment map of the mooseridge patent as the new acquisition was called from the circumstance of the surveyors having shot a moose on a particular ridge of land in its centre excited certain feelings of avarice within my mind there were streams meandering among hills and valleys little lakes or ponds as they were erroneously called in the language of the country dotted the surface and there were all the artistical proofs of a valuable estate that a good mapmaker could devise to render the whole pleasing and promising 17  if it were a good thing to be the heir of satanstoe it was far better to be the tenant in common with my friend dirck of all these ample plains rich bottoms flowing streams and picturesque lakes in a word for the first time in the history of the colonies the littlepages had become the owners of what might be termed an estate according to our new york parlance six or eight hundred acres are not an estate nor two or three thousand scarcely but ten or twenty and much more forty thousand acres of land might be dignified with the name of an estate  the first knotty point discussed was to settle the manner in which dirck and myself should reach mooseridge two modes of going as far as albany offered and on one of these it was our first concern to decide we might wait until the river opened and go as far as albany in a sloop of which one or two left town each week when business was active as it was certain to be in the spring of the year it was thought however that the army would require mos of the means of transportation of this nature that offered and it might put us to both inconvenience and delay to wait on the tardy movements of quartermasters and contractors my grandfather shook his head when the thing was named and advised us to remain as independent as possible  have as little as possible to do with such people corny put in my grandfather now a greyheaded venerablelooking old gentleman who did not wear his wig half the time but was content to appear in a pointed nightcap and gown at all hours until just before dinner was announced when he invariably came forth dressed as a gentlemanhave as little as possible to do with these gentry corny money and not honour is their game and you will be treated like a barrel of beef or a bag of potatoes if you fall into their hands if you move with the army at all keep among the real soldiers my boy and above all things avoid the contractors  it was consequently determined that there was too much uncertainty and delay in waiting for a passage to albany by water for it was known that the voyage itself often lasted ten days or a fortnight and it would be so late before we could sail as to render this delay very inconvenient the other mode of journeying was to go before the snow had melted from the roads by the aid of which it was quite possible to make the distance between satanstoe and albany in three days  certain considerations of economy next offered and we settled down on the following plan which as it strikes me is even now worthy of being mentioned on account of its prudence and judgment it was well known that there would be a great demand for horses for the army as well as for stores provisions c of various sorts now we had on the neck several stout horses that were falling into years though still serviceable and good for a campaign col follock had others of the same description and when the cavalry of the two farms were all assembled at satanstoe there were found to be no fewer than fourteen of the venerable animals these made just three fourhorse teams besides leaving a pair for a lighter load old stout lumber sleighs were bought or found and repaired and jaap having two other blacks with him was sent off at the head of what my father called a brigade of lumber sleighs all of which were loaded with the spare pork and flour of the two families the war had rendered these articles quite high but the hogs that were slaughtered at christmas had not yet been sold and it was decided that dirck and myself could not commence our career as men who had to buy and sell from the respective farms in any manner more likely to be useful to us and to our parents than this as yaaps movements were necessarily slow he was permitted to precede dirck and myself by two entire days giving him time to clear the highlands before we left satanstoe the negroes carried the provender for their horses and no small portion of the food and all of the cider that was necessary for their own consumption no one was ashamed of economising with his slaves in this manner the law of slavery itself existing principally as a moneymaking institution i mention these little matters that posterity may understand the conventional feeling of the colony on such points  when everything was ready we had to listen to much good advice from our friends previously to launching ourselves into the world what col follock said to dirck the latter never told me but the following was pretty much the form and substance of that which i received from my own fatherthe interview taking place in a little room he called his office or study as jason used to term it  here corny are all the bills or invoices properly made out my father commenced handing me a small sheaf of papers and you will do well to consult them before you make any sales here are letters of introduction to several gentlemen in the army whose acquaintance i could wish you to cultivate this in particular is to my old captain charles merrewether who is now a lt col and commands a battalion in the royal americans you will find him of great service to you while you remain with the army i make no doubt pork they tell me if of the quality of that you will have ought to bring three half joes the barreland you might ask that much should accident procure you an invitation to the table of the commanderinchief as may happen through col merrewethers friendship i trust you will do full credit to the loyalty of the littlepages ah theres the flour too it ought to be worth two half joes the barrel in times like these i have thrown in a letter or two to some of the schuylers with whom i served when of your age they are firstrate people remember and rank among the highest families of the colonies full of good old van cortlandt blood and well crossed with the rensselaers should any of them ask you about the barrel of tongues that you will find marked t  any of whom sir the schuylers the cortlandts or the rensselaers  poh any of the sutlers or contractors i mean of course you can tell them that they were cured at home and that you dare recommend them as fit for the commanderinchiefs own table  such was the character of my fathers parting instructions my mother held a different discourse  corny my beloved child she said this will be an allimportant journey to you not only are you going far from home but you are going to a part of the country where much will be to be seen i hope you will remember what was promised for you by your sponsors in baptism and also what is owing to your own good name and that of your family the letters you take with you will probably introduce you to good company and that is a great beginning to a youth i wish you to cultivate the society of reputable females corny my sex has great influence on the conduct of yours at your time of life and both your manners and principles will be aided by being as much with women of character as possible  but mother if we are to go any distance with the army as both my father and col follock wish it will not be in our power to be much in ladies society  i speak of the time you will pass in and near albany i do not expect you will find accomplished women at mooseridge nor should you really go any distance with the troops though i see no occasion for your going with them a single foot since you are not a soldier do i suppose you will find many reputable women in the camp but avail yourself of every favourable opportunity to go into good company i have procured a letter for you from a lady of one of the great families of this county to madam schuyler who is above all other women they tell me in and around albany her you must see and i charge you on your duty to deliver this letter it is possible too that herman mordaunt  what of herman mordaunt and anneke mother  i spoke only of herman mordaunt himself and did not mention anneke boy answered my mother smiling though i doubt not that the daughter is with the father they left town for albany two months since my sister legge writes me and intend to pass the summer north i will not deceive you corny so you shall hear all that your aunt has written on the subject in the first place she says herman mordaunt has gone on public service having an especial appointment for some particular duty of importance that is private but which it is known will detain him near albany and among the northern posts until the close of the season though he gives out to the world he is absent on account of some land he has in albany county his daughter and mary wallace are with him with several servants and they have taken up with them a sleighload of conveniences that looks like remaining now you ought to hear the rest my child though i feel no apprehension when such a youth as yourself is put in competition with any other man in the colony yes though your own mother i think i may say that  what is it mothernever mind me i shall do well enough depend on itthat isbut what is it dear mother  why your aunt says it is whispered among a few in town a very few only but whispered that herman mordaunt got the appointment named merely that he might have a pretence for taking anneke near the th in which regiment it seems there is a baronets son who is a sort of relative of his and whom he wishes to marry to anneke  i am sorry then that my aunt legge listens to any such unworthy gossip i indignantly cried my life on it anneke mordaunt never contemplated so indelicate a thing  no one supposes anneke does or did but fathers are not daughters corny no nor mothers neither as i can freely say seeing you are my only child herman mordaunt may imagine all this in his heart and anneke be every thing that is innocent and delicate  and how can my aunt legges informants know what is in herman mordaunts heart  howi suppose they judge by what they find in their own my son a common means of coming at a neighbours failings though i believe virtues are rarely detected by the same process  ay and judge of others by themselves the means may be common mother but they are not infallible  certainly not corny and that will be a ground of hope to you remember my child you can bring me no daughter i shall love half as well as i feel i can love anneke mordaunt we are related too her fathers greatgreatgrandmother  never mind the greatgreatgrandmother my dear good excellent parent after this i shall not attempt to have any secret from you unless anneke mordaunt consent to be your daughter you will never have one  do not say that corny i beseech you cried my mother a good deal frightened remember there is no accounting for tastes the army is a formidable rival and after all this mr bulstrode i think you call him may prove as acceptable to anneke as to her father do not say so cruel a thing i entreat of you dearest dearest corny   it is not a minute mother since you said how little you apprehended for me when opposed by any other man in the province  yes child but that is a very different thing from seeing you pass all your days as a heartless comfortless old bachelor there are fifty young women in this very county i could wish to see you united to in preference to witnessing such a calamity  well mother we will say no more about it but is it true that mr worden actually intends to be of our party  both mr worden and mr newcome i believe we shall scarcely know how to spare the first but he conceives he has a call to accompany the army in which there are so few chaplains and souls are called to their last dread account so suddenly in war that one does not know how to refuse to let him go  my poor confiding mother when i look back at the past and remember the manner in which the rev mr worden discharged the duties of his sacred office during the campaign that succeeded i cannot but smile at the manner in which confidence manifests itself in woman the sex has a natural disposition to place their trusts in priests by a very simple process of transferring their own dispositions to the bosoms of those they believe set apart for purely holy objects well we live and learn i dare say that many are what they profess to be but i have lived long enough now to know all are not as for mr worden he had one good point about him at any rate his friends and his enemies saw the worst of him he was no hypocrite but his associates saw the man very much as he was still i am far from wishing to hold up this imported minister as a model of christian graces for my descendants to admire no one can be more convinced than myself how much sectarians are prone to substitute their own narrow notions of right and wrong for the law of god confounding acts that are perfectly innocent in themselves with sin but at the same time i am quite aware too that appearances are ever to be consulted in cases of morals and that it is a minor virtue to be decent in matters of manners the rev mr worden whatever might have been his position as to substantial certainly carried the external of liberality to the verge of indiscretion  a day or two after the conversation i have related our party left satanstoe with some éclat the team belonged equally to the follocks and the littlepages one horse being the property of my father while the other belonged to col follock the sleigh an old one new painted for the occasion was the sole property of the latter gentleman and was consigned in mercantile phrase to dirck in order to be disposed of as soon as we should reach the end of our journey on its exterior it was painted a bright skyblue while its interior was of vermilion a colour that was and is much in vogue for this species of vehicle inasmuch as it carries with it the idea of warmth so at least the old people say though i will confess i never found my toes any less cold in a sleigh thus painted than in one painted blue which is usually thought a particularly cold colour to the feet  we had three buffaloskins or rather two buffalo bison skins and one bearskin the last being trimmed with scarlet cloth had a particularly warm and comfortable appearance the largest skin was placed on the hindseat and thrown over the back of the sleigh as a matter of course and though this back was high enough to break off the wind from our heads and necks the skin not only covered it but it hung two or three feet down behind as is becoming in a gentlemans sleigh the other buffalo was spread in the bottom of the sleigh as a carpet for all four leaving an apron to come in front upon dircks and my lap as a protection against the cold in that quarter the bearskin formed a cushion for us in front and an apron for mr worden and jason who sat behind our trunks had gone on the lumber sleighs that is mine and dircks had thus been sent while our two companions found room for theirs in the conveyance in which we went ourselves  it was march 1st 1758 the morning we left satanstoe on this memorable excursion the winter had proved as was common in our latitude though there had been more snow along the coast than was usual salt air and snow do not agree well together but i had driven in a sleigh over the neck most of the month of february though there were symptoms of a thaw and of a southerly wind the day we left home my father observed this and he advised me to take the road through the centre of the county and get among the hills as soon as possible not only was there always more snow in that part of the country but it resisted the influence of a thaw much longer than that which had fallen near the sea or sound i got my mothers last kiss my fathers last shake of the hand my grandfathers blessing stepped into the sleigh took the reins from dirck and drove off  a party in a sleigh must be composed of a very sombre sort of persons if it be not a merry one in our case everybody was disposed to goodhumour though jason could not pass along the highway in york colony without giving vent to his provincial connecticut hypercriticism everything was dutch according to his view of matters and when it failed of being dutch why it was yorkcolony the doors were not in the right places the windows were too large when they were not too small things had a cabbagelook the people smelt of tobacco and hastypudding was called suppaan but these were trifles and being used to them nobody paid much attention to what our puritanical neighbour saw fit to pour out in the humility and meekness of his soul mr worden chuckled and urged jason on in the hope of irritating dirck but dirck smoked through it all with an indifference that proved how much he really despised the critic i was the only one who resented this supercilious ignorance but even i was often more disposed to laugh than to be angry  the signs of a thaw increased as we got a few miles from home and by the time we reached white plains the south wind did not blow softly but freshly and the snow in the road became sloppy and rills of water were seen running down the hillsides in a way that menaced destruction to the sleighing on we drove however and deeper and deeper we got among the hills until we found not only more snow but fewer symptoms of immediately losing it our first days work carried us well into the manor of the van cortlandts where we passed the night next morning the south wind was still blowing sweeping over the fields of snow charged with the salt air of the ocean and bare spots began to show themselves on all the acclivities and hillsidesan admonition for us to be stirring we breakfasted in the highlands and in a wild and retired part of them though in a part where snow and beaten roads were still to be found we had escaped from the thaw and no longer felt any uneasiness on the subject of reaching the end of our journey on runners  the second day brought us fairly through the mountains out on the plains of dutchess permitting us to sup at fishkill this was a thriving settlement the people appearing to me to live in abundance as certainly they did in peace and quiet they made little of the war and asked us many questions concerning the army its commanders its force and its objects they were a simple and judging from appearances an honest people who troubled themselves very little with what was going on in the world  after quitting fishkill we found a great change not only in the country but in the weather the first was level as a whole and was much better settled than i could have believed possible so far in the interior as for the weather it was quite a different climate from that we had left below the highlands not only was the morning cold cold as it had been a month earlier with us but the snow still lay two or three feet in depth on a level and the sleighing was as good as heart could wish  that afternoon we overtook yaap and the brigade of lumbersleighs everything had gone right and after giving the fellow some fresh instructions i passed him proceeding on our route this parting did not take place however until the following had been uttered between us  well yaap i inquired as a sort of close to the previous discourse how do you like the upper counties  a loud negro laugh succeeded and a repetition of the question was necessary to extort an answer  lor masser corny how you tink i know when dere notin but snow to be seen  there was plenty of snow in westchester yet i dare say you could give some opinion of our own county  cause i know him sah inside and out and all over masser corny  well but you can see the houses and orchards and barns and fences and other things of that sort  em pretty much like ourn masser corny why you bother nigger with sich question  here another burst of loud hearty yahyahyahs succeeded and yaap had his laugh out before another word could be got out of him when i put the question a third time  well den masser corny sin you will know dis is my mind dis country is oncomparable wid our ole county sah de houses seem mean de barns look empty de fencea be low and de niggers ebbery one of em look cold sahyes sahey look berry cold  as a cold negro was a most pitiable object in negro eyes i saw by this summary that yaap had commenced his travels in much of the same temper of superciliousness as jason newcome it struck me as odd at the time but since that day i have ascertained that this feeling is a very general travelling companion for those who set out on their first journey  we passed our third night at a small hamlet called rhinebeck in a settlement in which many german names were to be found here we were travelling through the vast estates of the livingstons a name wellknown in our colonial history we breakfasted at claverack and passed through a place called kinderhooka village of low dutch origin and of some antiquity that night we succeeded in coming near albany by making a very hard days drive of it there was no village at the place where we slept but the house was a comfortable and exceedingly neat dutch tavern after quitting fishkill we had seen more or less of the river until we passed claverack where we took our leave of it it was covered with ice and sleighs were moving about it with great apparent security but we did not like to try it our whole party preferred a solid highway in which there was no danger of the bottoms dropping out  as we were now about to enter albany the second largest town in the colony and one of the largest inland towns of the whole country if such a word can properly be given to a place that lies on a navigable river it was thought necessary to make some few arrangements in order to do it decently instead of quitting the tavern at daylight therefore as had been our practice previously we remained until after breakfast having recourse to our trunks in the mean time dirck jason and myself had provided ourselves with fur caps for the journey with earlaps and other contrivances for keeping oneself warm the cap of dirck and my own were of very fine martens skins and as they were round and high and each was surmounted with a handsome tail that fell down behind they had both a smart and military air i thought i had never seen dirck look so nobly and well as he did in his cap and i got a few compliments on my own air in mine though they were only from my mother who i do think would feel disposed to praise me even if i looked wretchedly the cap of jason was better suited to his purse being lower and of foxskins though it had a tail also mr worden had declined travelling in a cap as unsuited to his holy office accordingly he wore his clerical beaver which differed a little from the ordinary cockedhats that we all wore as a matter of course though not so much so as to be very striking  all of us had overcoats well trimmed with furs mine and dircks being really handsome with trimmings of marten while those of our companion were less showy and expensive on a consultation dirck and i decided that it was better taste to enter the town in travellers dresses than to enter it in any other and we merely smartened up a little in order to appear as gentlemen the case was very different with jason according to his idea a man should wear his best clothes on a journey and i was surprised to see him appear at breakfast in black breeches striped woollen stockings large plated buckles in his shoes and a coat that i well knew he religiously reserved for highdays and holidays this coat was of a light peagreen colour and but little adapted to the season but jason had not much notion of the fitness of things in general in matters of taste dirck and myself wore our ordinary snuffcoloured coats under our furs but jason threw aside all the overcoats when we came near albany in order to enter the place in his best fortunately for him the day was mild and there was a bright sun to send its warm rays through the peagreen covering to keep his blood from chilling as for mr worden he wore a cloak of black cloth laying aside all the furs but a tippet and muff both of which he used habitually in cold weather  in this guise then we left the tavern about nine in the morning expecting to reach the banks of the river about ten nor were we disappointed the roads being excellent a light fall of snow having occurred in the night to freshen the track it was an interesting moment to us all when the spires and roofs of that ancient town albany first appeared in view we had journeyed from near the southern boundary of the colony to a place that stood at no great distance from its frontier settlements on the north the town itself formed a pleasing object as we approached it on the opposite side of the hudson there it lay stretching along the low land on the margin of the stream and on its western bank sheltered by high hills up the side of which the principal street extended for the distance of fully a quarter of a mile near the head of this street stood the fort and we saw a brigade paraded in the open ground near it wheeling and marching about the spires of two churches were visible one the oldest being seated on the low land in the heart of the place and the other on the height at no great distance from the fort or about halfway up the acclivity which forms the barrier to the inner country on that side of the river both these buildings were of stone of course shingle tenements being of very rare occurrence in the colony of new york though common enough further east 18  i will own that not one of our party liked the idea of crossing the hudson in a loaded sleigh on the ice and that in the month of march there were no streams about us to be crossed in this mode nor was the cold exactly sufficient to render such a transit safe and we felt as the inexperienced would be apt to feel in circumstances so unpleasant i must do jason the credit to admit that he showed more plain practical good sense than any of us determining our course in the end by his view of the matter as for mr worden however nothing could induce him to venture on the ice in a sleigh or near a sleigh though jason remonstrated in the following terms  now look here rev mr wordenjason seldom omitted anybodys titleyouve only to turn your eyes on the river to see it is dotted with sleighs far and near there are highways north and south and if that be the place where the crossing is at the town it is more like a thoroughfare than a spot that is risky in my judgment these people who live hereabouts ought to know whether there is any danger or not  obvious as was this truth rev mr worden made us stop on terra firma and permit him to quit the sleigh that he might cross the river on foot jason ventured a hint or two about faith and its virtues as he stripped himself to the peagreen in order to enter the town in proper guise throwing aside everything that concealed his finery as for dirck and myself we kept our seats manfully and trotted on the river at the point where we saw sleighs and footpassengers going and coming in some numbers the rev mr worden however was not content to take the beaten path for he knew there was no more security in being out on the ice near a sleigh than there was in being in it so he diverged from the road which crossed at the ferry striking diagonally atwhart the river towards the wharves of the place  it seemed to me to be a sort of a holiday among the young and idle one sleigh passing us after another filled with young men and maidens all sparkling with the excitement of the moment and gay with youth and spirits we passed no less than four of these sleighs on the river the jingling of the bells the quick movement the laughter and gaiety and the animation of the whole scene far exceeding anything of the sort i had ever before witnessed we were nearly across the river when a sleigh more handsomely equipped than any we had yet seen dashed down the bank and came whirling past us like a comet it was full of ladies with the exception of one gentleman who stood erect in front driving i recognised bulstrode in furs like all of us capped and tailed if not plumed while among the halfdozen pairs of brilliant eyes that were turned with their owners smiling faces on us i saw one which never could be forgotten by me that belonged to anneke mordaunt i question if we were recognised for the passage was like that of a meteor but i could not avoid turning to gaze after the gay party this change of position enabled me to be a witness of a very amusing consequence of mr wordens experiment a sleigh was coming in our direction and the party in it seeing one who was known for a clergyman walking on the ice turned aside and approached him on a gallop in order to offer the courtesy of a seat to a man of his sacred profession our divine heard the bells and fearful of having a sleigh so near him he commenced a downright flight pursued by the people in the sleigh as fast as their horses could follow everybody on the ice pulled up to gaze in wonder at this strange spectacle until the whole party reached the shore the rev mr worden pretty well blown as the reader may suppose  footnote 17 forty years ago a gentleman in new york purchased a considerable body of wild land on the faith of the map when he came to examine his new property it was found to be particularly wanting in watercourses the surveyor was sought and rebuked for his deception the map having numerous streams c why did you lay down all these streams here where none are to be found demanded the irritated purchaser pointing to the document whywhy who the dl ever saw a map without rivers was the answer editor  footnote 18 in nothing was the difference of character between the people of new england and those of the middle colonies more apparent than in the nature of the dwellings in new york for instance men worth thousands dwelt in humble low usually one story dwellings of stone having windowshutters frequently within as well as without and the other appliances of comfort whereas the farmer farther east was seldom satisfied though his means were limited unless he lived in a house as good as his neighbours and the strife dotted the whole of their colonies with wooden buildings of great pretension for the age that rarely had even exterior shutters and which frequently stood for generations unfinished the difference was not of dutch origin for it was just as apparent in new jersey or pennsylvania as in new york and i think it may be attributed to a very obvious consequence of a general equality of condition a state of society in which no one is content to wear even the semblance of poverty but those who cannot by any means prevent it but in which all strive to get as high as possible in appearances at leasteditor     chapter xi    bid physicians talk our veins to temper   and with an argument newset a pulse   then think my lord of reasoning unto love    young   as the road from the ferry into the town ran along the bank of the river we reached the point where the rev mr worden had landed precisely at the same instant with his pursuers who had been obliged to make a little circuit in order to get off the ice i do not know which party regarded the other in the greatest astonishmentthe hunted or the hunters the sleigh had in it two finelooking young fellows that spoke english with a slight dutch accent and three young women whose bright coalblack eyes betokened surprise a little mitigated by a desire to laugh seeing that we were all strangers i suppose and that we claimed the runaway as belonging to our party one of the young men raised his cap very respectfully and opened the discourse by asking in a very civil tone  what ails the reverent gentleman to make him run so fast  run exclaimed mr worden whose lungs had been playing like a blacksmiths bellowsrun and who would not run to save himself from being drowned  drowned repeated the young dutchman looking round at the river as if to ascertain whether the ice were actually movingwhy does the dominie suppose there was any danger of that  as mr wordens bellows were still hard at work i explained to the young albanians that we were strangers just arrived from the vicinity of new york that we were unaccustomed to frozen rivers and had never crossed one on the ice before that our reverend companion had chosen to walk at a distance from the road in order to be in less danger should any team break in and that he had naturally run to avoid their sleigh when he saw it approaching the albanians heard this account in respectful silence though i could see the two young men casting sly glances at each other and that even the ladies had some little difficulty in altogether suppressing their smiles when it was through the oldest of the dutchmena fine daredevil roysteringlooking fellow of four or fiveandtwenty whose dress and mien however denoted a person of the upper classbegged a thousand pardons for his mistake quitting his sleigh and insisting on having the honours of shaking hands with the whole of us his name was ten eyck he said guert ten eyck and he asked permission as we were strangers of doing the honour of albany to us everybody in the place knew him which as we afterwards ascertained was true enough for he had just as much reputation for fun and frolic as at all comported with respectability keeping along as it were on the very verge of the pale of reputable people without being thrown entirely out of it the young females with him were a shade below his own natural position in society tolerating his frolics on account of this circumstance aided as it was by a singularly manly face and person a hearty and ready laugh a full purse and possibly by the secret hope of being the happy individual who was designed by providence to convert a reformed rake into the best of husbands in a word he was always welcome with them when those a little above them felt more disposed to frown  of course all this was unknown to us at the time and we accepted guert ten eycks proffers of civility in the spirit in which they were offered he inquired at what tavern we intended to stop and promised an early call then shaking us all round by the hand again with great cordiality he took his leave his companion doffed a very dashing high wolfskin cap to us and the blackeyed trio on the hindseat smiled graciously and away they drove at a furious rate startling all the echoes of albany with their bells by this time mr worden was seated and we followed more moderately our team having none of the dutch courage of a pair of horses fresh from the stable such were the circumstances under which we made our entrance into the ancient city of albany we were all in hopes the little affair of the chase would soon be forgotten for no one likes to be associated with a ridiculous circumstance but we counted without our host guert ten eyck was not of a temperament to let such an affair sleep but as i afterwards ascertained he told it with the laughing embellishments that belonged to his reckless character until in turn the rev mr worden came to be known throughout all that region by the nickname of the loping dominie  the reader may be assured our eyes were about us as we drove through the streets of the second town in the colony we were not unaccustomed to houses constructed in the dutch style in new york though the english mode of building had been most in vogue there for half a century it was not so with albany which remained essentially a dutch town in 1758 we heard little beside dutch as we passed along the women scolded their children in low dutch a use by the way for which the language appears singularly well adapted the negroes sang dutch songs the men called to each other in dutch and dutch rang in our ears as we walked our horses through the streets towards the tavern there were many soldiers about and other proofs of the presence of a considerable military force were not wanting still the place struck me as very provincial and peculiar after new york nearly all the houses were built with their gables to the streets and each had heavy wooden dutch stoops with seats at its door a few had small courtyards in front and here and there was a building of somewhat more pretension than usual i do not think however there were fifty houses in the place that were built with their gables off the line of the streets 19  we were no sooner housed than dirck and i sallied forth to look at the place here we were in one of the oldest towns of america a place that could boast of much more than a centurys existence and it was natural to feel curious to look about one our inn was in the principal streetthat which led up the hill towards the fort this street was a wide avenue that quite put broadway out of countenance so far as mere width was concerned the streets that led out of it however were principally little better than lanes as if the space that had been given to two or three of the main streets had been taken off of the remainder the high street as we english would call it was occupied by sleds filled with wood for sale sleds loaded with geese turkeys tame and wild and poultry of all sorts sleds with venison still in the skin piled up in heaps call these eatables being collected in unusual quantities as we were told to meet the extraordinary demand created by the different military messes deer were no strangers to us for long island was full of all sorts of game as were the upper counties of new jersey even westchester old and well settled as it had become was not yet altogether clear of deer and nothing was easier than to knock over a buck in the highlands nevertheless i had never seen venison wild turkeys and sturgeons in such quantities as they were to be seen that day in the principal street of albany  the crowd collected in this street the sleighs that were whirling past filled with young men and maidens the incessant jingling of bells the spluttering and jawing in low dutch the hearty english oaths of serjeants and sutlersmen and cooks of messes the loud laughs of the blacks and the beauty of the cold clear day altogether produced some such effect on me as i had experienced when i went to the theatre not the least striking picture of the scene was jason in the middle of the street gaping about him in the cockedhat the peagreen coat and the striped woollen stockings  dirck and myself naturally examined the churches these were two as has been said alreadyone for the dutch and the other for the english the first was the oldest it stood at the point where the two principal streets crossed each other and in the centre of the street leaving sufficient passages all round it the building was square with a high pointed roof having a belfry and weathercock on its apex windows with diamond panes and painted glass and a porch that was well suited both to the climate and to appearances 20  we were examining this structure when guert ten eyck accosted us in his frank offhand way  your servant mr littlepage your servant mr follock he cried again shaking each cordially by the hand i was on the way to the tavern to look you up when i accidentally saw you here a few gentlemen of my acquaintance who are in the habit of supping together in the winter time meet for the last jollification of the season tonight and they have all expresst a wish to have the pleasure of your company i hope you will allow me to say you will come we meet at nine sup at ten and break up at twelve quite regularly in a very sedate and prudent manner  there was something so frank and cordial so simple and straightforward in this invitation that we did not know how to decline it we both knew that the name of ten eyck was respectable in the colony our new acquaintance was well dressed he seemed to be in good company when we first met him his sleigh and horses had been actually of a more dashing stamp than usual and his own attire had all the peculiarities of a gentlemans with the addition of something even more decided and knowing than was common it is true the style of these peculiarities was not exactly such as i had seen in the air manners and personal decorations of those of billings and harris but they were none the less striking and none the less attractive the two englishmen being macaronis from london and ten eyck being a buck of albany  i thank you very heartily mr ten eyck i answered both for myself and for my friend  and will let me come for you at halfpast eight to show you the way  why yes sir i was about to say as much if it be not giving you too much trouble  do not speak of trrouplethis last word will give a very good notion of guerts accent which i cannot stop to imitate at all times in writingand do not say your frent but your frentz  as to the two that are not here i cannot positively answer yonder however is one that can speak for himself  i see him mr littlepage and will answer for him on my own account depent on it he will come but the dominiehe has a hearty look and can help eat a turkey and swallow a glass of goot madeirai think i can rely on a man cannot take all that active exercise without food  mr worden is a very companionable man and is excellent company at a suppertable i will communicate your invitation and hope to be able to prevail on him to be of the party  tat is enough sir returned ten eyck or guert as i shall henceforth call him in general vere dere ist a vill dere ist a vay guert frequently broke out in such specimens of broken english while at other times he would speak almost as well as any of us so got pless you my dear mr littlepage and make us lasting friends i like your countenance and my eye never deceives me in these matters  here guert shook us both by the hand again most cordially and left us dirck and i next strolled up the hill going as high as the english church which stood also in the centre of the principal street an imposing and massive edifice in stone with the exception of mother trinity in new york this was the largest and altogether the most important edifice devoted to the worship of my own church i had ever seen in westchester there were several of queen annes churches but none on a scale to compare with this our small edifices were usually without galleries steeples towers or bells while st peters albany if not actually st peters rome was a building of which a man might be proud a little to our surprise we found the rev mr worden and mr jason newcome had met at the door of this edifice having sent a boy to the sexton in quest of the key in a minute or two the urchin returned bringing not only the key of the church but the excuses of the sexton for not coming himself the door was opened and we went in  i have always admired the decorous and spiritual manner in which the rev mr worden entered a building that had been consecrated to the services of the deity i know not how to describe it but it proved how completely he had been drilled in the decencies of his profession off came his hat of course and his manner however facetious and easy it may have been the moment before changed on the instant to gravity and decorum not so with jason he entered st peters albany with exactly the same indifferent and cynical air with which he had seemed to regard everything but money since he entered york colony usually he wore his cockedhat on the back of his head thereby lending himself a lolloping negligent and at the same time defying air but i observed that as we all uncovered he brought his own beaver up over his eyebrows in a species of military bravado to uncover to a church in his view of the matter was a sort of idolatry there might be images about for anything he knew and a man could never be enough on his guard agin being carried away by such evil deceptions as he had once before answered to a remonstrance of mine for wearing his hat in our own parish church  i found the interior of st peters quite as imposing as its exterior three of the pews were canopied having coats of arms on their canopies these the boy told us belonged to the van rensselaer and schuyler families all these were covered with black cloth in mourning for some death in those ancient families which were closely allied i was very much struck with the dignified air that these patrician seats gave the house of god 21  there were also several hatchments suspended against the walls some being placed there in commemoration of officers of rank from home who had died in the kings service in the colony and others to mark the deaths of some of the more distinguished of our own people  mr worden expressed himself well pleased with appearances of things in and about this building though jason regarded all with illconcealed disgust  what is the meaning of them pews with tops to them corny the pedagogue whispered me afraid to encounter the parsons remarks by his own criticism  they are the pews of families of distinction in this place mr newcome and the canopies or tops as you call them are honourable signs of their owners conditions  do you think their owners will sit under such coverings in paradise corny continued jason with a sneer  it is impossible for me to say sir it is probable however the just will not require any such mark to distinguish them from the unjust  let me see said jason looking round and affecting to count there are just threebishop priest and deacon i suppose waal theres a seat for each and they can be comfortable here whatever may turn up hereater  i turned away unwilling to dispute the point for i knew it was as hopeless to expect that a danbury man would feel like a new yorker on such a subject as it was to expect that a new yorker could be made to adopt danbury sentiments as for the argument however i have heard others of pretty much the same calibre often urged against the three orders of the ministry  on quitting st peters i communicated the invitation of guert ten eyck to mr worden and urged him to be of the party i could see that the notion of a pleasant supper was anything but unpleasant to the missionary still he had his scruples inasmuch as he had not yet seen his reverend brother who had the charge of st peters did not know exactly the temper of his mind and was particularly desirous of officiating for him in the presence of the principal personages of the place on the approaching sunday he had written a note to the chaplain for the person who had the cure of the episcopalians held that rank in the army st peters being as much of an official chapel as a parish church and he must have an interview with that individual before he could decide fortunately as we descended the street towards our inn we saw the very person in question the marks of the common office that these two divines bore about their persons in their dress sufficed to make them known to each other at a glance in five minutes they had shaken hands heard each mans account of himself had given and accepted the invitation to preach and were otherwise on free and easy terms mr worden was to dine in the fort with the chaplain we then walked forward towards the tavern  by the way mr  said mr worden in a parenthesis of the discourse the family of ten eyck is quite respectable here in albany  very much so sira family that is held in much esteem i shall count on your assisting me morning and evening my dear mr worden  it is surprising how the clergy do depend on each other for assistance  make your arrangements accordingly my good brotheri am quite fresh and have brought a good stock of sermons not knowing how much might remain to be done in the army corny in a halfwhisper you can let our new friends know that i will sup with them and harkeejust drop a hint to them that i am none of your puritans  here then we found everything in a very fair way to bring us all out in society within the first two hours of our arrival mr worden was engaged to preach the next day but one and he was engaged to supper that same day all looked promising and i hurried on in order to ascertain if guert ten eyck had made his promised call as before he was met in the street and the acceptance of the dominie was duly communicated guert seemed highly pleased at this success and he left me promising to be punctual to his hour in the mean time we had to dine  the dinner proved a good one and as mr worden remarked it was quite lucky that the principal dish was venison a meat that was so easy of digestion as to promise no great obstacle to the accommodation of the supper he should dine on venison therefore and he advised all three of us to follow his example but certain dutch dishes attracted the eye and taste of dirck while jason had alighted on a hash of some sort or other that he did not quit until he had effectually disposed of it as for myself i confess the venison was so much to my taste that i stuck by the parson we had our wine too and left the table early in order not to interfere with the business of the night  after dinner it was proposed to walk out in a body to make a further examination of the place and to see if we could not fall in with an army contractor who might be disposed to relieve dirck and myself of some portion of our charge luck again threw us in the way of guert ten eyck who seemed to live in the public street in the course of a brief conversation that took place as a passing compliment i happened to mention a wish to ascertain where one might dispose of a few horses and of two or three sleighloads of flour pork c c  my dear mr littlepage said guert with a frank smile and a friendly shake of the hand i am delighted that you have mentioned these matters to me i can take you to the very man you wish to see a heavy armycontractor who is buying up everything of the sort he can lay his hands on  of course i was as much delighted as guert could very well be and left my party to proceed at once to the contractors office with the greatest alacrity dirck accompanying me as we went along our new friend advised us not to be very backward in the way of price since the king paid in the long run  rich dealers ought to pay well he added and i can tell you as a useful thing to know that orders came on no later than yesterday to buy up everything of the soil that offered put sleigh and harness at once all in a heap on the kings servants  i thought the idea not a bad one and promised to profit by it guert was as good as his word and i was properly introduced to the contractor my business was no sooner mentioned than i was desired to send a messenger round to the stables in order that my conveyance team c might make their appearance as for the articles that were still on the road i had very little trouble the contractor knew my father and he no sooner heard that mr littlepage of satanstoe was the owner of the provisions than he purchased the whole on the guaranty of his name for the pork i was to receive two halfjoes the barrel and for the flour one this was a good sale the horses would be taken if serviceable as the contractor did not question as would the lumbersleighs though the prices could not be set until the different animals and objects were seen and examined  it is amazing what war will do for commerce as well as what it does against it the demand for everything that the judgment of my father had anticipated was so great that the contractor told me very frankly the sleighs would not be unloaded in albany at all but would be sent on north on the line of the expected route of the army so as to anticipate the disappearance of the snow and the breaking up of the roads  you shall be paid liberally for your teams harness and sleighs he continued though no sum can be named until i see them these are not times when operations are to be retarded on account of a few joes more or less for the kings service must go on i very well know that major littlepage and col follock both understand what they are about and have sent us the right sort of things the horses are very likely a little old but are good for one campaign better than if younger perhaps and were they colts we could get no more than that out of them these movements in the woods destroy man and beast and cost mints of money ah there comes your team  sure enough the sleigh drove round from the tavern and we all went out to look at the horses c guert now became an important person on the subject of horses he was accounted an oracle and he talked moved and acted like one in all respects the first thing he did was to step up to the animals head and to look into the mouth of each in succession the knowing way in which this was done the coolness of the interference and the fine manly form of the intruder would have given him at once a certain importance and a connection with what was going on had not his character for judgment in horseflesh been well established far and near in that quarter of the country  upon my word wonderfully good mouths exclaimed guert when through you must have your grain ground mr littlepage or the teeth never could have stood it so well  what age do you call the animals guert demanded the contractor  that is not so easily told sir i admit that they are aged horses but they may be eight or nine or even ten as for what can be told by their teeth by the looks of their limbs i should think they might be nine coming grass  the nearhorse is eleven i said and the offhorse is supposed to be  poh poh littlepage interrupted guert making signs to me to be quietyou may think the offhorse ten but i should place him at about nine his teeth are excellent and there is not even a windgall on his legs there is a cross of the flemish in that beast  well and what do you say the pair is worth master guert demanded the contractor who seemed to have a certain confidence in his friends judgment notwithstanding the recklessness and freedom of his manner twelve halfjoes for them both  that will never do mr contractor answered guert shaking his head in times like these such stout animals and beasts too in such heart and condition ought to bring fifteen  fifteen let it be then if mr littlepage assents now for the sleigh and harness and skins i suppose mr littlepage will part with the skins too as he can have no use for them without the sleigh  have you mr contractor asked guert a little abruptly that bearskin fills my eye beautifully and if mr littlepage will take a guinea for it here is his money  as this was a fair price it was accepted though i pressed the skin on guert as a gift in remembrance of our accidental acquaintance this offer however he respectfully but firmly resisted and here i will take occasion to say lest the reader be misled by what is met with in works of fiction and other light and vain productions that in all my dealings and future connection with guert i found him strictly honourable in money matters it is true i would not have purchased a horse on his recommendation if he owned the beast but we all know how the best men yield in their morals when they come to deal in horses i should scarcely have expected mr worden to be orthodox in making such bargains but on all other subjects connected with money guert ten eyck was one of the honestest fellows i ever dealt with  the contractor took the sleigh harness and skins at seven more halfjoes making twentythree for the whole outfit this was certainly receiving two halfjoes more than my father had expected and i owed the gain of sixteen dollars to guerts friendly and bold interference as soon as the prices were settled the money was paid me in good spanish gold and i handed over to dirck the portion that properly fell to his fathers share as it was understood that the remaining horses sleighs harness provisions c were to be taken at an appraisal the instant they arrived this hours work relieved my friend and myself from any further trouble on the subject of the property entrusted to our care and a relief it was to be so well rid of a responsibility that was as new as it was heavy to each of us  the reader will get some idea of the pressure of affairs and how necessary it was felt to be on the alert in the month of marcha time of the year when twentyfour hours might bring about a change in the seasonby the circumstance that the contractor sent his new purchase to be loaded up from the door of his office with orders to proceed on north with supplies for a depot that he was making as near to lake george as was deemed prudent the french being in force at ticonderoga and crown point two posts at the head of champlain a distance considerably less than a hundred miles from albany whatever was forwarded as far as lake george while the snow lasted could then be sent on with the army in the contemplated operations of the approaching summer by means of the two lakes and their northern outlets  well mr littlepage cried guert heartily that affair is well disposed of you got goot prices and i hope the king has got goot horses they are a little venerable perhaps but what of that the army would knock up the best and youngest beast in the colony in one campaign in the woots and it can do no more with the oldest and worst shall we walk rount into the main street gentlemen this is about the hour when the young ladies are apt to start for their afternoon sleighing  i suppose the ladies of albany are remarkable for their beauty mr ten eyck i rejoined wishing to say something agreeable to a man who seemed so desirous of serving me the specimens i saw in crossing the river this morning would induce a stranger to think so  sir replied guert walking towards the great avenue of the town we are content with our ladies in general for they are charming warmhearted and amiable but there has been an arrival among us this winter from your part of the colony that has almost melted the ice on the hudson  my heart beat quicker for i could only think of one being of her sex as likely to produce such a sensation still i could not abstain from making a direct inquiry on the subject  from our part of the colony mr ten eyckyou mean from new york probably  yes sir as a matter of course there are several beautiful english women who have come up with the army but no colonel major or captain has brought such paragons with him as herman mordaunt a gentleman who may be known to you by name  personally too sir herman mordaunt is even a kinsman of dirck follock my friend here  then is mr follock to be envied since he can call cousin with so charming a young lady as anneke mordaunt  true sir most true i interrupted eagerly anne mordaunt passes for the sweetest girl in york  i do not know that i should go quite as far as that mr littlepage returned guert moderating his warmth in a manner that a little surprised me though his handsome face still glowed with honest natural admiration since there is a miss mary wallace in her company that is quite as much thought of here in albany as her friend miss mordaunt  mary wallace the idea of comparing the silent thoughtful excellent though she were mary wallace with anneke could never have crossed my mind still mary wallace certainly was a very charming girl she was even handsome had a placid saintlike character of countenance that had often struck me singular beauty and development of form and in any other company than that of annekes might well have attracted the first attention of the most fastidious beholder  and guert ten eyck admiredperhaps loved mary wallace here then was fresh evidence how much we are all inclined to love our opposites to form close friendships with those who resemble us least principles excepted for virtue can never cling to vice and how much more interest novelty possesses in the human breast than the repetition of things to which we are accustomed no two beings could be less alike than mary wallace and guert ten eyck yet the last admired the first  miss wallace is a very charming young lady mr ten eyck i rejoined as soon as wonder would allow me to answer and i am not surprised you speak of her in terms of so much admiration  guert stopped short in the street looked me full in the face with an expression of truth that could not well be feigned squeezed my hand fervently and rejoined with a strange frankness that i could not have imitated to be master of all i saw  admiration mr littlepage is not a word strong enough for what i feel for mary i would marry her in the next hour and love and cherish her for all the rest of my life i worship her and love the earth she treads on  and you have told her this mr ten eyck  fifty times sir she has now been two months in albany and my love was secured within the first week i offered myself too soon i fear for mary is a prutent sensible young woman and girls of that character are apt to distrust the youth who is too quick in his advances they like to be served sir for seven years and seven years as joseph served for potiphar  you mean most likely mr ten eyck as jacob served for rachel  well sir it may be as you say dough i tink that in our dutch bibles it stands as joseph served for potipharbut you know what i mean mr littlepage if you wish to see the ladies and will come with me i will go to a place where herman mordaunts sleigh invariably passes at this hour for the ladies almost live in the air i never miss the occasion of seeing them  i had now a clue to guerts being so much in the street he was as good as his word however for he took a stand near the dutch church where i soon had the happiness of seeing anneke and her friend driving past on their evenings excursion how blooming and lovely the former looked mary wallaces eye turned i fancied understandingly to the corner where guert had placed himself and her colour deepened as she returned his bow but the start of surprise the smile and the lightening eye of anneke as she unexpectedly saw me filled my soul with delight almost too great to be borne  footnote 19 the population of albany could not have reached 4000 in 1758 its dutch character remained down to the close of this century with gradual changes the writer can remember when quite as much dutch as english was heard in the streets of albany though it has now nearly disappeared the present population must be near 40000  mr littlepages description was doubtless correct at the time he wrote but albany would now be considered a firstclass country town in europe it has much better claims to compare with the towns of the old world in this character than new york has to compare with their capitalseditor  footnote 20 there were two churches of this character built on this spot the second much larger than the first but of the same form was built round the other in which service was held to the last when it was literally thrown out of the windows of its successor the last edifice disappeared about forty years sinceeditor  footnote 21 i cannot recollect one of these canopied pews that is now standing in this part of the union the last of my knowledge were in st marks new york and i believe belonged to the stuyvesants the patron family of that church they were taken down when that building was repaired a few years since this is one of the most innocent of all our innovations of this character distinctions in the house of god are opposed to the very spirit of the christian religion and it were far more fitting that pews should be altogether done away with the true mode of assembling under the sacred roof than that men should be classed even at the foot of the altar  it may be questioned if a hatchment is now hung up either on the dwelling or in a church in any part of america they were to be seen however in the early part of the present century whenever any such traces of ancient usages are met with among us by the traveller from the old world he is apt to mistake them for the shadows that coming events cast before instead of those of the pasteditor     chapter xii    then the wine it gets into their heads   and turns the wit out of its station   nonsense gets in in its stead   and their puns are now all botheration    the punning society   guert ten eyck looked at me expressively as the sleigh whirled round an angle of the building and disappeared he then proposed that we should proceed on ascending the main street i was not a little surprised at discovering the sort of amusement that was going on and in which it seemed to me all the youths of the place were engaged by youths i do not mean lads of twelve and fourteen but young men of eighteen and twenty the amusement being that of sliding down hill or coasting as i am told it is called in boston the acclivity was quite sharp and of sufficient length to give an impetus to the sled that was set in motion at a short distance above the english church an impetus that would carry it past the dutch churcha distance that was somewhat more than a quarter of a mile the handsleds employed were of a size and construction suited to the dimensions of those that used them and as a matter of course there was no new yorker that had not learned how to govern the motion of one of these vehicles even when gliding down the steepest descent with the nicest delicacy and greatest ease as children or boys as late in life as fourteen even every male in the colony and not a few of the females had acquired this art but this was the first place in which i had ever known adults to engage in the sport the accidental circumstance of a hills belonging to the principal street joined to the severity of the winters had rendered an amusement suited to grown people that elsewhere was monopolized by the children  by the time we had ascended as high as the english church a party of young officers came down from the fort gay with the glass and the song of the regimental mess no sooner did they reach the startingpoint than three or four of the more youthful got possession of as many sleds and off they went like the shot starting from its gun nobody seemed to think it strange but on the contrary i observed that the elderly people looked on with a complacent gravity that seemed to say how vividly the sight recalled the days of their own youth i cannot say however that the strangers succeeded very well in managing their sleds generally meeting with some stoppage before they reached the bottom of the hill  will you take a slide mr littlepage guert demanded with a courteous gravity that showed how serious a business he fancied the sport here is a large and strong sled that will carry double and you might trust yourself with me though a regiment of horse were paraded down below  but are we not a little too old for such an amusement in the streets of a large town mr ten eyck i answered doubtingly looking round me in an uncertain manner as one who did not like to adventure even while he hesitated to refuse those kings officers are privileged people you know  no man has a higher privilege to use the streets of albany than mr cornelius littlepage sir i can assure you the young ladies often honour me with their company and no accident has ever happened  do the young ladies venture to ride down this street mr ten eyck  not often sir i grant you though that has been done too of a moonlight night there is a more retired spot at no great distance from this street however to which the ladies are rather more partial look mr littlepagethere goes the hon capt monson of the th and he will be down the hill and up again before we are off unless you hurry take your seat ladyfashion and leave me to manage the sled  what could i do guert had been so very civil was so much in earnest everybody seemed to expect it of me and the hon capt monson was already a hundred yards on his way to the bottom shooting ahead with the velocity of an arrow i took my seat accordingly placing my feet together on the front round ladyfashion as directed in an instant guerts manly frame was behind me with a leg extended on each side of the sled the government of which as every american who has been born north of the potomac well knows is effected by delicate touches of the heels guert called out to the boys for a shove and away we went like the ship that is bound for her destined element as the poets say we got a good start and left the spot as the arrow leaves its bow  shall i own the truth and confess i had a momentary pleasure in the excitement produced by the rapidity of the motion by the race we were running with another sled and by the skill and ease with which guert almost without touching the ground carried us unharmed through sundry narrow passages and along the line of wood and venison loaded sleighs barely clearing the noses of their horses i forgot that i was making this strange exhibition of myself in a strange place and almost in strange company so rapid was our motion however that the danger of being recognised was not very great and there were so many to divide attention that the act of folly would have been overlooked but for a most untimely and unexpected accident we had gone the entire length between the two churches with great successseveral steady grave and respectablelooking old burghers calling out on a high key vell done guertfor guert appeared to be a general favourite in the sense of fun and frolic at leastwhen turning an angle of the old dutch temple in the ambitious wish of shooting past it in order to run still lower and shoot off the wharf upon the river we found ourselves in imminent danger of running under the forelegs of two foaming horses that were whirling a sleigh around the same corner of the church nothing saved us but guerts readiness and physical power by digging a heel into the snow he caused the sled to fly round at a right angle to its former course and us to fly off it heels over head without much regard to the proprieties so far as postures or grace was concerned the negro who drove the sleigh pulled up at the same instant with so much force as to throw his horses on their haunches the result of these combined movements was to cause guert and myself to roll over in such a way as to regain our feet directly alongside of the sleigh in rising to my feet indeed i laid a hand on the side of the vehicle in order to assist me in the effort  what a sight met my eyes in the front stood the negro grinning from ear to ear for he deemed every disaster that occurred on runners a fit subject for merriment who ever did anything but laugh at seeing a sleigh upsetand it was consequently quite in rule to do so on seeing two overgrown boys roll over from a handsled i could have knocked the rascal down with a good will but it would not have done to resent mirth that proceeded from so legitimate a cause had i been disposed to act differently however the strength and courage necessary to effect such a purpose would have been annihilated in me by finding myself standing within three feet and directly in front of anneke mordaunt and mary wallace the shame at being thus detected in the disastrous termination of so boyish a flight at first nearly overcame me how guert felt i do not know but for a single instant i wished him in the middle of the hudson and all albany its dutch church sleds hill and smoking burghers included on top of him  mr littlepage burst out of the rosy lips of anneke in a tone of voice that was not to be misunderstood  mr guert ten eyck exclaimed mary wallace in an accent and manner that bespoke chagrin  at your service miss mary answered guert who looked a little sheepish at the result of his exploit though for a reason i did not at first comprehend brushing some snow from his cap at the same timeat your service now and ever miss mary but do not suppose it was awkwardness that produced this accident i entreat of you it was altogether the fault of the boy who is stationed to give warning of sleighs below the church who must have left his post whenever either of you young ladies will do me the honour to take a seat with me i will pledge my character as an albanian to carry her to the foot of the highest and steepest hill in town without disturbing a riband  marv wallace made no answer and i fancied she looked a little sad it is possible anneke saw and understood this feeling for she answered with a spirit that i had never seen her manifest before  no no mr ten eyck she said when miss wallace or i wish to ride down hill and become little girls again we will trust ourselves with boys whose constant practice will be likely to render them more expert than men can be who have had time to forget the habits of their childhood pompey we will return home  the cold inclination of the head that succeeded while it was sufficiently gracious to preserve appearances proved too plainly that neither guert nor myself had risen in the estimation of his mistress by this boyish exhibition of his skill with the handsled had either of these young ladies been albanians it is probable they would have laughed at our mishap but no high hill running directly into new york the custom that prevailed at albany did not prevail in the capital small boys alone used the handsled in that part of the colony while the taste continued longer among the more stable and constant dutch of course we had nothing to do but to make profound bows and suffer the negro to move on  there it is littlepage exclaimed guert with a species of sigh i shall have nothing but iced looks for the next week and all for riding down hill four or five years later than is the rule everybody hereabouts uses the handsled until eighteen or so and i am only fiveandtwenty pray what may be your age my dear fellow  twentyone only about a month since i wish with all my heart it were ten  turned the cornerwell thats unlucky but we must make the best of it my taste is for fun and so i have admitted to miss wallace twenty times but she tells me that after a certain period men should look to graver things and think of their country she has lectured me already once on the subject of sliding though she allows that skating is a manly exercise  when a lady takes the trouble to lecture it is a sure sign she feels some interest in the subject  by st nicholas i never thought of that littlepage cried guert who notwithstanding the great advantages he possessed in the way of face and figure turned out to have less personal vanity about him than almost any man i ever met with lecture me she has and that more than once too  the lady who lectures me sir will not get rid of me at the end of the discourse  thats manly i like it littlepage and i like you i foresee we shall be great friends and well talk more of this matter another time now mary has spoken to me of the war and hinted that a single man like myself with the world before him might do something to make his name known in it i did not like that for a girl who loved a fellow would not wish to have him shot  a girl who took no interest in her suitor mr ten eyck would not care whether he did anything or not but i must now quit you being under an engagement to meet mr worden at the inn at six  guert and i shook hands for the tenth or twelfth time that day parting with an understanding that he was to call for us to accompany our party to the supper at the previously appointed hour as i walked towards the inn i pondered on what had just occurred in a most mortified temper that anneke was displeased was only too apparent and i felt fearful that her displeasure was not entirely free from contempt as for guerts case it did not strike me as being half so desperate as my own for there was nothing unnatural but something quite the reverse in women of sense and stability when they admire any youth of opposite temperamentand i remembered to have heard my grandfather say that such was apt to be the casewishing to elevate their suitors in their pursuits and characters had anneke taken the pains to remonstrate with me about the folly of what i had done i should have been encouraged but the cold indifference of her manner not to call it contempt cut me to the quick it is true anneke seemed to feel most on her friends account but i could not mistake the look of surprise with which she saw me cornelius littlepage rise from under her sleigh and stand brushing the snow from my clothes like a great calf as i was no man can bear to be rendered ridiculous in the presence of the woman he loves  near the inn i met dirck his whole face illuminated with a look of pleasure  i have just met anneke and mary wallace he said and they stopped their sleigh to speak to me herman mordaunt has been here half the winter and he means to remain most of the summer there will be no lilacsbush this season the girls told me but herman mordaunt has got a house where he lives with his own servants and boils his own pot as he calls it we shall be at home there of course for you are such a favourite corny ever since that affair of the lion as for anneke i never saw her looking so beautiful  did miss mordaunt say she would be happy to see us on the old footing dirck  did shei suppose so she said i shall be glad to see you cousin dirck whenever you can come and i hope you will bring with you sometimes the clergyman of whom you have spoken  but nothing of jason newcome or corny littlepage tell the truth at once dirck my name was not mentioned  indeet it was tough i mentioned it several times and told them how long we had been on the roat and how you trove and how you had sold the sleigh and horses already and a dozen other tings oh we talket a great deal of you corny that is i dit and the girls listened  was my name mentioned by either of the young ladies dirck in direct terms  to be sure anneke had something to say about you though it was so much out of the way i can hardly tell you what it was now oh i remember she said i have seen mr littlepage and think he has grown since we last met he promises to make a man one of these days what could tat mean corny  that i am a fool a great overgrown boy and wish i had never seen albany thats what it means come let us go in mr worden will be expecting us ha who the devils that dirck  a loud dutch shout from dirck broke out of him regardless of the street and his whole face lighted up into a broad sympathetic smile i had caught a glimpse of a sled coming down the acclivity we were slowly ascending which sled glided past us just as i got the words out of my mouth it was occupied by jason alone who seemed just as much charmed with the sport as any other grownup boy on the hill there he went the cockedhat uppermost the peagreen coat beneath and the striped woollens and heavy plated buckles stuck out one on each side governing the movement of the sled with the readiness of a lad accustomed to the business  that must be capital fun corny my companion said scarce able to contain himself for the pleasure he felt i have a great mind to borrow a sled and take a turn myself  not if you intend to visit miss mordaunt dirck take my word for it she does not like to see men following the pleasures of boys  dirck stared at me but being taciturn by nature he said nothing and we entered the house there we found mr worden reading over an old sermon in readiness for his next sundays business and sitting down we began to compare notes on the subject of the town and its advantages the divine was in raptures as for the dutch he cared little for them and had seen but little of them overlooking them in a very natural metropolitan sort of way but he had found so many english officers had heard so much from home and had received so many invitations that his campaign promised nothing but agreeables we sat chatting over these matters until the tea was served and for an hour or two afterwards my bargains were applauded my promptitudethe promptitude of guert would have been more justwas commended and i was told that my parents should hear the whole truth in the matter in a word our mentor being in goodhumour with himself was disposed to be in good humour with every one else  at the appointed hour guert came to escort us to the place of meeting he was courteous attentive and as frank as the air he breathed in manner mr worden took to him excessively and it was soon apparent that he and young ten eyck were likely to become warm friends  you must know gentlemen that the party to which i have had the honour of inviting you will be composed of some of the heartiest young men in albany if not in the colony we meet once a month in the house of an old bachelor who belongs to us and who will be delighted to converse with you mr worden on the subject of religion mr van brunt is very expert in religion and we make him the umpire of all our disputes and bets on that subject  this sounded a little ominous i thought but mr worden was not a man to be frightened from a good hot supper by halfadozen inadvertent words he could tolerate even a religious discussion with such an object in view he walked on side by side with guert and we were soon at the door of the house of mr van brunt the bachelor in divinity as i nicknamed him guert entered without knocking and ushered us into the presence of our quasi host  we found in the room a company of just twelve guert included that being the entire number of the club it struck me at the first glance that the whole set had a sort of slidedownhill aspect and that we were likely to make a night of it my acquaintance with dirck and indeed my connection with the old race had not left me ignorant of a certain peculiarity in the dutch character sober sedate nay phlegmatic as they usually appeared to be their roystering was on a pretty high key when it once fairly commenced we thought one lad of the old race down in westchester fully a match for two of the anglosaxon breed when it came to a hard setto no ordinary fun appeasing the longings of an excited dutchman tradition had let me into a good many secrets connected with their excesses and i had heard the young albanians often mentioned as being at the head of their profession in these particulars  nothing could be more decorous or considerate however than our introduction and reception the young men seemed particularly gratified at having a clergyman of their party and i make no doubt it was intended that the evening should be one of unusual sobriety and moderation i heard the word dominie whispered from mouth to mouth and it was easy to see the effect it produced most eyes were fastened on van brunt a redfaced squarebuilt somewhat dissolutelooking man of fortyfive who seemed to find his apology for associating with persons so much his juniors in his habits and possibly in the necessity of the case as men of his own years might not like his company  and gentlemen it is dry business standing here looking at each other observed mr van brunt and we will take a little punch to moisten our hearts as well as our throats guert yon is the pitcher  guert made good use of the pitcher and each man had his glass of puncha beverage then as now much used in the colony i must acknowledge that the mixture was very knowingly put together though i had no sooner swallowed my glass than i discovered it was confounded strong not so with guert not only did he swallow one glass but he swallowed two in quick succession like a man who was thirsty standing at the time in a fine manly erect attitude as one who trifled with something that did not half tax his powers the pitcher though quite large was emptied at that one assault in proof of which it was turned bottom upwards by guert himself  conversation followed most of it being in english out of compliment to the dominie who was not supposed to understand dutch this was an error however mr worden making out tolerably well in that language when he tried i was felicitated on the bargains i had made with the contractor and many kind and hospitable attempts were made to welcome me in a frank hearty manner among strangers i confess i was touched by these honest and sincere endeavours to put me at my ease and when a second pitcher of punch was brought round i took another glass with right goodwill while guert as usual took two though the liquor he drank i had many occasions to ascertain subsequently produced no more visible effect on him in the way of physical consequences than if he had not swallowed it guert was no drunkard far from it he could only drink all near him under the table and remain firm in his chair himself such men usually escape the imputation of being sots though they are very apt to pay the penalty of their successes at the close of their career these are the men who break down at sixty if not earlier becoming subject to paralysis indigestion and other similar evils  such was the state of things the company gradually getting into a very pleasant humour when guert was called out of the room by one of the blacks who bore a most ominous physiognomy while making his request he was gone but a moment when he returned with a certain sort of consternation painted in his own handsome face mr van brunt was called into a corner where two or three more of the principal persons present soon collected in an earnest halfwhispered discourse i was seated so near this group as occasionally to overhear a few expressions though to get no clear clue to its meaning the words i overheard were old cuylercapital suppervenison and duckspartridges and quailsknows us allnever dodominie the manstrangershow to do it and several other similar expressions which left a vague impression on my mind that our supper was in great peril from some cause or other but what that cause was i could not learn guert was evidently the principal person in this consultation everybody appearing to listen to his suggestions with respect and attention at length our friend came out of the circle and in a courteous selfpossessed manner communicated the difficulty in the following words  you must know rev mr worden and mr littlepage and mr follock and mr newcome that we have certain customs of our own among us youths of albany that perhaps are not familiar to you gentlemen nearer the capital the trut is that we are not always as wise and as sober as our parents and grandparents in particular could wish us to be it is tought a good thing among us sometimes to rummage the henroosts and poultryyards of the burghers and to sup on the fruits of such a forage i do not know how it is with you gentlemen but i will own that to me ducks and geese got in this innocent gamelike way taste sweeter than when they are bought in the markethall our own supper for tonight was a bought supper but it has become the victim of a little enlargement of the practice i have mentioned  howhows that friend ten eyck exclaimed mr worden in no affected consternation the supper a victim do you say  yes sir to be frank at once it is gone gone to a pullet a steak and a potatoe they have not left us a dish  they echoed the parsonand who can they be  that is a point yet to be ascertained for the operation has been carried on in so delicate and refined a way that none of our blacks know anything of the matter it seems there was a cry of fire just now and it took every one of the negroes into the street during which time all our game has been put up and has flown  bless me bless me what a calamitywhat a rascally theft did you not mark it down  no sir i am sorry to say we have not nor do we apply such hard names to a frolic even when we lose our supper by it it is the act of some of our associates and friends who hope to feast at our expense tonight and who will gentlemen unless you will consent to aid us in recovering our lost dishes  aid you my dear siri will do any thing you can wishwhat will you have me attempt shall i go to the fort and ask for succour from the army  no sir our object can be effected short of tat i am quite certain we can find what we want only two or three doors from this if you will consent to lend us a little a very little of your assistance  name itname it at once for heavens sake mr guert the dishes must be getting cold all this time cried mr worden jumping up with alacrity and looking about him for his hat and cloak  the service we ask of you gentlemen is just this rejoined guert with a coolness that when i came to reflect on the events of that night has always struck me as singularly astonishing our supper and an excellent one it is is close at hand as i have said nothing will be easier than to get it on our own table in the next room could we only manage to call old doortje off duty and detain her for five minutes at the area gate of her house she knows every one of us and would smell a rat in a minute did we show ourselves but mr worden and mr littlepage here might amuse her for the necessary time without any trouble she is remarkably fond of dominies and would not be able to trace you back to this house leaving us to eat the supper in peace after tat no one cares for the rest  ill do itill do it cried mr worden hurrying into the passage in quest of his hat and cloak it is no more than just that you should have your own and the supper will be either eaten or overdone should we go for constables  no fear of constables mr worden we never employ them in our poultry wars all we who will get the supper back again can expect will be merely a little hot water or a skirmish with our friends  the details of the movement were now intelligibly and clearly settled guert was to head a party provided with large clothesbaskets who were to enter the kitchen during doortjes absence and abstract the dishes which could not yet be served as all in albany of a certain class sat down to supper at nine precisely as for doortje a negro who was in the house in waiting on one of the guests his master would manage to get her out to the area gate the house having a cellar kitchen where it would depend on mr worden to detain her three or four minutes to my surprise the parson entered on the execution of the wild scheme with boyish eagerness affirming that he could keep the woman half an hour if it were necessary by delivering her a lecture on the importance of observing the eighth commandment as soon as the preliminaries were thus arranged the two parties proceeded on their respective duties the hour admonishing us of the necessity of losing no time unnecessarily  i did not like this affair from the first the experiment of sliding down hill having somewhat weakened my confidence in guert ten eycks judgment nevertheless it would not do for me to hold back when mr worden led and after all there was no great harm in recovering a supper that had been abstracted from our own house guert did not proceed like ourselves by the street but he went with his party out of a back gate into an alley and was to enter the yard of the house he assailed by means of a similar gate in its rear once in that yard the access to the kitchen and the retreat were very easy provided the cook could be drawn away from her charge at so important a moment everything therefore depended on the address of the young negro who was in the house and ourselves  on reaching the gate of the area we stopped while our negro descended to invite doortje forth this gave us a moment to examine the building the house was large much larger than most of those round it and what struck me as unusual there was a lighted lamp over the door this looked as if it might be a sort of a tavern or eating house and rendered the whole thing more intelligible to me our roystering plunderers doubtless intended to sup on their spoils at that tavern  the negro was gone but a minute when he came out with a young black of his own sex a servant whom he was leading off his post on some pretence of his own and was immediately followed by the cook doortje made many curtsies as soon as she saw the cockedhat and black cloak of the dominie begging his pardon and asking his pleasure mr worden now began a grave and serious lecture on the sin of stealing holding the confounded doortje in discourse quite three minutes in vain the cook protested she had taken nothing that her masters property was sacred in her eyes and ever had been that she never gave away even cold meats without an order and that she could not imagine why she was to be talked to in this way to give him his due mr worden performed his part to admiration though it is true he had only an ignorant wench who was awed by his profession to manage at length we heard a shrill whistle from the alley the signal of success when mr worden wished doortje a solemn goodnight and walked away with all the dignity of a priest in a minute or two we were in the house again and were met by guert with cordial shakes of the hand thanks for our acceptable service and a summons to supper it appears that doortje had actually dishedup everything all the articles standing before a hot fire waiting only for the clock to strike nine to be served in this state then the only change the supper had to undergo was to bring it a short distance through the alley and to place it on our table instead of that for which it was so lately intended  notwithstanding the rapidity with which the changes had been made it would not have been very easy for a stranger to detect any striking irregularity in our feast it is true there were two sets of dishes on the table or rather dishes of two different sets but the ducks game c were not only properly cooked but were warm and good to work everybody went therefore with an appetite and for five minutes little was heard beyond the clatter of knives and forks then came the drinking of healths and finally the toasts and the songs and the stories  guert sang capitally in a fine clear sweet manly voice and he gave us several airs with words both in english and in dutch he had just finished one of these songs and the clapping of hands was still loud and warm when the young man called on mr worden for a lady or a sentiment  come dominie he called out for by this time the feast had produced its familiaritycome dominie you have acquitted yourself so well as a lecturer that we are all dying to hear you preach  a lady do you say sir asked the parson who was as merry as any of us  a latya latyshouted six or seven at once the tominies latythe tominies laty  well gentlemen since you will have it so you shall have one you must not complain if she prove a little venerablebut i give you mother church  this produced a senseless laugh as such things usually do and then followed my turn mr van brunt very formally called on me for a lady after pausing a moment i said as i flatter myself with spiritgentlemen i will give you another almost as heavenlymiss anneke mordaunt  miss anneke mordaunt was echoed round the table and i soon discovered that anneke was a general favourite and a very common toast already at albany  i shall now ask mr guert ten eyck for his lady i said as soon as silence was restored there being very little pause between the cups that night  this appeal changed the whole character of the expression of guerts face it became grave in an instant as if the recollection of her whose name he was about to utter produced a pause in his almost fierce mirth he coloured then raised his eyes and looked sternly round as if to challenge denial and gave  miss mary wallace  ay guert we are used to that name now said van brunt a little drily this is the tenth time i have heard it from you within two months  you will be likely to hear it twenty more sir for i shall give mary wallace and nobody but mary wallace while the lady remains mary wallace how now mr constable what may be the reason we have the honour of a visit from you at this time of night 22  footnote 22 in this whole affair of the supper the reader will find incidents that bear a striking resemblance to certain local characteristics portrayed by mrs grant of laggan in her memoirs of an american lady thus corroborating the fidelity of the pictures of our ancient manners as given by that respectable writer by the unquestioned authority of mr cornelius littlepageeditor     chapter xiii    masters it is proved already   that you are little better than false knaves   and it will go near to be thought so shortly    dogberry   the sudden appearance of the city constable a functionary whose person was not unknown to most of the company brought every man at table to his feet the rev mr worden dirck and myself included for my own part i saw no particular reason for alarm though it at once struck me that this visit might have some connection with the demolished supper since the law does not in all cases suffer a man to reclaim even his own by trick or violence as for the constable himself a short compact snubnosed dutchbuilt person who spoke english as if it disagreed with his bile he was the coolest of the whole party  vell mr guert he said with a sort of goodnatured growl of authority here i moost coome agin mr mayor woult be happy to see you and ter tominie dat ist of your party and ter gentleman dat acted as clerk ven he lectured old doortje mr mayors cook  mr mayors cook here then a secret was out with a vengeance guert had not reclaimed his own lost supper which having passed into the hands of the philistines was hopelessly gone but he had actually stolen and eaten the supper prepared for the mayor of albanypeter cuyler a man of note and standing in all respects a functionary who had held his office from time immemorialthe lamp was the symbol of authority and not the sign of an inn or an eatinghousethe supper moreover was never prepared for one man or one family but had certainly been got up for the honourable treatment of a goodly companyfifteen stout men had mainly appeased their appetites on it and the fragments were that moment under discussion among halfadozen largemouthed shining negro faces in the kitchen under circumstances like these i looked inquiringly at the rev mr wordenand the rev mr worden looked inquiringly at me there was no apparent remedy however but after a brief consultation with guert we the summoned parties took our hats and followed dogberry to the residence of mr mayor  you are not to be uneasy gentlemen at this little interruption of our amusements said guert dropping in between mr worden and myself as we proceeded on our way these things happening very often among us you are innocent you know under all circumstances since you supposed that the supper was our ownbrought back by direct means instead of having recourse to the shabby delays of the law  and whose supper may this have been sir that we have just eaten demanded mr worden  why there can be no harm now in telling you the truth dominie and i will own therefore it belonged in law to mr mayor cuyler there is no great danger however as you will see when i come to explain matters you must know that the mayors wife was a schuyler and my mother has some of that blood in her veins and we count cousins as far as we can see in albany it is just supping with ones relations a little out of the common way as you will perceive gentlemen  have you dealt fairly with mr littlepage and myself sir in this affair mr worden asked a little sternly i might with great propriety lecture to a cook on the eighth commandment when that cook was a party to robbing you of your supper but how shall i answer to his honour mr mayor on the charge which will now be brought against me it is not for myself mr guert that i feel so much concern as for the credit and reputation of my sacred office and that too among your disciples of the schools of leyden  leave it all to me my dear dominieleave it all to me answered guert well disposed to sacrifice himself rather than permit a friend to suffer i am used to these little matters and will take care of you  i vill answer for tat put in the constable looking over his shoulder no young flyaway in allponny hast more knowletge in tese matters tan mr guert here if any potty can draw his heat out of the yoke mr guert can yaasyaashe know all apout tese little matters sure enough  this was encouraging of a certainty our associate was so well known for his tricks and frolics that even the constable who took him calculated largely on his address in getting out of scrapes i did not apprehend that any of us were about to be tried and convicted of a downright robbery for i knew how far the dutch carried their jokes of this nature and how tolerant the seniors were to their juniors and especially how much all men are disposed to regard any exploit of the sort of that in which we had been engaged when it has been managed adroitly and in a way to excite a laugh still it was no joke to rob a mayor of his supper these functionaries usually passing to their offices through the probationary grade of alderman 23 guert was not free from uneasiness as was apparent by a question he put to the officer on the steps of mr cuylers house and under the very light of the official lamp  how is the old gentleman this evening hans the principal asked with some little concern in his manner i hope he and his company have supped  vell tat is more tan i can tell you mr guert he lookt more as like himself when he hat the horse tieves from new englant taken up tan he hast for many a tay twas most too pat mr guert to run away wit the mayors own supper i coult have tolt you who hast your own tucks and venison  i wish you had hans with all my heart but we were hard pushed and had a strange dominie to feed you know a body must provide well for company  yaas yaas i understants it and knows how you moost have peen nonplusht to do sich a ting put it was moost too pat vell we are all young afore we live to be olttat effery potty knows  by this time the door was open and we entered mr mayor had issued orders we should all be shown into the parlour where i rather think from what subsequently passed he intended to cut up guert a little more than common by exposing him before the eyes of a particular person at all events the reader can judge of my horror at finding that the party whose supper i had just helped to demolish consisted in addition to three or four sons and daughters of the house of herman mordaunt mary wallace and anneke of course everybody knew what had been done but until we entered the room mr mayor alone knew who had done it of mr worden and myself even he knew no more than he had learned from dootjes account of the matter and the cook quite naturally had represented us as rogues feigning our divinity  guert was a thoroughly manly fellow and he did us the justice to enter the parlour first poor fellow i can feel for him even at this distance of time when his eye first fell on mary wallaces pallid and distressed countenance it could scarcely be less than i felt myself when i first beheld annekes flushed features and the look of offended propriety that i fancied to be sparkling in her estranged eye  mr mayor evidently regarded mr worden with surprise as indeed he did me for instead of strangers he probably expected to meet two of those delinquents whose faces were familiar to him by divers similar jocular depredations committed within the limits of his jurisdiction then the circumstance that mr worden was a real dominie could not be questioned by those who saw him standing as he did face to face with all the usual signs of his sacred office in his dress and air  i believe there must be some mistake here constable exclaimed mr mayor why have you brought these two strange gentlemen along with guert ten eyck  my orters mr mayor wast to pring dootjes rapscallion tominie and his rapscallion frient and tat is one and tis ist tote  this gentleman has the appearance of being a real clergyman and that too of the church of england  yaas mr mayor tat is yoost so he wilt preach fifteen minutes witout stopping if you wilt give him a plack gownt and pray an hour in a white shirt 24  will you do me the favour guert ten eyck to let me have the names of the strangers i have the pleasure to receive said the mayor a little authoritatively  certainly mr mayor certainly and with very great pleasure i should have done this at once had we been ushered into your house by any one but the city constable whenever i accompany that gentleman anywhere i always wait to ascertain my welcome  guert laughed with some heart at this allusion to his own known delinquencies while mr cuyler only smiled i could see notwithstanding the severe measures to which he had resorted in this particular case that the last was not unfriendly to the first and that our friend guert had not fallen literally among robbers in being brought to the place where we were  this reverend dominie continued guert as soon as he had had his laugh and had ventured to cast a short inquiring glance at mary wallace is a gentleman from england mr mayor who is to preach in st peters the day after tomorrow by special invitation from the chaplain when i make no doubt we shall all be much edified miss mary wallace among the rest if she will do him the honour to attend the servicegood and angelic and forgiving as i know she is by nature  this speech caused all eyes to turn on the young lady whose face crimsoned though she made no reply i now felt satisfied that guerts manly frank avowed and sincere admiration had touched the heart of mary wallace while her reason condemned that which her natural tenderness encouraged and the struggle in her mind was then and long after a subject of curious study with me as for anneke i thought she resented this somewhat indiscreet not to say indelicate though indirect avowal of his feelings towards his mistress and that she looked on guert with even more coldness than she had previously done neither of the ladies however said anything during this dumbshow mr cuyler had leisure to recover from the surprise of discovering that one of his prisoners was really a clergyman and to inquire who the other might be  that gentleman then is in fact a clergyman he answered you have forgotten to name the other guert  this is mr corny littlepage mr mayorthe only son of major littlepage of satanstoe westchester  the mayor looked a little puzzled and i believe felt somewhat embarrassed as to the manner in which he ought to proceed the incursion of guert upon his premises much exceeded in boldness anything of the kind that had ever before occurred in albany it was common enough for young men of his stamp to carry off poultry pigs c and feast on the spoils and cases had occurred as i afterwards learned in which rival parties of these depredators preyed on each otherthe same materials for a supper having been known to change hands two or three times before they were consumedbut no one had ever presumed previously to this evening to make an inroad even on mr mayors hencoop much less to molest the domains of his cook in the first impulse of his anger mr cuyler had sent for the constable and guerts club with its place of meeting being well known that functionary having had many occasions to visit it the latter proceeded thither forthwith it is probable however a little reflection satisfied the mayor that a frolic could not well be treated as a larceny and that guert had some of his own wifes blood in his veins when he came to find that two respectable strangers were implicated in the affair one of whom was actually a clergyman this charitable feeling was strengthened and he changed his course of proceeding  you can return home hans said mr mayor very sensibly mollified in his manner should there be occasion for your further services i will send for you now gentlemen as soon as the door closed on the constable i will satisfy you that old peter cuyler can cover a table and feed his friends even though guert ten eyck be so near a neighbour miss wallace will you allow me the honour to lead you to the table mr worden will see mrs cuyler in safety to the same place  on this hint the missionary stepped forward with alacrity and led mrs mayoress after mary wallace with the utmost courtesy guert did the same to one of the young ladies of the house anneke was led in by one of the young men and i took the remaining young lady who i presumed was also one of the family it was very apparent we were respited and all of us thought it wisest to appear as much at our ease as possible in order not to balk the humour of the principal magistrate of the ancient town of albany  to do mr mayor justice the lost time had been so well improved by doortje that on looking around the table i thought the supper to which we were thus strangely invited was of the two the best i had seen that evening luckily game was plenty and by means of quails partridges oysters venison patties and other dishes of that sort the cook had managed to send up quite as good a supper at ten oclock as she had previously prepared for nine  i will not pretend that i felt quite at my ease as i took my seat at the table for the second time that night all the younger members of the party looked exceedingly grave as if they could very well dispense with our company the old people alone appearing to enter into the scene with any spirit anneke did not even look at me after the first astounded look given on my entrance nor did mary wallace once cast her eyes towards guert when we reached the supperroom mr mayor notwithstanding had determined to laugh off the affair and he and mr worden soon became excellent friends and began to converse freely and naturally  come cousin guert cried mr mayor after two or three glasses of madeira had still further warmed his heart fill and pledge meunless you prefer to give a lady if the last everybody will drink to her with hearty goodwill you eat nothing and must drink the more  ah mr mayor i have toasted one lady tonight and cannot toast another  not present company excepted my boy  no sir not even with that license i pledge you with all my heart and thank you with all my heart for this generous treatment after my own foolish frolicbut you know how it is mr mayor with us albany youths when our pride is up and a supper must be had  not i guert i know nothing about it but should very well like to learn how came you in the first place to take such a fancy to my cooks supper did you imagine it better than van brunts cook could give you  the supper of arent van brunts cook has disappearedgone on the hill i fancy among the redcoats and to own the truth mr mayor it was yours or nothing i had invited these gentlemen to pass the evening with us one of our blacks happened to mention what was going on here and hospitality led us all astray it was nothing more i do assure you mr mayor  and so your hospitable feelings made your guests work for their supper by sending them to preach to old doortje while you were dishing up my ducks and game  your pardon mr mayor doortje had dishedup before she went to lecture your cook is too well trained to neglect her duty even to hear a sermon by the rev mr worden but these gentlemen were quite as much deceived as the old woman for they supposed we were after our own lost goods and did not know that you dwelt here and were as much my dupes as old doortje herself truth obliges me to own this much in their justification  there was a general clearing up of countenances at this frank avowal and i saw that anneke herself turned her looks inquiringly upon the speaker and suffered a smile to relieve the extreme gravity of her sweet countenance from that moment a very sensible change came over the feelings and deportment of the younger part of the company and the conversation became easier and more natural it was certainly much in our favour to have it known we had not officiously and boyishly joined in a gratuitous attempt to rob and insult this particular and unoffending family but that mr worden and i supposed we were simply aiding in getting back those things which properly belonged to our hosts and getting them back too in a manner of which the party we supposed we were acting against would certainly have no right to complain inasmuch as they had set the example guert was encouraged to go on further with his explanations which he did in his own honest candid manner exculpating us in effect from everything but being a little too much disposed to waggery for a minister of the church and his pupil who had just commenced his travels  annekes face brightened up more and more as the explanations proceeded and soon after they were ended she turned to me in a very gracious manner and inquired after my mother as i sat directly opposite to her and the table was narrow we could converse without attracting much attention to ourselves mr mayor and his other guests keeping up a round of reasonably noisy jokes on the events of the evening nearer the foot of the table  you find some customs in albany mr littlepage that are not known to us in new york anneke observed after a few preliminary remarks had opened the way to further communication  i scarce know miss anneke whether you allude to what has occurred this evening or to what occurred this afternoon  to both i believe answered anneke smiling though she coloured as i thought with a species of feminine vexation for certainly one is no more a custom with us than the other  i have been most unfortunate miss mordaunt in the exhibitions i have made of myself in the course of the few hours i have passed in this to me strange place i am afraid you regard me as little more than an overgrown boy who has been permitted by his parents to leave home sooner than he ought  this is your construction and not mine mr littlepage i suppose you knowbut we will talk of this in the other room or at some other time  i took the hint and said no more on the subject while at table mr mayor i suppose in consideration of our having gone through the exactions of one feast already that evening permitted us to leave the supperroom much earlier than common and the hour being late the whole party broke up immediately afterwards before we separated however herman mordaunt approached me in a friendly free way and invited me to come to his house at eight next morning to breakfast requesting the pleasure of dircks company at the same time the invitation to the latter going through me it is scarcely necessary to say how gladly i accepted and how much i was relieved by this termination of an adventure that at one moment menaced me with deep disgrace had mr mayor seen fit to pursue the affair of the abstraction of his first supper in a serious vein although the legal consequences could not probably have amounted to anything very grave they might prove very ridiculous and i have no doubt they would have brought about a very abrupt termination of my visit to the north as it was my mind was vastly relieved as i believe was the case also with that of the rev mr worden  corny said that gentleman after we had wished guert goodnight and were well on our way to the inn again this second supper has helped surprisingly to digest the first i doubt if our new acquaintance here will be likely to turn out very profitable to us  yet sir you appeared to take to him exceedingly and i had thought you excellent friends  i like the fellow well enough too for he is hearty and frank and goodnatured but there was some little policy in keeping on good terms with him im afraid corny i did not altogether consult the dignity of my holy office this morning on the ice it is exceedingly unbecoming in a clergyman to be seen running in a public place like a schoolboy or a youngster contending in a match i thought moreover i overheard one of those young dutchmen call me the loping dominie and so taking altogether it struck me it would be wisest to keep on good terms with this guert ten eyck  i see your policy sir and it does not become me to deny it as for myself i confess i like guert surprisingly and shall not give him up easily though he has already got me into two serious scrapes in the short time we have been acquainted he is a hearty goodnatured thoughtless young fellow who dutchmanlike when he does make an attempt to enjoy life does it with all his heart  i then related the affair of the handsled to mr worden who gave me some of that sort of consolation of which a man receives a great deal as he elbows his way through this busy selfish world  well corny said my old master i am not certain you did not look more like a fool as you rolled over from that sled than i looked while loping from our friends in the sleigh  we both laughed as we entered the tavern i to conceal the vexation i really felt and mr worden as i presume because he was flattered with the belief that i must have appeared quite as ridiculous as himself  next morning i proceeded to herman mordaunts residence at the earliest hour the rules of society would allow i found the family established in one of those dutch edifices of which albany was mainly composed and which stood a little removed from the streethaving a tiny yard in front with the stoop in the gable and that gable towards the yard the battlement walls of this house diminished towards the high apex of a very steep roof by steps as we are all so much accustomed to see and the whole was surmounted by an iron weathercock that was perched on a rod of some elevation it was always a matter of importance with the dutch to know which way the wind blew nor did it comport with their habits of minute accuracy to trust to the usual indications of the feeling on the skin the bending of branches the flying of clouds or the driving of smoke but they must and would have the certainty of a machine that was constructed expressly to let them know the fact smoke might err but a weathercock would not  no one was in the little parlour into which i was shown by the servant who admitted me to the house and in whom i recognised herman mordaunts principal male attendant of the household in new york how pleasantly did that little room appear to me in the minute or two that i was left in it alone there lay the very shawl that anneke had on the day i met her in the pinkster field and a pair of gloves that it seemed to me no other hands but hers were small enough to wear had been thrown on the shawl carelessly as one casts aside a thing of that sort in a hurry a dozen other articles were put here and there that denoted the habits and presence of females of refinement but the gloves most attracted my attention and i must needs rise and examine them it is true these gloves might belong to mary wallace for she too had a pretty little hand but i fancied they belonged to anneke under this impression i raised them to my lips and was actually pressing them there with a good deal of romantic feeling when a light footstep in the room told me i was not alone dropping the gloves i turned and beheld anneke herself she was regarding me with an expression of countenance i did not then know how to interpret and which i now hardly know how to describe in the first place her charming countenance was suffused with blushes while her eyes were filled with an expression of softened interest that caused my heart to beat so violently that i did not know but it would escape by the channel of the throat how near i was to declaring all i felt at that moment of throwing myself at the feet of the dear dear creature and of avowing how much and engrossingly she had filled both my waking and sleeping thoughts during the last year and of beseeching her to bless the remainder of my days by becoming my wife nothing prevented this sally but the remark which anneke made the instant she had gracefully curtsied in return to my confused and awkward bow and which happened to be this  what do you find so much to admire in miss wallaces gloves asked the wilful girl biting her lip as i fancied to suppress a smile though her cheeks were still suffused and her eyes continued to give forth that indescribable expression of bewitching softness it is a pair my father presented to her and she wore them last evening in compliment to him  i beg pardon miss mordauntmiss annekethat isi beg pardon is there not a very delightful odour about those glovesthat is i was thinking so and was endeavouring to ascertain what it might be by the scent  it must be the lavender with which we young ladies are so coquettish as to sprinkle our gloves and handkerchiefsor it may be musk mary is rather fond of musk though i prefer lavender but what an evening we had mr littlepage and what an introduction you have had to albany and most of all what a master of ceremonies  do you then dislike guert ten eyck as an acquaintance miss anneke  far from it it is quite impossible to dislike guert he is so manly so ready to admit his own weaknesses so sincere in all he does and says so good natured and in short so much that were one his sister she might wish him to be and yet so much that a sister must regret  i thought last evening that all the ladies felt an interest in him notwithstanding the numberless wild and illjudged things he does is he not a favourite with miss wallace  the quick sensitive glance that anneke gave me said plainly enough that my question was indiscreet and it was no sooner put than it was regretted a shadow passed athwart the sweet face of my companion and a moment of deep and as i fancied of painful thought succeeded then a light broke over all a smile illumined her features after which a light girlish laugh came to show how active were the agents within and how strong was the native tendency to happiness and humour  after all corny littlepage said anneke turning her face towards me with an indescribable character of fun and feeling so blended in it as fairly to puzzle me you must admit that your exploit in the handsled was sufficiently ridiculous to last a young man for some time  i confess it all anneke and shall have a care how i turn boy again in a strange place i am rejoiced to find however that you look upon the foolish affair of the slide as more grave than that of the supper which i was fearful might involve me in serious disgrace  neither is very serious mr littlepage though the last might have proved awkward had not the mayor known the ways of the young men of the town they say however that nothing so bold has ever before been attempted in that way in albany great as are the liberties that are often taken with the neighbours hencoops  and she laughed and this time it was naturally and without the least restraint  i hope you will not think it shabby in me if i seem to wish to throw all the blame on this harumscarum guert ten eyck he drew me into both affairs and into the last in a great measure innocently and ignorantly  so it is understood and so it would be understood the moment guert ten eyck was found to be connected with the affair at all  i may hope then to be forgiven anneke i said holding out a hand to invite her to accept it as a pledge of pardon  anneke did not prudishly decline putting her own little hand in mine though i got only the ends of two or three slender delicate fingers and her colour increased as she bestowed this grace  you must ask forgiveness corny she answeredi believe she now used this familiar name simply to show how completely she had forgotten the little spleen she had certainly felt at my untoward exhibition in the streetyou must ask forgiveness of those who possess the right to pardon if corny littlepage chooses to slide down hill like a boy what right has anneke mordaunt to say him nay  every right in the worldthe right of friendshipthe right of a superior mind of superior mannersthe right that my  hushthat is mr bulstrodes footstep in the passage and he will not understand this discussion on the subject of my manifold rights it takes him some time however to throw aside his overcoats and furs and sword and i will just tell you that guert ten eyck is a dangerous master of ceremonies for corny littlepage  yet he has sense enough feeling enough heart enough to admire and love mary wallace  has he told you this so soon but i need not ask as he tells his love to every one who will listen  and to miss wallace herself i trust among the number the man who loves and loves truly should not long permit its object to remain in any doubt of his feelings and intentions it has ever appeared to me miss mordaunt as a most base and dastardly feeling in a man to wish to be certain of a womans returning his love before he has the manliness to let his mistress understand his wishes how is a sensitive female to know when she is safe in yielding her affections without this frankness on the part of her suitor ill answer for it that guert ten eyck has dealt thus honestly and frankly with mary wallace  that is a merit which cannot be denied him answered anneke in a low thoughtful tone of voice mary has heard this from his own mouth again and again even my presence has been no obstacle to his declarations for three times have i heard him beg mary to consider him as a suitor for her hand and entreat her not to decide on his offer until he has had a longer opportunity to win her esteem  and this you will admit miss mordaunt is to his credit is manly and like himself  it is certainly frank and honourable mr littlepage since it enables miss wallace to understand the object of his attentions and leaves nothing to doubt or uncertainty  i am glad you approve of such fair and frank proceedingsthough but a moment remains to say what i wish it will suffice to add that the course guert ten eyck has taken towards mary wallace cornelius littlepage would wish to pursue towards anneke mordaunt  anneke started turned pale then showed cheeks that were suffused with blushes and looked at me with timid surprise she made no answer though that earnest yet timid gaze long remained and for that matter still remains vividly impressed upon my recollection it seemed to express astonishment startled sensibility feminine bashfulness and maiden coyness but it did not appear to me that it expressed displeasure there was no time however to ask for explanations since the voices of herman mordaunt and bulstrode were now heard at the very door and at the next instant both entered the room  footnote 23 the american mayor is usually a different person from the english mayor until within the last fiveandtwenty or thirty years the mayor of new york was invariably a man of social and political importance belonging strictly to the higher class of society the same was true of the mayor of albany at the present time the rule has been so far enlarged as to admit a selection from all of the more reputable classes without any rigid adherence to the highest the elective principle has produced the change during the writers boyhood philip van rensselaer the brother of the late patroon was so long mayor of albany as to be universally known by the sobriquet of the mayoreditor  footnote 24 this opinion of the constables must refer to the notion common amongst the nonepiscopal sects that the value of spiritual provender was to be measured by the quantity preaching however might be overdone in the dutch reformed churches for quite within my recollection a halfhour glass stood on the pulpit of the dutch edifice named in the text to regulate the dominies wind it was said it might be turned once with impunity but wo betide him who should so far trespass on his peoples patience as to presume to turn it twiceeditor     chapter xiv    my beautiful my beautiful that standest meekly by   with thy proudly archd and glossy neck and dark and fiery eye    thus thus i leap upon thy back and scour the distant plains   away who overtakes me now shall claim thee for his pains    the arab to his steed   bulstrode seemed happy to meet me complaining that i had quite forgotten the satisfaction with which all new york agreeably to his account of the matter had received me the past spring of course i thanked him for his civility and we soon became as good friends as formerly in a minute or two mary wallace joined us and we all repaired to the breakfasttable where we were soon joined by dirck who had been detained by some affairs of his own  herman mordaunt and bulstrode had the conversation principally to themselves for the first few minutes mary wallace was habitually silent but anneke without being loquacious was sufficiently disposed to converse this morning however she said little beyond what the civilities of the table required from the mistress of the house and that little in as few words as possible once or twice i could not help remarking that her hand remained on the handle of a richlychased teapot after that hand had performed its office and that her sweet deep blue eye was fixed on vacancy or on some object before her with a vacant regard in the manner of one that thought intensely each time as she recovered from these little reveries a slight flush appeared on her face and she seemed anxious to conceal the involuntary abstraction this absence of mind continued until bulstrode who had been talking with our host on the subject of the movements of the army suddenly directed his discourse to me  i hope we owe this visit to albany he said to an intention on your part mr littlepage to make one among us in the next campaign i hear of many gentlemen of the colonies who intend to accompany us in our march to quebec  that is somewhat farther than i had thought of going mr bulstrode was my answer inasmuch as i have never supposed the kings forces contemplated quite so distant a march it is the intention of mr follock and myself to get permission to attach ourselves to some regiment and to go forward as far as ticonderoga at least for we do not like the idea of the french holding a post like that so far within the limits of our own province  bravely said sir and i trust i shall be permitted to be of some assistance when the time comes to settle details our mess would always be happy to see you and you know that i am at its head since the lt colonel has left us  i returned my thanks and the discourse took another direction  i met harris as i was walking hither this morning bulstrode continued and he gave me in his confused irish wayfor i insist he is irish although he was born in londonbut he gave me a somewhat queer account of a supper he was at last night which he said had been borne off by a foraging party of young albanians and brought into the barracks as a treat to some of our gentlemen this was bad enough though they tell me a dutchman always pardons such a frolic but harris makes the matter much worse by adding that the supperless party indemnified itself by making an attack on the kitchen of mr mayor and carrying off his ducks and partridges in a way to leave him without even a potatoe  i felt that my face was as red as scarlet and i fancied everybody was looking at me while herman mordaunt took on himself the office of making a reply  the story does not lose in travelling as a matter of course answered our host though it is true in the main we all supped with mr cuyler last evening and know that he had much more than a potatoe on the table  allwhat the ladies  even to the ladiesand mr littlepage in the bargain returned herman mordaunt casting a glance at me and smiling each and all of us will testify he not only had a plenty of supper but that which was good  i see by the general smile cried bulstrode that them is a sous entendu here and shall insist on being admitted to the secret  herman mordaunt now told the whole story not being particularly careful to conceal the more ludicrous parts dwelling with some emphasis on the lecture mr worden had delivered to doortje and appealing to me to know whether i did not think it excellent bulstrode laughed of course though i fancied both the young ladies wished nothing had been said on the subject anneke even attempted once or twice to divert her father from certain comments that he made in which he spoke rather lightly of such sort of amusements in general  that guert ten eyck is a character exclaimed bulstrode and one i am sometimes at a loss to comprehend a more manlylooking fine bold young fellow i do not know and he is often as manly and imposing in his opinions and judgments as he is to the eye while at times he is almost childish in his tastes and propensities how do you account for this miss anneke  simply that nature intended guert ten eyck for better things than accident and education or the want of education have enabled him to become had guert ten eyck been educated at oxford he would have been a very different man from what he is if a man has only the instruction of a boy he will long remain a boy  i was surprised at the boldness and decision of this opinion for it was not annekes practice to be so open in delivering her sentiments of others but it was not long ere i discovered that she did not spare guert in the presence of her friend from a deep conviction he was not worthy of the hold he was sensibly gaining on the feelings of mary wallace herman mordaunt as i fancied favoured his daughters views in this behalf and there was soon occasion to observe that poor guert had no other ally in that family than the one his handsome manly person open disposition and uncommon frankness had created in his mistresss own bosom there was certainly a charm in guerts habitual manner of underrating himself that inclined all who heard him to his side and for myself i will confess i early became his friend in all that matter and so continued to the last  bulstrode and i left the house together walking arm and arm to his quarters leaving dirck with the ladies  this is a charming family said my companion as we left the door and i feel proud of being able to claim some affinity to it though it is not so near as i trust it may one day become  i started almost twitching my arm away from that of the majors turning half round at the same instant to look him in the face bulstrode smiled but preserved his own selfpossession in the stoical manner common to men of fashion and easy manners pursuing the discourse  i see that my frankness has occasioned you some little surprise he added but the truth is the truth and i hold it to be unmanly for a gentleman who has made up his mind to become the suitor of a lady to make any secret of his intentionsis not that your own way of thinking mr littlepage  certainly as respects the lady and possibly as respects her family but not as respects all the world  i take your distinction which may be a good one in ordinary cases though in the instance of anneke mordaunt it may be merciful to let wandering young men like yourself corny comprehend the real state of the case i very well understand your own particular relation to the family of the mordaunts but others may approach it with different and more interested views  am i to understand mr bulstrode that miss mordaunt is your betrothed  oh by no means for she has not yet made up her mind to accept me you are to understand however that i have proposed to herman mordaunt with my fathers knowledge and approbation and that the affair is in petto you can judge for yourself of the probable termination being a better judge as a lookeron than i as a party interested of annekes manner of viewing my suit  you will remember i have not seen you together these ten months until this morning and i presume you do not wish me to suppose you have been waiting all that time for an answer  as i consider you an ami de famille corny there is no reason why there should not be a fair statement of things laid before you for that affair of the lion will ever render you half a mordaunt yourself i had proposed to anneke when you first saw me and got the usual ladylike answer that the dear creature was too young to think of contracting herself which was certainly truer then than now that i had friends at home who ought to be consulted that time must be given or the answer would necessarily be no and all the usual substance of such replies in the preliminary state of a negotiation  and there the matter has stood ever since  by no means my dear fellow as far from that as possible i heard herman mordaunt for he did most of the talking on that side with the patience of a saint observed how proper it all was and stated my intention to lay every thing before my father and then advance to the assault anew reinforced by his consent and authority to offer settlements  all of which you got by return of vessel on writing home i added unable to imagine how any man could hesitate about receiving anneke mordaunt for a daughterinlaw  why not exactly by return of vessel though sir harry is much too wellbred to neglect answering a letter i never knew him to do such a thing in his life no not when i have pushed him a little closely on the subject of my allowance having been out before the quarter was up as will sometimes happen at college you know corny to tell you the truth my dear boy sir harrys consent did not come by return of vessel though an answer did it is a confounded distance across the atlantic and it takes time to argue a question when the parties are a thousand leagues asunder  arguewhat argument could be required to convince sir harry bulstrode of the propriety of your getting anneke mordaunt for a wife if you could  quite plain and sincere upon my honourbut i love you for the simplicity of your character corny and so shall view all favourably if i could well we shall know at the end of the approaching campaign when you and i come back from our trip to quebec  you have not answered my question in the mean time concerning sir harry bulstrode  i beg sir harrys and your pardon what argument could be required to convince my fatherwhy you have never been at home littlepage and cannot easily understand therefore what the feeling is precisely in relation to the coloniesmuch depends on that you know  i trust the mother loves her children as i am certain the children love their mother  yes you are all loyali will say that for you though albany is not exactly bath or new york westminster i suppose you know littlepage that the church upon the hill yonder which is called st peters though a very good church and a very respectable church with a very reputable congregation is not exactly westminster abbey or even st jamess  i believe i understand you sir and so sir harry proved obstinate  as the devilit took no less than three letters the last of which was pretty bold to get him round which i did at last and his consent in due form has been handed in to herman mordaunt i contended with some advantages in the affair or i never should have prevailed but you will see how it was sir harry is gouty and asthmatic both and no great things of a life at the best and every acre he has on earth is entailed just making the whole thing a question of time  all of which you communicated of course to anneke and herman mordaunt  if i did ill be hanged no no master corny i am not so green as that would imply you provincials are as thinskinned as raisons de fontainbleau and are not to be touched so rudely i do not believe anneke would marry the duke of norfolk himself if the family raised the least scruple about receiving her  and would not anneke be right in acting under so respectable a feeling  why you know she would only marry the duke and not his mother and aunts and uncles i cannot see the necessity of a young womans making herself uncomfortable on that account but we have not come to that yet for i would wish you to understand littlepage that i am not accepted no no justice to anneke demands that i should say this much she knows of sir harrys consent however and that is a good deal in my favour you must allow i suppose her great objection will be to quitting her father who has no other child and on him it will bear a little hard and then it is likely she will say something about a change of country for you americans are all great sticklers for living in your own region  i do not see how you can justly accuse us of that since it is universally admitted among us that everything is better at home than it is in the colonies  i really think corny rejoined bulstrode smiling goodnaturedly were you to pay the old island a visit now you yourself would confess that some things are  i to visiti am at a loss to imagine why i am named as one disposed to deny it had it been guert ten eyck now or ever dirck follock one might imagine such a thingbut i who come from english blood and who have an englishborn grandfather at this moment alive and well at satanstoe am not to be included among the disaffected to england  bulstrode pressed my arm and his conversation took a more confidential air as it proceeded i believe you are right corny he said the colony is loyal enough heaven knows yet i find these dutch look on us redcoats more coldly than the people of english blood below should it be ascribed to the phlegm of their manners or to some ancient grudge connected with the conquest of their colony  hardly the last i should think since the colony was traded away under the final arrangement in exchange for a possession the dutch now hold in south america there is nothing strange however in the descendants of the people of holland preferring the dutch to the english  i assure you littlepage the coldness with which we are regarded by the albanians has been spoken of among us though most of the leading families treat us well and aid us all they can they should remember that we are here to fight their battles and to prevent the french from overrunning them  to that they would probably answer that the french would not molest them but for their quarrel with england here we must part mr bulstrode as i have business to attend to i will add one word however before we separate and that is that king george ii has not more loyal subjects in his dominions than those who dwell in his american provinces  bulstrode smiled nodded in assent waved his hand and we parted  i had plenty of occupation for the remainder of that day yaap arrived with his brigade of sleighs about noon and i went in search of guert in whose company i repaired once more to the office of the contractor horses harness sleighs provisions and all were taken at high prices and i was paid for the whole in spanish gold joes and halfjoes being quite as much in use among us in that day as the coin of the realm spanish silver has always formed our smaller currency such a thing as an english shilling or a sixpence being quite a stranger among us pieces of eight or dollars are our commonest coin it is true but we make good use of the halfjoe in all heavy transactions i have seen two or three bank of england notes in my day but they are of very rare occurrence in the colonies there have been colony bills among us but they are not favourites most of our transactions being carried on by means of the spanish gold and spanish silver that find their way up from the islands and the spanish main the war of which i am now writing however brought a great many guineas among us most of the troops being paid in that species of coin but the contractors in general found it easier to command the halfjoe than the guinea of the former when all our sales were made dirck and myself had between us no less than one hundred and eleven or eight hundred and eightyeight dollars in value  i found guert just as ready and just as friendly on this occasion as he had been on the previous day not only were all our effects disposed of but all our negroes were hired to the army for the campaign yaap excepted the boys went off with their teams towards the north that same afternoon in high spirits as ready for a frolic as any white youths in the colony i permitted yaap to go on with his sleigh to be absent for a few days but he was to return and join us before we proceeded in quest of the patent after the breaking up of the winter  it was late in the afternoon before everything was settled when guert invited me to take a turn with him on the river in his own sleigh by this time i had ascertained that my new friend was a young man of very handsome property without father or mother and that he lived in as good style as was common for the simple habits of those around him our principal families in new york were somewhat remarkable for the abundance of their plate tablelinen and other household effects of the latter character while here and there one was to be found that possessed some good pictures the latter i have reason to think however were rare though occasionally the work of a master did find its way to america particularly from holland and flanders guert kept bachelors hall in a respectable house that had its gable to the street as usual and which was of no great size but everything about it proved that his old black housekeeper had been trained under a regime of thorough neatness for that matter everything around albany wore the appearance of being periodically scoured the streets themselves could not undergo that process with snow on the ground but once beneath a roof and everything that had the character of dirt was banished in this particular guerts bachelor residence was as faultless as if it had a mistress at its head and that mistress were mary wallace  if she ever consent to have me said guert actually sighing as he spoke and glancing his eyes round the very pretty little parlour i had just been praising on the occasion of the visit i first made to his residence that afternoon if she ever consent to have me corny i shall have to build a new house this is now a hundred years old and though it was thought a great affair in its day it is not half good enough for mary wallace my dear fellow how i envy you that invitation to breakfast this morning what a favourite you must be with herman mordaunt  we are very good friends guertfor with the freedom of our colony manners we had already dropped into the familiarity of calling each other corny and guertwe are very good friends guert i answered and i have some reason to think herman mordaunt does not dislike me it was in my power to be of a trifling service to miss anneke last spring and the whole family is disposed to remember it  so i can see at a glance even anneke remembers it i have heard the whole story from mary wallace it was about a lion i would give half of what i am worth to see mary wallace in the paws of a lion or any other wild beast just to let her see that guert ten eyck has a heart as well as corny littlepage but corny my boy there is one thing you must do you are in such favour that it will be easy for you to effect it though i might try in vain for ever  i will do anything that is proper to oblige you guert for you have a claim on me for services rendered by yourself  pshawsay nothing of such matters i am never happier than when buying or selling a horse and in helping you to get off your old cattle why i did the king no harm and you some good but it was about horses i was thinking you must know littlepage there is not a young man or an old man within twenty miles of albany that drives such a pair of beasts as myself  you surely do not wish me to sell these horses to mary wallace guert i rejoined laughing  ay my lad and this house and the old farm and two or three stores along the river and all i have provided you can sell me with them as the ladies have no present use for horses however herman mordaunt having brought up with him a very good pair that came near running over you and me corny so there is no need of any sale but i should like to drive mary and anneke a turn of a few miles with that team of mine and in my own sleigh  that cannot prove such a difficult affair young ladies ordinarily consenting readily enough to be diverted with a sleighride  the offone carries himself more like a colonel at the head of his regiment than like an ignorant horse  i will propose the matter to herman mordaunt or to anneke herself if you desire it  and the nearone has the movement of a lady in a minuet when you rein him in a little i drove those cattle corny across the pineplains to schenectady in one hour and twentysix minutessixteen miles as the crow fliesand nearer sixty if you follow all the turnings of the fifty roads  well what am i to do tell this to the ladies or beg them to name a day  name a dayi wish it had come to that corny with my whole soul they are two beauties  yes i think everybody will admit that i answered innocently yet very different in their charms  oh not a bit more alike than is just necessary for a good match i call one jack and the other moses i never knew an animal that was named jack who would not do his work i would give a great deal corny that mary wallace could see that horse move  i promised guert that i would use all my influence with the ladies to induce them to trust themselves with his team and in order that i might speak with authority the sleigh was ordered round to the door forthwith with a view first to take a turn with me the winter equipage of guert ten eyck was really a tasteful and knowing thing i had often seen handsomer sleighs in the way of paint varnish tops and mouldings for to these he appeared to pay very little attention the points on which its owner most valued his sleigh was the admirable manner in which it rested on its runnerspressing lightly both behind and before then the traces were nearer on a level with the horses than was common though not so high as to affect the draft the colour without was a skyblue a favourite dutch tint while within it was fieryred the skins were very ample all coming from the grey wolf as these skins were lined with scarlet cloth the effect of the whole was sufficiently cheering and warm i ought not to forget the bells in addition to the four sets buckled to the harness the usual accompaniment of every sort of sleighharness guert had provided two enormous strings always leathern straps that passed from the saddles quite down under the bodies of jack and moses and another string around each horses neck thus increasing the jingling music of his march at least fourfold beyond the usual quantity 25  in this style then we dashed from the door of the old ten eyckhouse all the blacks in the street gazing at us in delight and shaking their sides with laughtera negro always expressing his admiration of anything even to a sermon in that mode i remember to have heard a traveller who had been as far as niagara declare that his black did nothing but roar with laughter the first halfhour he stood confronted with that mighty cataract  nor did the blacks alone stop to admire guert ten eyck his sleigh and his horses all the young men in the place paid guert this homage for he was unanimously admitted to be the best whip and the best judge of horseflesh in albany that is the best judge for his years several young women who were out in sleighs looked behind them as we passed proving that the admiration extended even to the other sex all this guert felt and saw and its effect was very visible in his manner as he stood guiding his spirited pair amid the woodsleds that still crowded the main street  our route lay towards the large flats that extend for miles along the west shore of the hudson to the north of albany this was the road usually taken by the young people of the place in their evening sleighrides not a few of the better class stopping to pay their respects to madame schuyler a widow born of the same family as that into which she had married and who from her character connections and fortune filled a high place in the social circle of the vicinity guert knew this lady and proposed that i should call and pay my respects to hera tribute she was accustomed to receive from most strangers of respectability thither then we drove as fast as my companions blacks could carry us the distance was only a few miles and we were soon dashing through the open gate into what must have been a very pretty though an inartificial lawn in the summer  by jove we are in luck cried guert the moment his eyes got a view of the stables yonder is herman mordaunts sleigh and we shall find the ladies here  all this turned out as guert had announced anneke and mary wallace had dined with madame schuyler and their coats and shawls had just been brought to them preparatory to returning home as we entered i had heard so much of madame schuyler as not to approach this respectable person without awe and i had no eyes at first for her companions i was well received by the mistress of the house a woman of so large a size as to rise from her chair with great difficulty but whose countenance expressed equally intelligence principles refinement and benevolence she no sooner heard the name of littlepage than she threw a meaning glance towards the young female friends mine following and perceiving anneke colouring highly and looking a little distressed as for mary wallace she appeared to me then as i fancied was usually the case whenever guert ten eyck approached her to be struggling with a species of melancholy pleasure  it is unnecessary for me to hear your mothers name mr littlepage said madam schuyler extending a hand since i knew her as a young woman in her name you are welcome as indeed you would be in your own after the allimportant service i hear you have rendered my sweet young friend here  i could only bow and express my thanks but it is unnecessary to say how grateful to me was praise of this sort coming as i knew it must from anneke in the first instance still i could hardly refrain from laughing at guert who shrugged his shoulders and turned towards me with a look that repeated his ludicrous regrets he could not see mary wallace in a lions paws the conversation then took the usual turn and i got an opportunity of speaking to the young ladies  after the character i had heard of madam schuyler i was a good deal surprised to find that guert was somewhat of a favourite but even the most intellectual and refined women i have since had occasion to learn feel a disposition to judge handsome manly frank flighty fellows like my new acquaintance somewhat leniently with all his levity and his disposition to run into the excesses of animal spirits there was that about guert which rendered it difficult to despise him the courage of a lion was in his eye and his front and bearing were precisely those that are particularly attractive to women to these advantages were added a seeming unconsciousness of his superiority to most around him in the way of looks and a humility of spirit that caused him often to deplore his deficiencies in those accomplishments which characterize the man of study and of intellectual activity it was only among the hardy active and reckless that guert manifested the least ambition to be a leader  do you still drive those spirited blacks guert demanded madam schuyler in a gentle affable way that inclined her to adapt her discourse to the tastes of those she might happen to be with those i mean which you purchased in the autumn  you may be certain of that auntevery one who could claim the most distant relationship to this amiable woman and whose years did not render the appellation disrespectful called her auntyou may be certain of that aunt for their equals are not to be found in this colony the gentlemen of the army pretend that no horse can be good that has not what they call blood but jack and moses are both of the dutch breed and the schuylers and the ten eycks will never own there is no blood in such a stock i have given each of these animals my own name and call them jack ten eyck and moses ten eyck  i hope you will not exclude the littlepages and the mordaunts from your list of dissenters mr ten eyck observed anneke laughing since both have dutch blood in their veins too  very true miss anneke miss wallace being the only true thorough englishwoman here but as aunt schuyler has spoken of my team i wish i could persuade you and miss mary to let me drive you back to albany with it this very evening your own sleigh can follow and your fathers horses being english we shall have an opportunity of comparing the two breeds the anglosaxons will have no load while the flemings will still i will wager animal against animal that the last do the work the most neatly and in the shortest time  to this proposition however anneke would not consent her instinctive delicacy i make no doubt at once presenting to her mind the impropriety of quitting her own sleigh to take an evenings drive in that of a young man of guerts established reputation for recklessness and fun and who was not always fortunate enough to persuade young women of the first class to be his companions the turn the conversation had taken nevertheless had the effect to produce so many urgent appeals that were seconded by myself to give the horses a trial that mary wallace promised to submit the matter to herman mordaunt and should he approve to accompany guert anneke and myself in an excursion the succeeding week  this concession was received by poor guert with profound gratitude and he assured me as we drove back to town that he had not felt so happy for the last two months  it is in the power of such a young womanyoung angel i might better say added guert to make anything she may please of me i know i am an idler and too fond of our dutch amusements and that i have not paid the attention i ought to have paid to books but let that precious creature only take me by the hand and i should turn out an altered man in a month young women can do anything they please with us mr littlepage when they set their minds about it in earnest i wish i was a horse to have the pleasure of dragging mary wallace in this excursion  footnote 25 as it is possible this book may pass into the hands of others than americans it maybe well to say that a sleighbell is a small hollow ball made of bellmetal having a hole in it that passes round half of its circumference and containing a small solid ball of a size not to escape these bells are fastened to leathern straps which commonly pass round the necks of the horses in the time of guert ten eyck most of the bells were attached to small plates that were buckled to various parts of the harness but as this caused a motion annoying to the animals mr littlepage evidently wishes his readers to understand that his friend ten eyck was too knowing to have recourse to the practice even the straps are coming into disuse the opinion beginning to obtain that sleighbells are a nuisance instead of an advantage twenty years since the laws of most large towns rendered them necessary under the pretence of preventing accidents by apprising the footman of the approach of a sleigh but more horses are now driven in the state of new york without than with bells in winter  sleigh as spelt is purely an american word it is derived from slee in dutch which is pronounced like sleigh some persons contend that the americans ought to use the old english words sled or sledge but these words do not precisely express the things we possess there is as much reason for calling a pleasure conveyance by a name different from sled as there is for saying coach instead of wagon sleigh will become english ere long as it is now american twenty millions of people not only can make a word but they can make a language if it be needededitor     chapter xv    when lo the voice of loud alarm   his inmost soul appals   what ho lord william rise in haste   the water saps thy walls    lord william   the visit to madam schuyler occurred of a saturday evening and the matter of our adventure in company with jack and moses was to be decided on the following monday when i rose and looked out of my window on the sunday morning however there appeared but very little prospect of its being effected that spring inasmuch as it rained heavily and there was a fresh south wind we had reached the 21st of march a period of the year when a decided thaw was not only ominous to the sleighing but when it actually predicted a permanent breaking up of the winter the season had been late and it was thought the change could not be distant  the rain and south wind continued all that day and torrents of water came rushing down the short steep streets effectually washing away everything like snow mr worden preached notwithstanding and to a very respectable congregation dirck and myself attended but jason preferred sitting out a double halfhour glass sermon in the dutch church delivered in a language of which he understood very little to lending his countenance to the rites of the english service both anneke and mary wallace found their way up the hill going in a carriage though i observed that herman mordaunt was absent guert was in the gallery in which we also sat but i could not avoid remarking that neither of the young ladies raised her eyes once during the whole service as high as our pews guert whispered something about this as he hastened down stairs to hand them to their carriage when the congregation was dismissed begging me at the same time to be punctual to the appointment for the next day what he meant by this last remembrancer i did not understand for the hills were beginning to exhibit their bare breasts and it was somewhat surprising with what rapidity a rather unusual amount of snow had disappeared i had no opportunity to ask an explanation as guert was too busy in placing the ladies in the carriage and the weather was not such as to admit of my remaining a moment longer in the street than was indispensably necessary  a change occurred in the weather during the night the rain having ceased though the atmosphere continued mild and the wind was still from the south it was the commencement of the spring and as i walked round to guert ten eycks house to meet him at breakfast i observed that several vehicles with wheels were already in motion in the streets and that divers persons appeared to be putting away their sleighs and sleds as things of no further use until the next winter our springs do not certainly come upon us as suddenly as some of which i have read in the old world but when the snow and winter endure as far into march as had been the case with that of the year 1758 the change is often nearly magical  here then is the spring opening i said to dirck as we walked along the wellwashed streets and in a few weeks we must be off to the bush our business on the patent must be got along with before the troops are put in motion or we may lose the opportunity of seeing a campaign  with such expectations and feelings i entered guerts bachelor abode and the first words i uttered were to sympathize in his supposed disappointment  it is a great pity you did not propose the drive to the ladies for saturday i began for that was not only a mild day but the sleighing was excellent as it is you will have to postpone your triumph until next winter  i do not understand you cried guert jack and moses never were in better heart or in better condition i think they are equal to going to kinderhook in two hours  but who will furnish the roads with snow by looking out of the window you will see that the streets are nearly bare  streets and roads who cares for either while we have the river we often use the river here weeks at a time when the snow has left us the ice has been remarkably even the whole of this winter and now the snow is off it there will be no danger from the airholes  i confess i did not much like the notion of travelling twenty miles on the ice but was far too much of a man to offer any objections  we breakfasted and proceeded in a body to the residence of herman mordaunt when the ladies first heard that we had come to claim the redemption of the halfpromise given at madam schuylers their surprise was not less than mine had been half an hour before while their uneasiness was probably greater  surely jack and moses cannot exhibit all their noble qualities without snow exclaimed anneke laughing ten eycks though they be  we albanians have the advantage of travelling on the ice when the snow fails us answered guert here is the river near by and never was the sleighing on it better than at this moment  but it has been many times safer i should think this looks very much like the breaking up of winter  that is probable enough and so much greater the reason why we should not delay if you and miss mary ever intend to learn what the blacks can do it is for the honour of holland that i desire it else would i not presume so far i feel every condescension of this sort that i receive from you two ladies in a way i cannot express for no one knows better than myself how unworthy i am of your smallest notice  this brought the signs of yielding at once into the mild countenance of mary wallace guerts selfhumiliation never failed to do this there was so much obvious truth in his admission so sincere a disposition to place himself where nature and education or a want of education had placed him and most of all so profound a deference for the mental superiority of mary herself that the female heart found it impossible to resist to my surprise guerts mistress contrary to her habit in such things was the first to join him and to second his proposal herman mordaunt entering the room at this instant the whole thing was referred to him as in reason it ought to have been  i remember to have travelled on the hudson a few years since returned herman mordaunt the entire distance between albany and singsing and a very good time we had of it much better than had we gone by land for there was little or no snow  just our case now miss anneke cried guert good sleighing on the river but none on the land  was that near the end of march dear papa asked anneke a little inquiringly  no certainly not for it was early in february but the ice at this moment must be near eighteen inches thick and strong enough to bear a load of hay  yes masser herman observed cato a greyheaded black who had never called his master by any other name having known him from an infant yes masser herman a load do come over dis minute  it appeared unreasonable to distrust the strength of the ice after this proof to the contrary and anneke submitted the party was arranged forthwith and in the following mannerthe two ladies guert and myself were to be drawn by the blacks while herman mordaunt dirck and any one else they could enlist were to follow in the new york sleigh it was hoped that an elderly female connection mrs bogart who resided at albany would consent to be of the party as the plan was to visit and dine with another and a mutual connection of the mordaunts at kinderhook while the sleighs were getting ready herman mordaunt walked round to the house of mrs bogart made his request and was successful  the clock in the tower of the english church struck ten as both sleighs drove from herman mordaunts door there was literally no snow in the middle of the streets but enough of it mingled with ice was still to be found nearer the houses to enable us to get down to the ferry the point where sleighs usually went upon the river here herman mordaunt who was in advance checked his horses and turned to speak to guert on the propriety of proceeding the ice near the shore had evidently been moved the river having risen a foot or two in consequence of the wind and the thaw and there was a sort of icy wave cast up near the land over which it was indispensable to pass in order to get fairly on the river as the top of this ridge or wave was broken it exposed a fissure that enabled us to see the thickness of the ice and this guert pointed out in proof of its strength there was nothing unusual in a small movement of the covering of the river which the current often produces but unless the vast fields below got in motion it was impossible for those above materially to change their positions sleighs were passing too still bringing to town hay from the flats on the eastern bank and there was no longer any hesitation herman mordaunts sleigh passed slowly over the ridge having a care to the legs of the horses and ours followed in the same cautious manner though the blacks jumped across the fissure in spite of their masters exertions  once on the river however guert gave his blacks the whip and rein and away we went like the wind the smooth icy surface of the hudson was our road the thaw having left very few traces of any track the water had all passed beneath the ice through cracks and fissures of one sort and another leaving us an even dry surface to trot on the wind was still southerly though scarcely warm while a bright sun contributed to render our excursion as gay to the eye as it certainly was to our feelings in a few minutes every trace of uneasiness had vanished away we went the blacks doing full credit to their owners boasts seeming scarcely to touch tke ice from which their feet appeared to rebound with a sort of elastic force herman mordaunts bays followed on our heels and the sleighs had passed over the wellknown shoal of the overslaugh within the first twenty minutes after they touched the river  every northern american is familiar with the effect that the motion of a sleigh produces on the spirits under favourable circumstances had our party been altogether composed of albanians there would probably have been no drawback on the enjoyment for use would have prevented apprehension but it required the few minutes i have mentioned to give anneke and mary wallace full confidence in the ice by the time we reached the overslaugh however their fears had vanished and guert confirmed their sense of security by telling them to listen to the sounds produced by his horses hoofs which certainty conveyed the impression of moving on a solid foundation  mary wallace had never before been so gay in my presence as she appeared to be that morning once or twice i fancied her eyes almost as bright as those of annekes and certainly her laugh was as sweet and musical both the girls were full of spirits and some little things occurred that gave me hopes bulstrode had no reason to fancy himself as secure as he sometimes seemed to be a casual remark of guerts had the effect to bring out some of annekes private sentiments on the subject or at least so they appeared to be to me  i am surprised that mr mordaunt forgot to invite mr bulstrode to be one of our party today cried guert when we were below the overslaugh the major loves sleighing and he would have filled the fourth seat in the other sleigh very agreeably as for coming into this that would be refused him were he even a general  mr bulstrode is english answered anneke with spirit and fancies american amusements beneath the tastes of one who has been presented at the court of st james  well miss anneke i cannot say that i agree with you at all in this opinion of mr bulstrode guert returned innocently it is true he is english that he fancies an advantage as does corny littlepage here but we must make proper allowances for homelove and foreigndislike  corny littlepage here is only half english and that half is colonyborn and colonybred answered the laughing girl and he has loved a sleigh from the time when he first slid down hill  ah miss annekelet me entreat  oh no allusion is intended to the dutch church and its neighbourhoodbut the sports of childhood are always dear to us as are sometimes the discomforts habit and prejudice are sister handmaidens and i never see one of these gentlemen from home taking extraordinary interest in any of our peculiarly colony usages but i distrusted an extra amount of complaisance or a sort of enjoyment in which we do not strictly share  is this altogether liberal to bulstrode miss anneke i ventured to put in he seems to like us and i am sure he has good reason so to do that he likes some of us is too apparent to be concealed or denied  mr bulstrode is a skilful actor as all who saw his cato must be aware retorted the charming girl compressing her pouting lips in a way that seemed to me to be inexpressibly pleasing and those who saw his scrub must be equally convinced of the versatility of his talents no no major bulstrode is better where he is or will be today at four oclockat the head of the mess of the th instead of dining in a snug dutch parlour with my cousin worthy mrs van der heyden at a dinner got up with colony hospitality and colony goodwill and colony plainness the entertainment we shall receive today sweetened as it will be by the welcome which will come from the heart can have no competitor in countries where a messenger must be sent two days before the visit to ask permission to come in order to escape cold looks and artificial surprise i would prefer surprising my friends from the heart instead of from the head  guert expressed his astonishment that any one should not always be glad and willing to receive his friends and insisted on it that no such inhospitable customs could exist i knew however that society could not exist on the same terms in old and in new countriesamong a people that was pressed upon by numbers and a people that had not yet felt the evils of a superabundant population americans are like dwellers in the country who are always glad to see their friends and i ventured to say something of the causes of these differences in habits  nothing occurred worthy of being dwelt on in our ride to kinderhook mrs van der heyden resided at a short distance from the river and the blacks and the bays had some little difficulty in dragging us through the mud to her door once there however our welcome fully verified the theory of the colony habits which had been talked over in our drive down annekes worthy connection was not only glad to see her as anybody might have been but she would have been glad to receive as many as her house would hold few excuses were necessary for we were all welcome the visit would retard her dinner an hour as was frankly admittedbut that was nothing and cakes and wine were set before us in the interval did we feel hungry in consequence of a two hours ride guert was desired to make free and go to the stables to give his own orders in a word our reception was just that which every colonist has experienced when he has gone unexpectedly to visit a friend or a friends friend our dinner was excellent though not accompanied by much form the wine was good mrs van der heydens deceased husband having been a judge of what was desirable in that respect everybody was in goodhumour and our hostess insisted on giving us coffee before we took our departure  there will be a moon cousin herman she said and the night will be both light and pleasant guert knows the road which cannot well be missed as it is the river and if you quit me at eight you will reach home in good season to go to rest it is so seldom i see you that i have a right to claim every minute you can spare there remains much to be told concerning our old friends and mutual relatives  when such words are accompanied by looks and acts that prove their sincerity it is not easy to tear ourselves away from a pleasant house we chatted on laughed listened to stories and colony anecdotes that carried us back to the last war and heard a great many eulogiums on beaux and belles that we young people had all our lives considered as respectable elderly commonplace sort of persons  at length the hour arrived when even mrs bogart herself admitted we ought to part anneke and mary were kissed enveloped in their furs and kissed again and then we took our leave as we left the house i remarked that a clock in the passage struck eight in a few minutes every one was placed and the runners were striking fire from the flints of the bare ground we had less difficulty in descending than in ascending the bank of the river though there was no snow it did not absolutely freeze nor had it actually frozen since the commencement of the thaw but the earth had stiffened since the disappearance of the sun i was much rejoiced when the blacks sprang upon the ice and whirled us away on our return road at a rate even exceeding the speed with which they had come down it in the morning i thought it high time we should be in motion on our return and in motion we were if flying at the rate of eleven miles in the hour could thus be termed  the light of the moon was not clear and bright for there was a haze in the atmosphere as is apt to occur in the mild weather of march but there was enough to enable guert to dash ahead with as great a velocity as was at all desirable we were all in high spirits us two young men so much the more because each of us fancied he had seen that day evidence of a tender interest existing in the heart of his mistress towards himself mary wallace had managed with a womans tact to make her suitor appear even respectable in female society and had brought out in him many sentiments that denoted a generous disposition and a manly heart if not a cultivated intellect and guert was getting confidence and with it the means of giving his capacity fairer play as for anneke she now knew my aim and i had some right to construe several little symptoms of feeling that escaped her in the course of the day favourably i fancied that gentle as it always was her voice grew softer and her smile sweeter and more winning as she addressed herself to or smiled on me and she did just enough of both not to appear distant and just little enough to appear conscious at least such were the conjectures of one who i do not think could be properly accused of too much confidence and whose natural diffidence was much increased by the selfdistrust of the purest love  away we went guerts complicated chimes of bells jingling their merry notes in a manner to be heard half a mile the horses bearing hard on the bits for they knew that their own stables lay at the end of their journey and herman mordaunts bays keeping so near us that notwithstanding the noise we made with our own bells the sounds of his were constantly in our ears an hour went swiftly by and we had already passed coejemans and had a hamlet that stretched along the strand and which lay quite beneath the high bank of the river in dim distant view this place has since been known by the name of monkey town and is a little remarkable as being the first cluster of houses on the shores of the hudson after quitting albany i dare say it has another name in law but guert gave it the appellation i have mentioned  i have said that the night had a sombre misty light the moon wading across the heavens through a deep but thin ocean of vapour we saw the shores plainly enough and we saw the houses and trees but it was difficult to distinguish smaller objects at any distance in the course of the day twenty sleighs had been met or passed but at that hour everybody but ourselves appeared to have deserted the river it was getting late for the simple habits of those who dwelt on its shores when about halfway between the islands opposite to coejemans and the hamlet just named guert who stood erect to drive told us that some one who was out late like themselves was coming down the horses of the strangers were in a very fast trot and the sleigh was evidently inclining towards the west shore as if those it held intended to land at no great distance as it passed quite swiftly a mans voice called out something on a high key but our bells made so much noise that it was not easy to understand him he spoke in dutch too and none of our ears those of guert excepted were sufficiently expert in that language to be particularly quick in comprehending what he said the call passed unheeded then such things being quite frequent among the dutch who seldom passed each other on the highway without a greeting of some sort or other i was thinking of this practice and of the points that distinguished our own habits from those of the people of this part of the colony when sleighbells sounded quite near me and turning my head i saw herman mordaunts bays galloping close to us as if wishing to get alongside at the next moment the object was effected and guert pulled up  did you understand the man who passed down guert demanded herman mordaunt as soon as all noises ceased  he called out to us at the top of his voice and would hardly do that without an object  these men seldom go home after a visit to albany without filling their jugs answered guert drily what could he have to say more than to wish us goodnight  i cannot tell but mrs bogart thought she understood something about albany and the river  the ladies always fancy albany is to sink into the river after a great thaw answered guert goodhumouredly but i can show either of them that the ice is sixteen inches thick here where we stand  guert then gave me the reins stepped out of the sleigh went a short distance to a large crack that he had seen while speaking and returned with a thumb placed on the handle of the whip as a measure to show that his statement was true the ice at that spot was certainly nearer eighteen than sixteen inches thick herman mordaunt showed the measure to mrs bogart whose alarm was pacified by this positive proof neither anneke nor mary exhibited any fear but on the contrary as the sleighs separated again each had something pleasant but feminine to say at the expense of poor mrs bogarts imagination  i believe i was the only person in our own sleigh who felt any alarm after the occurrence of this little incident why uneasiness beset me i cannot precisely say it must have been altogether on annekes account and not in the least on my own such accidents as sleighs breaking through on our new york lakes and rivers happened almost every winter and horses were often drowned though it was seldom the consequences proved so serious to their owners i recalled to mind the fragile nature of ice the necessary effects of the great thaw and the heavy rains remembering that frozen water might still retain most of its apparent thickness after its consistency was greatly impaired but i could do nothing if we landed the roads were impassable for runners almost for wheels and another hour might carry the ladies by means of the river to their comfortable homes that day however which down to the moment of meeting the unknown sleigh had been the very happiest of my life was entirely changed in its aspect and i no longer regarded it with any satisfaction had anneke been at home i could gladly have entered into a contract to pass a week on the river myself as the condition of her safety i thought but little of the others to my shame be it said though i cannot do myself the injustice to imagine had anneke been away that i would have deserted even a horse while there was a hope of saving him  away we went guert drove rapidly but he drove with judgment and it seemed as if his blacks knew what was expected of them it was not long before we were trotting past the hamlet i have mentioned it would seem that the bells of the two sleighs attracted the attention of the people on the shore all of whom had not yet gone to bed for the door of a house opened and two men issued out of it gazing at us as we trotted past at a pace that defied pursuit these men also hallooed to us in dutch and again herman mordaunt galloped up alongside to speak to us  did you understand these men he called out for this time guert did not see fit to stop his horses they too had something to tell us  these people always have something to tell an albany sleigh mr mordaunt answered guert though it is not often that which it would do any good to hear  but mrs bogart thinks they also had something to say about albany and the river  i understand dutch as well as excellent mrs bogart said guert a little drily and i heard nothing while i fancy i understand the river better this ice would bear a dozen loads of hay in a close line  this again satisfied herman mordaunt and the ladies but it did not satisfy me our own bells made four times the noise of those of herman mordaunt and it was very possible that one who understood dutch perfectly might comprehend a call in that language while seated in his own sleigh when the same call could not be comprehended by the same person while seated in guerts there was no pause however on we trotted and another mile was passed before any new occurrence attracted attention  the laugh was again heard among us for mary wallace consented to sing an air that was rendered somewhat ludicrous by the accompaniment of the bells this song or verse or two for the singer got no further on account of the interruption had drawn guerts and my attention behind us or away from the horses when a whirling sound was heard followed immediately by a loud shout a sleigh passed within ten yards of us going down and the whirling sound was caused by its runners while the shout came from a solitary man who stood erect waving his whip and calling to us in a loud voice as long as he could be heard this was but for a moment however as his horses were on the run and the last we could see of the man through the misty moonlight he had turned his whip on his team to urge it ahead still faster in an instant herman mordaunt was at our side for the third time that night and he called out to us somewhat authoritatively to stop  what can all this mean guert he asked three times have we had warnings about albany and the river i heard this man myself utter those two words and cannot be mistaken  i dare say sir that you may have heard something of the sort answered the still incredulous guert for these chaps have generally some impertinence to utter when they pass a team that is better than their own these blacks of mine herman mordaunt awaken a good deal of envy whenever i go out with them and a dutchman will forgive you any other superiority sooner than he will overlook your having the best team that last man had a spur in his head moreover and is driving his cattle at this moment more like a spook than like a humane and rational being i dare say he asked if we owned albany and the river  guerts allusion to his horses occasioned a general laugh and laughter is little favourable to cool reflection we all looked out on the solemn and silent night cast our eyes along the wide and long reach of the river in which we happened to be and saw nothing but the calm of nature rendered imposing by solitude and the stillness of the hour guert smilingly renewed his assurances that all was right and moved on away we went guert evidently pressed his horses as if desirous of being placed beyond this anxiety as soon as possible the blacks flew rather than trotted and we were all beginning to submit to the exhilaration of so rapid and easy a motion when a sound which resembled that which one might suppose the simultaneous explosion of a thousand rifles would produce was heard and caused both drivers to pull up the sleighs stopping quite near each other and at the same instant a slight exclamation escaped old mrs bogart but anneke and mary remained still as death  what means that sound guert inquired herman mordaunt the concern he felt being betrayed by the very tone of his voice something seems wrong  something is wrong answered guert coolly but very decidedly and it is something that must be seen to  as this was said guert stepped out on the ice which he struck a hard blow with the heel of his boot as if to make certain of its solidity a second report was heard and it evidently came from behind us guert gazed intently down the river then he laid his head close to the surface of the ice and looked again at the same time three or four more of these startling reports followed each other in quick succession guert instantly rose to his feet  i understand it now he said and find i have been rather too confident the ice however is safe and strong and we have nothing to fear from its weakness perhaps it would be better to quit the river notwithstanding though i am far from certain the better course will not be to push on  let us know the danger at once mr ten eyck said herman mordaunt that we may decide for the best  why sir i am afraid that the rains and the thaw together have thrown so much water into the river all at once as it might be as to have raised the ice and broken it loose in spots from the shores when this happens above before the ice has disappeared below it sometimes causes dams to form which heap up such a weight as to break the whole plain of ice far below it and thus throw cakes over cakes until walls twenty or thirty feet high are formed this has not happened yet therefore there is no immediate danger but by bending your heads low you can see that such a break has just taken place about half a mile below us  we did as guert directed and saw that a mound had arisen across the river nearer than the distance named by our companion completely cutting off retreat by the way we had come the bank on the west side of the hudson was high at the point where we were and looking intensely at it i saw by the manner in which the trees disappeared the more distant behind those that were nearer that we were actually in motion an involuntary exclamation caused the whole party to comprehend this startling fact at the same instant we were certainly in motion though very slowly on the ice of that swollen river in the quiet and solitude of a night in which the moon rather aided in making danger apparent than in assisting us to avoid it what was to be done it was necessary to decide and that promptly and intelligently  we waited for herman mordaunt to advise us but he referred the matter at once to guerts greater experience  we cannot land here answered the young man so long as the ice is in motion and i think it better to push on every foot will bring us so much nearer to albany and we shall get among the islands a mile or two higher where the chances of landing will be greatly increased besides i have often crossed the river on a cake for they frequently stop and i have known even loaded sleighs profit by them to get over the river as yet there is nothing very alarminglet us push on and get nearer to the islands  this then was done though there was no longer heard the laugh or the song among us i could see that herman mordaunt was uneasy about anneke though he could not bring her into his own sleigh leaving mary wallace alone neither could he abandon his respectable connection mrs bogart before we reentered the sleighs i took an occasion to assure him that anneke should be my especial care  god bless you corny my dear boy herman mordaunt answered squeezing my hand with fervour god bless you and enable you to protect her i was about to ask you to change seats with me but on the whole i think my child will be safer with you than she could be with me we will await gods pleasure as accident has placed us  i will desert her only with life mr mordaunt be at ease on that subject  i know you will noti am sure you will not littlepage that affair of the lion is a pledge that you will not had bulstrode come we should have been strong enough tobut guert is impatient to be off god bless you boygod bless you do not neglect my child  guert was impatient and no sooner was i in the sleigh than we were once more in rapid motion i said a few words to encourage the girls and then no sound of a human voice mingled with the gloomy scene     chapter xvi    he started up each limb convulsed   with agonizing fear   he only heard the storm of night   twas music to his ear    lord william   away we went guerts aim was the islands which carried him nearer home while it offered a place of retreat in the event of the dangers becoming more serious the fierce rapidity with which we now moved prevented all conversation or even much reflection the reports of the rending ice however became more and more frequent first coming from above and then from below more than once it seemed as if the immense mass of weight that had evidently collected somewhere near the town of albany was about to pour down upon us in a floodwhen the river would have been swept for miles by a resistless torrent nevertheless guert held on his way firstly because he knew it would be impossible to get on either of the main shores anywhere near the point where we happened to be and secondly because having often seen similar dammings of the waters he fancied we were still safe that the distant reader may understand the precise character of the danger we ran it may be well to give him some notion of the localities  the banks of the hudson are generally high and precipitous and in some places they are mountainous no flats worthy of being mentioned occur until albany is approached nor are those which lie south of that town of any great extent compared with the size of the stream in this particular the mohawk is a very different river having extensive flats that i have been told resemble those of the rhine in miniature as for the hudson it is generally esteemed in the colony as a very pleasing river and i remember to have heard intelligent people from home admit that even the majestic thames itself is scarcely more worthy to be visited or that it better rewards the trouble and curiosity of the enlightened traveller 26  while there are flats on the shores of the hudson and of some extent in the vicinity of albany the general formation of the adjacent country is preservedbeing high bold and in some quarters more particularly to the northward and eastward mountainous among these hills the stream meanders for sixty or eighty miles north of the town receiving tributaries as it comes rushing down towards the sea the character of the river changes entirely a short distance above albany the tides flowing to that point rendering it navigable and easy of ascent in summer all the way from the sea of the tributaries the principal is the mohawk which runs a long distance towards the westthey tell me for i have never visited these remote parts of the colonyamong fertile plains that are bounded north and south by precipitous highlands now in the spring when the vast quantities of snow that frequently lie four feet deep in the forests and among the mountains and valleys of the interior are suddenly melted by the south winds and rains freshets necessarily succeed which have been known to do great injury the flats of the mohawk they tell me are annually overflown and a moderate freshet is deemed a blessing but occasionally a union of the causes i have mentioned produces a species of deluge that has a very opposite character thus it is that houses are swept away and bridges from the smaller mountain streams have been known to come floating past the wharves of albany holding their way towards the ocean at such times the tides produce no countercurrent for it is a usual thing in the early months of the spring to have the stream pour downwards for weeks the whole length of the river and to find the water fresh even as low as new york  such was the general nature of the calamity we had been so unexpectedly made to encounter the winter had been severe and the snows unusually deep and as we drove furiously onward i remembered to have heard my grandfather predict extraordinary freshets in the spring from the character of the winter as we had found it even previously to my quitting home the great thaw and the heavy rains of the late storm had produced the usual effect and the waters thus let loose among the distant as well as the nearer hills were now pouring down upon us in their collected might in such cases the first effect is to loosen the ice from the shores and local causes forcing it to give way at particular points a breaking up of its surface occurs and dams are formed that set the stream back in floods upon all the adjacent low land such as the flats in the vicinity of albany  we did not then know it but at the very moment guert was thus urging his blacks to supernatural effortsactually running them as if on a racecoursethere was a long reach of the hudson opposite to for a short distance below and for a considerable distance above the town which was quite clear of stationary ice vast cakes continued to come down it is true passing on to increase the dam that had formed below near and on the overslaugh where it was buttressed by the islands and rested on the bottom but the whole of that firm field on which we had first driven forth that morning had disappeared this we did not know at the time or it might have changed the direction of guerts movements but i learned it afterwards when placed in a situation to inquire into the causes of what had occurred  herman mordaunts bells and the rumbling sound of his runners were heard close behind us as our own sleigh flew along the river at a rate that i firmly believe could not have been much less than that of twenty miles in the hour as we were whirled northward the reports made by the rending of the ice increased in frequency and force they really became appalling still the girls continued silent maintaining their selfcommand in a most admirable manner though i doubt not that they felt in the fullest extent the true character of the awful circumstances in which we were placed such was the state of things as guerts blacks began sensibly to relax in their speed for want of wind they still galloped on but it was no longer with the swiftness of the wind and their master became sensible of the folly of hoping to reach the town ere the catastrophe should arrive he reined in his panting horses therefore and was just falling into a trot as a violent report was heard directly in our front at the next instant the ice rose positively beneath our horses hoofs to the height of several feet taking the form of the roof of a house it was too late to retreat and guert shouting out jackmoses applied the whip and the spirited animals actually went over the mound leaping a crack three feet in width and reaching the level ice beyond all this was done as it might be in the twinkling of an eye while the sleigh flew over this ridge it was with difficulty i held the girls in their seats though guert stood nobly erect like the pine that is too firmly rooted to yield to the tempest no sooner was the danger passed however than he pulled up and came to a dead halt  we heard the bells of herman mordaunts sleigh on the other side of the barrier but could see nothing the broken cakes pressed upon by millions of tons weight above had risen fully ten feet into an inclination that was nearly perpendicular rendering crossing it next to impossible even to one afoot then came herman mordaunts voice filled with paternal agony and human grief to increase the awe of that dreadful moment  shoreshore he shouted or rather yelledin the name of a righteous providence to the shore guert  the bells passed off towards the western bank and the rumbling of the runners accompanied their sound that was a breathless moment to us four we heard the rending and grinding of the ice on all sides of us saw the broken barriers behind and in front heard the jingling of herman mordaunts bells as it became more and more distant and finally ceased and felt as if we were cut off from the rest of our species i do not think either of us felt any apprehension of breaking through for use had so accustomed us to the field of the river while the more appalling grounds of alarm were so evident that no one thought of such a source of danger nor was there much in truth to apprehend from that cause the thaw had not lasted long enough materially to diminish either the thickness or the tenacity of the common river ice though it was found unequal to resisting the enormous pressure that bore upon it from above it is probable that a cake of an acres size would have upheld not only ourselves but our sleigh and horses and carried us like a raft down the stream had there been such a cake free from stationary impediments even the girls now comprehended the danger which was in a manner suspended over usas the impending wreath of snow menaces the fall of the avalanche but it was no moment for indecision or inaction  cut off as we were by an impassable barrier of ice from the route taken by herman mordaunt it was necessary to come to some resolution on our own course we had the choice of endeavouring to pass to the western shore on the upper side of the barrier or of proceeding towards the nearest of several low islands which lay in the opposite direction guert determined on the last walking his horses to the point of land there being no apparent necessity for haste while the animals greatly needed breath as we went along he explained to us that the fissure below cut us off from the only point where landing on the western shore could be practicable at the same time he put in practice a pious fraud which had an excellent effect on the feelings and conduct of both the girls throughout the remainder of the trying scenes of that fearful night more especially on those of anneke he dwelt on the good fortune of herman mordaunt in being on the right side of the barrier that separated the sleighs in a way to induce those who did not penetrate his motive to fancy the rest of the party was in a place of security as the consequence of this accident thus did anneke believe her father safe and thus was she relieved from much agonizing doubt  as soon as the sleigh came near the point of the island guert gave me the reins and went ahead to examine whether it were possible to land he was absent fifteen minutes returning to us only after he had made a thorough search into the condition of the island as well as of that of the ice in its eastern channel these were fifteen fearful minutes the rending of the masses above and the grinding of cake on cake sounding like the roar of the ocean in a tempest notwithstanding all the awful accessories of this dreadful night i could not but admire guerts coolness of manner and his admirable conduct he was more than resolute for he was cool collected and retained the use of all his faculties in perfection as plausible as it might seem to one less observant and clearheaded to attempt escaping to the western shore guert had decided right in moving towards the island the grinding of the ice in another quarter had apprised him that the water was forcing its way through near the main land and that escape would be nearly hopeless on that side of the river when he rejoined us he called me to the heads of the horses for a conference first solemnly assuring our precious companions that there were no grounds for immediate apprehension mary wallace anxiously asked him to repeat this to her on the faith due from man to woman and he did it when i was permitted to join him without further opposition  corny said guert in a low tone providence has punished me for my wicked wish of seeing mary wallace in the claws of lions for all the savage beasts of the old world could hardly make our case more desperate than it now is we must be cool however and preserve the girls or die like men  our fates are and must be the same do you devote yourself to mary and leave anneke to me but why this language surely our case is by no means so desperate  it might not be so difficult for two active vigorous young men to get ashore but it would be different with females the ice is in motion all around us and the cakes are piling and grinding on each other in a most fearful manner were it light enough to see we should do much better but as it is i dare not trust mary wallace any distance from this island at present we may be compelled to pass the night here and must make provision accordingly you hear the ice grinding on the shore a sign that everything is going down streamgod send that the waters break through ere long though they may sweep all before them when they do come i fear me corny that herman mordaunt and his party are lost  merciful providencecan it be as bad as thati rather hope they have reached the land  that is impossible on the course they took even a man would be bewildered and swept away in the torrent that is driving down under the west shore it is that vent to the water which saves us but no more wordsyou now understand the extent of the danger and will know what you are about we must get our precious charge on the island if possible without further delay half an hournay half a minute may bring down the torrent  guert took the direction of everything even while we had been talking the ice had moved materially and we found ourselves fifty feet further from the island than we had been by causing the horses to advance this distance was soon recovered but it was found impossible to lead or drive them over the broken cakes with which the shore of the island now began to be lined after one or two spirited and determined efforts guert gave the matter up and asked me to help the ladies from the sleigh never did women behave better than did these delicate and lovely girls on an occasion so awfully trying without remonstrances tears exclamations or questions both did as desired and i cannot express the feeling of security i felt when i had helped each over the broken and grinding border of white ice that separated us from the shore the night was far from cold but the ground was now frozen sufficiently to prevent any unpleasant consequences from walking on what would otherwise have been a slimy muddy alluvion for the island was so very low as often to be under water when the river was particularly high this indeed formed our danger after we had reached it  when i returned to guert i found him already drifted down some little distance and this time we moved the sleigh so much above the point as to be in less danger of getting out of sight of our precious wards to my surprise guert was busy in stripping the harness from the horses and jack already stood only in his blinkers moses was soon reduced to the same state i was wondering what was to be done next when guert drew each bridle from its animal and gave a smart crack of his whip the liberated horses started back with affrightsnorted reared and turning away they went down the river free as air and almost as swift the incessant and loud snapping of heir masters whip in no degree tending to diminish their speed i asked the meaning of this  it would be cruel not to let the poor beasts make use of the strength and sagacity nature has given them to save their lives answered guert straining his eyes after moses the horse that was behind so long as his dark form could be distinguished and leaning forward to listen to the blows of their hoofs while the noises around us permitted them to be heard to us they would only be an encumbrance since they never could be forced over the cracks and caked ice in harness nor would it be at all safe to follow them if they could the sleigh is light and we are strong enough to shove it to land when there is an opportunity or it may be left on the island  nothing could have served more effectually to convince me of the manner in which guert regarded our situation than to see him turn loose beasts which i knew he so highly prized i mentioned this and he answered me with a melancholy seriousness that made the impression so much the stronger  it is possible they may get ashore for nature has given a horse a keen instinct they can swim too where you and i would drown at all events they are not fettered with harness but have every chance it is in my power to give them should they land any farmer would put them in his stable and i should soon hear where they were to be found if indeed i am living in the morning to make the inquiry  what is next to be done guert i asked understanding at once both his feelings and his manner of reasoning  we must now run the sleigh on the island after which it will be time to look about us and to examine if it be possible to get the ladies on the main land  accordingly guert and i applied ourselves to the task and had no great difficulty in dragging the sleigh over the cakes grinding and in motion as they were we pulled it as far as the tree beneath which anneke and mary stood when the ladies got into it and took their seats enveloped in the skins the night was not cold for the season and our companions were thickly clad having tippets and muffs still the wolves skins of guert contributed to render them more comfortable all apprehension of immediate danger now ceased for a short time nor do i think either of the females fancied they could run any more risk beyond that of exposure to the night air so long as they remained on terra firma such was not the case however as a very simple explanation will render apparent to the reader  all the islands in this part of the hudson are low being rich alluvial meadows bordered by trees and bushes most of the first being willows sycamores or nuts the fertility of the soil had given to these trees rapid growths and they were generally of some stature though not one among them had that great size which ought to mark the body and branches of a venerable tenant of the forest this fact of itself proved that no one tree of them all was very old a circumstance that was certainly owing to the ravages of the annual freshets i say annual for though the freshet which now encompassed us was far more serious than usual each year brought something of the sort and the islands were constantly increasing or diminishing under their action to prevent the last a thicket of trees was left at the head of each island to form a sort of barricade against the inroads of the ice in the spring so low was the face of the land or meadow however that a rise of a very few feet in the river would be certain to bring it entirely under water all this will be made more apparent by our own proceedings after we had placed the ladies in the sleigh and more especially by the passing remarks of guert while employed in his subsequent efforts  no sooner did guert ten eyck believe the ladies to be temporarily safe than he proposed to me that we should take a closer look at the state of the river in order to ascertain the most feasible means of getting on the main land this was said aloud and in a cheerful way as if he no longer felt any apprehension and evidently to me to encourage our companions anneke desired us to go declaring that now she knew herself to be on dry land all her own fears had vanished we went accordingly taking our first direction towards the head of the island  a very few minutes sufficed to reach the limits of our narrow domain and as we approached them guert pointed out to me the mound of ice that was piling up behind it as a most fearful symptom  there is our danger he said with emphasis and we must not trust to these trees this freshet goes beyond any i ever saw on the river and not a spring passes that we have not more or less of them do you not see corny what saves us now  we are on an island and cannot be in much danger from the river while we stay here  not so my dear friend not at all so but come with me and look for yourself  i followed guert and did look for myself we sprang upon the cakes of ice which were piled quite thirty feet in height on the head of the island extending right and left as far as our eyes could see by that misty light it was by no means difficult moving about on this massive pile the movement in the cakes being slow and frequently interrupted but there was no concealing the true character of the danger had not the island and the adjacent main interposed their obstacles the ice would have continued to move bodily down the stream cake shoving over cake until the whole found vent in the wider space below and floated off towards the ocean not only was our island there however but other islands lay near us straitening the different channels or passages in such a way as to compel the formation of an icy dam and on the strength of this dam rested all our security were it to be ruptured anywhere near us we should inevitably be swept off in a body guert thought however as has been said already that the waters had found narrow issues under the main land both east and west of us and should this prove to be true there was a hope that the great calamity might be averted in other words if these floodgates sufficed we might escape otherwise the catastrophe was certain  i cannot excuse it to myself to remain here without endeavouring to see what is the state of things nearer to the shore said guert after we had viewed the fast accumulating mass of broken ice above us as well as the light permitted and we had talked over together the chances of safety and the character of the danger do you return to the ladies corny and endeavour to keep up their spirits while i cross this channel on our right to the next island and see what offers in that direction  i do not like the idea of your running all the risk alone besides something may occur to require the strength of two instead of that of one to overcome it  you can go with me as far as the next island if you will where we shall be able to ascertain at once whether it be ice or water that separates us from the eastern shore if the first you can return as fast as possible for the ladies while i look for a place to cross i do not like the appearance of this dam to be honest with you and have great fears for those who are now in the sleigh  we were in the very act of moving away when a loud cracking noise that arose within a few yards alarmed us both and running to the spot whence it proceeded we saw that a large willow had snapped in two like a pipestem and that the whole barrier of ice was marching slowly but grandly over the stump crushing the fallen trunk and branches beneath its weight as the slowmoving wheel of the loaded cart crushes the twig guert grasped my arm and his fingers nearly entered the flesh under his iron pressure  we must quit this spot he said firmly and at once let us go back to the sleigh  i did not know guerts intentions but i saw it was time to act with decision we moved swiftly down to the spot where we had left the sleigh and the reader will judge of our horror when we found it gone the whole of the low point of the island where we had left it was already covered with cakes of ice that were in motion and which had doubtless swept off the sleigh during the few minutes that we had been absent looking around us however we saw an object on the river a little distance below that i fancied was the sleigh and was about to rush after it when a voice filled with alarm took us in another direction mary wallace came out from behind a tree to which she had fled for safety and seizing guerts arm implored him not to quit her again  whither has anneke gone i demanded in an agony i cannot describei see nothing of anneke  she would not quit the sleigh answered mary wallace almost panting for breathi imploredentreated her to follow mesaid you must soon return but she refused to quit the sleigh anneke is in the sleigh if that can now be found  i heard no more but springing on the still moving cakes of ice went leaping from cake to cake until my sight showed me that sure enough the sleigh was on the bed of the river over which it was in slow motion forced downwards before the new coating of ice that was fast covering the original surface at first i could see no one in the sleigh but on reaching it i found anneke buried in the skins she was on her knees the precious creature was asking succour from god  i had a wild but sweet consolation in thus finding myself as it might be cut off from all the rest of my kind in the midst of that scene of gloom and desolation alone with anneke mordaunt the moment i could make her conscious of my presence she inquired after mary wallace and was much relieved on learning that she was with guert and would not be left by him for a single instant again that night indeed i saw their figures dimly as they moved swiftly across the channel that divided the two islands and disappear in that direction among the bushes that lined the place to which they had gone  let us follow i said eagerly the crossing is yet easy and we too may escape to the shore  go you said anneke over whom a momentary physical torpor appeared to have passed go you corny she said a man may easily save himself and you are an only childthe sole hope of your parents  dearest beloved annekewhy this indifferencethis apathy on your own behalf are you not an only child the sole hope of a widowed fatherdo you forget him  no no no exclaimed the dear girl hurriedly help me out of the sleigh corny there i will go with you anywhereany howto the end of the world to save my father from such anguish  from that moment the temporary imbecility of anneke vanished and i found her for the remainder of the time we remained in jeopardy quick to apprehend and ready to second all my efforts it was this passing submission to an imaginary doom on the one hand and the headlong effect of sudden fright on the other which had separated the two girls and which had been the means of dividing the whole party as described  i scarcely know how to describe what followed so intense was my apprehension on behalf of anneke that i can safely say i did not think of my own fate in the slightest degree as disconnected from hers the selfdevoted reliance with which the dear girl seemed to place all her dependence on me would of itself have produced this effect had she not possessed my whole heart as i was now so fully aware moments like those make one alive to all the affections and strip off every covering that habit or the dissembling of our manners is so apt to throw over the feelings i believe i both spoke and acted towards anneke as one would cling to or address the being dearest to him in the world for the next few minutes but i can suppose the reader will naturally prefer learning what we did under such circumstances rather than what we said or how we felt  i repeat it is not easy for me to describe what followed i know we first rather ran than walked across the channel on which i had last seen the dim forms of guert and mary and even crossed the island to its eastern side in the hope of being able to reach the shore in that quarter the attempt was useless for we found the water running down over the ice like a raceway nothing could be seen of our late companions and my loud and repeated calls to them were unanswered  our case is hopeless cornelius said anneke speaking with a forced calmness when she found retreat impossible in that direction let us return to the sleigh and submit to the will of god  beloved annekethink of your father and summon your whole strength the bed of the river is yet firm we will cross it and try the opposite shore  cross it we did my delicate companion being as much sustained by my supporting arm as by her own resolution but we found the same obstacle to retreat interposing there also the island above had turned the waters aside until they found an outlet under each bankshooting along their willowy shores with the velocity of arrows by this time owing to our hurried movement i found anneke so far exhausted that it was absolutely necessary to pause a minute to take breath this pause was also necessary in order to look about us and to decide understandingly as to the course it was necessary now to pursue this pause brief as it was moreover contributed largely to the apparent horrors of our situation  the grating or grinding of the ice above us cake upon cake now sounded like the rushing of heavy winds or the incessant roaring of a surf upon the seashore the piles were becoming visible by their height and their proximity as the ragged barriers set slowly but steadily down upon us and the whole river seemed to me to be in motion downwards at this awful instant when i began to think it was the will of providence that anneke and i were to perish together a strange sound interrupted the fearful natural accessories of that frightful scene i certainly heard the bells of a sleigh at first they seemed distant and brokenthen nearer and incessant attended by the rumbling of runners on the ice i took off my cap and pressed my head for i feared my brain was unsettled there it came however more and more distinctly until the trampling of horses hoofs mingled in the noise  can there be others as unhappy as ourselves exclaimed anneke forgetting her own fears in generous sympathy see littlepagesee dear corneliusyonder surely comes another sleigh  come it did like the tempest or the whirlwind passing within fifty feet of us i knew it at a glance it was the sleigh of herman mordaunt empty with the horses maddened by terror running wherever their fears impelled as the sleigh passed it was thrown on one side then it was once more whirled up again and it went out of sight with the rumbling sound of the runners mingling with the jingling of bells and the tramp of hoofs  at this instant a loud distant cry from a human voice was certainly heard it seemed to me as if some one called my name and anneke said she so understood it too the call if call it was came from the south and from under the western shore at the next moment awful reports proceeded from the barrier above and passing an arm around the slender waist of my lovely companion to support her i began a rapid movement in the direction of that call while attempting to reach the western shore i had observed a high mound of broken ice that was floating down or rather was pressed down on the smooth surface of the frozen river in advance of the smaller cakes that came by in the current it was increasing in size by accessions from these floating cakes and threatened to form a new dam at some narrow pass below as soon as of sufficient size it occurred to me we should be temporarily safe could we reach that mound for it rose so high as to be above danger from the water thither then i ran almost carrying anneke on my arm our speed increased by the terrific sounds from the dam above us  we reached the mound and found the cakes so piled as to be able to ascend them though not without an effort after getting up a layer or two the broken mass became so irregular and ragged as to render it necessary for me to mount first and then to drag anneke up after me this i did until exhausted and we both seated ourselves on the edge of a cake in order to recover our breath while there it struck me that new sounds arose from the river and bending forward to examine i saw that the water had forced its way through the dam above and was coming down upon us in a torrent  footnote 26 this remark of mr cornelius littlepages may induce a smile in the reader but few persons of fifty can be found who cannot recall the time when it was a rare thing to imagine anything american as good as its english counterpart the american who could write a booka real live bookforty years since was a sort of prodigy it was the same with him who could paint any picture beyond a common portrait the very fruits and natural productions of the country were esteemed doubtingly and he was a bold man who dared to extol even canvassback ducks in the year 1800 at the present day the feeling is fast undergoing an organic change it is now the fashion to extol everything american and from submitting to a degree that was almost abject to the feeling of colonial dependency the country is filled today with the most profound provincial selfadmiration it is to be hoped that the next change will bring us to something like the trutheditor     chapter xvii    my heart leaps up when i behold   a rainbow in the sky   so was it when my life began   so is it now i am a man   so be it when i shall grow old   or let me die    the child is father of the man   and i could wish my days to be   bound each to each by natural piety    wordsworth   five minutes longer on the ice of the main channel and we should have been swept away even as we still sat looking at the frightful force of the swift current as well as the dim light of that clouded night would permit i saw guert ten eycks sleigh whirl past us and only a minute later herman mordaunts followed the poor exhausted beasts struggling in the harness for freedom that they might swim for their lives anneke heard the snorting of those wretched horses but her unpractised eyes did not detect them immersed as they were in the current nor had she recognised the sleigh that whirled past us as her fathers a little later a fearful shriek came from one of the fettered beasts such a heartpiercing cry as it is known the horse often gives i said nothing on the subject knowing that love for her father was one of the great incentives which had aroused my companion to exertion and being unwilling to excite fears that were now latent  two or three minutes of rest were all that circumstances permitted i could see that everything visible on the river was in motion downwards the piles of ice on which we were placed as well as the cakes that glanced by us in their quicker descent our own motion was slow on account of the mass which doubtless pressed on the shoals of the west side of the river as well as on account of the friction against the lateral fields of ice and occasionally against the shore still we were in motion and i felt the necessity on every account of getting as soon as possible on the western verge of our floating island in order to profit by any favourable occurrence that might offer  dear annekehow admirably did she behave that fearful night from the moment she regained her entire consciousness after i found her praying in the bottom of the sleigh down to that instant she had been as little of an encumbrance to my own efforts as was at all possible reasonable resolute compliant and totally without any illtimed exhibition of womanly apprehension she had done all she was desired to do unhesitatingly and with intelligence in ascending that pile of ice by no means an easy task under any circumstances we had acted in perfect concert every effort of mine being aided by one of her own directed by my advice and greater experience  god has not deserted us dearest anneke i said now that my companions strength appeared to have returned and we may yet hope to escape i can anticipate the joy we shall bring to your fathers heart when he again takes you to his arms safe and uninjured  dear dear fatherwhat agony he must now be suffering on my accountcome corny let us go to him at once if it be possible  as this was said the precious girl arose and adjusted her tippet in a way that should cause her no encumbrance like one ready to set about the execution of a serious task with all her energies the muff had been dropped on the river for neither of us had any sensibility to cold the night however was quite mild for the season and we probably should not have suffered had our exertions been less violent anneke declared herself ready to proceed and i commenced the difficult and delicate task of aiding her across an island composed of icy fragments in order to reach its western margin we were quite thirty feet in the air and a fall into any of the numerous caverns among which we had to proceed might have been fatal certainly would have crippled the sufferer then the surface of the ice was so smooth as to render walking on it an exceedingly delicate operation more especially as the cakes lay at all manner of inclinations to the plane of the horizon fortunately i wore buckskin moccasins over my boots and their rough leather aided me greatly in maintaining my footing anneke too had socks of cloth without which i do not think she could have possibly moved by these aids however and by proceeding with the utmost caution we had actually succeeded in attaining our object when the floating mass shot into an eddy and turning slowly round under this new influence placed us on the outer side of the island again not a murmur escaped anneke at this disappointment but with a sweetness of temper that spoke volumes in favour of her natural disposition and a resignation that told her training she professed a readiness to renew her efforts to this i would not consent however for i saw that the eddy was still whirling us about and i thought it best to escape from its influence altogether before we threw away our strength fruitlessly instead of recrossing the pile therefore i told my fair companion that we would descend to a cake that lay level on the water and which projected from the mass to such a distance as to be close to the shore should we again get near it this descent was made after some trouble though i was compelled to receive anneke entirely into my arms in order to effect it effect it i did placing the sweet girl safely at my side on the outermost and lowest of all the cakes in our confused pile  in some respects this change was for the better while it did not improve our situation in others it placed both anneke and myself behind a shelter as respected the wind which though neither very strong nor very cold had enough of march about it to render the change acceptable it took my companion too from a position where motion was difficult and often dangerous leaving her on a level even spot where she could walk with ease and security and keep the blood in motion by exercise then it put us both in the best possible situation to profit by any contact with that shore along and near which our island was now slowly moving  there could no longer be any doubt of the state of the river in general it had broken up spring had come like a thief in the night and the ice below having given way while the mass above had acquired too much power to be resisted everything was set in motion and like the death of the strong man the disruption of fields in themselves so thick and adhesive had produced an agony surpassing the usual struggle of the seasons nevertheless the downward motion had begun in earnest and the centre of the river was running like a sluice carrying away in its current those masses which had just before formed so menacing an obstacle above  luckily our own pile was a little aside from the great downward rush i have since thought that it touched the bottom which caused it to turn as well as retarded its movement be this as it might we still remained in a little bay slowly turning in a circle and glad was i to see our low cake coming round again in sight of the western shore the moment now demanded decision and i prepared anneke to meet it a large low level cake had driven up on the shore and extended out so far as to promise that our own cake would touch it in our evolutions i knew that the ice in general had not broken in consequence of any weakness of its own but purely under the weight of the enormous pressure from above and the mighty force of the current and that we ran little or no risk in trusting our persons on the uttermost limits of any considerable fragment a station was taken accordingly near a projection of the cake we were on when we waited for the expected contact at such moments the slightest disappointment carries with it the force of the greatest circumstances several times did it appear to us that our island was on the point of touching the fastened cake and as often did it incline aside at no time coming nearer than within six or eight feet this distance it would have been easy enough for me to leap across but to anneke it was a barrier as impassable as the illimitable void the sweet girl saw this and she acted like herself under the circumstances she took my hand pressed it and said earnestly and with patient sweetness  you see how it is corny i am not permitted to escape but you can easily reach the shore go then and leave me in the hands of providence go i never can forget what you have already done but it is useless to perish together  i have never doubted that anneke was perfectly sincere in her wish that i should at least save my own life the feeling with which she spoke the despair that was coming over her and the movement of our island which at that moment gave signs of shooting away from the shore altogether roused me to a sudden and certainly to a very bold attempt i tremble even at this distance of time as i write the particulars a small cake of ice was floating in between us and that which lay firmly fastened to the shore its size was such as to allow it to pass between the two though not without coming nearly if not absolutely in contact with one if not with both i observed all this and saying one word of encouragement to anneke i passed an arm around her waistwaited the proper momentand sprang forward it was necessary to make a short leap with my precious burthen on my arm in order to gain this floating bridge but it was done and successfully scarcely permitting annekes foot to touch this frail support which was already sinking under our joint weight i crossed it at two or three steps and threw all my power into a last and desperate effort i succeeded here also and fell upon the firmer cake with a heart filled with gratitude to god the touch told me that we were safe and in the next instant we reached the solid ground under such circumstances one usually looks back to examine the danger he has just gone through i did so and saw that the floating cake of ice had already passed down and was out of reach while the mass that had been the means of saving us was slowly following under some new impulse received from the furious currents of the river but we were saved and most devoutly did i thank my god who had mercifully aided our escape from perils so imminent  i was compelled to wait for anneke who fell upon her knees and remained there quite a minute before i could aid her in ascending the steep acclivity which formed the western bank of the hudson at this particular point we reached the top however after a little delay and pausing once or twice to take breath when we first became really sensible of the true character of the scene from which we had been delivered dim as was the light there was enough to enable us to overlook a considerable reach of the river from that elevated stand the hudson resembled chaos rushing headlong between the banks as for the cakes of icesome darting past singly and others piled as high as housesof course the stream was filled with such but a large dark object was seen coming through that very channel over which anneke and i had stood less than an hour before sailing down the current with fearful rapidity it was a house of no great size it is true but large enough to present a singular object on the river a bridge of some size followed and a sloop that had been borne away from the wharves of albany soon appeared in the strange assemblage that was thus suddenly collected on this great artery of the colony  but the hour was late anneke was yet to care for it was necessary to seek a shelter still supporting my lovely companion who now began to express her uneasiness on account of her father and her other friends i held the way inland knowing that there was a high road parallel to the river and at no great distance from it we reached the highway in the course of ten minutes and turned our faces northward as the direction which led towards albany we had not advanced far before i heard the voices of men who were coming towards us and glad was i to recognise that of dirck follock among the number i called aloud and was answered by a shout of exultation which as i afterwards discovered spontaneously broke out of his mouth when he recognised the form of anneke dirck was powerfully agitated when we joined him i had never previously seen anything like such a burst of feeling from him and it was some time before i could address him  of course your whole party is safe i asked a little doubtingly for i had actually given up all who had been in herman mordaunts sleigh for lost  yes thank god all but the sleigh and horses but where are guert ten eyck and miss wallace  gone ashore on the other side of the river we parted and they took that direction while we came hither i said this to quiet annekes fears but i had misgivings about their having got off the river at all but let me know the manner of your own escape  dirck then gave us a history of what had passed the whole party turning back to accompany us as soon as i told them that their erranda search for the horseswas useless the substance of what we heard was as followsin the first effort to reach the western shore herman mordaunt had been met by the very obstacle which guert had foreseen and he turned south hoping to find some spot at which to land by going farther from the dam that had formed above after repeated efforts and having nearly lost his sleigh and the whole party a point was reached at which herman mordaunt determined to get his female companion on shore at every hazard this was to be done only by crossing floating cakes of ice in a current that was already running at the rate of four or five miles in the hour dirck was left in charge of the horses while the experiment was made but seeing the adventurers in great danger he flew to their assistancewhen the whole party were immersed though not in deep water left to themselves and alarmed with the floundering in the river and the grinding of the cakes herman mordaunts bays went off in the confusion mrs bogart was assisted to the land and was helped to reach the nearest dwellinga comfortable farmhouse about a quarter of a mile beyond the point where we had met the party there mrs bogart had been placed in a warm bed and the gentlemen were supplied with such dry clothes as the rustic wardrobe of these simple people could furnish the change made dirck was on his way to ascertain what had become of the sleigh and horses as has been mentioned  on inquiry i found that the spot where anneke and myself had landed was quite three miles below the island on which guert and i had drawn the sleigh nearly the whole of this distance had we floated with the pile of broken ice in the short time we were on it a proof of the furious rate at which the current was setting downward no one had heard anything of guert and mary but i encouraged my companion to believe that they were necessarily safe on the other shore i certainly deemed this to be very questionable but there was no use in anticipating evil  on reaching the farmhouse herman mordaunts delight and gratitude may more easily be imagined than described he folded anneke to his heart and she wept like an infant on his bosom nor was i forgotten in this touching scene but came in for a full share of notice  i want no details noble young man i am professing to write the truth and must be excused for relating such things as these buti want no details noble young man said herman mordaunt squeezing my hand to feel certain that under god i owe my childs life for the second time to you i wish to heavenbut no matterit is now too latesome other way may and must offer i scarce know what i say littlepage but what i mean is to express faintly some small portion of the gratitude i feel and to let you know how sensibly and deeply your services are felt and appreciated  the reader may think it odd that this incoherent but pregnant speech made little impression on me at the time beyond the grateful conviction of having really rendered the greatest of all services to anneke and her father though i had better occasion to remember it afterwards  it is unnecessary to dwell more particularly on the occurrences at the farmhouse the worthy people did what they could to make us comfortable and we were all warm in bed in the course of the next halfhour  on the following morning a wagon was harnessed and we left these simple countrymen and womenwho refused everything like compensation as a matter of courseand proceeded homeward i have heard it said that we americans are mercenary it may be so but not a man probably exists in the colonies who would accept money for such assistance we were two hours in reaching albany on wheels and entered the place about ten in a very different style from that in which we had quitted it the day before as we drove along the highway frequently led us to points that commanded views of the river and we had so many opportunities of noting the effects of the freshet of ice very little remained here and there a cake or a pile was seen still adhering to the shore and occasionally fragments floated downwards but as a rule the torrent had swept all before it i particularly took notice of the island on which we had sought refuge it was entirely under water but its outlines were to be traced by the bushes which lined its low banks most of the trees on its upper end were cut down and all that grew on it would unquestionably have gone had not the dam given way as early as it did a great number of trees had been broken down on all the islands and large tops and heavy trunks were still floating in the current that were lately tenants of the forest and had been violently torn from their places  we found all the lower part of albany too under water boats were actually moving through the streets a considerable portion of its inhabitants having no other means of communicating with their neighbours a sloop of some size lay up on one of the lowest spots and as the water was already subsiding it was said she would remain there until removed by the shipwrights nobody was drowned in the place for it is not usual for the people of these colonies to remain in their beds at such times to await the appearance of the enemy in at their windows we often read of such accidents destroying hundreds in the old world but in the new human life is of too much account to be unnecessarily thrown away and so we make some efforts to preserve it  as we drove into the street in which herman mordaunt lived we heard a shout and turning our heads we saw guert ten eyck waving his cap to us with joy delineated in every feature of his handsome face at the next moment he was at our side  mr herman mordaunt he cried shaking that gentleman most cordially by the hand i look upon you as one raised from the dead you and my excellent neighbour mrs bogart and mr follock here how you got off the river is a mystery to me for i well know that the water commonly breaks through first under the west shore corny and miss annekegod bless you both mary wallace is in terror lest ill news come from some of you but i will run ahead and let her know the glad tidings it is but five minutes since i left her starting at every sound lest it prove the foot of some illomened messenger  guert stopped to say no more in a minute he was inside of herman mordaunts housein another anneke and mary wallace were locked in each others arms after exchanging salutes mrs bogart was conveyed to her own residence and there was a termination to that memorable expedition  guert had less to communicate in the way of dangers and marvels than i had anticipated it seemed that when he and miss wallace reached the inner margin of the last island a large cake of ice had entered the strait and got jammed or rather that it went through forced by the tremendous pressure above though not without losing large masses as it came in contact with the shores and grinding much of its material into powder by the attrition guerts presence of mind and decision did him excellent service here without delaying an instant the moment it was in his power he led mary on that cake and crossed the narrow branch of the river which alone separated him from the main land on it dryshod the water was beginning to find its way over this cake as it usually did on all those that lay low and which even stopped in their progress but this did not offer any serious obstacles to persons who were so prompt safe themselves our friends remained to see if we could not be induced to join them and the call we heard was from guert who had actually recrossed to the island in the hope of meeting us and directing us to a place of safety guert never said anything to me on the subject himself but i subsequently gathered from mary wallaces accounts that the young man did not rejoin her without a good deal of hazard and difficulty and after a long and fruitless search for his companions finding it useless to remain any longer on the riverside guert and his companion held their way towards albany about midnight they reached the ferry opposite to the town having walked quite six miles filled with uneasiness on account of those who had been left behind guert was a man of decision and he wisely determined it would be better to proceed than to attempt waking up the inmates of any of the houses he passed the river was now substantially free from ice though running with great velocity but guert was an expert oarsman and finding a skiff he persuaded mary wallace to enter it actually succeeding by means of the eddies in landing her within ten feet of the very spot where the handsled had deposited him and myself only a few days before from this point there was no difficulty in walking home and miss wallace actually slept in her own bed that eventful night if indeed she could sleep  such was the termination of this adventure one that i have rightly termed memorable in the end jack and moses came in safe and sound having probably swum ashore they were found in the public road only a short distance from the town and were brought in to their master the same day every one who took any interest in horsesand what dutchman does notknew jack and moses and there was no difficulty in ascertaining to whom they belonged what is singular however both sleighs were recovered though at long intervals of time and under very different circumstances that of guert wolves skins and all actually went down the whole length of the river on the ice passing out to sea through the narrows it must have gone by new york in the night or doubtless it would have been picked up while the difficulty of reaching it was its protector on the descent above the town once outside of the narrows it was thrown by the tide and winds upon the shore of staten island where it was hauled to land housed and being properly advertised in our new york paper guert actually got tidings of it in time to receive it skins and all by one of the first sloops that ascended the hudson that year which was within a fortnight after the river had opened the year 1758 was one of great activity on account of the movements of the army and no time was then unnecessarily lost  the history of herman mordaunts sleigh was very different the poor bays must have drowned soon after we saw them floating past us in the torrent of course life had no sooner left them than they sank to the bottom of the river carrying with them the sleigh to which they were still attached in a few days the animals rose to the surfaceas is usual with all swollen bodiesbringing up the sleigh again in this condition the wreck was overtaken by a downward bound sloop the men of which saved the sleigh harness skins footstoves and such other articles as would not float away  our adventure made a good deal of noise in the circle of albany and i have reason to think that my own conduct was approved by those who heard of it bulstrode paid me an especial visit of thanks the very day of my return when the following conversation took place between us  you seem fated my dear corny the major observed after he had paid the usual compliments to be always serving me in the most material way and i scarcely know how to express all i feel on the occasion first the lion and now this affair of the riverbut that guert will drown or make away with the whole family before the summer is over unless mr mordaunt puts a stop to his interference  this accident was one that might have overtaken the oldest and most prudent man in albany the river seemed as solid as the street when we went on it and another hour even as it was would have brought us all home in entire safety  ay but that hour came near bringing death and desolation into the most charming family in the colony and you have been the means of averting the heaviest part of the blow i wish to heaven littlepage that you would consent to come into the army join us as a volunteer the moment we move and i will write to sir harry to obtain a pair of colours for you as soon as he hears that we are indebted to your coolness and courage for the life of miss mordaunt he will move heaven and earth to manifest his gratitude the instant this good parent made up his mind to accept miss mordaunt as a daughter he began to consider her as a child of his own  and annekemiss mordaunt herself mr bulstrodedoes she regard sir harry as a father  why that must be coming by slow degrees as a matter of course you know women are slower than us men to admit such totally novel impressions and i dare say anneke fancies one father enough for her just at this moment though she sends very pleasant messages to sir harry i can assure you when in the humour but what makes you so grave my good corny  mr bulstrode i conceive it no more than fair to be as honest as yourself in this matter you have told me that you are a suitor for miss mordaunts hand i will now own to you that i am your rival  my companion heard this declaration with a quiet smile and the most perfect goodnature  so you actually wish to become the husband of anneke mordaunt yourself my dear corny do you he said so coolly that i was at a loss to know of what sort of materials the man could be made  i do major bulstrodeit is the first and last wish of my heart  since you seem disposed to reciprocate my confidence you will not take offence if i ask you a question or two  certainly not sir your own frankness shall be a rule for my government  have you ever let miss mordaunt know that such are your wishes  i have sir and that in the plainest termssuch as cannot well be misunderstood  what last nighton that infernal icewhile she thought her life was in your hands  nothing was said on the subject last night for we had other thoughts to occupy our minds  it would have been a most ungenerous thing to take advantage of a ladys fears  major bulstrodei cannot submit  hush my dear corny interrupted the other holding out a hand in a most quiet and friendly manner there must be no misunderstanding between you and me men are never greater simpletons than when they let the secret consciousness of their love of life push them into swaggering about their honour when their honour has in fact nothing to do with the matter in hand i shall not quarrel with you and must beg you in advance to receive my apologies for any little indecorum into which i may be betrayed by surprise as for great pieces of indecorum i shall endeavour to avoid them  enough has been said mr bulstrode i am no wrangler to quarrel with a shadow and i trust not in the least that most contemptible of all human beings a social bully to be on all occasions menacing the sword or the pistol such men usually do nothing when matters come to a crisis even when they fight they fight bunglingly and innocently  you are right littlepage and i honour your sentiments i have remarked that the most expert swordsman with his tongue and the deadest shot at a shingle are commonly as innocent as lambs of the shedding of blood on the ground they can sometimes screw themselves up to meet an adversary but it exceeds their powers to use their weapons properly when it comes to serious work the swaggerer is ever a coward at heart however well he may wear a mask for a time but enough of thiswe understand each other and are to remain friends under all circumstances may i question further  ask what you please bulstrodei shall answer or not at my own discretion  then permit me to inquire if major littlepage has authorized you to offer proper settlements  i am authorized to offer nothingnor is it usual for the husband to make settlements on his wife in these colonies further than what the law does for her in favour of her own the father sometimes has a care for the third generation i should expect herman mordaunt to settle his estate on his daughter and her rightful heirs let her marry whom she may  ay that is a very american notion and one on which herman mordaunt who remembers his extraction will be little likely to act well corny we are rivals as it would seem but that is no reason we should not remain friends we understand each otherthough perhaps i ought to tell you all  i should be glad to know all mr bulstrode and can meet my fate i hope like a man whatever it may cost me if anneke prefer another her happiness will be dearer to me than my own  yes my dear fellow we all say and think so at oneandtwenty which is about your age i believe at twoandtwenty we begin to see that our own happiness has an equal claim on us and at threeandtwenty we even give it the preference however i will be just if i am selfish i have no reason to believe anne mordaunt does prefer me though my perhaps is not altogether without a meaning either  in which case i may possibly be permitted to know to what it refers  it refers to the father and i can tell you my fine fellow that fathers are of some account in the arrangement of marriages between parties of any standing had not sir harry authorized my own proposals where should i have been not a farthing of settlement could i have offered while he remained sir harry notwithstanding i had the prodigious advantage of the entail i can tell you what it is corny the existing power is always an important power since we all think more of the present time than of the future that is the reason so few of us get to heaven as for herman mordaunt i deem it no more than fair to tell you he is on my side heart and hand he likes my offers of settlement he likes my family he likes my rank civil and military and i am not altogether without the hope that he likes me  i made no direct answer and the conversation soon changed bulstrodes declaration however caused me to remember both the speech and manner of herman mordaunt when he thanked me for saving his daughters life i now began to reflect on it and reflected on it much during the next few months in the end the reader will learn the effect it had on my happiness     chapter xviii    good sir why do you start and seem to fear   things that do sound so fair i the name of truth   are ye fantastical or that indeed   which outwardly ye show    banquo  as i have said already the adventure on the river made a good deal of noise in that simple community and it had the effect to render guert and myself a sort of heroes in a small way bringing me much more into notice than would otherwise have been the case i thought that guert in particular would be likely to reap its benefit for various elderly persons who were in the habit of frowning whenever his name was mentioned i was given to understand could now smile and two or three of the most severe among the albany moralists were heard to say that after all there was some good about that guert ten eyck the reader will not require to be told that a highschool moralist in a place as retired and insulated as albany must necessarily be a being that became subject to a very severe code morality as i understand the matter has a good deal of convention about it there is townmorality and countrymorality all over the world as they tell me but in america our morals were and long have been separated into three great and very distinct classes viznew england or puritanmorals middle colonies or liberal morals and southern colonies or latitudinarian morals i shall not pretend to point out all the shades of difference in these several schools though that in which i had myself been taught was necessarily the most in conformity with my own tastes there were minor shades to be found in the same school guert and myself belonging to different classes his morals were of the dutch class while mine more properly belonged to the english the great characteristic of the dutch school was the tendency to excess that prevailed when indulgences were sought with them it did not rain often but when it did rain it was pretty certain to pour old col follock was a case in point on this scare nor was his son dirck young and diffident as he was altogether an exception to the rule there was not a more respectable man in the colony in the main than col van valkenburgh he was well connected had a handsome unencumbered estate and money at interestwas a principal prop in the church of his neighbourhood was esteemed as a good husband a good father a true friend a kind neighbour an excellent and loyal subject and a thoroughly honest man nevertheless col van valkenburgh had his weak times and seasons he would have a frolic and the dominie was obliged to wink at this propensity mr worden often nicknamed him col frolic his frolics might be divided into two classes viz the moderate and immoderate of the first he had two or three turns a year and these were the occasions on which he commonly visited satanstoe or had my father with him at rockrockarock as his own place in rockland was called on these visits whether to or from there was a large consumption of tobacco beer cider wine rum lemons sugar and the other ingredients of punch toddy and flip but no outrageously durable excesses there was much laughing a great deal of good feeling many stories and regular repetitions of old adventures in the way of traditional narrations but nothing that could be called decided excesses it is true that my grand father and my father and the rev mr worden and col follock were much in the habit of retiring to their beds a little confused in their brains the consequence of so much tobaccosmoke as mr worden always maintained but everything was decent and in order the parson for instance invariably pulled up on a friday and did not take his place in the circle until monday evening again which gave him fully twentyfour hours to cool off in before he ascended the pulpit i will say this for mr worden that he was very systematic and methodical in the observance of all his duties and i have known him when he happened to be late at dinner on discovering that my father had omitted to say grace insist on everybodys laying down their knives and forks while he asked a blessing even though it were after the fish was actually eaten no no mr worden was a particular person about all such things and it was generally admitted that he had been the means of causing grace to be introduced into several families in westchester in which it had never been the practice to have it before his examples and precepts were known to them  i had not been acquainted with guert ten eyck a fortnight before i saw he had a tendency to the same sort of excesses as those to which col van valkenburgh was addicted there was an old french huguenot living near satanstoeor rather the son of one who still spoke his fathers languageand who used to call col follocks frolics his grands couchers and his petit couchers 27 inasmuch as he usually got to bed at the last without assistance while at the first it was indispensable that some aid should be proffered it was these grands couchers at which my father never assisted on these occasions the colonel invariably held his orgies over in rockland in the society of men of purely dutch extraction there being something exclusive in the enjoyment i have heard it said that these last frolics sometimes lasted a week on really important occasions during the whole of which time the colonel and all near him were as happy as lords these grands couchers however occurred but rarelycoming round as it might be like leapyears just to regulate the calendar and adjust the time  as for my new friend guert he made no manifestation towards a grand coucher during the time i remained at albanythis his attachment to mary wallace forbadebut i discovered by means of hints and allusions that he had been engaged in one or two such affairs and that there was still a longing for them in his bones it was owing to her consciousness of the existence of such weaknesses and her own strong aversion to anything of the sort that i am persuaded mary wallace was alone induced to hesitate about accepting guerts weekly offer of his hand the tenderness she evidently felt for him now shone too obviously in her eyes to leave any doubt in my mind of guerts final success for what woman ever refused long to surrender when the image of the besieger had taken its place in the citadel of her heart even anneke received guert with much favour after his excellent behaviour on the river and i fancied that everything was going on most flatteringly for my friend while it seemed to me that i made no advances in my own suit such at least were my notions on the subject at the very moment when my new friend as it appeared was nearly driven to desperation  it was near the end of april or about a month after our perilous adventure on the ice that guert came to seek me one fine spring morning with something very like despair depicted in his fine manly face during the whole of that month it ought to be premised i had not dared to speak of love to anneke my attentions and visits were incessant and pointed but my tongue had been silent the diffidence of real admiration had held me tonguetied and i foolishly fancied there would be something like presuming on the services i had so lately rendered in urging my suit so soon after the occurrence of the events i have described i had even the romance to think it might be taking an undue advantage of bulstrode to wish to press my claims at a moment when the common object of our suit might be supposed to feel the influence of a lively gratitude these were the notions and sentiments of a very young man it must be confessed but i do not know that i ought to feel ashamed of them at all events they existed and they had produced the effect i have mentioned leaving me to fall each day more desperately in love while i made no sensible advances in preferring my suit guert was very much in the same situation with this difference however he made it a point to offer himself distinctly each monday morning invariably receiving for an answer no if the lady were to be pressed for a definite reply but leaving some glimmering of hope should time be given for her to make up her mind the visit of guerts to which i have just alluded was after one of the customary offers and usual replies the offer direct and the no tempered by the doubting and thoughtful brow the affectionate smile and the tearful eye  corny said my friend throwing down his hat with a most rueful aspect for winter having departed and spring come we had all laid aside our furcapscorny i have just been refused again that word no has got to be so common with mary wallace that i am afraid her tongue will never know how to utter a yes do you know corny i have a great mind to consult mother doortje  mother whoyou do not mean mr mayors cook surely  no mother doortje she is said to be the best fortune teller that has ever lived in albany but perhaps you do not believe in fortunetellers some people i know do not  i cannot say that i have much belief or unbelief on the subject never having seen anything of that sort  have they then no fortuneteller no person who has the dark art in new york  i have heard of such people but have never had an opportunity of seeing or hearing for myself if you do go to see this mother dorrichy or whatever you call her i should like amazingly to be of the party 28  guert was delighted to hear this and he caught eagerly at the offer if i would stand his friend he would go at once but he confessed he did not like to trust himself all alone in the old womans company  i am perhaps the only man of my time of life in albany who has not sooner or later consulted mother doortje he added i do not know how it is but somehow i have never liked to tempt fortune by going to question her one never can tell what such a being may say and should it be evil why it might make a man very miserable i am sure i want no more trouble as it is than to find mary wallace so undetermined about having me  then you do not mean to go after all i am not only ready but anxious to accompany you  you mistake me corny go i will now though she tell me that which will cause me to cut my throatbut we must not go as we are we must disguise ourselves in order that she may not know us everybody goes disguised and then they have an opportunity of learning if she is in a good vein or not by seeing if she can tell anything about their business or habits in the first place if she fail in that i should not care a straw for any of the rest so go to work corny and dress yourself for the occasionborrow some clothes of the people in the house here and come round to me as soon as you please i shall be ready for i often go disguised to frolicsyes unlucky devil that i am and come back disguised too  everything was done as desired by means of a servant in the tavern i was soon equipped in a way that satisfied me was very successful inasmuch as i passed dirck in quitting the house and my old confidential friend did not recognise me guert was in as good luck as i actually asked himself for himself when he opened the door for my admission the laugh and the handsome face however soon let me into the secret and we sallied forth in high spirits almost forgetting our misgivings concerning the future in the fun of passing our acquaintances in the street without being known  guert was much more artistically and knowingly disguised than i was myself we both had put on the clothes of labourers guert wearing a smockfrock that he happened to own for his fishing occupations in summerbut i had my usual linen in view and wore all the ordinary minor articles of my daily attire my friend pointed out some of these defects as we went along and an attempt was made to remedy them mr worden coming in view i determined to stop him and speak to him in a disguised voice in order to ascertain if it were possible to deceive him  your sarvant tominie i said making an awkward bow as soon as we got near enough to the parson to address him be you ter tominie that marries folk on a pinch  ay or on a handful liking the last bestwhy corny thou rogue what does all this mean  it was necessary to let mr worden into the secret and he no sooner learned the business we were on than he expressed a wish to be of the party as there was no declining we now went to the inn and gave him time to assume a suitable disguise as the divine was a rigid observer of the costume of his profession and was most strictly a man of his cloth it was a very easy matter for him to make such a change in his exterior as completely to render him incognito when all was ready we went finally forth on our errand  i go with you corny on this foolish business said the rev mr worden as soon as we were fairly on our way to comply with a promise made your excellent mother not to let you stray into any questionable company without keeping a fatherly eye over you now i regard a fortunetellers as a doubtful sort of society therefore i feel it to be a duty to make one of this party  i do not know whether the rev mr worden succeeded in deceiving himself but i very well know he did not succeed in deceiving me the fact was he loved a frolic and nothing made him happier than to have an opportunity of joining in just such an adventure as that we were on judging from the position of her house and the appearance of things in and around it the business of mother doortje was not of the most lucrative sort dirt and poverty were two things not easily encountered in albany and i do not say that we found very positive evidence of either here but there was less neatness than was usual in that ultratidy community and as for any great display of abundance it was certainly not to be met with  we were admitted by a young woman who gave us to understand that mother doortje had a couple of customers already but she invited us to sit down in an outer room promising that our turn should be the next we did so accordingly listening through a door that was a little ajar with no small degree of curiosity to what was passing within i accidentally took a seat in a place that enabled me to see the legs of one of the fortunetellers customers and i thought immediately that the striped stockings were familiar to me when the nasal and very peculiar intonation of jason put the matter out of all doubt he spoke in an earnest manner which rendered him a little incautious while the womans tones were low and mumbled notwithstanding we all overheard the following discourse  well now mother dorrichay said jason in a very confiding sort of way ive paid you well for this here business and i want to know if there is any chance for a poor man in this colony who doesnt want for friends or for that matter merit  thats yourself mumbled the female voicein the way one announces a discoveryyes i see by the cards that your question applies to yourself you are a young man that wants not for friends and you have merit you have friends that you deserve the cards tells me that  well ill not deny the truth of what you assert and i must say dirck it is a little strange this woman who never saw me before should know me so wellmy very natur as it might be but do you think i shall do well to follow up the affair i am now on or that i had best give it up  give up nothing answered the oracle in a very oracular manner shuffling the cards as she spoke no give up nothing but keep all you can that is the way to thrive in this world  by the hokey dirck she gives good advice and i think i shall follow it but how about the land and the millseator rather how about the particular things im thinking about  you are thinking of purchasingyes the cards say purchasing or is it disposing  why as ive got none to sell it cant very well be disposing mother  yes im rightthis jack of clubs settles the matteryou are thinking of buying some landah theres water running downhill and here i see a pondwhy you are thinking of buying a millseat  by the hokeywho would have thought this dirck  not a mill no there is no mill built but a millseat six king three and an ace yes i see how it isand you wish to get this millseat at much less than its real value much less not less but much less  well this is wonderful ill never gainsay fortintellin agin exclaimed jason dirck you are to say nothin of this or think nothin of thisas its all in confidence you know now jist put in a last word about the end of life mother and ill be satisfied what you have told me about my fortin and earnins must be true i think for my whole heart is in them but i should like to know after enjoying so much wealth and happiness as youve foretold what sort of an end i am to make of it  an excellent endfull of grace and hope and christian faith i see here something that looks like a clergymans gownwhite sleevesbook under the arm  that cant be me mother as im no lover of forms but belong to the platform  oh i see how it is now you dislike church of england people and could throw dirt at them yes yeshere you area presbyterian deacon and one that can lead in a private meeting on an occasion  come dirck im satisfiedlet us go we have kept mother doorichaise long enough and i heard some visiters come in just now thank you motherthank you with all my heart i think there must be some truth in this fortintellin after all  jason now arose and walked out of the house without even deigning to look at usand consequently without our being recognised but dirck lingered a minute not yet satisfied with what had been already told him  do you really think i shall never be married mother he asked in a tone that sufficiently betrayed the importance he attached to the answer i wish to know that particularly before i go away  young man answered the fortuneteller in an oracular manner what has been said has been said i cannot make fortunes but only reveal them you have heard that dutch blood is in your veins but you live in an english colony your king is her king while she is your queenand you are not her master if you can find a woman of english blood that has a dutch heart and has no english suitors go forward and you will succeed but if you do not remain as you are until time shall end these are my words and these are my thoughts i can say no more  i heard dirck sighpoor fellow he was thinking of annekeand he passed through the outer room without once raising his eyes from the floor he left mother doortje as much depressed in spirits as jason had left her elated the one looking forward to the future with a selfish and niggardly hope while the other regarded it with a feeling as forlorn as the destruction of all his youthful fancies could render any view of his afterlife the reader may feel disposed to smile at the idea of dirck van valkenburghs possessing youthful fanciesregarding the young man in the quiet unassuming manner in which he has hitherto been portrayed by me but it would be doing great injustice to his heart and feelings to figure him to the mind as a being without deep sensibilities i have always supposed that this interview with mother doortje had a lasting influence on the fortunes of poor dirck nor am i at all certain its effects did not long linger in the temperament of some others that might be named  as our turns had now come we were summoned to the presence of this female soothsayer it is unnecessary to describe the apartment in which we found mother doortje it had nothing unusual in it with the exception of a raven that was hopping about the floor and which appeared to be on the most familiar terms with its mistress doortje herself was a woman of quite sixty wrinkled lean and haglike and i thought some care had been taken in her dress to increase the effect of this certainly her natural appearance her cap was entirely of black muslin though her dress itself was grey the eye of this woman was of the colour of her gown and it was penetrating restless and deepseated altogether she looked the character well  on our entrance after saluting the fortuneteller each of us laid a french crown on the table at which she was seated this coin had become quite current among us since the french troops had penetrated into our colony and it was even said they purchased supplies with it from certain of our own people as we had paid the highest price ever given for these glimpses into futurity we thought ourselves entitled to have the pages of the sealed book freely opened to us  do you wish to see me together or shall i communicate with one at a time demanded doortje in her husky sepulchral voice which it struck me obtained its peculiar tones partly from nature and partly from art  it was settled that she should commence with mr worden but that all might remain in the room the whole time while we were talking over this point doortjes eyes were by no means fixed but i remarked that they wandered from person to person like those of one who was gathering information many persons do not believe at all in the art of the fortuneteller but insist that there is nothing more in it than trick and management pretending that this very woman kept the blacks of the town in pay to bring her information and that she never told anything of the past which was true that had not been previously communicated to herself i shall not pretend to affirm that the art goes as far as many imagine but it strikes me that it is very presuming to deny that there is some truth in these matters i do not wish to appear credulous though at the same time i hold it to be wrong to deny our testimony to facts that we are convinced are true 29  doortje commenced by shuffling an exceedingly dirty pack of cards which had probably been used five hundred times on similar duty she next caused mr worden to cut these cards when a close and musing examination succeeded all this time not a syllable was said though we were startled by a low whistle from the woman which brought the raven upon her shoulder  well mother cried mr worden with a little impatience at what he fancied mummery i am dying to hear what has happened that i may put the more faith in what is to happen tell me something of the crop of wheat i put into the ground last autumn how many bushels i sowed and on how many acres whether on new land or on old  ay ay you have sowedand you have sowed answered the woman on a high key for her but your seed fell among tares and on the flinty ground and youll never reap a soul among em all broadcast may you sowbut narrow will be your harvest  the rev mr worden gave a loud hemplaced his arms akimboand seemed determined to brazen it out though i could easily perceive that he felt excessively awkward  how is it with my cattle and shall i send much mutton to market this season  a wolf in sheeps clothing muttered doortje nonoyou like hot suppers and ducks and lectures to cooks more than gathering in the harvest of the lord  come this is folly woman exclaimed the parson angrily give me some common sense for my good french crown what do you see in that knave of diamonds that you study its face so closely  a loping dominiea loping dominie screamed the hag several times rather than exclaiming aloud seehe runs for life but beelzebub will overtake him  there was a sudden and dead pause for the rev mr worden had caught up his hat and darted from the room quitting the house as if already busily engaged in the race alluded to guert shook his head and looked serious but perceiving that the woman was already tranquil and was actually shuffling the cards anew in his behalf he advanced to learn his fate i saw the eyes of doortje fastened keenly on him as he took his stand near the table and the corners of her mouth curled in a significant smile what that meant exactly i have never been able to ascertain  i suppose you wish to know something of the past like all the rest of them mumbled the woman so that you may have faith in what you hear about the future  why mother answered guert passing his hand through his own fine head of natural curls and speaking a little hastily i do not know that it is any great matter about the past what is done is done and there is an end of it a young man may not wish to hear of such things at the moment perhaps when he is earnestly bent on doing better we are all young once in our lives and we can grow old only after having been so  yesyesi see how it is muttered doortje sosoturkeysturkeys ducksducksquaackquaackquaackgobble gobble gobble here the old hag set up such an imitation of ducks geese turkeys gamecocks and other birds that one who was in an outer room might well have imagined he heard the cries of a regular poultryyard i was startled myself for the imitation was very admirablebut guert was obliged to wipe the perspiration from his face  that will dothat will do mother the young man exclaimed i see you know all about it and there is no use in attempting disguises with you now tell me if i am ever to be a married man or not my errand here is to learn that fact and i may as well own it at once  the world has many women in itand fair faces are plenty in albany once more mumbled the woman examining her cards with great attention a youth like you might marry twice even  no that is impossible if i do not marry a particular lady i shall never marry at all  yesyesi see how it isyou are in love young man  dye hear that corny isnt it wonderful how these creatures can tell i admit the truth of what you say but describe to me the lady that i love  guert had forgotten altogether that the use of the word lady completely betrayed the fact of his disguise since no man truly of his dress and air would think of applying such a word to his sweetheart 30 i could not prevent these little betrayals of himself however for by this time my companion was too much excited to hear reason  the lady that you love answered the fortuneteller deliberately and with the manner of one that proceeded with great confidence is very handsome in the first place  true as the sun in the heavens mother  then she is virtuous and amiable and wise and witty and good  the gospel is not more certain corny this surpasses belief  then she is young yes she is young and fair and good three things that make her much sought after  why is she so long reflecting on my offers mother tell me that i beg of you or will she ever consent to have me  i seei seeit is all here on the cards the lady cannot make up her mind  listen to that now corny and do not tell me there is nothing in this art why does she not make up her mind for heavens sake let me know that a man may tire of offering to marry an angel and getting no answer i wish to know the reason of her doubts  a womans mind is not easily read some are in haste while some are not i am of opinion you wish to get an answer before the lady is ready to give it men must learn to wait  she really seems to know all about it corny much as i have heard of this woman she exceeds it all good mother can you tell me how i can gain the consent of the woman i love  that is only to be had by asking ask once ask twice ask thrice  by st nicholas i have asked already twenty times if asking would do it she would have been my wife a month since what do you think cornyno ill not do itit is not manly to get the secrets of a womans heart by means like theseill not ask her  the crown is paid and the truth must be said the lady you love loves you and she does not love you she will have you and she wont have you she thinks yes and she says no  guert now trembled all over like an aspenleaf  i do not believe there is any harm corny in asking whether i gained or lost by the affair of the river i will ask her that much of a certainty tell me mother am i better or worse for a certain thing that happened about a month agoabout the time that the ice went and that we had a great freshet  guert ten eyck why do you try me thus demanded the fortuneteller solemnly i knew your father and i knew your mother i knew your ancestors in holland and their children in america generations on generations have i known your people and you are the first that i have seen so illclad do you suppose boy that old doortjes eyes are getting dim and that she cannot tell her own nation i saw you on the riverha ha

and if you hear muskets fired go near them fear will sometimes make a young woman speak you have your answer and i will tell no more come hither young owner of many halfjoes and touch that card  i did as ordered when the woman began to mumble to herself and to run over the pack as rapidly as she could kings aces and knaves were examined one after another until she had got the queen of hearts in her hand which she held up to me in triumph  that is your lady she is a queen of too many hearts the hudson did that for you that it has done for many a poor man before you yes yes the river did you good but water will drown as well as make tears do you beware of knights barrownights 31  here mother doortje came to a dead stand in her communications and not another syllable of any sort could either of us get from her though between us as many as twenty questions were asked signs were made for us to depart and when the woman found our reluctance she laid a crown for each of us on the table with a dignified air and went into a corner seated herself and began to rock her body like one impatient of our presence after so unequivocal a sign that she considered her work as done we could not well do less than return leaving the money behind us as a matter of course  footnote 27 in plain english the great gotobed and the little gotobed there may be a portion of our readers who are not aware that the word levee meaning a morning reception by a great man is derived from the french lever which means to rise or to get up the kings of france were in the habit of receiving homage at their morning toilets a strange custom that doubtless had its origin in the empressement of the courtier to inquire how his master had slept which receptions were divided into two classes the grand lever and the petit leverthe great gettingup or the little gettingup the first was an occasion of more state than the last even down to the time of charles x the court papers seldom went a week without announcing that the king had signed the contract of marriagea customary compliment in france among friends of this of that personageat the grand lever or at the petit lever the first i believe but am not certain being the greater honour of the twoeditor  footnote 28 doortjepronounced doortyaymeans dorothea mr littlepage uses a sort of corruption of the pronunciation i well remember a fortuneteller of that name in albany though it could not have been the doortje of 1758editor  footnote 29 it is quite evident that mr cornelius littlepage was to agree at least a believer in the fortunetellers art this was however no more than was common a century since quite within my recollection the albanians had a celebrated dealer in the black art who was regularly consulted on the subject of all lost spoons and the pilfering of servants by the good housewives of the town as recently as my schoolboy days the dutch like the germans appear to have been prone to this species of superstition from which even the english of education were far from being free a century since mademoiselle normand existed in the present century even in the sceptical capital of france but the somnambulist is taking the place of the ancient soothsayer in our own timeseditor  footnote 30 this might have been true in 1758 but is not true for 1845editor  footnote 31 in the colony of new york there lived but one titled man for a considerable period it was the celebrated sir william johnson bart of johnson hall johnstown albany now fulton county the son of sir william johnson was knighted during his fathers lifetime and was sir john while sir william was living at the death of his father he was sir john johnson kt  bart and it was usual for the common class of people to style him a knight of barrownighteditor     chapter xix    virtue how frail it is   friendship too rare   love how it sells poor bliss   for proud despair   but we though soon they fall   survive their joy and all   which ours we call    shelley   guert ten eyck was profoundly impressed with what he had heard in his visit to the fortuneteller it affected his spirits and as will be seen it influenced all his subsequent conduct as for myself i will not say that i totally disregarded what had passed though the effect was greatly less on me than it was on my friend the rev mr worden however treated the matter with great disdain he declared that he had never before been so insulted in his life the old hag no doubt had seen us all before and recognised him profiting by a knowledge of this sortthat was very easily obtained in a place of the size of albanyshe had taken the occasion to make the most of the low gossip that had been circulated at his expense loping dominie indeed he added as if any man would not run to save his life you saw how it was with the river corny when it once began to break up and know that my escape was marvellous i deserve as much credit for that retreat boy as xenophon did for his retreat with the ten thousand it is true i had not thirtyfour thousand six hundred and fifty stadia to retreat over but acts are to be estimated more by quality than by quantity the best things are always of an impromptu character and generally they are on a small scale then as for all you tell me about guert why the hussy knew himmust have known him in a town like albany where the fellow has a character that identifies him with all sorts of fun and roguery jack and moses too do you think the inspiration of even an evil spirit or of forty thousand devils would lead a fortuneteller to name any horse moses jack might do perhaps but moses would never enter the head of even an imp remember lad moses was the great lawgiver of the jews and such a creature would be as apt to suppose a horse was named confucius as to suppose he was named moses  i suppose the inspiration as you call it sir would lead a clever fortuneteller to give things as they are and to call the horses by their real names let them be what they might  ay such inspiration as this miserable old wrinkled impudent shedevil enjoys dont tell me corny there is no such thing as fortunetelling at least nothing that can be depended on in all casesand this is one of downright imposition loping dominie forsooth  such were the rev mr wordens sentiments on the subject of mother doortjes revelations he exacted a pledge from us all to say nothing about the matter nor were we much disposed to be communicative on the subject as for guert dirck jason and myself we did not hesitate to converse on the circumstances of our visits among ourselves however and each and all of us viewed the matter some what differently from our mentor i ascertained that jason had been highly gratified with what had been predicted on his own behalf for what was wealth in his eyes had been foretold as his future lot and a man rarely quarrels with good fortune whether in prospective or in possession dirck though barely twenty began to talk of living a single life from this time and no laughter of mine could induce the poor lad to change his views or to entertain livelier hopes guert was deeply impressed as has been said and feeling no restraint in the matter of his own case he took occasion to speak of his visit to the woman one morning that herman mordaunt the two ladies bulstrode and myself were sitting together chatting in the freedom of what had now become a very constant intercourse  are such things as fortunetellers known in england mr bulstrode guert abruptly commenced fastening his eyes on mary wallace as he asked the question for on her were his thoughts running at the time  all sorts of silly things are to be found in old england mr ten eyck as well as some that are wise i believe london has one or two soothsayers and i think i have heard elderly people say that the fashion of consulting them has somewhat increased since the court has been so german  yes guert innocently replied i find it easy to believe that for it is a common saying among our people that the german and low dutch fortunetellers are the best known they have had or pretend to have had witches in new england but no one hereabouts puts any faith in the pretence it is like all the bragging of these boastful yankees  i observed that mary wallaces colour deepened and that in biting off a thread she profited by the occasion to avert her face in such a manner that bulstrode in particular could not see it  the meaning of all this put in major bulstrode is that our friend guert has been to pay a visit to mother doortjes a woman of some note who lives on the hill and who has a reputation in that way among these good albanians several of our mess have been to see the old woman  it is mr bulstrode guert answered in his manly way and with a gravity which proved how much he was in earnest i have been to see mother doortje for the first time in my life and corny littlepage here was my companion long as i have known the woman by reputation i have never had any curiosity to pay her a visit until this spring we have been however and i must say i have been greatly surprised at the extent of the knowledge of this very extraordinary person  did she tell you to look into the sweetmeatpot for the lost spoon mr ten eyck anneke inquired with an archness of eye and voice that sent the blood to my own face in confusion they say that fortunetellers send all prudent yet careless housewives to the sweetmeatpots to look for the lost spoons many have been found i hear by this wonderful prescience  well miss anneke i see you have no faith answered guert fidgeting and people who have no faith never believe notwithstanding i put so much confidence in what doortje has told me that i intend to follow her advice let matters turn out as they may  here mary wallace raised her thoughtful full blue eyes to the face of the young man and they expressed an intense interest rather than any light curiosity that even her womans instinct and womans sensitiveness could not so far prevail as to enable her to conceal still mary wallace did not speak leaving the others present to maintain the discourse  of course you mean to tell us all about it ten eyck cried the major there is nothing more likely to succeed with an audience than a good history of witchcraft or something so very marvellous as to do violence to common sense before we give it our faith  excuse me mr bulstrode these are things i cannot well mention though corny littlepage will testify that they are very wonderful at any rate i shall go into the bush this spring and littlepage and follock being excellent companions i propose to join their company it will be late before the army will be ready to move and by that time all three of us propose to join you before ticonderoga if indeed you succeed in getting so far  say rather in front of montreal for i trust this new commanderinchief will find something more for us to do than the last one did shall i have a sentinel placed at doortjes door in your absence guert  the smile this question produced was general guert himself joining in it for his goodnature was of proof when i say the smile was general however i ought to except mary wallace who smiled little that morning  we shall be neighbours then herman mordaunt quietly observed that is to say if you mean by accompanying corny and dirck to the bush you intend to go with them to the patent lately obtained by messrs littlepage and van valkenburgh i have an estate in that quarter which is now ten years old and these ladies have consented to accompany me thither as soon as the weather is a little more settled and i can be assured that our army will be of sufficient force to protect us from the french and indians  it is unnecessary for me to say with what delight guert and i heard this announcement on bulstrode however it produced an exactly contrary effect he did not appear to me to be surprised at a declaration that was so new to us but several expressions fell from him that showed he had no idea the two estates that of herman mordaunts and that which belonged to us lay so near together it was by means of his questions indeed that i learned the real facts of the case it appeared that herman mordaunts business in albany was to make some provisions in behalf of this property on which he had caused mills to be erected and some of the other improvements of a new settlement to be made two or three years before and which by the progress and events of the war was getting to be in closer proximity to the enemy than was desirable even where the french lay at ticonderoga his mills in particular might be thought in some danger though forty or more miles distant for parties of savages led on by white men frequently marched that distance through the forests in order to break up a settlement and to commit depredations but the enemy had crossed lake george the previous summer and had actually taken fort william henry at its southern extremity by siege it is true this was the extent of their inroad and it was now known that they had abandoned this bold conquest and had fallen back upon ty and crown point two of the strongest military positions in the british colonies still ravensnest as herman mordaunts property was called was far from being beyond the limits of sorties and the residence at albany was solely to watch the progress of events in that quarter and to be near the scene if he had any public employment it remained a profound mystery a new source of embarrassment had arisen however and this it was that decided the proprietor to visit his lands in person the fifteen or twenty families he had succeeded in establishing on the estate at much cost and trouble had taken the alarm at the prospect of a campaign in their vicinity and had announced an intention of abandoning their huts and clearings as the course most expedient for the times two or three had already gone off towards the hampshire grants whence they had originally come profiting by the last of the snow and it was feared that others might imitate their caution  herman mordaunt saw no necessity for this abandonment of advantages over the wilderness that had been obtained at so much cost and trouble the labour of a removal and a return was sufficient of itself to give a new direction to the movements of his settlers and as their first entrance into the country had been effected through his agency and aided by his means he naturally wished to keep the people he had got to his estate with so much difficulty and at so much cost at their several positions as long at least as he conceived it to be prudent in these circumstances therefore he had determined to visit ravensnest in person and to pass a part if not most of the summer among his people this would give them confidence and would enable him to infuse new life into their operations it would seem that anneke and mary wallace had refused to let mr mordaunt go alone and believing himself there was no danger in the course he was about to take the father and guardian for mary wallace was herman mordaunts ward had yielded to the importunities of the two girls and it had been formally decided that they were all to proceed together as soon as the season should get to be a little more advanced intelligence of this intention had been sent to the settlers and its effect was to induce them to remain at their posts by pacifying their fears  i might as well add here what i learned subsequently in the due course of events bulstrode had been made acquainted with herman mordaunts plans they being sworn friends and the latter warmly in the interest of the formers suit and he had known how to profit by the information it was now time to put the troops in motion and several parties had already marched towards the north taking post at different points that it was thought desirable to occupy previously to the commencement of the campaign among other corps under orders of this nature was that commanded by bulstrode and he had sufficient interest at headquarters to get it sent to the point nearest to ravensnest where it gave him the double advantage of having it in his power to visit the ladies on occasion while at the same time he must appear to them somewhat in the character of a protector the object of dirck and myself in visiting the north was no secret and it was generally understood that we were to go to mooseridge but we did not know ourselves that herman mordaunt had an estate so near us this intelligence as has been said i now ascertained was as new to bulstrode as it was to myself  the knowledge of many little things i have just mentioned was obtained by me only at intervals and by means of observation and discourse nevertheless the main points were determined on the morning on which guert referred to his visit to the fortuneteller and in the manner named the conversation lasted an hour nor did it cease until all present got a general idea of the course intended to be pursued by the different parties present during the succeeding summer  it happened that morning that bulstrode dirck and guert withdrew together the two last to look at a horse the former had just purchased leaving me alone with the young ladies no sooner was the door closed on the retiring members of our party than i saw a smile struggling about the handsome mouth of anneke mary wallace continuing the whole time thoughtful if not sad  and you were of the party at the fortunetellers too it seems mr littlepage anneke remarked after appearing to be debating with herself on the propriety of proceeding any farther in the subject i knew there was such a person in albany and that thrifty housekeepers did sometimes consult her but i was ignorant that men and educated men paid her that honour  i believe there is no exception in the way of sex or learning to her influence or her authority they tell me that most of the younger officers of the army visit her while they remain here  i would much like to know if mr bulstrode has been of the number he is young enough in years though so high in rank a major may have as much curiosity as an ensign or as it may appear dear mary of a woman who has lost her grandmothers favourite dessertspoon  mary wallace gave a gentle sigh and she even raised her eyes from her work still she made no answer  you are severe on us anneke for since the affair on the river the whole family treated me with the familiarity of a son or a brotheri fancy we have done no more than mr mordaunt has done in his day  this may be very true corny and not make the consultation the wisest thing in nature i hope however you do not keep your fortune a secret but let your friends share in your knowledge  to me the woman was far from being communicative though she treated guert ten eyck better certainly she told him many extraordinary things of the past even unless indeed she knew who he was  is it probable mr littlepage said mary wallace that any person in albany should not know guert ten eyck and a good deal of his past history poor guert makes himself known wherever he is  and often much to his advantage i addeda remark that cost me nothing but which caused mary wallaces face to brighten and even brought a faint smile to her lips all that is true yet there was something wild and unnatural in the womans manner as she told these things  all of which you seem determined to keep to yourself observed anneke as one asks a question  it would hardly do to betray a friends secrets let guert answer for himself he is as frank as broad day and will not hesitate about letting you know all  i wish corny littlepage were only as frank as twilight  i have nothing to concealand least of all from you anneke the fortuneteller told me that the queen of my heart was the queen of too many hearts that the river had done me no harm and that i must particularly beware of what she called knightsbarrownights  i watched anneke closely as i repeated this warning of mother doortje but could not read the expression of her sweet and thoughtful countenance she neither smiled nor frowned but she certainly blushed of course she did not look at mefor that would have been to challenge observation mary wallace however did smile and she did look at me  you believe all the wizzard told you corny said anneke after a short pause  i believed that the queen of my heart was the queen of many hearts that the river had done me no harmthough i could not say or see that it had done me much good and that i had much to fear from knightsbarrownights i believed all this however before i ever saw the fortuneteller  the next remark that was made came from anneke and it referred to the weather the season was opening finely and fast and it could not be long before the great movements of the year must commence several regiments had arrived in the colonies and various officers of note and rank had accompanied them among others who had thus crossed the atlantic for the first time was my lord howe a young soldier of whom fame spoke favourably and from whom much was expected in the course of the anticipated service of the year while we were talking over these things herman mordaunt reentered the room after a short absence and he took me with him to examine his preparations for transporting the ladies to ravensnest as we went along the discourse was maintained and i learned many things from my older and intelligent companion that were new to me  new lords new laws they say corny continued herman mordaunt and this mr pitt the great commoner as some persons call him is bent on making the british empire feel the truth of the axiom everything is alive in the colonies and the sluggish period of lord loudons command is passed gen abercrombie an officer from whom much is expected is now at the head of the kings troops and there is every prospect of an active and most important campaign the disgraces of the few last years must be wiped out and the english name be made once more to be dreaded on this continent the lord howe of whom anneke spoke is said to be a young man of merit and to possess the blood of our hanoverian monarchs his mother being a halfsister in the natural way of his present majesty  herman mordaunt then spoke more fully of his own plans for the summerexpressed his happiness at knowing that dirck and myself were to be what he called his neighboursthough on a more exact computation it was ascertained that the nearest boundaries of the two patents that of ravensnest and that of mooseridge lay quite fourteen miles apart with a dense and virgin forest between them nevertheless this would be making us neighbours in a certain sense as gentlemen always call men of their own class neighbours when they live within visiting distance or near enough to be seen once or twice in a year and such men are neighbours in the sense that is most essential to the termthey know each other better understand each other better sympathize more freely have more of the intercourse that makes us judges of motives principles and character twentyfold than he who lives at the gate and merely sees the owner of the grounds pass in and out on his daily avocations there is and can be no greater absurdity than to imagine that the sheer neighbourhood or proximity of position makes men acquainted that was one of jason newcomes connecticut notions having been educated in a state of society in which all associated on a certain footing of intimacy and in which half the difficulties that occurred were told to the church he was for ever fancying he knew all the gentry of westchester because he had lived a year or two in the county when in fact he had never spoken to one in a dozen of them i never could drive this notion out of his head however for looking often at a man or occasionally exchanging a bow with him on the highway he would insist was knowing him or what he called being well acquainted a very favourite expression of the danbury mans though their sympathies habits opinions and feelings created so vast a void between the parties they hardly understood each others terms and ordinary language when they did begin to converse as sometimes happened notwithstanding all this jason insisted to the last that he knew every gentleman in the county whom he had been accustomed to hear alluded to in discourse and when he had seen them once or twice though it were only at church but jason had a very flattering notion generally of his own acquisitions on all subjects  herman mordaunt had made careful provision for the contemplated journey having caused a covered vehicle to be constructed that could transport not only himself and the ladies but many articles of furniture that would be required during their residence in the forest another conveyance strong spacious and covered was also prepared for the blacks and another portion of the effects he pointed out all these arrangements to me with great satisfaction dwelling on the affection and spirit of the girls with a pleasure he did not affect to conceal for my own part i have always been of opinion that anneke was solely influenced by pure natural regard in forming her indiscreet resolution while her father was governed by the secret expectation that the movement would leave open the means of receiving visits and communications from bulstrode during most of the summer i commended the arrangements made one or two suggestions of my own in behalf of anneke and mary and we returned to our several homes  a day or two after this visit to the workshops and the conversation related the th took up its line of march for the north the troops defiled through the narrow streets in the neighbourhood of the barracks half an hour after the appearance of the sun preceded and followed by a long train of baggagewagons they marched without tents however it being well understood that they were going into a region where the axe could at any time cover thousands of men in about the time that a camp could be laid out and the canvass spread hutting was the usual mode of placing an army under cover in the forest and a dozen marches would take the battalion to the point where it was intended it should remain as a support to two or three other corps still further in advance and to keep open the communications  bulstrode however did not quit albany in company with his regiment i had been invited with guert and dirck to breakfast at herman mordaunts that morning and as we approached the door i saw the majors groom walking his own and his masters horse in the street near by this was a sign we were to have the pleasure of bulstrodes company at breakfast accordingly on entering the room we found him present in the uniform of an officer of his rank about to commence a march in the forests of america i thought him melancholy as if sad at parting but my most jealous observation could detect no sign of similar feeling on the part of anneke she was not quite as gay as usual but she was far from being sad  i leave you ladies with the deepest regret said bulstrode while at table for you have made this country more than a home to meyou have rendered it dear  this was said with feeling more than i had ever seen bulstrode manifest before and more than i had given him credit for possessing anneke coloured a little but there was no tremor in the beautiful hand that held a highlywrought little teapot suspended over a cup at that very moment  we shall soon meet again harry herman mordaunt remarked in a tone of strong affection for our party will not be a week behind you remember we are to be good neighbours as well as neighbours and if the mountain will not come to mahomet mahomet must go to the mountain  which means mr bulstrode said mary wallace with one of her sweet smiles and one that was as open and natural as childhood itself that you are mahomet and we are the mountain ladies can neither travel with comfort in a wilderness nor visit a camp with propriety if they would  they tell me i shall not be in a camp at all answered the soldier but in good comfortable logbarracks that have been built for us by the battalion we relieve i am not without hopes they will be such as even ladies will not disdain to use on an emergency there ought to be no mahomet and no mountain between such old and intimate friends  the conversation then turned on the plans and expectations of the respective parties and the usual promises were made of being sociable and good neighbours as had just been suggested herman mordaunt evidently wished to consider bulstrode as one of his family a feeling that might excuse itself to the world on the score of consanguinity but which it was easy enough for me to see had its origin in a very different cause when bulstrode rose to take his leave i wished myself away on account of the exhibition of concern it produced while the desire to watch the effect on anneke would have kept me rooted to the floor even had it been proper that i should retire  bulstrode was more affected than i could have thought possible he took one of herman mordaunts hands into his own and pressed it warmly for some little time before he could speak at all  god only knows what this summer is to see and whether we are ever to meet again or not he then said but come what may the past the happy past is so much gained from the commonplace if you never hear of me again my dear kinsman my letters to england will give you a better account of my gratitude than anything i can say in words they have been written as your kindnesses have been bestowed and they faithfully pourtray the feelings to which your hospitality and friendship have given rise in a possible event i have requested that every one of them may be sent to america for your special perusal  nay my dear harry this is foreboding the very worst interrupted herman mordaunt dashing a tear from his eye and is making a very short separation a more serious matter than one ought  nay sir a soldier who is about to be posted within striking distance of his enemy can never speak with confidence of separations that are to be short this campaign will be decisive for meglancing towards annekei must return a conqueror in one sense or i do not wish to return at all but god bless you herman mordaunt as your own countrymen call you a thousand years could not efface from my heart the remembrance of all your kindness  this was handsomely expressed and the manner in which it was uttered was as good as the language bulstrode hesitated a momentlooked at the two girls in doubtand first approached mary wallace  adieu excellent mary wallace he said taking her offered hand and kissing it with a freedom from emotion that denoted it was only friendship and respect which induced the acti believe you are a severe critic on catos and scrubs but i forgive all your particular backbitings on account of your general indulgence and probity you may meet with a thousand mere acquaintances before you find another who shall have the same profound respect for your many virtues as myself  this was handsomely said too and it caused mary wallace to remove the handkerchief from her eyes and to utter her adieus cordially and with some emotion strangers say that our women want feelingpassion or if they have it that it is veiled behind a mask of coldness that takes away from its loveliness and warmth that they are girlish and familiar where they might better be reserved and distant and unnatural where feeling and nature ought to assert their sway that they have less manner in all respects in that of selfcontrol and perhaps of selfrespect in their ordinary intercourse and in that of acting where it may seem necessary so to do i believe to be true buts he who denies an american girl a heart knows nothing about her she is all heart and the apparent coldness is oftener the consequence of not daring to trust her feelings and her general dislike to everything artificial than to any want of affections two girls educated however as had been anneke and mary wallace could not but acquit themselves better in such a scene than those who had been less accustomed to the usages of polite life which are always more or less the usages of convention  on the present occasion mary wallace was strongly affected it would not have been possible for one of her gentle nature and warm affections to be otherwise when an agreeable companion one she had now known intimately near two years was about to take his leave of her on an errand that he himself either thought or affected so well to seem to think might lead to the most melancholy issue she shook hands with bulstrode warmly wished him good fortune and various other pleasant things thanked him for his good opinion and expressed her hope as well as her belief that they should all meet again before the summer was over and again be happy in each others society  annekes turn came next her handkerchief was at her eyes and when it was removed the face was pale and the cheeks were covered with tears the smile that followed was sweetness itself and i will own it caused me a most severe pang to my surprise bulstrode said nothing he took annekes hand pressed it to his heart kissed it left a note in it bowed and moved away i felt ashamed to watch the countenance of miss mordaunt under such circumstances and turned aside that observation might not increase the distress and embarrassment she evidently felt i saw enough notwithstanding to render me more uncertain than ever as to the success of my own suit annekes colour had come and gone as bulstrode stood near her acting his dumbshow of leavetaking and to me she seemed far more affected than mary wallace had been nevertheless her feelings were always keener and more active than those of her friend and that which my sensitiveness took for the emotion of tenderness might be nothing more than ordinary womanly feeling and friendship besides bulstrode was actually her relative  we men all attended bulstrode to his horse he shook us cordially by the hand and after he had got into the saddle he saidthis summer will be warmer than is usual even in your warmycold climate my letters from home give me reason to think that there is at last a man of talents at the head of affairs and the british empire is likely to feel the impulse he will give it at its most remote extremities i shall expect you three young men to join the th as volunteers as soon as you hear of our moving in advance i wish i had a thousand like you for that affair of the river tells where a man will be found when the time comes god bless you corny leaning forward in his saddle to give me another shake of the hand we must remain friends coute qui couté  there was no withstanding this frankness and so much goodtemper we shook hands most cordially bulstrode raised his hat and bowed after which he rode away as i fancied at a slow thoughtful reluctant pace notwithstanding the kindness of this parting i had more cause than ever to regret bulstrode had appeared among us and the scenes of that morning only confirmed me in a resolution previously adopted not to urge anneke to any decision in my case at a moment when i felt there might be so much danger it would he adverse     chapter xx    come let a proper text be read   an touch it aff wi vigour   how graceless ham leugh at his dad   which made canaan a nigger    burns   ten days after the departure of the th herman mordaunt and his family with our own party left albany on the summers business in that interval however great changes had taken place in the military aspect of things several regiments of kings troops ascended the hudson most of the sloops on the river of which there could not have been fewer than thirty or forty having been employed in transporting them and their stores two or three corps came across the country from the eastern colonies while several provincial regiments appeared everything tending to a concentration at this point the head of navigation on the hudson among other men of mark who accompanied the troops was lord viscount howe the nobleman of whom herman mordaunt had spoken he bore the local rank of brigadier 32 and seemed to be the very soul of the army it was not his personal consideration alone that placed him so high in the estimation of the public and of the troops but his professional reputation and professional services there were many young men of rank in the army present and as for younger sons of peers there were enough to make honourables almost as plenty at albany as they were at boston most of the colonial families of mark had sons in the service too those of the middle and southern colonies bearing commissions in regular regiments while the provincial troops from the eastern were led as was very usual in that quarter of the country by men of the class of yeomen in a great degree the habits of equality that prevailed in those provinces making few distinctions on the score of birth or fortune  yet it was said i remember that obedience was as marked among the provincials from massachusetts and connecticut as among those that came from farther south the men deferring to authority as the agent of the laws they were fine troops too better than our own colony regiments i must acknowledge seeming to belong to a higher class of labourers while it must be admitted that most of their officers were no very brilliant representatives of manners acquirements or habits that would be likely to qualify them for command it must have been that the officers and men suited each other for it was said all round that they stood well and fought very bravely whenever they were particularly well led as did not always happen to be the case as a body of mere physical men they were universally allowed to be the finest corps in the army regulars and all included  i saw lord howe two or three times particularly at the residence of madam schuyler the lady i have already had occasion to mention and to whom i had given the letter of introduction procured by my mother the mordaunts visiting her with great assiduity and frequently taking me with them as for lord howe himself he almost lived under the roof of excellent madam schuyler where indeed all the good company assembled at albany was at times to be seen  our party was a large one and it might have passed for a small corps of the army itself moving on in advance as was the case with corps or parts of corps now almost daily herman mordaunt had delayed our departure indeed expressly with a view to render the country safe by letting it fill with detachments from the army and our progress when we were once in motion was literally from post to post encampment to encampment it may be well to enumerate our force and to relate the order of our march that the reader may better comprehend the sort of business we were on  herman mordaunt took with him in addition to the ladies a black cook and a black servinggirl a negroman to lake care of his horses and another as his houseservant he had three white labourers in additionmen employed about the teams and as axemen to clear the woods bridge the streams and to do other work of that nature as it might be required on our side there were us three gentlemen yaap my own faithful negro mr traverse the surveyor two chainbearers and two axemen guert ten eyck carried with him also a negroman who was called pete it being contrary to bonos mores to style him peter or petrus the latter being his true appellation this made us ten men strong of whom eight were white and two black herman mordaunt mustered in all just the same number of which however four were females thus by uniting our forces we made a party of twenty souls altogether of this number all the males black and white were well armed each man owning a good rifle and each of the gentlemen a brace of pistols in addition we carried the latter belted to our bodies with the weapons which were small and fitted to the service turned behind in such a way as to be concealed by our outer garments the belts were also hid by the flaps of our nether garments by this arrangement we were well armed without seeming to be so a precaution that is sometimes useful in the woods  it is hardly necessary to say that we did not plunge into the forest in the attire in which we had been accustomed to appear in the streets of new york and albany cocked hats were laid aside altogether forest caps resembling in form those we had worn in the winter with the exception that the fur had been removed being substituted the ladies wore light beavers suited to their sex there being little occasion for any shade for the face under the dense canopies of the forest veils of green however were added as the customary american protection for the sex anneke and mary travelled in habits made of light womans cloth and in a manner to fit their exquisite forms like gloves the skirts were short to enable them to walk with ease in the event of being compelled to go afoot a feather or two in each hat had not been forgottenthe offering of the natural propensity of their sex to please the eyes of men  as for us men buckskin formed the principal material of our garments we all wore buckskin breeches and gaiters and moccasins the latter however had the whitemans soles though guert took a pair or two with him that were of the pure indian manufacture each of us had a coatee made of common cloth but we all carried huntingshirts to be worn as soon as we entered the woods these huntingshirts green in colour fringed and ornamented garments of the form of shirts to be worn over all were exceedingly smart in appearance and were admirably suited to the woods it was thought that the fringes form and colour blended them so completely with the foliage as to render them in a manner invisible to one at a distance or at least undistinguished they were much in favour with all the forest corps of america and formed the usual uniform of the riflemen of the woods whether acting against man or only against the wild beasts  neither mr worden nor jason moved with the main party and it was precisely on account of these distinctions of dress as for the divine he was so good a stickler for appearances he would have worn the gown and surplice even on a mission to the indians which bytheway was ostensibly his present business and at the several occasions on which i saw him at cockfights he kept on the clerical coat and shovelhat in a word mr worden never neglected externals so far as dress was concerned and i much question if he would have consented to read prayers without the surplice or to preach without the gown let the desire for spiritual provender be as great as it might i very well remember to have heard my father say that on one occasion the parson had refused to officiate of a sunday when travelling rather than bring discredit on the church by appearing in the discharge of his holy office without the appliances that belonged to the clerical character  more harm than good is done to religion mr littlepage said the rev mr worden on that occasion by thus lessening its rites in vulgar eyes the first thing is to teach men to respect holy things my dear sir and a clergyman in his gown and surplice commands threefold the respect of one without them i consider it therefore a sacred duty to uphold the dignity of my office on all occasions  it was in consequence of these opinions that the divine travelled in his clerical hat clerical coat black breeches and band even when in pursuit of the souls of red men among the wilds of north america i will not take it upon myself to say these observances had not their use but i am very certain they put the reverend gentleman to a great deal of inconvenience  as for jason he gave a danbury reason for travelling in his best everybody did so in his quarter of the country and for his part he thought it disrespectful to strangers to appear among them in old clothes there was however another and truer reason and that was economy for the troops had so far raised the price of everything that jason did not hesitate to pronounce albany the dearest place he had ever been in there was some truth in this allegation and the distance from new york being no less than one hundred and sixty milesso reportedthe reader will at once see it was the business of quite a month or even more to refurnish the shelves of the shop that had been emptied the dutch not only moved slow but they were methodical and the shopkeeper whose stores were exhausted in april would not be apt to think of replenishing them until the regular time and season returned  as a consequence of these views and motives the rev mr worden and mr jason newcome left albany twentyfour hours in advance of the rest of our party with the understanding they were to join us at a point where the road led into the woods and where it was thought the cocked hat and the skin cap might travel in company harmoniously there was however a reason for the separation i have not yet named in the fact that all of my own set travelled on foot three or four packhorses carrying our necessaries now mr worden had been offered a seat in a government conveyance and jason managed to worm himself into the party in some way that to me was ever inexplicable it is however due to mr newcome to confess that his faculty of obtaining favours of all sorts was of a most extraordinary character and he certainly never lost any chance of preferment for want of asking in this respect jason was always a moral enigma to me there being an absolute absence in his mind of everything like a perception of the fitness of things so far as the claims and rights of persons were connected with rank education birth and experience rank in the official sense once possessed he understood and respected but of the claims to entitle one to its enjoyment he seemed to have no sort of notion for property he had a profound deference so far as that deference extended to its importance and influence but it would have caused him not the slightest qualm either in the way of conscience or feeling to find himself suddenly installed in the mansion of the patroons for instance and placed in possession of their estates provided only he fancied he could maintain his position the circumstance that he was dwelling under the roof that was erected by another mans ancestors for instance and that others were living who had a better moral right to it would give him no sort of trouble so long as any quirk of the law would sustain him in possession in a word all that was allied to sentiment in matters of this nature was totally lost on jason newcome who lived and acted from the hour he first came among us as if the game of life were merely a game of puss in the corner in which he who inadvertently left his own post unprotected would be certain to find another filling his place as speedily as possible i have mentioned this propensity of jasons at some little length as i feel certain should this history be carried down by my own posterity as i hope and design it will be seen that this disposition to regard the whole human family as so many tenants in common of the estate left by adam will lead in the end to something extraordinary but leaving the rev mr worden and mr jason newcome to journey in their public conveyance i must return to our own party  all of us men with the exception of those who drove the two wagons of herman mordaunt marched afoot each of us carried a knapsack in addition to his rifle and ammunition and it will be imagined that our days work was not a very long one the first day we halted at madam schuylers by invitation where we all dined including the surveyor lord howe was among the guests that day and he appeared to admire the spirit of anneke and mary wallace greatly in attempting such an expedition at such a time  you need have no fears however ladies as we shall keep up strong detachments between you and the french he said more gravely after some pleasant trifling on the subject last summers work and the disgraceful manner in which poor munro was abandoned to his fate has rendered us all keenly alive to the importance of compelling the enemy to remain at the north end of lake george too many battles having already been fought on this side it for the credit of the british arms we pledge ourselves to your safety  anneke thanked him for this pledge and the conversation changed there was a young man present who bore the name of schuyler and who was nearly related to madam with whose air manner and appearance i was much struck his aunt called him philip and being about my own age during this visit i got into conversation with him he told me he was attached to the commissariat under gen bradstreet and that he should move on with the army as soon as the preparations for its marching were completed he then entered into a clear simple explanation of the supposed plan of the approaching campaign  we shall see you and your friends among us then i hope he added as we were walking on the lawn together previously to the summons to dinner for to own to you the truth mr littlepage i do not half like the necessity of our having so many eastern troops among us to clear this colony of its enemies it is true a nation must fight its foes wherever they may happen to be found but there is so little in common between us and the yankees that i could wish we were strong enough to beat back the french alone  we have the same sovereign and the same allegiance i answered if you can call that something in common  that is true yet i think you must have enough dutch blood about you to understand me my duty calls me much among the different regiments and i will own that i find more trouble with one new england regiment than with a whole brigade of the other troops they have generals and colonels and majors enough for the army of the duke of marlborough  it is certain there is no want of military rank among themand they are particularly fond of referring to it  quite true answered young schuyler smiling you will hear the word general or colonel oftener used in one of their cantonments in a day than you shall hear it at head quarters in a month they have capital points about them too yet somehow or other we do not like each other  twenty years later in life i had reason to remember this remark as well as to reflect on the character of the man who had uttered it i or my successors will probably have occasion to advert to matters connected with this feeling in the later passages of this record  i had also a little conversation with lord howe who complimented me on what had passed on the river he had evidently received an account of that affair from some one who was much my friend and saw fit to allude to the subject in a way that was very agreeable to myself this short conversation was not worth repeating but it opened the way to an acquaintance that subsequently was connected with some events of interest  about an hour after dinner our party took its leave of madam schuyler and moved on the days march was intended to be short though by this time the roads were settled and tolerably good of roads however we were not long to enjoy the advantages for they extended only some thirty miles to the north of albany in our direction with the exception of the military route which led direct to the headwaters of lake champlain this was about the extent of all the avenues that penetrated the interior in that quarter of the country our direction was to the northward and eastward both ravensnest and mooseridge lying slightly in the direction of the hampshire grants  as soon as we reached the point on the great northern road or that which led towards skeenesborough herman mordaunt was obliged to quit his wagons and to put all the females on horseback the most necessary of the stores were placed on packhorses and after a delay of half a day time lost in making these arrangements we proceeded the wagons were to follow but at a slow pace the ladies being compelled to abandon them on account of the ruggedness of the ways which would have rendered their motion not easy to be borne our cavalcade and train of footmen made a respectable display along the uneven road which soon became very little more than a line cut through the forest with an occasional wheeltrack but without the least attempt to level the surface of the ground by any artificial means this was the place where we were to overtake mr worden and jason and where we did find their effects the owners themselves having gone on in advance leaving word that we should fall in with them somewhere on the route  guert and i marched in front our youth and vigour enabling us to do this with great ease to ourselves knowing that the ladies were well cared for on horseback we pushed on in order to make provision for their reception at a house a few miles distant where we were to pass the night this building was of logs of course and stood quite alone in the wilderness having however some twenty or thirty acres of cleared land around it and it would not do to pass it at that time of the day the distance from this solitary dwelling to the first habitation on herman mordaunts property was eighteen miles and that was a length of road that would require the whole of a long may day to overcome under our circumstances  guert and myself might have been about a mile in advance of the rest of the party when we saw a sort of semiclearing before us that we mistook at first for our restingplace a few acres had been chopped over letting in the light of the day upon the gloom of the forest but the second growth was already shooting up covering the area with high bushes as we drew nearer we saw it was a small abandoned clearing entering it voices were heard at no great distance and we stopped for the human voice is not heard in such a place without causing the traveller to pause and stand to his arms this we did after which we listened with some curiosity and caution  high exclaimed some one very distinctly in english  jack said another voice in a sort of answering second that could not well be mistaken  theres three for lowis that good put in the first speaker  it will do sir but here are a ten and an ace ten and three and four and two make nineteenim game  high low jack and game whispered guert here are fellows playing at cards near us let us go on and beat up their quarters  we did so and pushing aside some bushes broke quite unexpectedly to all parties on the rev mr worden and jason newcome playing the game of all fours on a stump or if not literally in the classic position of using the stump substituting the trunk of a fallen tree for their table as we broke suddenly in upon the cardplayers jason gave unequivocal signs of a disposition to conceal his hand by thrusting the cards he held into his bosom while he rapidly put the remainder of the pack under his thigh pressing it down in a way completely to conceal it this sudden movement was merely the effect of a puritanical education which having taught him to consider that as a sin which was not necessarily a sin at all exacted from him that hypocrisy which is the tribute that vice pays to virtue very different was the conduct of the rev mr worden taught to discriminate better and unaccustomed to set up arbitrary rules of his own as the law of god this loose observer of his professional obligations is other matters made a very proper distinction in this instead of giving the least manifestation of confusion or alarm the log on which he was seated was not more unmoved than he remained at our sudden appearance at his side  i hope corny my dear boy mr worden cried that you did not forget to purchase a few packs of cards which i plainly see will be a great resource for us in this woody region these cards of jasons are so thumbed and handled that they are not fit to be touched by a gentleman as i will show youwhy what has become of the pack master newcomeit was on the log but a minute ago  jason actually blushed yes for a wonder shame induced jason newcome to change colour the cards were reluctantly produced from beneath his leg and there the schoolmaster sat as it might be in presence of his school actually convicted of being engaged in the damning sin of handling certain spotted pieces of paper invented for and used in the combinations of a game played for amusement  had it been pushpin now guert whispered it would give mr newcome no trouble at all but he does not admire the idea of being caught at all fours on a stump we must say a word to relieve the poor sinners distress i have cards mr worden and they shall be much at your service as soon as we can come at our effects there is one pack in my knapsack but it is a little soiled by use though somewhat cleaner than that if you wish it i will hand it to you i never travel without carrying one or two clean packs with me  not just now sir i thank you i love a game of whist or picquet but cannot say i am an admirer of all fours as mr newcome knows no other we were merely killing half an hour at that game but i have enough of it to last me for the summer i am glad that cards have not been forgotten however for i dare say we can make up a very respectable party at whist when we all meet  that we can sir and a party that shall have its good players miss mary wallace plays as good a hand at whist as a woman should mr worden and a very pretty accomplishment it is for a lady to possess useful sir as well as entertaining for anything is preferable to dummy i do not think a woman should play quite as well as a man our sex having a natural claim to lead in all such things but it is very convenient sometimes to find a lady who can hold her hand with coolness and skill  i would not marry a woman who did not understand picquet exclaimed the rev mr worden to say nothing of whist and one or two other games but let us be moving since the hour is getting late  move on we did and in due time we all reached the place at which we were to halt for the night this looked like plunging into the wilderness indeed for the house had but two rooms one of which was appropriated to the use of the females while most of us men took up our lodgings in the barn anneke and mary wallace however showed the most perfect goodhumour and our dinner or supper might better be the name was composed of deliciously fat and tender broiled pigeons it was the pigeon season the woods being full of the birds and we were told we might expect to feast on the young to satiety  about noon the next day we reached the first clearing on the estate of ravensnest the country through which we were travelling was rolling rather than bold but it possessed a feature of grandeur in its boundless forests our route that day lay under lofty arches of young leaves the buds just breaking into the first green of the foliage tall straight columns sixty eighty and sometimes a hundred feet of the trunks of the trees rising almost without a branch the pines in particular were really majestic most of them being a hundred and fifty feet in height and a few as i should think nearly if not quite two hundred as everything grows towards the upper light in the forest this ought not to surprise those who are accustomed to see vegetation expand its powers in widespreading tops and low gnarled branches that almost touch the ground as is the case in the open fields and on the lawns of the older regions as is usual in the american virgin forest there was very little underbrush and we could see frequently a considerable distance through these long vistas of trees or indeed until the number of the stems intercepted the sight  the clearings of ravensnest were neither very large nor very inviting in that day the settlement of new lands was a slow and painful operation and was generally made at a great outlay to the proprietor various expedients were adopted to free the earth from its load of trees 33 for at that time the commerce of the colonies did not reward the toil of the settler in the same liberal manner as has since occurred herman mordaunt as we moved along related to me the cost and trouble he had been at already in getting the ten or fifteen families who were on his property in the first place to the spot itself and in the second place to induce them to remain there not only was he obliged to grant leases for three lives or in some cases for thirty or forty years at rents that were merely nominal but as a rule the first six or eight years the tenants were to pay no rent at all on the contrary he was obliged to extend to them many favours in various ways that cost no inconsiderable sum in the course of the year among other things his agent kept a small shop that contained the most ordinary supplies used by families of the class of the settler and these he sold at little more than cost for their accommodation receiving his pay in such articles as they could raise from their halftilled fields or their sugarbushes and turning those again into money only after they were transported to albany at the end of a considerable period in a word the commencement of such a settlement was an arduous undertaking and the experiment was not very likely to succeed unless the landlord had both capital and patience  the political economist can have no difficulty in discovering the causes of the circumstances just mentioned they were to be found in the fact that people were scarce while land was superabundant in such a condition of society the tenant had the choice of his farm instead of the landlords having a selection of his tenants and the latter were to be bought only on such conditions as suited themselves  you see continued herman mordaunt as we walked together conversing on this subject that my twenty thousand acres are not likely to be of much use to myself even should they prove to be of any to my daughter a century hence indeed my descendants may benefit from all this outlay of money and trouble but it is not probable that either i or anneke will ever see the principal and interest of the sums that will be expended in the way of roads bridges mills and other things of that sort years must go by before the light rents which will only begin to be paid a year or two hence and then only by a very few tenants can amount to a sufficient sum to meet the expenses of keeping up the settlement to say nothing of the quitrents to be paid to the crown  this is not very encouraging to a new beginner in the occupation of a landlord i answered and when i look into the facts i confess i am surprised that so many gentlemen in the colony are willing to invest the sums they annually do in wild lands  every man who is at his ease in his moneyed affairs corny feels a disposition to make some provision for his posterity this estate if kept together and in single hands may make some descendant of mine a man of fortune half a century will produce a great change in this colony at the end of that period a child of annekes may be thankful that his mother had a father who was willing to throw away a few thousands of his own the surplus of a fortune that was sufficient for his wants without them in order his grandson may see them converted into tens or possibly into hundreds of thousands  posterity will at least owe us a debt of gratitude mr mordaunt for i now see that mooseridge is not likely to make either dirck or myself very affluent patroons  on that you may rely satanstoe will produce you more than the large tracts you possess in this quarter  do you no longer fear sir that the war and apprehension of indian ravages may drive your people off  not much at present though the danger was great at one time the war may do me good as well as harm the armies consume everything they can getsoldiers resembling locusts in this respect my tenants have had the commissaries among them and i am told every blade of grass they can spareall their surplus grain potatoes butter cheese and in a word everything that can be eaten and with which they are willing to part has been contracted for at the top of the market the king pays in gold and the sight of the precious metals will keep even a yankee from moving  about the time this was said we came in sight of the spot herman mordaunt had christened ravensnest a name that had since been applied to the whole property it was a log building that stood on the verge of a low cliff of rocks at a point where a bird of that appellation had originally a nest on the uppermost branches of a dead hemlock the building had been placed and erected with a view to defence having served for some time as a sort of rallying point to the families of the tenantry in the event of an indian alarm at the commencement of the present war taking into view the exposed position of his possessions on that frontierfrontier as to settlement if not as to territorial limitsherman mordaunt had caused some attention to be paid to his fortifications which though they might not have satisfied mons vauban were not altogether without merit considered in reference to their use in case of a surprise  the house formed three sides of a parallelogram the open portion of the court in the centre facing the cliff a strong picket served to make a defence against bullets on that side while the dead walls of solid logs were quite impregnable against any assault known in forest warfare but that of fire all the windows opened on the court while the single outer door was picketed and otherwise protected by the coverings of plank i was glad to see by the extent of this rude structure which was a hundred feet long by fifty in depth that anneke and mary wallace would not be likely to be straitened for room such proved to be the fact herman mordaunts agent having prepared four or five apartments for the family that rendered them as comfortable as people could well expect to be in such a situation everything was plain and many things were rude but shelter warmth and security had not been neglected  footnote 32 the ordinary american reader may not know that the rank of brigadier in the british army is not a step in the regular line of promotion as with us in england the regular military gradations are from colonel to majorgeneral lieut general general and field marshal the rank of brigadier is barely recognised like that of commodore in the navy to be used on emergencies usually as brevet local rank to enable the government to employ clever colonels at need  footnote 33 the late venerable hendrick frey was a man well known to all who dwelt in the valley of the mohawk he had been a friend contemporary and it is believed an executor of the celebrated sir william johnson bart thirty years since he related to the writer the following anecdote young johnson first appeared in the valley as the agent of a property belonging to his kinsman admiral sir peter warren k b who having married in the colony had acquired several estates in it among other tracts was one called warrensbush on the mohawk on which young johnson first resided finding it difficult to get rid of the trees around his dwelling johnson sent down to the admiral at new york to provide some purchases with which to haul the trees down to the earth after grubbing and cutting the roots on one side an acre was lowered in this manner each tree necessarily lying at a larger angle to the earth than the next beneath it an easterly wind came one night and to johnsons surprise he found half his trees erect again on rising in the morning the mode of clearing lands by purchases was then abandonededitor     chapter xxi    and long shall timorous fancy see   the painted chief and pointed spear   and reasons self shall bow the knee   to shadows and delusions here    freneau   it is not necessary to dwell on the manner in which herman mordaunt and his companions became established at ravensnest two or three days sufficed to render them as comfortable as circumstances would permit then dirck and i bethought us of proceeding in quest of the lands of mooseridge mr worden and jason both declined going any further the millseat of which the last was in quest being as i now learned on the estate of herman mordaunt and having been for some time the subject of a negotiation between the pedagogue and its owner as for the divine he declared that he saw a suitable field for his missionary labour where he was while it was easy to see that he questioned if there were fields of any sort where we were going  our party on quitting ravensnest consisted of dirck and myself guert mr traverse the surveyor three chainbearers jaap or yaap guerts man pete and one woodsman or hunter this would have given us ten vigorous and wellarmed men for our whole force it was thought best however to add two indians to our number in the double character of hunters and runners or messengers one of these redskins was called jumper in the language of the settlement where we found them and the other trackless the latter sobriquet having been given him on account of a faculty he possessed of leaving little or no trail in his journeys and marches this indian was about sixandtwenty years of age and was called a mohawk living with the people of that tribe though i subsequently ascertained that he was in fact an onondago 34 by birth his true name was susquesus or crooked turns an appellation that might or might not speak well of his character as the turns were regarded in a moral or in a physical sense  take that man mr littlepage by all means said herman mordaunts agent when the matter was under discussion you will find him as useful in the woods as your pocketcompass besides being a reasonably good hunter he left here as a runner during the heaviest of the snows last winter and a trial was made to find his trail within half an hour after he had quitted the clearing but without success he had not gone a mile in the woods before all traces of him were lost as completely as if he had made the journey in the air  as susquesus had a reputation for sobriety as was apt to be the case with the onondagoes the man was engaged though one indian would have been sufficient for our purpose but jumper had been previously hired and it would have been dangerous under our circumstances to offend a redman by putting him aside for another even after compensating him fully for the disappointment by mr traverses advice therefore we took both the indian or mohawk name of jumper was quissquiss a term that i fancy signified nothing very honourable or illustrious  the girls betrayed deep interest in us on our taking leave more i thought than either had ever before manifested guert had told me privately of an intention on his part to make another offer to mary wallace and i saw the traces of it in the tearful eyes and flushed cheeks of his mistress but at such a moment one does not stop to think much of such things there being tears in annekes eyes as well as in those of her friend we had a thousand good wishes to exchange and we promised to keep open the communication between the two parties by means of our runners semiweekly the distance which would vary from fifteen to thirty miles would readily admit of this since either of the indians would pass over it with the greatest ease to himself in a day at that season of the year  after all the separation was to be short for we had promised to come over and dine with herman mordaunt on his fiftieth birthday which would occur within three weeks this arrangement made the parting tolerable to us young men and our constitutional gaiety did the rest half an hour after the last breakfast at ravensnest saw us all on our road cheerful if not absolutely happy herman mordaunt accompanied us three miles which led him to the end of his own settlements and to the edge of the virgin forest there he took his leave and we pursued our way with the utmost diligence for hours with the compass for our guide until we reached the banks of a small river that was supposed to lie some three or four miles from the southern boundaries of the patent we sought i say supposed to lie for there existed then and i believe there still exists much uncertainty concerning the landmarks of different estates in the woods on the banks of this stream which was deep but not broad the surveyor called a halt and we made our dispositions for dinner men who had walked as far and as fast as we had done made but little ceremony and for twenty minutes every one was busy in appeasing his hunger this was no sooner accomplished however than mr traverse summoned the indians to the side of the fallen tree on which we had taken our seats when the first occasion occurred for putting the comparative intelligence of the two runners to the proof at the same time the principal chainbearer a man whose life had been passed in his present occupation was brought into the consultation as follows  we are now on the banks of this stream and about this bend in it commenced the surveyor pointing to the precise curvature of the river on a map he had spread before him at which he supposed we were actually situated and the next thing is to find that ridge on which the moose was killed and across which the line of the patent we seek is known to run this abstract of the title tells us to look for a corner somewhere off here about a mile or a mile and a half from this bend in the rivera black oak with its top broken off by the wind and standing in the centre of a triangle made by three chestnuts i think you told me david that you had never borne a chain on any of these ridges  no sir never answered david the old chainbearer already mentioned my business never having brought me out so far easta black oak with corner blazes on it and its top broken down by the wind and standing atween three chestnuts howsomedever can be nothing so very hard to find for a person thats the least acquainted these injins will be the likeliest bodies to know that tree if theyve any natral knowledge of the country  know a tree there we were and had been for many hours in the bosom of the forest with trees in thousands ranged around us trees had risen on our march as horizon extends beyond horizon on the ocean and this chainbearer fancied it might be in the power of one who often passed through these dark and untenanted mazes to recognise any single member of those countless oaks and beeches and pines nevertheless mr traverse did not seem to regard davids suggestion as so very extravagant for he turned towards the indians and addressed himself to them  hows this he asked jumper do you know anything of the sort of tree i have described  no was the short sententious answer  then i fear there is little hope that trackless is any wiser as you are mohawk born and he they tell me is at bottom an onondago what say you trackless can you help us to find the tree  my eyes were fastened on susquesus as soon as the indians were mentioned there he stood straight as the trunk of a pine light and agile in person with nothing but his breechcloth moccasins and a blue calico shirt belted to his loins with a scarlet band through which was thrust the handle of his tomahawk and to which were attached his shotpouch and horn while his rifle rested against his body butt downward trackless was a singularly handsome indian the unpleasant peculiarities of his people being but faintly portrayed in his face and form while their nobler and finer qualities came out in strong relief his nose was almost aquiline his eye dark as night was restless and piercing his limbs apollolike and his front and bearing had all the fearless dignity of a warrior blended with the grace of nature the only obvious defects were in his walk which was indian or intoed and bending at the knee but to counterbalance these his movements were light springy and swift i fancied him in figure the very beauidéal of a runner  during the time the surveyor was speaking the eye of susquesus was seemingly fastened on vacancy and i would have defied the nicest observer to detect any consciousness of what was in hand in the countenance of this forest stoic it was not his business to speak while an older runner and an older warrior was presentfor jumper was bothand he waited for others who might know more to reveal their knowledge ere he produced his own thus directly addressed however all reserve vanished and he advanced two or three steps cast a curious glance at the map even put a finger on the river the devious course of which it followed across the map much as a child would trace any similar object that attracted his attention susquesus knew but little of maps it was clear enough but the result showed that he knew a great deal about the woods his native field of action  well what do you make of my map trackless repeated the surveyor is it not drawn to suit your fancy  goodreturned the onondago with emphasis now show susquesus your oak tree  here it is trackless you see it is a tree drawn in ink with a broken top and here are the three chestnuts in a sort of triangle around it  the indian examined the tree with some interest and a slight smile illumined his handsome though dark countenance he was evidently pleased at this proof of accuracy in the colony surveyors and no doubt thought the better of them for the fidelity of their work  good he repeated in his low guttural almost feminine voice so soft and mild in its tone very good the palefaces know everything now let my brother find the tree  that is easier said than done susquesus answered traverse laughing it is one thing to sketch a tree on a map and another to go to its root as it stands in the forest surrounded by thousands of other trees  paleface must first see him or how paint him where painter  ay the surveyor saw the tree once and marked it once but that is not finding it again can you tell me where the oak stands mr littlepage will give the man who finds that corner a french crown put me anywhere on the line of the old survey and i will ask favours of no one  painted tree there said susquesus pointing a little scornfully at the map as it seemed to me paleface cant find him in wood live tree out younder injin know  trackless pointed with great dignity towards the north east standing motionless as a statue the while as if inviting the closest possible scrutiny into the correctness of his assertion  can you lead us to the tree demanded traverse eagerly do it and the money is yours  susquesus made a significant gesture of assent then he set about collecting the scanty remains of his dinner a precaution in which we imitated him as a supper would be equally agreeable as the meal just taken a few hours later when everything was put away and the packs were on our shouldersnot on those of the indians for they seldom condescended to carry burthens which was an occupation for womentrackless led the way in the direction he had already pointed out  well did the onondago deserve his name as it seemed to me while he threaded his way through that gloomy forest without path mark or sign of any sort that was intelligible to others his pace was between a walk and a gentle trot and it required all our muscles to keep near him he looked to neither the right nor the left but appeared to pursue his course guided by an instinct or as the keenscented hound follows the viewless traces of his game this lasted for ten minutes when traverse called another halt and we clustered together in council  how much further do you think it may be to the tree onondago demanded the surveyor as soon as the whole party was collected in a circle i have a reason for asking  so many minutes answered the indian holding up five fingers or the four fingers and thumb of his right hand oak with broken top and paleface marks there  the precision and confidence with which the trackless pointed not a little surprised me for i could not imagine how any human being could pretend to be minutely certain of such a fact under the circumstances in which we were placed so it was however and so it proved in the end in the mean time traverse proceeded to carry out his own plans  as we are so near to the tree he said for the surveyor had no doubt of the redmans accuracy we must also be near the line the last runs north and south on this part of the patent and we shall shortly cross it spread yourselves therefore chainbearers and look for blazed trees for put me anywhere on the boundaries and ill answer for finding any oak beech or maple that is mentioned in the corners  as soon as this order was received all the surveyors men obeyed opening the order of their march and spreading themselves in a way to extend their means of observing materially when all was ready a sign was made to the indian to proceed susquesus obeyed and we were all soon in quick motion again  guerts activity enabled him to keep nearest to the onondago and a shout from his clear full throat first announced the complete success of the search in a moment the rest of us pressed forward and were soon at the end of our journey there was susquesus quietly leaning against the trunk of the broken oak without the smallest expression of triumph in either his manner or his countenance that which he had done he had done naturally and without any apparent effort or hesitation to him the forest had its signs and metes and marksas the inhabitant of the vast capital has his means of threading its mazes with the readiness of familiarity and habit as for traverse he first examined the top of the tree where he found the indicated fracture then he looked round for the three chestnuts each of which was in its place after which he drew near to look into the more particular signs of his craft there they were three of the inner sides of the oak being blazed the proof it was a corner while that which had no scar on its surface looked outward or from the patent of mooseridge just as all these agreeable facts were ascertained shouts from the chainbearers south of us announced that they had discovered the linemen of their stamp being quite as quicksighted in ascertaining their own peculiar traces as the native of the forest is in finding his way to any object in it which he has once seen and may desire to revisit by following the line these men soon joined us when they gave us the additional information that they had also actually found the skeleton of the moose that had given its name to the estate  thus far all was well our success much exceeding our hopes the hunters were sent to look for a spring and one being found at no great distance we all repaired to the spot and hutted for the night nothing could be more simple than our encampment which consisted of coverings made of the branches of trees with leaves and skins for our beds next day however traverse finding the position favourable for his work he determined to select the spot as headquarters and we all set about the erection of a loghouse in which we might seek a shelter in the event of a storm and where we might deposit our implements spare ammunition and such stores as we had brought with us on our backs as everybody worked with goodwill at the erection of this rude building and the labourers were very expert with the axe we had it nearly complete by the setting of the next days sun traverse chose the place because the water was abundant and good and because a small knoll was near the spring that was covered with young pines that were about fourteen or fifteen inches in diameter while they grew to the height of near a hundred feet with few branches and straight as the onondago these trees were felled cut into lengths of twenty and thirty feet notched at the ends and rolled alternately on each other so as to enclose an area that was onethird longer than it was wide the notches were deep and brought the logs within two or three inches of each other and the interstices were filled with pieces of riven chestnut a wood that splits easily and in straight lines which pieces were driven hard into their beds so as to exclude the winds and the rains as the weather was warm and the building somewhat airy at the best we cut no windows though we had a narrow door in the centre of one of the longer sides for a roof we used the bark of the hemlock which at that season came off in large pieces and which was laid on sticks raised to the desired elevation by means of a ridge pole  all this was making no more than one of the common loghouses of the new settlements though in a more hurried and a less artificial manner than was usual we had no chimney for our cooking could be done in the open air and less attention was paid to the general finish of the work than might have been the case had we expected to pass the winter there the floor was somewhat rude but it had the effect of raising us from the ground and giving us perfectly dry lodgings an advantage not always obtained in the woods it was composed of logs roughly squared on three sides and placed on sleepers to my surprise traverse directed a door to be made of riven logs that were pinned together with crosspieces and which was hung on the usual wooden hinges when i spoke of this as unnecessary labour occupying two men an entire day to complete he reminded me that we were much in advance from the settlements that an active war was being waged around us and that the agents of the french had been very busy among our own tribes while those in canada often pushed their warparties far within our borders he had always found a great satisfaction as well as security in having a sort of citadel to retreat to when on these exposed surveys and he never neglected the necessary precaution when he fancied himself in the least danger  we were quite a week in completing our house though after the first day neither the surveyor nor his chainbearers troubled themselves with the labour any further than to make an occasional suggestion traverse and his men went to work in their own pursuit running lines to divide the patent into its great lots each of which was made to contain a thousand acres it should be mentioned that all the surveys in that day were made on the most liberal scale our forty thousand acres turning out in the end to amount to quite three thousand more so it was with the subdivisions of the patent each of which was found to be of more than the nominal dimensions blazed trees and records cut into the bark served to indicate the lines while a map went on pari passu with the labour the fieldbook containing a description of each lot in order that the proprietor of the estate might have some notions of the nature of its soil and surface as well as of the quality and sizes of the trees it bore  the original surveyors those on whose labours the patent of the king was granted had a comparatively trifling duty to perform so long as they gave a reasonably accurate outline of an area that would contain forty thousand acres of land more or less and did not trespass on any prior grant no material harm could be done there being no scarcity of surface in the colony but mr traverse had to descend to a little more particularity it is true he ran out his hundreds of acres daily duly marking his corners and blazing his line trees but something very like a summers work lay before him this he understood and his proceedings were as methodical and deliberate as the nature of his situation required  in a very few days things had gotten fairly in train and everybody was employed in some manner that was found to be useful the surveying party was making a very satisfactory progress running out their great lots between sun and sun while dirck and myself made the notes concerning their quality under the dictation of mr traverse guert did little besides shoot and fish keeping our larder well supplied with trout pigeons squirrels and such other game as the season would allow occasionally knocking over something in the shape of poor venison the hunters brought us their share of eatables also and we did well enough in this particular more especially is trout proved to be very abundant yaap or jaap as i shall call him in future and pete performed domestic duty acting as scullions and cooks though the first was much better fitted to perform the service of a forester the two indians did little else for the first fortnight but come and go between ravensnest and mooseridge carrying missives and acting as guides to the hunters who went through once or twice within that period to bring us out supplies of flour groceries and other similar necessaries no inducement being able to prevail on the indians to carry anything that approached a burthen either in weight or appearance  the surveying party did not always return to the hut at night but it camped out as they called it whenever the work led them to a distance on the other side of the tract mr traverse had chosen his position for headquarters more in reference to its proximity to the settlement at ravensnest than in reference to its position on the patent it was sufficiently central to the latter as regarded a north and south line but was altogether on the western side of the property as his surveys extended east therefore he was often carried too far from the building to return to it each night though his absences never extended beyond the evening of the third day in consequence of this arrangement his people were enabled to carry the food they required without inconvenience for the periods they were away coming back for fresh supplies as the lines brought them west again sundays were strictly observed by us all as days of rest a respect to the day that is not always observed in the forest he who is in the solitude of the woods like him who roams athwart the wastes of the ocean often forgetting that the spirit of the creator is abroad equally on the ocean and on the land ready to receive that homage of his creatures which is a tribute due to beneficence without bounds a holiness that is spotless and a truth that is inherent  as jumper or the trackless returned from his constantly recurring visits to our neighbours we young men waited with impatience for the letter that the messenger was certain to bear this letter was sometimes written by herman mordaunt himself but oftener by anneke or mary wallace it was addressed to no one by name but uniformly bore the superscription of to the hermits of mooseridge nor was there anything in the language to betray any particular attention to either of the party we might have liked it better perhaps could we have received epistles that were a little more pointed in this particular but those we actually got were much too precious to leave any serious grounds of complaint one from herman mordaunt reached us on the evening of the second saturday when our whole party was at home and assembled at supper it was brought in by the trackless and among other matters contained this paragraph  we learn that things hourly assume a more serious aspect with the armies our troops are pushing north in large bodies and the french are said to be reinforcing living as we do out of the direct line of march and fully thirty miles in the rear of the old battlegrounds i should feel no apprehension were it not for a report i hear that the woods are full of indians i very well know that such a report invariably accompanies the near approach of hostilities in the frontier settlements and is to be received with many grains of allowance but it seems so probable the french should push their savages on this flank of our army to annoy it on the advance that i confess the rumour has some influence on my feelings we have been fortifying still more and i would advise you not to neglect such a precaution altogether the canadian indians are said to be more subtle than our own nor is government altogether without the apprehension that our own have been tampered with it was said at albany that much french silver had been seen in the hands of the people of the six nations and that even french blankets knives and tomahawks were more plentiful among them than might be accounted for by the ordinary plunder of their warfare one of your runners the man who is called the trackless is said to live out of his own tribe and such indians are always to be suspected their absence is sometimes owing to reasons that are creditable but far oftener to those that are not it may be well to have an eye on the conduct of this man after all we are in the hands of a beneficent and gracious god and we know how often his mercy has saved us on occasions more trying than this  this letter was read several times among ourselves including mr traverse as the oi polloi of our party were eating out of earshot and the indians had left us it naturally induced a conversation that turned on the risks we ran and on the probability of susquesuss being false  as for the rumour that the woods are full of indians the surveyor quietly observed it is very much as herman mordaunt saysthere is never a blanket seen but fame magnifies it into a whole bale there is danger to be apprehended from savages i will allow but not onehalf that the settlers ordinarily imagine as for the french they are likely to need all their savages at ty for they tell me gen abercrombie will go against them with three men to their one  with that superiority at least i answered but after all would not a sagacious officer be likely to annoy his flank in the manner here mentioned  we are every mile of forty to the eastward of the line of march and why should parties keep so distant from their enemies  even such a supposition would place our foes between us and our friends no very comfortable consideration of itself but what think you of this hint concerning the onondago  there may be truth in thatmore than in the report that the woods are full of savages it is usually a bad sign when an indian quits his tribe and this runner of ours is certainly an onondago that i know for the fellow has twice refused rum bread he will take as often as offered but rum has not wet his lips since i have seen him offered in fair weather or foul  tat is a bad signput in guert a little dogmatically for him te man tat refuses his glass in good company has commonly something wrong in his morals i always keep clear of such chaps  poor guerthow true that was and what an influence the opinion had on his character and habits as for the indian i could not judge him so harshly there was something in his countenance that disposed me to put confidence in him at the very moment his cold abstracted mannerscold and abstracted even for a redskin in paleface companycreated doubts and distrust  certainly nothing is easier than for a man in his situation to sell us i answered after a short pause if he be so disposed but what could the french gain by cutting off a party as peaceably employed as this it can be of no moment to them whether mooseridge be surveyed into lots this year or the next  quite true and i am of opinion that mons montcalm is very indifferent whether it be ever surveyed at all returned traverse who was an intelligent and tolerably educated man you forget however mr littlepage that both parties offer such things as premiums on scalps a huron may not care about our lines corners and marked trees but he does care a great deal whether he is to go home with an empty string or with halfadozen human scalps at his girdle  i observed that dirck thrust his fingers through his bushy hair and that his usually placid countenance assumed an indignant and semiferocious appearance a little amused at this i walked towards the log on which susquesus was seated having ended his meal in silent thought  what news do you bring us from the redcoats trackless i asked with as much of an air of indifference as i could assume are they out in sufficient numbers to eat the french  look at leaves count em answered the indian  yes i know they are in force but what are the redskins about is the hatchet buried among the six nations that you are satisfied with being a runner when scalps may be had near ticonderoga  susquesus onondagothe redman replied laying a strong emphasis on the name of his tribe no mohawk blood run in him his people no dig up hatchet this summer  why not trackless you are allies of the yengeese and ought to give us your aid when it is wanted  count leavescount yengeese too much for one army no want onondago  that may be true possibly for we are certainly very strong but how is it with the woodsare they altogether clear of redskins in times as troublesome as these  susquesus looked grave but he made no answer still he did not endeavour to avoid the keen look i fastened on his face but sat composed rigid and gazing before him knowing the uselessness of attempting to get anything out of an indian when he was indisposed to be communicative i thought it wisest to change the discourse this i did by making a few general inquiries as to the state of the streams all of which were answered when i walked away  footnote 34 pronounced onondawger the latter syllable hard or like ga as it is sometimes spelled this is the name of one of the midland counties of new york the tribe from which it is derived in these later times has over borne a better name for morals than its neighbours the oneidas the mohawks c c the onondagoes belonged to the six nationseditor     chapter xxii    fear not till birnam wood   shall come to dunsinane    macbeth   i cannot say i was quite satisfied with the manner of susquesus nor on the other hand was i absolutely uneasy all might be well and if it were not the power of this man to injure us could not be very great a new occurrence however raised very unpleasant doubts of his honesty jumper being out on a hunt the onondago was sent across to ravensnest the next trip out of his turn but instead of returning as had been the practice of both the next day we saw no more of him for near a fortnight as we talked over this sudden and unexpected disappearance we came to the conclusion that perceiving he was distrusted the fellow had deserted and would be seen no more during his absence we paid a visit to ravensnest ourselves spending two or three happy days with the girls whom we found delighted with the wildness of their abode and as happy as innocence health and ceaseless interest in the forest and its habits could make them herman mordaunt having fortified his house sufficiently as he fancied to remove all danger of an assault returned with us to mooseridge and passed two or three days in walking over and examining the quality of the land together with the advantages offered by the watercourses as for mr worden and jason the former had gone to join the army craving the fleshpots of a regimental mess in preference to the simple fare of the woods while jason had driven a hard bargain with herman mordaunt for the possession of the millseat which had been the subject of frequent discussions between the parties and about which the pedagogue had deemed it prudent to draw on the wisdom of mother doortje as the reader may have some curiosity to know how such things were conducted in the colony in the year 1758 i will recapitulate the terms of the bargain that was finally agreed on signed and sealed  herman mordaunt expected no emolument to himself from ravensnest but looked forward solely to a provision for posterity in consequence of these views he refused to sell but gave leases on such conditions as would induce tenants to come into his terms in a country in which land was far plentier than men for some reason that never was very clear to me he was particularly anxious to secure jason newcome and no tolerable terms seemed extravagant to effect his purpose it is not surprising therefore that our miller in perspective got much the best of the bargain as its conditions will show  the lease was for three lives and twentyone years afterwards this would have been thought equal to a lease for fortytwo years in that day in europe but experience is showing that it is in truth for a much longer period in america 35 the first ten years no rent at all was to be paid for the next ten the land five hundred acres was to pay sixpence currency an acre the tenant having the right to cut timber at pleasure this was a great concession as the milllot contained much pine for the remainder of the lease be it longer or shorter a shilling an acre or about sixpence sterling was to be paid for the land and forty pounds currency or one hundred dollars a year for the millseat the mills to be taken by the landlord at an appraisal made by men at the expiration of the lease the tenant to pay the taxes the tenant had the privilege of using all the materials for his dams buildings c he could find on the land  the policy of the owners of mooseridge was different we intended to sell at low prices at first reserving for leases hereafter such farms as could not be immediately disposed of or for which the purchaser failed to pay in this manner it was thought we should sooner get returns for our outlays and sooner build up a settlement as the phrase goes in america the reader should know everything is built the priest builds up a flock the speculator a fortune the lawyer a reputation and the landlord a settlement sometimes with sufficient accuracy in language he even builds a town  jason was a very happy man the moment he got his lease signed and sealed in his own possession it made him a sort of a landholder on the spot and one who had nothing to pay for ten years to come god forgive me if i do the man injustice but from the first i had a suspicion that jason trusted to fortune to prevent any payday from ever coming at all as for herman mordaunt he seemed satisfied for he fancied that he had got a man of some education on his property who might answer a good purpose in civilizing and in otherwise advancing the interests of his estate  just as the rays of the rising sun streamed through the crevices of our log tenement and ere one of us three idlers had risen from his pallet i heard a moccasined foot moving near me in the nearly noiseless tread of an indian springing to my feet i found myself face to face with the missing onondago  you here susquesus i exclaimed we supposed you had abandoned us what has brought you back  time to go now answered the indian quietly yengeese and canada warrior soon fight  is this trueand do you can you know it to be true where have you been this fortnight past  been seehave seeknow him just so comecall young men go on warpath  here then was an explanation of the mystery of the onondagos absence he had heard us speak of an intention of moving with the troops at the last moment and he had gone to reconnoitre in order that we might have seasonable notice when it would be necessary to quit the ridge as we familiarly termed the patent i saw nothing treasonable in this but rather deemed it a sign of friendly interest in our concerns though it was certainly running much farther than the indian had been directed to proceed and running a little off the track one might overlook such an irregularity in a savage however more especially as i began to weary of the monotony of our present manner of living and was not sorry to discover a plausible apology for a change  the reader may be certain it was not long before i had communicated the intelligence brought by the trackless to my companions who received it as young men would be apt to listen to tidings so stirring the onondago was summoned to our council and he renewed his protestation that it was time for us to be moving  no stophe answered when questioned again on the subject time go canoe readygun loadedwarrior countedchief woke upcouncil fire gone out time go  well then corny said guert rising and stretching his fine frame like a lion roused from his lair heres off we can go to ravensnest to sleep today and tomorrow we will work our way out into the highway and fall into the line of march of the army i shall have another opportunity of seeing mary wallace and of telling her how much i love her that will be so much gained at all events  no see squawno go to nest said the indian with energy warpath this way pointing in a direction that might have varied a quarter of a circle from that to herman mordaunts settlement bad for warrior to see squaw when he dig up hatchetonly make woman of him no go this waypath thereno herescalp theresquaw here  as the gestures of the onondago were quite as significant as his language we had no difficulty in understanding him guert continued his questions however while dressing and we all soon became convinced by the words of the indian broken and abrupt as they were that abercrombie was on the point of embarking with his army on lake george and that we must needs be active if we intended to be present at the contemplated operations in front of ticonderoga  our decision was soon reached and our preparations made by packing and shouldering his knapsack and arming himself each man would be ready though a short delay grew out of the absence of traverse and his chainbearers we wrote a letter however explaining the reason of our intended absence promising to return as soon as the operations in front of ty should be terminated this letter we left with pete who was to remain as cook though jaap bestirred himself loaded his broad shoulders with certain indispensables for our march took his rifle pack and horn and was ready to move as soon as any of us all this the fellow did moreover without orders deeming it a part of his duty to follow his young master even if he followed him to evil no dog indeed could be truer in this particular than jaap or jacob satanstoe for he had adopted the name of the neck as his patronymic much as the nobles of other regions style themselves after their lands  when all was ready and we were on the point of quitting the hut the question arose seriously whether we were to go by ravensnest or by the new route that the onondago had mentioned path there was not in either direction but we had landmarks springs and other known signs on the former while of the latter we literally knew nothing then anneke and mary wallace with their bright blooming sunny facesbright and happy whenever we appeared most certainly of latewere in the former direction and even dirck cried out for ravensnest but on that route the onondago refused to stir one foot he stood resembling a fingerpost pointing northwesterly with an immovable obstinacy that threatened to bring the order of our march into some confusion  we know nothing of that route trackless guert observed or rather replied for the indians manner was so expressive as to amount to a remark and we would rather travel a road with which we are a little acquainted besides we wish to pay our parting compliments to the ladies  squaw no good nowwarpath no go to squaw huronfrench warrior here  ay and they are there too we shall be on their heels soon enough by going to ravensnest  no soon noughcant do him path long time short paleface warrior in great hurry  paleface warriors friends are in a hurry tooso you will do well to follow us as we do not intend to follow you come gentlemen we will lead the indian as the indian does not seem disposed to lead us after a mile or two he will think it more honourable to go in advance and for that distance i believe i can show you the way  that road good for young men who dont want see enemy said susquesus with ironical point  by st nicholas indian what do you mean cried guert turning short on his heels and moving swiftly towards the onondago who did not wait for the menacing blow but wheeled in his tracks and led off at a quick pace directly towards the northwest  i do believe that guert pursued for the first minute with no other intention than that of laying his powerful arm on the offenders shoulder but i dropped in on his footsteps so soon dirck following me and jaap dirck that we were all moving off indian file or in the fashion of the woods at the rate of four miles in the hour almost before we knew it an impulse of that angry nature is not over in a minute and before either of us had sufficiently cooled to be entirely reasonable the whole party was fairly out of sight of the hut after that no one appeared to think of the necessity or of the expediency of reverting to the original intention it was certainly indiscreet thus to confide absolutely in the good faith of a savage or a semisavage at least whom we scarcely knew and whom we had actually distrusted but we did it and precisely in the manner and under the feelings i have described i know that we all thought of the indiscretion of which we had been guilty after the first mile but each was too proud to make the other acquainted with his misgivings i say all but jaap ought to be excepted for nothing in the shape of danger ever gave that negro any concern unless it was spooks he was afraid of spooks but he did not fear man  susquesus manifested the same confidence in his knowledge of the woods while now leading the way league after league through the dark forest as he had done when he took us to the oak with the broken top on this occasion he guided us more by the sun and the course generally than by any acquaintance with objects that we passed though three times that day did he point out to us particular things that he had before seen while traversing the woods in directions that crossed at angles more or less oblique the line of our present route as for us it was like a sailors pointing to a path on the trackless ocean we had our pocketcompasses it is true and understood well enough that a northwest course would bring us out somewhere near the foot of lake george but i much doubt if we could have made by any means as direct a line by their aid as we did by that of the indian  on this subject we had a discussion among ourselves i well remember when we halted to eat and rest a little after the turn of the day for five hours had we walked with great rapidity much as the bird flies so far as course was concerned never turning aside unless it might be to avoid some impassable obstacle and our calculation was that we had made quite twenty of the forty miles we had to go over according to the onondagos account of the probable length of our journey we had strung our sinews and hardened our muscles in such a way as to place us above the influence of common fatigue yet it must be confessed the indian was much the freshest of the five when we reached the spring where we dined  an indian does seem to have a nose much like that of a hound said guert as our appetites began to be appeased that must be admitted yet i think corny a compass would carry a man through the woods with more certainty than any signs on the bark of trees or looks at the sun  a compass cannot err of course but it would be a troublesome thing to be stopping every minute or two to look at your compass which must have time to become steady you will remember or it would become a guide that is worse than none  every minute or two say once in an hour or once in half an hour at most i would engage to travel as straight as the best indian of them all by looking at my compass once in half an hour  susquesus was seated near enough to us three to over hear our conversation and he understood english perfectly though he spoke it in the usual clipped manner of an indian i thought i could detect a covert gleam of contempt in his dark countenance at this boast of guerts but he made no remark we finished our meal rested our legs and when our watches told us it was one oclock we rose in a body to resume our march we were renewing the priming of our rifles a precaution each man took twice every day to prevent the effects of the damps of the woods when the onondago quietly fell in behind guert patiently waiting the leisure of the latter  we are all ready trackless cried the albanian give us the lead and the step as before  noanswered the indian compass lead now susquesus no see any longerblind as young dog  oh that is your game is it well let it be so now corny you shall learn the virtue there is in a compass  hereupon guert drew his compass from a pocket in his huntingshirt placed it on a log in order to get a perfectly accurate start and waited until the quivering needle had become perfectly stationary then he made his observation and took a large hemlock which stood at the distance of some twenty rods a great distance for a sight in the forest as his landmark gave a shout caught up his compass and led off we followed of course and soon reached the tree as guert now fancied he was well entered on the right course he disdained to turn to renew his observation but called out for us to come on as he had a new tree for his guide and that in the true direction we may have proceeded in this manner for half a mile and i began to think that guert was about to triumphfor to me it did really seem that our course was as straight as it had been at any time that day guert now began to brag of his success talking to me and at the indian who was between us over his shoulder  you see corny he said i am used to the bush after all and have often been up among the mohawks and on their hunts the great point is to begin right after which you can have no great trouble make certain of the first ten rods and you can be at ease about the ten thousand that are to follow so it is with life corny boy begin right and a young man is pretty certain of coming out right i made a mistake at the start and you see the trouble it has given me but i was left an orphan littlepage at ten years of age and the boy that has neither father nor money must be an uncommon boy not to kick himself out of the traces before he is twenty well onondago what do you say to following the compass now  best look at himhe tell answered susquesus our whole line halting to let guert comply  this dd compass will never come round exclaimed guert shaking the little instrument in order to help the needle round to the point at which he wished to see it stand these little devils are very apt to get out of order corny after all  try moregot threesaid the indian holding up the number of fingers he mentioned as was his wont when mentioning numbers of any sort  on this hint dirck and i drew out our compasses and the three were placed on a log at the side of which we had come to our halt the result showed that the three little devils agreed most accurately and that we were marching exactly southeast instead of northwest guert looked on that occasion very much as he did when he rose from the snow after the handsled had upset with us there was no resisting the truth we had got turned completely round without knowing it the fact that the sun was so near the zenith probably contributed to our mistake but any one who has tried the experiment will soon ascertain how easy it is for him to lose his direction beneath the obscurity and amid the inequalities of a virgin forest guert gave it up like a man as he was and the indian again passed in front without the slightest manifestation of triumph or discontent it required nothing less than a thunderbolt to disturb the composure of that onondago  from that moment our progress was as swift as it had been previously to the halt while our course was seemingly as unerring as the flight of the pigeon susquesus did not steer exactly northwest as before however but he inclined more northerly at length it was just as the sun approached the summits of the western mountains an opening appeared in our front beneath the arches of the woods and we knew that a lake was near us and that we were on the summit of high land though at what precise elevation could not yet be told our route had lain across hills and through valleys and along small streams though as i afterwards ascertained the hudson did not run far enough north to intercept our march or rather by a sudden turn to the west it left our course clear had we inclined westwardly ourselves we might have almost done that which col follock had once laughingly recommended to my mother in order to avoid the dangers of the powles hook ferry gone round the river  a clearing now showed itself a little on our right and thither the indian held his way this clearing was not the result of the labours of man but was the fruit of one of those forest accidents that sometimes let in the light of the sun upon the mysteries of the woods this clearing was on the bald cap of a rocky mountain where indians had doubtless often encamped the vestiges of their fires proving that the winds had been assisted by the sister element in clearing away the few stunted trees that had once grown in the fissures of the rocks as it was there might have been an open space of some two or three acres that was now as naked as if it had never known any vegetation more ambitious than the bush of the whortleberry or the honeysuckle delicious water was spouting from a higher ridge of the rocks that led away northerly forming the summit of an extensive range in that direction at this spring susquesus stooped to drink then he announced that our days work was done  until this announcement i do not believe that one of us all had taken the time to look about him so earnest and rapid had been our march now however each man threw aside his pack laid down his rifle and thus disencumbered we turned to gaze on one of the most surprisingly beautiful scenes eye of mine had ever beheld  from what i have read and heard i am now fully aware that the grandest of our american scenery falls far behind that which is to be found among the lakes and precipices of the alps and along the almost miraculous coast of the mediterranean and i shall not pretend that the view i now beheld approached many in magnificence that are to be met with in those magic regions nevertheless it was both grand and soft and it had one element of vastness in the green mantle of its interminable woods that is not often to be met with in countries that have long submitted to the sway of man such as it was i shall endeavour to describe it  beneath us at the distance of near a thousand feet lay a lake of the most limpid and placid water that was beautifully diversified in shape by means of bluffs bays and curvatures of the shores and which had an extent of near forty miles we were on its eastern margin and about onethird of the distance from its southern to its northern end countless islands lay almost under our feet rendering the mixture of land and water at that particular point as various and fanciful as the human imagination could desire to the north the placid sheet extended a great distance bounded by rocky precipices passing by a narrow gorge into a wider and larger estuary beyond to the south the water lay expanded to its oval termination with here and there an island to relieve the surface in that direction only were any of the results of human industry to be traced everywhere else the gorges the receding valleys the long ranges of hills and the bald caps of granite presented nothing to the eye but the unwearying charms of nature far as the eye could reach mountain behind mountain the earth was covered with its green mantle of luxuriant leaves such as vegetation bestows on a virgin soil beneath a beneficent sun the rolling and variegated carpet of the earth resembled a firmament reversed with clouds composed of foliage  at the southern termination of the lake however there was an opening in the forest of considerable extent and one that had been so thoroughly made as to leave few or no trees from this point we were distant several miles and that distance necessarily rendered objects indistinct though we had little difficulty in perceiving the ruins of extensive fortifications a thousand white specks we now ascertained to be tents for the works were all that remained of fort william henry and there lay encamped the army of abercrombie much the largest force that had then ever collected in america under the colours of england history has since informed us that this army contained the formidable number of sixteen thousand men hundreds of boats large batteaux that were capable of carrying forty or fifty men were moving about in front of the encampment and remote as we were it was not impossible to discover the signs of preparation and of an early movement the indian had not deceived us thus far at least but had shown himself an intelligent judge of what was going on as well as a faithful guide  we were to pass the night on the mountain our beds were none of the best as the reader may suppose and our cover slight yet i do not remember to have opened my eyes from the moment they were closed until i awoke in the morning the fatigue of a forced march did that for us which down cannot obtain for the voluptuary and we all slept as profoundly as children consciousness returned to me by means of a gentle shake of the shoulder which proceeded from susquesus on arising i found the indian still near me his countenance for the first time since i had known him expressing something like an animated pleasure he had awoke none of the others and he signed for me to follow him without arousing either of my companions why i had been thus particularly selected for the scene that succeeded i cannot say unless the onondagos native sagacity had taught him to distinguish between the educations and feelings of us three young men so it was however and i left the rude shelter we had prepared for the night alone  a glorious sight awaited me the sun had just tipped the mountaintops with gold while the lake and the valleys the hillsides even and the entire world beneath still reposed in shadow it appeared to me like the awakening of created things from the sleep of nature for a moment or more i could only gaze on the wonderful picture presented by the strong contrast between the golden hilltops and their shadowed sidesthe promises of day and the vestiges of night but the onondago was too much engrossed with his own feelings to suffer me long to disregard what he conceived to be the principal point of interest directed by his finger and eye for he spoke not i turned my look towards the distant shore of william henry and at once perceived the cause of his unusual excitement as soon as the indian was certain that i saw the objects that attracted himself so strongly he exclaimed with a strong guttural emphatic cadence  good  abercrombies army was actually in motion sixteen thousand men had embarked in boats and were moving towards the northern end of the lake with imposing force and a most beautiful accuracy the unruffled surface of the lake was dotted with the flotilla boats in hundreds stretching across it in long dark lines moving on towards their point of destination with the method and concert of an army with its wings displayed the last brigade of boats had just left the shore when i first saw this striking spectacle and the whole picture lay spread before me at a single glance america had never before witnessed such a sight and it may be long before she will again witness such another for several minutes i stood entranced nor did i speak until the rays of the sun had penetrated the dusky light that lay on the inferior world as low as the bases of the western mountains  what are we to do susquesus i then asked feeling how much right the indian now might justly claim to govern our movements  eat breakfast firstthe onondago quietly replied then go down mountain  neither of which will place us in the midst of that gallant army as it is our wish to be  see byem by injin knowno hurry now hurry come when frenchman shoot  i did not like this speech nor the manner in which it was uttered but there were too many things to think of just then to be long occupied by vague conjectures touching the onondagos evasive allusions guert and dirck were called and made to share in the pleasure that such a sight could not fail to communicate then it was i got the first notion of what i should call the truly martial character of ten eyck his fine manly figure appeared to me to enlarge his countenance actually became illuminated and the expression of his eye usually so full of goodnature and fun seemed to change its character entirely to one of sternness and seventy  this is a noble sight mr littlepage guert remarked after gazing at the measured but quick movement of the flotilla for some time in silencea truly noble sight and it is a reproach to us three for having lost so much time in the woods when we ought to have been there ready to aid in driving the french from the province  we are not too late my good friend as the first blow yet remains to be struck  you say true and i shall join that army if i have to swim to reach the boats it will be no difficult thing for us to swim from one of these islands to another and the troops must pass through the midst of them n order to get into the lower lake any reasonable man would stop to pick us up  no need said the onondago in his quiet way eat breakfast then go got canoethat nough  a canoe by st nicholas mr susquesus ill tell you what it isyou shall never want a friend as long as guert ten eyek is living and able to assist you that idea of the canoe is a most thoughtful one and shows that a reasoning man has had the care of us we can now join the troops with the rifles in our hand as becomes gentlemen and volunteers  by this time jaap was up and looking at the scene with all his eyes it is scarcely necessary to describe the effect on a negro he laughed in fits shook his head like the chinese figure of a mandarin rolled over on the rocks arose shook himself like a dog that quits the water laughed again and finally shouted as we were all accustomed to these displays of negro sensibility they only excited a smile among us and not even that from dirck as for the indian he took no more notice of these natural but undignified signs of pleasure in jaap than if the latter had been a dog or any other unintellectual animal perhaps no weakness would be so likely to excite his contempt as to be a witness of so complete an absence of selfcommand as the untutored negro manifested on this occasion  as soon as our first curiosity and interest were a little abated we applied ourselves to the necessary duty of breaking our fasts the meal was soon despatched and to say the truth it was not of a quality to detain one long from anything of interest the moment we had finished the whole party left the cap of the mountain following our guide as usual  the onondago had purposely brought us to that lookout a spot known to him in order that we might get the view of its panorama it was impossible to descend to the lakeshore at that spot however and we were obliged to make a detour of three or four miles in order to reach a ravine by means of which and not without difficulty either that important object was obtained here we found a bark canoe of a size sufficient to hold all five of us and we embarked without a moments delay  the wind had sprung up from the south as the day advanced and the flotilla of boats was coming on at a greatly increased rate as to speed by the time we had threaded our way through the islands and reached the main channel if indeed any one passage could be so termed among such a variety the leading boat of the army was within hail the indian paddled and waving his hand in sign of amity he soon brought us alongside of the batteau as we approached it however i observed the fine large form of the viscount howe standing erect in its bows dressed in his light infantry forest uniform as if eager to be literally the foremost man of a movement in the success of which the honour of the british empire itself was felt to be concerned  footnote 35 it has been found that a three lives lease in the state of new york is equal to a term of more than thirty yearseditor     chapter xxiii    my sons it may   unman my heart and the poor boys will weep   and what can i reply to comfort them   save with some hollow hopes and illworn smiles    sardanapalus   my lord howe did not at first recognise us in our huntingshirts with guert ten eyck however he had formed such an acquaintance while at albany as caused him to remember his voice and our welcome was both frank and cordial we inquired for the th declaring our intention to join that corps from the commander of which all three of us had reiterated and pressing invitations to join his mess the intention of seeking our friend immediately nevertheless was changed by a remark of our present host if one may use such a term as applied to the commander of a brigade of boats  bulstrodes regiment is in the centre and will be early in the field he said but not as early as the advanced guard if you desire good living gentlemen i am far from wishing to dissuade you from seeking the fleshpots of the th there being a certain mr billings in that corps who has an extraordinary faculty they tell me in getting up a good dinner out of nothing but if you want service we shall certainly be the first brigade in action and to such fare as i can command you will be most acceptable guests as for anything else time must show  after this no more was said about looking for bulstrode though we let our noble commander understand that we should tax his hospitality no longer than to see him fairly in the field after driving away the party that it was expected the enemy would send to oppose our landing  susquesus no sooner learned our decision than he took his departure quietly paddling away towards the eastern shore no one attempting to intercept a canoe that was seen to quit the batteau that was known to carry the commander of the advanced brigade  the wind freshened as the day advanced and most of the boats having something or other in the shape of a sail our progress now became quite rapid by nine oclock we were fairly in the lower lake and there was every prospect of our reaching our point of destination by midday i confess the business we were on the novelty of my situation and the certainty that we should meet in montcalm an experienced as well as a most gallant foe conspired to render me thoughtful though i trust not timid during the few hours we were in the batteau perfectly inactive it is not surprising that so young a soldier should feel sobered by the solemn reflections that are apt to get possession of the mind at the probable approach of deathif not to myself at least to many of those who were around me nor was there anything boastful or inflated in the manner or conversation of our distinguished leader who had seen much warm service in germany in the wars of his reputed grandfather and uncle young as he was on the contrary my lord howe that day was grave and thoughtful as became a man who held the lives of others in his keeping though he was neither depressed nor doubting there were moments indeed when he spoke cheerfully to those who were near him though as a whole his deportment was as i have just said grave and thoughtful once i caught his eye fastened on me with a saddened expression and i suppose that a question he soon after put me was connected with the subject of his thoughts  how would our excellent and respectable friend madam schuyler feel did she know our precise position at this moment mr littlepage i do believe that excellent woman feels more concern for those in whom she takes an interest than they often feel for themselves  i think my lord that in such a case we should certainly receive the benefit of her prayers  you are an only child i think she told me littlepage  i am my lord and thankful am i that my mother cannot foresee this scene  i too have those that love me though they are accustomed to think of me as a soldier and liable to a soldiers risks happy is the military man who can possess his mind in the moment of trial free from the embarrassing though pleasing and otherwise so grateful ties of affection but we are nearing the shore and must attend to duty  this is the last conversation i held with that brave soldier and these were the last words of a private nature i ever heard him utter from that moment his whole soul seemed occupied with the discharge of his duty the success of our arms and the defeat of the enemy  i am not soldier enough to describe what followed in a very military or intelligible manner as the brigade drew near the foot of the lake where there was a wide extent of low land principally in forest however some batteaux were brought to the front on which were mounted a number of pieces of heavy artillery the french had a party of considerable force to oppose our landing but as it appeared they had not made a sufficient provision of guns on their part to contend with success and our grape scouring the woods we met with but little real resistance nor did we assail them precisely at the point where we were expected but proceeded rather to the right of their position at the signal the advanced brigade pushed for the shore led by our gallant commander and we were all soon on terra firma without sustaining any loss worth naming we four that is guert dirck myself and jaap kept as near as was proper to the noble brigadier who instantly ordered an advance to press the retreating foe the skirmishing was not sharp however and we gained ground fast the enemy retiring in the direction of ticonderoga and we pressing on their rear quite as fast as prudence and our preparations would allow i could see that a cloud of indians was in our front and will own that i felt afraid of an ambush for the artful warfare practised by those beings of the wood could not but be familiar by tradition at least to one born and educated in the colonies we had landed in a cove not literally at the foot of the lake but rather on its western side and room was no sooner obtained than gen abercrombie got most of his force on shore and formed it as speedily as possible in columns of these columns we had four the two in the centre being composed entirely of kings troops six regiments in all numbering more than as many thousand men while five thousand provincials were on the flanks leaving quite four thousand of the latter with the boats of which this vast flotilla actually contained the large number of one thousand and twenty five all our boats however had not yet reached the point of debarkation those with the stores artillery c c being still some distance in the rear  our party was now placed with the right centre column at the head of which marched our noble acquaintance the enemy had posted a single battalion in a log encampment near the ordinary landing but finding the character of the force with which he was about to be assailed its commandant set fire to his huts and retreated the skirmishing was now even of less moment than it had been on landing and we all moved forward in high spirits though the want of guides the density of the woods and the difficulties of the ground soon produced a certain degree of confusion in our march the columns got entangled with each other and no one seemed to possess the means of promptly extricating them from this awkward embarrassment want of guides was the great evil under which we laboured but it was an evil that it was now too late to remedy  our column notwithstanding or its head rather continued to advance with its gallant leader keeping even pace with its foremost platoon we four volunteers acted as lookouts a little on its flank and i trust there will be no boasting if i say we kept rather in advance of the leading files than otherwise in this state of things french uniforms were seen in front and a pretty strong party of the enemy was encountered wandering like ourselves a little uncertain of the route they ought to take in order to reach their entrenchments in the shortest time as a matter of course this party could not pass the head of our column without bringing on a collision though it were one that was only momentary which party gave the first fire i cannot say though i thought it was the french the discharge was not heavy however and was almost immediately mutual i know that all four of us let off our rifles and that we halted under a cover to reload i had just driven the ball down when my eye caught the signs of some confusion in the head of the column and i saw the body of an officer borne to the rear it was that of lord howe he had fallen at the first serious discharge made by the enemy in that campaign the fall of its leader so immediately in its presence seemed to rouse the column into a sense of the necessity of doing something effective and it assaulted the party in its front with the rage of so many tigers dispersing the enemy like chaff making a considerable number of prisoners besides killing and wounding not a few  i never saw a man more thoroughly aroused than was guert ten eyck in this little affair he had been much noticed by lord howe during the residence of that unfortunate nobleman at albany and the loss of the last appeared to awaken all that there was of the ferocious in the nature of my usually kindhearted albany friend he acted as our immediate commander and he led us forward on the heels of the retreating french until we actually came in sight of their entrenchments then indeed we all saw it was necessary to retreat in our turn and guert consented to fall back though it was done surlily and like a lion at bay a party of indians pressed us hard in this retreat and we ran an imminent risk of our scalps all of which i have ever believed would have been lost were it not for the resolution and herculean strength of jaap it happened as we were dodging from tree to tree that all four of our rifles were discharged at the same time a circumstance of which our assailants availed themselves to make a rush at us luckily the weight of the onset fell on jaap who clubbed his rifle and literally knocked down in succession the three indians that first reached him this intrepidity and success gave us time to reload and dirck ever a cool and capital shot laid the fourth huron on his face with a ball through his heart guert then held his fire and called on jaap to retreat fie was obeyed and under cover of our two rifles the whole party got off the redskins being too thoroughly rebuked to press us very closely after the specimen they had just received of the stuff of which we were made  we owed our escape however as much to another circumstance as to this resolution of jaap and the expedient of guert among the provincials was a partisan of great repute of the name of rogers this officer led a party of riflemen on our left flank and he drove in the enemys skirmishers along his own front with rapidity causing them to suffer a considerable loss by this means the indians before us were held in check as there was the danger that major rogerss party might fall in upon their rear should they attempt to pursue us and thus cut them off from their allies it was well it was so inasmuch as we had to fall back more than a mile ere we reached the spot where abercrombie brought his columns to a halt and encamped far the night this position was distant about two miles from the works before ticonderoga and consequently at no great distance from the outlet of lake george here the army was brought into good order and took up its station for some little time  it was necessary to await the arrival of the stores ammunition and artillery as the bringing up these materials through a country that was little else than a virgin forest was no easy task it occupied us quite two days melancholy days they were too the death of lord howe acting on the whole army much as if it had been a defeat he was the idol of the kings troops and he had rendered himself as popular with us americans as with his own countrymen a sort of ominous sadness prevailed among us each common man appearing to feel his loss as he might have felt that of a brother  we looked up the th and joined bulstrode as soon as we reached the ground chosen for the new encampment our reception was friendly and even kind and it became warmer still as soon as it was understood that we composed the little party that had skirmished so freely on the flank of the right centre column and which was known to have gone farther in advance than any one else in that part of the field thus we joined our corps with some éclat at the very outset everybody welcoming us cordially and with seeming sincerity  nevertheless the general sadness existed in the th as well as in all the other corps lord howe was as much beloved in that regiment as in any other and our meeting and subsequent intercourse could not be called joyful bulstrode had an extensive and important command for his rank and years and he certainly was proud of his position but i could see that even his elastic and usually gay temperament was much affected by what had occurred that night we walked together apart from our companions when he spoke on the subject of our loss  it may appear strange to you corny he said to find so much depression in camp after a debarkation that has certainly been successful and a little affair that has given us as they assure me a couple of hundred prisoners i tell you however my friend it were better for this army to have seen its best corps annihilated than to have lost the man it has howe was literally the soul of this entire force he was a soldier by nature and made all around him soldiers as for the commanderinchief he does not understand you americans and will not use you as he ought then he does not understand the nature of the warfare of this continent and will be very likely to make a blunder ill tell you how it is corny howe had as much influence with abercrombie as he had with every one else and an attempt will be made to introduce his mode of fighting but such a man as lord howe requires another lord howe to carry out his own conceptions that is the point on which i fear we shall fail  all this sounded very sensible to me though it sounded discouragingly i found however that bulstrode did not entertain these feelings alone but that most around me were of the same way of thinking in the mean time the preparations proceeded and it was understood that the 8th was to be the day that was to decide the fate of ticonderoga the fort proper at this celebrated station stands on a peninsula and can only be assailed on one side the outworks were very extensive on that side and the garrison was known to be formidable as these outworks however consisted principally of a log breastwork and it could be approached through open woods which of itself afforded some cover it was determined to carry it by storm and if possible enter the main work with the retreating enemy had we waited for our artillery and established batteries our success would have been certain but the engineer reported favourably of the other project and perhaps it better suited the temper and impatience of the whole army to push on rather than proceed by the slow movements of a regular siege  on the morning of the 8th therefore the troops were paraded for the assault our party falling in on the flank of the th as volunteers the ground did not admit of the use of many horses and bulstrode marched with us on foot i can relate but little of the general movements of that memorable day the woods concealing so much of what was done on both sides i know this however that the flower of our army were brought into the line and were foremost in the assault including both regulars and provincials the 42d a highland corps that had awakened much interest in america both by the appearance and character of its men was placed at a point where it was thought the heaviest service was to be performed the 55th another corps on which much reliance was placed was also put at the head of another column a swamp extending for some distance along the only exposed front of the peninsula these two corps were designated to carry the log breastwork that commenced at the point where the swamp ceases much the most arduous portion of the expected service since this was the only accessible approach to the fortress itself to render their position more secure the french had placed several pieces of artillery in battery along the line of this breastwork while we had not yet a gun in front to cover our advance  it was said that abercrombie did not take counsel of any of the american officers with him before he decided on the attack of the 8th of july he had directed his principal engineer to reconnoitre and that gentleman having reported that the defences offered no serious scientific obstacles the assault was decided on this report was accurate doubtless agreeably to the principles and facts of european warfare but it was not suited to those of the conflicts of this continent it was to be regretted however that the experience of 1755 and the fate of braddock had not inculcated a more extensive lesson of discretion among the royal commanders than was manifested by the incidents of this day  the th was placed in column directly in the rear of the highlanders who were led on this occasion by col gordon graham a veteran officer of great experience and of an undaunted courage 36 of course i saw this officer and this regiment being as they were directly in my front but i saw little else more especially after the smoke of the first discharge was added to the other obstacles to vision  a considerable time was consumed in making the preparations but when everything was supposed to be ready the columns were set in motion it was generally understood that the troops were to receive the enemys fire then rush forward to the breastwork cross the latter at the bayonets point if it should be necessary and deliver their own fire at close quarters or on their retreating foes permission was given to us volunteers and to divers light parties of irregulars to open on any of the french of whom we might get glimpses as little was expected from us in the charge  nearly an hour was consumed in approaching the point of attack owing to the difficulties of the ground and the necessity of making frequent halts in order to dress at length the important moment arrived when the head of the column was ready to unmask itself and consequently to come under fire a short halt sufficed for the arrangements here when the bagpipes commenced their exciting music and we broke out of cover shouting and cheering each other on we must have been within two hundred yards of the breastwork at the time and the first gun discharged was jaaps who by working his way into the cover of the swamp had got some distance ahead of us and who actually shot down a french officer who had got upon the logs of his defences in order to reconnoitre that assault however was fearfully avenged the highlanders were moving on like a whirlwind grave silent and steady cheered only by their music when a sheet of flame glanced along the enemys line and the iron and leaden messengers of death came whistling in among us like a hurricane the scotsmen were staggered by that shock but they recovered instantly and pressed forward the th did not escape harmless by any means while the din told us that the conflict extended along the whole of the breastwork towards the lakeshore how many were shot down in our column by that first discharge i never knew but the slaughter was dreadful and among those who fell was the veteran graham himself i can safely say however that the plan of attack was completely deranged from this first onset the columns displaying and commencing their fire as soon as possible no men could have behaved better than all that i could see the whole of us pushing on for the breastwork until we encountered fallen trees which were made to serve the purpose of chevauxdefrise these trees had been felled along the front of the breastwork while their branches were cut and pointed like stakes it was impossible to pass in any order and the troops halted when they reached them and continued to fire by platoons with as much regularity as on parade a few minutes of this work however compelled different corps to fall back and the vain conflict was continued for four hours on our part almost entirely by a smart but ineffective fire of musketry while the french sent their grape into our ranks almost with as much impunity as if they had been on parade it had been far better for our men had they been less disciplined and less under the control of their officers for the sole effect of steadiness under such circumstances is to leave the gallant and devoted troops who refuse to fall back while they are unable to advance only so much the longer in jeopardy  guert had shouted with the rest and i soon found that by following him for a leader we should quickly be in the midst of the fray he actually led us up to the fallen trees and finding something like a cover there we three established ourselves among them as riflemen doing fully out share of service when the troops fell back however we were left in a manner alone and it was rather dangerous work to retire and finding ourselves out of the line of fire from our own men no immaterial point in such a fray we maintained our post to the last admonished after a long time of the necessity of retreating by the manner in which the fire of our own line lessened we got off with sound skins though guert retired the whole distance with his face to the enemy firing as he withdrew we all did the last indeed using the trees for covers towards the close we attracted especial attention and there were two or three minutes during which the flight of bullets around us might truly without much exaggeration be likened to a storm of hail  jaap was not with us in this sally and i went into the swamp to look for him the search was not long for i found my fellow retreating also and bringing in with him a stout canadian indian as a prisoner he was making his captive carry three discharged rifles and blankets one of which had been his own property once and the others that of two of his tribe whom the negro had left lying in the swamp as bloody trophies of his exploits i cannot explain the philosophy of the thing but that negro ever appeared to me to fight as if he enjoyed the occupation as an amusement  these facts were scarcely ascertained when we learned the important intelligence that a general retreat was ordered our proud and powerful army was beaten and that too by a force twothirds less than its own it is not easy to describe the miserable scene that followed the transporting of the wounded to the rear had been going on the whole time and as usually happens when it is permitted it had contributed largely to thin the ranks these unfortunate men were put into the batteaux in hundreds while most of the dead were left where they lay so completely were our hopes frustrated and our spirits lowered that most of the boats pulled off that night and all the remainder quitted the foot of the lake early next day  thus terminated the dire expedition of 1758 against ticonderoga and with it our expectations of seeing montreal or quebec that season i dare say we had fully ten thousand bayonets in the field that bloody day and quite five thousand men closely engaged the mistake was in attempting to carry a post that was so nearly impregnable by assault and this too without the cover of artillery the enemy was said to have four or five thousand men present and this may be true as applied to all within the defences though i question if more than half that number pulled triggers on us in the miserable affair there is always much of exaggeration in both the boasting and the apologies of war  our own loss on this sad occasion was reported at 548 slain and 1356 wounded this was probably within the truth though the missing were said to be surprisingly few some thirty or forty in all the men having no place to repair to but the boats of the highlanders it was said that nearly half the common men and twentyfive or nearly all the officers were either killed or wounded one account indeed said that every officer of that corps who was on the ground suffered the 55th also was dreadfully cut up ten of its officers were slain outright and many were wounded as for the th it fared a little better not heading a column but its loss was fearful bulstrode was seriously wounded early in the attack though his hurt was never supposed to be dangerous billings was left dead on the field and harris got a scratch that served him to talk of in after life  the confusion was tremendous after such a conflict and such a defeat the troops reembarked without much regard to corps or regularity of movement and the boats moved away as fast as they received their melancholy cargoes an immense amount of property was lost though i believe all the customary military trophies were preserved as the provincials had been the least engaged and had suffered much the least in proportion to numbers a large body of them was kept as a rearguard while the regular corps removed their wounded and matériel  as for us three or four including jaap who stuck by his prisoner we scarcely knew what to do with ourselves everybody who felt any interest in us was either killed or wounded bulstrode we could not see nor could we even find the regiment should we succeed in the attempt at the last very few now remained in it who would have taken much or indeed any concern in us under the circumstances therefore we held a consultation on the lakeshore uncertain whether to ask admission into one of the departing boats or to remain until morning that our retreat might have a more manly aspect  ill tell you what it is corny said guert ten eyck in a somewhat positive manner the less we say about this campaign and of our share in it the petter we are not soldiers in the regular way and if we keep quiet nobody will know what a trashing we tree in particular haf receivet my advice is tat we get out of this army as we got into ittat is py a onesided movement and for ever afterholt our tongues about our having had anyting to do with it i never knew a worsted man any the more respected for his mishap and i will own that i set down flogging as a very material part of a fight  i am quite sure guert i am as little disposed to brag of my share in this affair as you or any one can possibly be but it is much easier to talk about getting away from this confused crowd than really to do the thing i doubt if any of these boats will take us in for an englishman flogged is not apt to be very goodnatured and all our friends seem to be killed or wounded  you want go asked a low indian voice at my elbow got nough eh  turning i saw susquesus standing within two feet of me our consultation was necessarily in the midst of a moving throng and the onondago must have approached us unnoticed at the commencement of our conference there he was however though whence he came or how he got there i could not imagine at the time and have never been able to learn since  can you help us to get away susquesus was my answer do you know of any means of crossing the lake  got canoe that good canoe go though yengeese run  that in which we came off to the army do you mean  the indian nodded his head and made a sign for us to follow little persuasion was necessary and we proceeded at his heels in a body in the direction he led i will confess that when i saw our guide proceeding eastward along the lakeshore i had some misgivings on the subject of his good faith that was the direction which took us towards instead of from the enemy and there was something so mysterious in the conduct of this man that it gave me uneasiness here he was in the midst of the english army in the height of its confusion though he had declined joining it previously to the battle nothing was easier than to enter the throng in its present confused state and move about undetected for hours if one had the nerve necessary for the service and in that property i felt certain the onondago was not deficient there was a coolness in the manner of the man a quiet observation both blended with the seeming apathy of a redskin that gave every assurance of his fitness for the duty  nevertheless there was no remedy but to follow or to break with our guide on the spot we did not like to do the last although we conferred together on the subject but followed keeping our hands on the locks of our rifles in readiness for a brush should we be led into danger susquesus had no such treacherous intentions however while he had disposed of his canoe in a place that denoted his judgment we had to walk quite a mile ere we reached the little bushfringed creek in which he had concealed it i have always thought we ran a grave risk in advancing so far in that direction since the enemys indians would certainly be hanging around the skirts of our army in quest of scalps but i afterwards learned the secret of the onondagos confidence who first spoke on the subject after we had left the shore and then only in an answer to a remark of guerts  no danger he said redman gettin yengeese scalps on the warpath too much kill now to want more  as both governments pursued the culpable policy of paying for human scalps this suggestion probably contained the whole truth  previously to quitting the creek however there was a difficulty to dispose of jaap had brought his huron prisoner with him and the onondago declared that the canoe could not carry six this we knew from experience indeed though five went in it very comfortably  no room said susquesus for redman five goodsix bad  what shall we do with the fellow corny asked guert with a little interest jaap says he is a proper devil by daylight and that he had a world of trouble in taking him and in bringing him in for five minutes it was heads or tails which was to give in and the nigger only got the best of it by his own account of the battle because the redskin had the unaccountable folly to try to beat in jaaps brains he might as well have battered the rock of gibraltar you know as to attempt to break a niggers skull and so your fellow got the best of it what shall we do with the rascal  take scalp said the onondago sententiously got good scalpwarlock readypaint warpaintcapital scalp  ay that may do better for you master succetushso guert always called our guide than it will do for us christians i am afraid we shall have to let the ravenous devil go after disarming him  disarmed he is already but he cannot be long without a musket on this battleground i am of your opinion guert so jaap release your prisoner at once that we may return to ravensnest as fast as possible  dat berry hard masser corny sah exclaimed jaap who did not half like the orders he received  no words about it sir but cut his fasteningsjaap had tied the indians arms behind him with a rope as an easy mode of leading him along do you know the mans name  yes sahhe say he name be mussprobably jaaps defective manner of repeating some indian sound and a proper muss he get in masser corny when he try to cotch jaap by he wool  here i was obliged to clap my hand suddenly on the blacks mouth for the fellow was so delighted with the recollection of the manner in which he had got the better of his red adversary that he broke out into one of the uncontrollable fits of noisy laughter that are so common to his race i repeated the order somewhat sternly for jaap to cut the cords and then to follow us to the canoe in which the onondago and my two friends had already taken their places my own foot was raised to enter the canoe when i heard heavy stripes inflicted on the back of some one rushing back to the spot where i had left jaap and his captive muss i found the former inflicting a severe punishment on the naked back of the other with the end of the cord that still bound his arms muss as jaap called him neither flinched nor cried the pine stands not more erect or unyielding in a summers noontide than he bore up under the pain indignantly i thrust the negro away cut the fellows bonds with my own hands and drove my slave before me to the canoe  footnote 36 holmess annals say that lord john murray commanded the 42d on this occasion i presume as mr littlepage was there and was posted so near the corps in question he cannot well be mistaken mrs grant of laggan who was at albany at the time and whose father was in the battle agrees with mr littlepage in saying that gordon graham led the 42deditor     chapter xxiv    pale set the sunthe shades of evening fell   the mournful nightwind sung their funeral knell   and the same day beheld their warriors dead   their sovereign captive and their glory fled    mrs hemans   i shall never forget the journey of that fearful night susquesus paddled the canoe unaided by us who were too much fatigued with the toil of the day to labour much as soon as we found ourselves in a place of safety even jaap lay down and slept for several hours the sleep of the weary i do not think any of us however actually slept for the first hour or two the scenes through which we had just passed and that indeed through which we were then passing acting as preventives to such an indulgence  it must have been about nine in the evening when our canoe quitted the illfated shore at the south end of lake george moving steadily and silently along the eastern margin of the sheet by that time fully five hundred boats had departed for the head of the lake the retreat having commenced long before sunset no order was observed in this melancholy procession each batteau moving off as her load was completed all the wounded were on the placid bosom of the holy lake as some writers have termed this sheet of limpid water by the time we ourselves got in motion and the sounds of parting boats told us that the unhurt were following as fast as circumstances would allow  what a night it was there was no moon and a veil of dark vapour was drawn across the vault of the heavens concealing most of the mild summer stars that ought to have been seen twinkling in their creators praise down between the boundaries of hills there was not a breath of air though we occasionally heard the sighings of light currents among the treetops above us the eastern shore having fewer sinuosities than the western most of the boats followed its dark frowning mass as the nearest route and we soon found ourselves near the line of the retiring batteaux i call it the line for though there was no order observed each party making the best of its way to the common point of destination there were so many boats in motion at the same time that far as the eye could penetrate by that gloomy light an unbroken succession of them was visible our motion was faster than that of these heavilyladen and feeblyrowed batteaux the soldiers being too much fatigued to toil at the oars after the day they had just gone through we consequently passed nearly everything and soon got on a parallel course with that of the boats moving along at a few rods inshore of them dirck remarked however that two or three small craft even passed us they went so near the mountain quite within its shadows in fact as to render it difficult to say what they were though it was supposed they might be whaleboats of which there were more than a hundred in the flotilla carrying officers of rank  no one spoke it appeared to me that not a human voice was raised among those humiliated and defeated thousands the plash of oars so long as we were at a distance from the line alone broke the silence of night but that was incessant as our canoe drew ahead however an hour or two after we had left the shore and we overtook the boats that had first started the moaning and groans of the wounded became blended with the monotonous sounds of the oars in two respects these unfortunate men had reason to felicitate themselves notwithstanding their sufferings no army could have transported its wounded with less pain to the hurt and the feverish thirst that loss of blood always induces might be assuaged by the limpid element on which we all floated  after paddling for hours susquesus was relieved by jaap dirck guert and myself occasionally lending our aid each had a paddle and each used it as he saw fit while the onondago slept occasionally i caught a nap myself as did my companions and we all felt refreshed by the rest and sleep at length we reached the narrow pass that separated the upper from the lower lake and we entered the former this is near the place where the islands are so numerous and we were unavoidably made to pass quite close to some of the batteaux i say to some for the line became broken at this point each boat going through the openings it found the most convenient  come nearer with that bark canoe called out an officer from a batteau i wish to learn who is in it  we are volunteers that joined the th the day the army moved up and were guests of major bulstrode pray sir can you tell us where that officer can be found  poor bulstrode he got a very awkward hit early in the day and was taken past me to the rear he will be able neither to walk nor to ride for some months if they save his leg i heard the commanderinchief order him to be sent across the lake in the first boat with wounded and some one told me bulstrode himself expressed an intention to be carried some distance to a friends house to escape from the abominations of an army hospital the fellow has horses enough to transport him on a horselitter to cape horn if he wishes it ill warrant you bulstrode works his way into good quarters if they are to be had in america i suppose this arm of mine will have to come off as soon as we reach fort william henry and that job done i confess i should like amazingly to keep him company proceed gentlemen i hope i have not detained you but observing a bark canoe i thought it my duty to ascertain we were not followed by spies  this then was another victim of war he spoke of the loss of his arm notwithstanding with as much coolness as if it were the loss of a tooth yet i question not that in secret he mourned over the calamity in bitterness of heart men never wear the mask more completely than when excited and stimulated by the rivalry of arms bulstrode too at ravensnest he could be carried nowhere else so easily and should his wound be of a nature that did not require constant medical treatment where could he be so happily bestowed as under the roof of herman mordaunt shall i confess that the idea gave me great pain and that i was fool enough to wish i too could return to anneke and appeal to her sympathies by dragging with me a wounded limb  our canoe now passed quite near another batteau the officer in command of which was standing erect seemingly watching our movements he appeared to be unhurt but was probably intrusted with some special duty as we paddled by the following curious conversation occurred  you move rapidly to the rear my friends observed the stranger pray moderate your zeal others are in advance of you with the evil tidings  you must think ill of our patriotism and loyalty sir to imagine we are hastening on with the intelligence of a check to the british arms i answered as drily and almost as equivocally in manner as the other had spoken  the checki beg a thousand pardonsi see you are patriots and of the purest water check is just the word though checkmate would be more descriptive and significant a charming time weve had of it gentlemen what say youit is your move now  there has been much firmness and gallantry manifested by the troops i answered as we who have been merely volunteers will always be ready to testify  i beg your pardons again and again returned the officer raising his hat and bowing profoundlyi did not know i had the honour to address volunteers you are entitled to superlative respect gentlemen having come voluntarily into such a field for my part i find the honour oppressive having no such supererogatory virtue to boast of volunteers on my word gentlemen you will have many wonders to relate when you get back into the family circle  we shall have to speak of the gallantry of the highlanders for we saw all they did and all they suffered  ah were you then near that brave corps exclaimed the other with something like honest natural feeling for the first time exhibited in his voice and meaning i honour men who were only spectators of so much courage especially if they took a tolerably near view of it may i venture to ask your names gentlemen  i answered giving him our names and mentioning the fact that we had been the guest of bulstrode and how much we were disappointed in having missed not only our friend but his corps  gentlemen i honour courage let it come whence it may said the stranger with strong feeling and no acting and most admire it when i see it exhibited by natives of these colonies in a quarrel of their own i have heard of you as being with poor howe when he fell and hope to know more of you as for mr bulstrode he has passed southward now some hours and intends to make his cure among some connections that he has in this province do not let this be the last of our intercourse i beg of you but look up capt charles lee of the th who will be glad to take each and all of you by the hand when we once more get into camp  we expressed our thanks but susquesus causing the canoe to make a sudden inclination towards the shore the conversation was suddenly interrupted  by this time the indian was awake and exercising his authority in the canoe again gliding among the islands he shortly landed us at the precise point where we had embarked only five days before securing his little bark the onondago led the way up the ravine and brought us out on the naked cap of the mountain where we had before slept after an hour of extreme effort  if the night had been so memorable the picture presented at the dawn of day was not less so we reached that lofty lookout about the same time in the morning as the indian had awakened me on the previous occasion and had the same natural outlines to the view in one sense also the artificial accessaries were the same though exhibited under a very different aspect i presume the truth will not be much if any exceeded when i say that a thousand boats were in sight on this as on the former occasion a few a dozen or so at most appeared to have reached the head of the lake but all the rest of that vast flotilla was scattered along the placid surface of the lovely sheet forming a long straggling line of dark spots that extended to the beach under fort william henry in one direction and far as eye could reach in the other how different did that melancholy broken procession of boats appear from the gallant array the martial bands the cheerful troops and the multitude of ardent young men who had pressed forward in brigades less than a week before filled with hope and exulting in their strength as i gazed on the picture i could not but fancy to myself the vast amount of physical pain the keen mental suffering and the deep mortification that might have been found amid that horde of returning adventurers we had just come up from the level of this scene of human agony and our imaginations could portray details that were beyond the reach of the senses at the elevation on which we stood  a week before and the name of abercrombie filled every mouth in america expectation had almost placed his renown on that giddy height where performance itself is so often insecure in the brief interval he was destroyed those who had been ready to bless him would now heap curses on his devoted head and none would be so bold as to urge aught in his favour men in masses when goaded by disappointment are never just it is indeed a hard lesson for the individual to acquire but released from his close personal responsibility the single man follows the crowd and soothes his own mortification and wounded pride by joining in the cry that is to immolate a victim yet abercrombie was not the foolhardy and besotted bully that braddock had proved himself to be his misfortune was to be ignorant of the warfare of the region in which he was required to serve and possibly to overestimate the imaginary invincible character of the veterans he led in a very short time he was recalled and america heard no more of him as some relief to the disgrace that had anew alighted on the british arms bradstreet a soldier who knew the country and who placed much reliance on the young man of her name and family whom i had met at madam schuylers marched against frontenac in canada at the head of a strong body of provincials an enterprise that as it was conducted with skill resulted in a triumph  but with all this my narrative has no proper connection no sooner did we reach the bald mountaintop than the onondago directed jaap to light a fire while he produced from a deposit left on the advance certain of the materials that were necessary to a meal as neither of us had tasted food since the morning of the previous day this repast was welcome and we all partook of it like so many famished men the negro got his share of course and then we called a council as to future proceedings  the question is whether we ought to make a straight path to ravensnest observed guert or proceed first to the surveyors and see how things are going on in that direction  as there can be no great danger of a pursuit on the part of the french since all their boats are in the other lake i remarked the state of the country is very much what it was before the army moved  ask that question of the indian put in dirck a little significantly  we looked at susquesus inquiringly for a look always sufficed to let him comprehend us when a tolerably plain allusion had been previously made  blackman do foolish ting observed the onondago  what i do you redskin devil demanded jaap who felt a sort of natural antipathy to all indians good or bad excellent or indifferent a feeling that the indians repaid to his race by contempt indifferently concealed what i do reddevil hadat you dares tell masser corny dat  susquesus manifested no resentment at this strong and somewhat rude appeal but sat as motionless as if he had not heard it this vexed jaap so much the more and my fellow being exceedingly pugnacious on all occasions that touched his pride there might have been immediate war between the two had i not raised a finger at once effectually stilling the outbreak of jacob satanstoes wrath  you should not bring such a charge against my slave onondago i said unless able to prove it  he beat red warrior like dog  what of dat growled jaap who was only halfquieted by my sign who ebber hear it hurt redskin to ropeend him  warrior back like squaws blow hurt him he never forget  well let him remember den grinned the negro showing his ivory teeth from ear to ear muss was my prisoner and what good he do me if he let go widout punishment i wish you tell masser corny dat instead of tellin him nonsense when he flog me who ebber hear me grumble  you have not had half enough of it jaap or your manners would be better i thought it necessary to put in for the fellow had never before manifested so quarrelsome a disposition in my presence most probably because i had never before seen him at variance with an indian let me hear no more of this or i shall be obliged to pay off the arrears on the spot  a little hiding does a nigger good sometimes observed guert significantly  i observed that dirck who loved my very slave principally because he was mine looked at the offender reprovingly and by these combined demonstrations we succeeded in curbing the fellows tongue  well susquesus i added we all listen to hear what you mean  musquerusque chiefhuron chiefgot very tender back never forget rope  you mean us to understand that my blacks prisoner will be apt to make some attempt to revenge himself for the flogging he got from his captor  just so indian good memoryno forget friendno forget enemy  but your huron will be puzzled to find us onondago he will suppose us with the army and should he even venture to look for us there you see he will be disappointed  never know wood full of pathsinjin full of cunning why talk of ravensnest  was the name of ravensnest mentioned in the presence of that huron i asked more uneasy than such a trifle would probably have justified me in confessing  ay something was said about it but not in a way the fellow could understand answered guert carelessly let him come on if he has not had enough of us yet  this was not my manner of viewing the matter however for the mentioning of ravensnest brought anneke to my mind surrounded by the horrors of an indians revenge  i will send you back to the huron susquesus i added if you can name to me the price that will purchase his forgiveness  the onondago looked at me meaningly a moment then bending forward he passed the forefinger of his hand around the head of jaap along the line that is commonly made by the knife of the warrior as he cuts away the trophy of success from his victim jaap comprehended the meaning of this very significant gesture as well as any of us and the manner in which he clutched the wool as if to keep the scalp in its place set us all laughing the negro did not partake of our mirth but i saw that he regarded the indian much as the bulldog shows his teeth before he makes his spring another motion of my finger however quelled the rising it was necessary to put an end to this and jaap was ordered to prepare our packs in readiness for the expected march relieved from his presence susquesus was asked to be more explicit  you know injin the onondago answered now he tink redcoats driv away and skeared he go look for scalp love all sort scalpold scalp young scalpman scalp woman scalpboy scalp gal scalpall get pay all get honour no difference to him  ay exclaimed guert with a strong aspiration such as escapes a man who feels strongly he is a devil incarnate when he once gets fairly on the scent of blood so you expect these french injins will make an excursion in among the settlers out here to the southeast of us  go to nearestdont care where he be nearest your friend wont like that spose  you are right enough onondago in saying that i shall not like it nor will my companions here like it and the first thing you will have to do will be to guide us straight as the bird flies to the ravensnest the picketed house you know where we have left our sweethearts  susquesus understood all that was said without any difficulty in proof of which he smiled at this allusion to the precious character of the inmates of the house guert told him to seek  squaw pretty nough he answered complacently no wonder young man like him but cant go there now first find friends measure land all injin land once  this last remark was made in a way i did not like for the idea seemed to cross the onondagos brain so suddenly as to draw from him this brief assertion in pure bitterness of spirit  i should be very sorry if it had not been susquesus i observed myself since the title is all the better for its having been so as our indian deed will show you know of course that my father and his friend col follock bought this land of the mohawks and paid them their own price for it  redman nebber measure land so he pint with finger break bush down and say there take from that water to that water  all very true my friend but as that sort of measurement will not answer to keep farms separate we are obliged to survey the whole off into lots of smaller size the mohawks first gave my father and his friend as much land as they could walk round in two suns allowing them the night to rest in  that good deed exclaimed the indian with strong emphasis leg cant cheatpen great rogue  well we have the benefit of both grants for the proprietors actually walked round the estate a party of indians accompanying them to see that all was fair after that the chiefs signed a deed in writing that there might be no mistake and then we got the kings grant  who give king land at allall land here redman land who give him to king  who made the delawares womenthe warriors of he six nations was it not susquesus  yesmy people help six nation great warrior and put petticoat on delawares so they cant go on warpath any more what that to do with kings land  why the kings warriors you know my friend have taken possession of this country just as the six nations took possession of the delawares before they made them women  what become of kings warrior now demanded the indian quick as lightning where he run away to where land ticonderoga now whose land tother end lake now  why the kings troops have certainly met with a disaster and for the present their rights are weakened it must be admitted but another day may see all this changed and the king will got his land again you will remember he has not sold ticonderoga to the french as the mohawks sold mooseridge to us and that you must admit makes a great difference a bargain is a bargain onondago  yes bargain bargainthat good good for redman good for palefaceno differencewhat mohawk sell he no take back but let paleface keepbut how come mohawk and king sell too bot own land eh  this was rather a puzzling question to answer to an indian we white people can very well understand that a human government which professes on the principles recognised by civilized nations to have jurisdiction over certain extensive territories that lie in the virgin forest and which are used only and that occasionally by certain savage tribes as huntinggrounds should deem it right to satisfy those tribes by purchase before they parcelled out their lands for the purposes of civilized life but it would not be so easy to make an unsophisticated mind understand that there could be two owners to the same property the transaction is simple enough to us and it tells in favour of our habits for we have the power to grant these lands without extinguishing the indian title as it is termed but it presents difficulties to the understandings of those who are not accustomed to see society surrounded by the multifarious interests of civilization in point of fact the indian purchases give no other title under our laws than the right to sue out in council a claim to acquire by the grant of the crown paying to the latter such a consideration as in its wisdom it shall see fit to demand still it was necessary to make some answer to the onondagos question lest he might carry away the mistaken notion that we did not justly own our possessions  suppose you find a rifle to your fancy susquesus i said after reflecting a moment on the subject and you find two indians who both claim to own it now if you pay each warrior his price is your right to the title any the worse for having done so is it not rather better  the indian was struck with this reply which suited the character of his mind thrusting out his hand he received mine and shook it cordially as much as to say he was satisfied having disposed of this episode thus satisfactorily we turned to the more interesting subject of our immediate movements  it would seem that the onondago expects the french indians will now strike at the settlements i remarked to my companions and that our friends at ravensnest may need our aid but at the same time he thinks we should first return to mooseridge and join the surveyors which mode of proceeding strikes you as the best my friends  let us first hear the injins reasons for going after the surveyors answered guert if he has a sufficient reason for his plan i am ready to follow it  surveyor got scalp as well as squaw said susquesus in his brief meaning manner  that must settle the point exclaimed guert i understand it all now the onondago thinks the mooseridge party may be cut off as being alone and unsupported and that we ought to apprise them of this danger  all perfectly just i replied and it is what they being our own people have a right to expect from us still guert i should think those surveyors might be safe where they are in the bosom of the forest for a year to come their business there cannot be known and who is then to betray them  see said susquesus earnestly kill deer and leave him in the wood wont raven find carcass  that may be true enough but a raven has an instinct given him by nature to furnish him with food he flies high in the air moreover and can see farther than an indian  nuttin see farther than injin redman fly high too see from salt lake to sweet water know ebbery ting in wood tell him nuttin he dont know  you do not suppose susquesus that the huron warriors could find our surveyors at mooseridge  why no find him find moose why no find ridge too find mooseridge sartain find landmeasurer  on the whole corny guert remarked after musing a little we may do well to follow the injins advice i have heard of so many misfortunes that have befallen people in the bush from having despised indian counsels that i own to a little superstition on the subject just look at what happened yesterday had redskin opinions been taken abercrombie might now have been a conqueror instead of a miserable beaten man  susquesus raised a finger and his dark countenance became illumined by an expression that was more eloquent even than his tongue  why no open ear to redman he asked with dignity some bird sing a song that goodsome sing bad songbut all bird know his own song mohawk warrior use to wood and follow a crooked warpath when he meet much enemy great yengeese chief think his warrior have two life that he put him before cannon and rifle to stand up and be shot no injin do so foolishnonever  as this was too true to be controverted the matter was not discussed but having determined among ourselves to let the onondago take us back on the path by which we had come we announced our readiness to start as soon as it might suit his convenience being sufficiently rested susquesus who did everything on system manifesting neither impatience nor laziness arose and quietly led the way our course was just the reverse of that on which we had travelled when we left mooseridge and i did not fail to observe that so accurate was the knowledge of our guide we passed many of the same objects as we had previously gone near there was nothing like a track with the exception of occasional footprints left by ourselves but it was evident the onondago paid not the least attention to these possessing other and more accessible clues to his course  guert marched next to the indian and i was third in the line how often that busy day did i gaze at my fileleader in admiration of his figure and mien nature appeared to have intended him for a soldier although so powerful his frame was agilea particular in which he differed from dirck who although so young already gave symptoms of heaviness at no distant day then guerts carriage waa as fine as his form the head was held erect the eye was intrepid in its glance and the tread elastic though so firm to the last hour on that long and weary march guert leaped logs sprang across hollows in the ground and otherwise manifested that his iron sinews and hardened muscles retained all their powers as he moved in my front i saw for the first time that some of the fringe of his huntingshirt had been cut away in the fight and that a musketball had passed directly through his cap i afterwards ascertained that guert was aware of these escapes but his nature was so manly he did not think of mentioning them  we made a single halt as before to dine but little was said at this meal and no change in our plan was proposed this was the point where we ought to have diverged from the former course did we intend to proceed first to ravensnest but though all knew it nothing was said on the subject  we shall carry unwelcome tidings to mr traverse and his men guert observed a minute or two before our halt was up for i take it for granted the news cannot have gone ahead of us  we first answered the onondago too soon for huron yet tink sonobody know  i wish corny pursued the albanian we had thought of saying a word to doortje about this accursed expedition there is no use in a mans being above his business and he who puts himself in the way of fortune might profit by now and then consulting a fortuneteller  had we done so and had all that has happened been foretold do you suppose it would have made any change in the result  perhaps not since we should have been the persons to relate what we had heard but abercrombie himself need have had no scruples about visiting that remarkable old woman shes a wonderful creature corny as we must allow and a prudent general would not fail to respect what she told him it is a thousand pities that either the commanderinchief or the adjutantgeneral had not paid doortje a visit before they left albany my lord howes valuable life might then have been saved  in what way guert i am at a loss to see in what manner any good could come of it  in what mannerwhy in the plainest possible now suppose doortje had foretold this defeat it is clear abercrombie if he put any faith in the old woman would not have made the attack  and thus defeat the defeat do you not see guert that the soothsayer can at the best but foretell what is to happen and that which must come will it would be an easy matter for any of us to get great reputations for fortunetelling if all we had to do was to predict misfortunes in order that our friends might avoid them as nothing would ever happen in consequence of the precautions taken to avert the evils a name would be easily and cheaply maintained  by st nicholas corny i never thought of that but you have been collegetaught and a thousand things are picked up at colleges that one never dreams of at an academy i see reason every day to lament my idleness when a boy and fortunate shall i be if i do not lament it all my life  poor guert he was always so humble when the subject of education arose however accidentally or unintentionally on my part that it was never commented on that it did not give me pain exciting a wish to avoid it as the time for the halt was now up it was easy to terminate the present discussion by declaring as much and proceeding on our way  we had a hard afternoons walk of it though neither of the five manifested the least disposition to give in as for susquesus to me he never seemed to know either fatigue or hunger he was doubtless acquainted with both but his habits of selfcommand were so severe as to enable him completely to conceal his sufferings in this as well as in most other respects  the sun was near setting when we entered within the limits of the mooseridge estate we ascertained this fact by passing the linetrees some of which had figures cut into their barks to denote the numbers of the great subdivisions of the property guert pointed out these marks being far more accustomed to the woods than either dirck or myself aided by such guides we had no difficulty in making a sufficiently straight course to the hut  susquesus thought a little caution necessary as we drew near to the end of our journey causing us to remain behind he advanced in front himself to reconnoitre a signal however soon took us to the place where he stood when we discovered the hut just as we had left it but no one near it this might be the result of mere accident the surveying party frequently camping out in preference to making a long march after a fatiguing days work and pete would be very likely to prefer going to join these men to remaining alone in the hut we advanced to the building therefore with confidence on reaching it we found the place empty as had been anticipated though with every sign about it of its tenants having left it but a short time previously that morning at the furthest  jaap set about preparing a supper out of the regular supplies of the party all of which were found in their places and in abundance on inquiry of the fellow i ascertained it was his opinion mr traverse had gone off that very day most probably to some distant portion of the patent taking pete with him as everything was covered up and put away with that sort of care that denotes an absence of some little time the indian heard the negros remark to this effect and tossing his head significantly he said  no need guessgo seelight enoughplenty time injin soon tell  he quitted the hut on the spot and immediately set about this selfassigned duty     chapter xxv    thou tremblest and the whiteness in thy cheek   is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand    shakspeare   curiosity induced me to follow the indian in order to watch his movements susquesus proceeded a short distance from the hut quitting the knoll entirely until he reached lower land where a footprint would be most likely to be visible when he commenced a slow circuit of the place with eyes fastened on the earth as the nose of the hound follows the scent i was so much interested in the onondagos manner as to join him fallingin in his rear in order not to interfere with his object  of footmarks there were plenty more particularly on the low moist ground where we were but they all appeared to me to have no interest with the indian most of our party wore moccasins and it was not easy to see how under such circumstances and amid such a maze of impressions it could be possible for any one to distinguish a hostile from a friendly trail that susquesus thought the thing might be done however was very evident by his perseverance and his earnestness  at first my companion met with no success or with nothing that he fancied success but after making half the circuit of the hut keeping always a hundred yards distant from it he suddenly stopped stooped quite to the earth then arose and sticking a broken knot into the ground as a mark he signed to me to keep a little on one side while he turned at right angles to his former course and moved inwards towards our dwelling i followed slowly watching his movements step by step  in this manner we reached the hut deviating from a direct line in order to do so at the hut itself susquesus made a long and minute examination but even i could see that the marks here were so numerous as to baffle even him after finishing his search at this point the indian turned and went back to the place where he had stuck the knot in the ground in doing this however he followed his own trail returning by precisely the same deviating course as that by which he had come this alone would have satisfied me that he saw more than i did for to own the truth i could not have done the same thing  when we reached the knot susquesus followed that to me invisible trail outside of the circle leading off into the forest in a direct line from the hut and spring i continued near him although neither had spoken during the whole of this examination which had now lasted quite half an hour as it was getting dark however and jaap showed the signal that our supper was ready i thought it might be well at length to break the silence  what do you make of all this trackless i inquired do you find any signs of a trail  good trailsusquesus answered new trail too look like huron  this was startling intelligence certainly yet much as i was disposed to defer to my companions intelligence in such matters in general i thought he must be mistaken in his fact in the first place though i had seen many footprints near the hut and along the low land on which the indian made his circuit i could see none where we then were i mentioned this to the indian and desired him to show me particularly one of the signs which had led him to his conclusion  see said susquesus stooping so low as to place a finger on the dead leaves that ever make a sort of carpet to the forest here been moccasinthat heel this toe  aided in this manner i could discover a faint footprint which might by aid of the imagination be thus read though the very slight impression that was to be traced might almost as well be supposed anything else as it seemed to me  i see what you mean susquesus and i allow it may be a footprint i answered but then it may also have been left by anything else which has touched the ground just at that spot it may have been made by a falling branch of a tree  where branch asked the indian quick as lightning  sure enough that is more than i can tell you but i cannot suppose that a huron footprint without more evidence than you now give  what you call thatthisthattother added the indian stepping quickly back and pointing to four other similar but very faint impressions on the leaves no see him ehjust leg apart too  this was true enough and now my attention was thus directed and my senses were thus aided i confess i did discover certain proofs of footsteps that would otherwise have baffled my most serious search  i can see what you mean susquesus i said and will allow that this line of impressions or marks does make them look more like footsteps at any rate most of our party wear moccasins as well as the redmen and how do you know that some of the surveyors have not passed this way  surveyor no make such mark toe turn in  this was true too but it did not follow that a footprint was a hurons merely because it was indian then where were the enemys warriors to come from in so short a time as had intervened between the late battle and the present moment there was little question all the forces of the french paleface and redman had been collected at ticonderoga to meet the english and the distance was so great as almost to render it impossible for a party to reach this spot so soon coming from the vicinity of the fortress after the occurrence of the late events did not the lake interpose an obstacle i might have inferred that parties of skirmishers would be thrown on the flanks of the advancing army thus bringing foes within a lessened distance of us but there was the lake affording a safe approach for more than thirty miles and rendering the employment of any such skirmishers useless all this occurred to me at the moment and i mentioned it to my companion as an argument against his own supposition  no true answered susquesus shaking his head that trailhe huron trail too dont know redman to say so  but redmen are human as well as palefaces it must be seventy miles from this spot to the foot of lake george and your conjecture would make it necessary that a party should have travelled that distance in less than twentyfour hours and be here some time before us  we no travel him eh  i grant you that trackless but we came a long bit of the road in a canoe each and all of us sleeping and resting ourselves in turns these hurons must have come the whole distance by land  no so huron paddle canoe well as onondago lake therecanoe plenty why not come  do you suppose trackless that any of the french indians would venture on the lake while it was covered with our boats as was the case last night  what our boat good for eh carry wounded warriorcarry runaway warriorwhat he care tink huron fraid of boat boat got eye eh boat see boat hear boat shoot eh  perhaps not but those who were in the boats can do all this and would be apt at least to speak to a strange canoe  boat speak my canoe eh onondago canoe strange canoe too  all this was clear enough when i began to reflect on it it was certainly possible for a canoe with two or three paddles to go the whole length of the lake in much less time than we had employed in going twothirds of the distance and a party landing in the vicinity of williamhenry could certainly have reached the spot where we then were several hours sooner than we had reached it ourselves still there existed all the other improbabilities on my side of the question it was improbable that a party should have proceeded in precisely this manner it was still more improbable that such a party coming on a warpath from a distant part of the country should know exactly where to find our hut after a moments pause and while we both slowly proceeded to join our companion i suggested these objections to the onondago  dont know injin answered the other betraying more earnestness of manner than was usual with him when he condescended to discuss any of the usages of the tribes with a paleface he fight first then he want scalp ever see dead horse in woodwell no crow there eh plenty crow isnt he just so injin wounded soldier carry off and injin watch in wood behind army to get scalp scalp good after battle want him very much wood full of huron along path to albany yengeese down in heart huron up scalp so good tink of nuttin else  by this time we had reached the hut where i found guert and dirck already at their supper i will own that my appetite was not as good as it might have been but for the onondagos conjectures and discoveries though i took a seat and began to eat with my friends while at the meal i communicated to my companions all that had passed particularly asking of guert who had a respectable knowledge of the bush what he thought of the probabilities of the case  if hostile redskins have really been here lately the albanian answered they have been thoroughly cunning devils for not an article in or about the hut has been disturbed i had an eye to that myself the moment we arrived for i have thought it far from unlikely that the hurons would be out on the road between williamhenry and the settlements trying to get scalps from the parties that would be likely to be sent to the rear with wounded officers  in which case our friend bulstrode might be in danger  he must take his chance like all of us but he will probably be carried to ravensnest as the nearest nest for him to nestle in i dont half like this trail however corny it is seldom a redskin of the onondagos character makes a mistake in such a matter  it is too late now to do anything tonight dirck observed besides i dont think any great calamity is likely to befall any of us or doortje would have dropped some hint about it these fortunetellers seldom let anything serious pass without a notice of some sort or other you see corny we went through all this business at ty without a scratch which is so much in favour of the old womans being right  poor dirck that prediction had made a deep impression on his character and on his future life a mans faith must be strong to fancy that a negative of this nature could carry with it any of the force of a positive affirmative prediction nevertheless dirck had spoken the truth in one respect it was too late to do anything that night and it only remained to prepare to take our rest as securely as possible  we consulted on the subject calling on the indian to aid us after talking the matter over it was determined to remain where we were securing the door and bringing everybody within the building for the negroes and the indians had been much in the habit of sleeping about under brush covers that they had erected for themselves it was thought that having once visited the hut and finding it empty the enemy if enemy there were would not be very likely to return to it immediately and that wo might consider our selves as comparatively safe from that circumstance alone then there were all the chances that the trail might have been left by friendly instead of hostile indians although susquesus shook his head in the negative whenever this was mentioned at all events we had but a choice of three expedientsto abandon the patent and seek safety in flight to camp out or to shut ourselves up in our fortress of the first no one thought for a moment and of the two others we decided on the last as far the most comfortable and on the whole as the safest  an hour after we had come to this determination i question if either of the five knew anything about it i never slept more profoundly in my life and my companions subsequently gave the same account of their several conditions fatigue and youth and health gave us all refreshing sleep and as we lay down at nine two oclock came after so much time totally lost in the way of consciousness i say two oclock for my watch told me that was just the hour when the indian awoke me by shaking my shoulder one gets the habits of watchfulness in the woods and i was on my feet in an instant  dark as it was for it was deep night i could distinguish that susquesus was alone stirring and that he had unbarred the door of our cabin indeed he passed through that open space into the air of the forest the moment he perceived i was conscious of what i was about without pausing to reflect i followed and soon stood at his side some fifteen or twenty feet from the hut  this good place to hear said the indian in a low suppressed tone now open ear  what a scene was that which now presented itself to my senses i can see it at this distance of time after years of peaceful happiness and years of toil and adventure the morning or it might be better to say the night was not very dark in itself but the gloom of the woods being added to the obscurity of the hour it lent an intensity of blackness to the trunks of the trees that gave to each a funereal and solemn aspect it was impossible to see for any distance and the objects that were visible were only those that were nearest at hand notwithstanding one might imagine the canopied space beneath the tops of the trees and fancy it in the majesty of its gloomy vastness of sounds there were literally none when the indian first bade me listen the stillness was so profound that i thought i heard the sighing of the night air among the upper branches of the loftier trees this might have been mere imagination nevertheless all above the summits of the giant oaks maples and pines formed a sort of upper world as regarded us a world with which we had little communication during our sojourn in the woods below the raven and the eagle and the hawk sailed in that region above the clouds of leaves beneath them and occasionally stooped perhaps to strike their quarry but to all else it was inaccessible and to a degree invisible  but my present concern is with the world i was in and what a world it was solemn silent dark vast and mysterious i listened in vain to catch the footstep of some busy squirrel for the forest was alive with the smaller animals by night quite as much as by day but everything at that moment seemed stilled to the silence of death  i can hear nothing trackless i whisperedwhy are you out here  you hear soonwake me up and i hear twice soon come agin  it did soon come again it was a human cry escaping from human lips in their agony i heard it once only but should i live to be a hundred it would not be forgotten i often hear it in my sleep and twenty times have i awoke since fancying that agonizing call was in my ears it was long loud piercing and the word help was as distinct as tongue could make it  great god i exclaimedsome one is set upon and calls for aid in his extremity let us arouse our friends and go to his assistance i cannot remain here susquesus with such a cry in my ears  best go tink too answered the onondago no need call though two better than four stop minute  i did remain stationary that brief space listening with agonized uncertainty while the indian entered the hut and returned bringing out his rifle and my own arming ourselves and shutting the door of the cabin to exclude the nightair at least susquesus led off with his noiseless step in a southwest direction or that in which we had heard the sound  our march was too swift and earnest to admit of discourse the onondago had admonished me to make as little noise as possible and between the anxiety i felt and the care taken to comply there was indeed but little opportunity for conversing my feelings were wrought up to a high pitch but my confidence in my companion being great i followed in his footsteps as diligently as my skill would allow susquesus rather trod on air than walked yet i kept close at his heels until we had gone as i should think fully half a mile in the direction from which that awful cry had come here susquesus halted saying to me in a low voice  no far from herebest stop  i submitted in all things to the directions of my indian guide the latter had selected the dark shadows of two or three young pines for our cover where by getting within their low branches we were completely concealed from any eye that was distant from us eight or ten feet no sooner were we thus posted than the onondago pointed to the trunk of a fallen tree and we took our seats silently on it i observed that my companion kept his thumb on the cock of his rifle while his forefinger was passed around the trigger it is scarcely necessary to say that i observed the same precaution  this good said susquesus in a voice so low and soft that it could not attract more attention than a whisper this very goodhear him agin soon then know  a stifled groan was heard and that almost as soon as my companion ceased to speak i felt my blood curdle at these frightful evidences of human suffering and an impulse of humanity caused me to move as if about to rise the hand of trackless checked the imprudence  no good he said sternly sit still warrior know how to sit still  but heavenly providence there is some one in agony quite near us man did you not hear a groan trackless  to be sure hear himwhat of that pain make groan come alway from paleface  you think then it is a whiteman who suffers if so it must be one of our party as there is no one else near us if i hear it again i must go to his relief onondago  why you behave like squaw what of little groan sartain he paleface injin never groan on warpath why he groan you tink cause huron meet him that reason he groan you groan too no sit still injin know time to shootknow time not to shoot  i had every disposition to call aloud to inquire who needed succour yet the admonitions of my companion aided as they were by the gloomy mysteries of that vast forest in the hour of deepest night enabled me to command the impulse three times notwithstanding was that groan repeated and as it appeared to me each time more and more faintly i thought too when all was still in the forestwhen we sat ourselves in breathless expectation of what might next reach our earsattentive to each sighing of the nightair and distrustful even of the rustling leafthat the last groan of all though certainly the faintest of any we had heard was much the nearest once indeed i heard or fancied i heard the word water murmured in a low smothered tone almost in my ear i thought too i knew the voice that it was familiar to me though i could not decide in the state of my feelings exactly to whom it belonged  in this manner we passed what to me were two of the most painful hours of my life waiting the slow return of light my own impatience was nearly ungovernable though the indian sat the whole of that time seemingly as insensible as the log which formed his seat and almost as motionless at length this intensely anxious and even physically painful watch drew near its end signs of day gleamed through the canopy of leaves and the rays of dull light appeared to struggle downward rendering objects dimly discernible  it was not long ere we could ascertain that we had so completely covered ourselves as to be in a position where the branches of the pines completely shut out the view of objects beyond this was favourable to reconnoitring however previously to quitting our concealment and enabled us to have some care of ourselves while attending to the duties of humanity  susquesus used the greatest caution in looking around before he left the cover i was close at his side peeping through such openings as offered for my curiosity was so intense that i almost forgot the causes for apprehension it was not long before i heard the familiar indian interjection hugh from my companion a proof that something had caught his eye of a more than ordinarily exciting character he pointed in the way i was to look and there indeed i beheld one of those frightful instances of barbarous cruelty that the usages of savage warfare have sanctioned as far back as our histories extend among the forest warriors of this continent the tops of two saplings had been brought down near each other by main force the victims hands attached firmly to upper branches of each and the trees permitted to fly back to their natural positions or as near them as the revolting means of junction would allow i could scarce believe my senses when my sight first revealed the truth but there hung the victim suspended by his arms at an elevation of at least ten or fifteen feet from the earth i confess i sincerely hoped he was dead and the motionless attitude of the body gave me reason to think it might be so still the cries for help uttered wildly hopelessly in the midst of a vast and vacant forest the groans extorted by suffering must have been his he had probably been thus suspended and abandoned while alive  even the onondago could not restrain me after i fully saw and understood the nature of the cruelty which had been exercised on the miserable victim who was thus suspended directly before my eyes and i broke out of the cover ready i am willing to confess to pull trigger on the first hostile redman i saw fortunately for myself most probably the place had long been deserted as the back of the sufferer was towards me i could not tell who he was but his dress was coarse and of the description that belongs to the lowest class blood had flowed freely from his head and i made no doubt he had been scalped though the height at which he hung and the manner in which his head had fallen forward upon his breast prevented me front ascertaining the fact at once by the aid of sight thus much did i perceive however ere the indian joined me  see said susquesus whose quick eye never let anything escape it long told you so huron been here  as this was said the indian pointed significantly at the naked skin which was visible between the heavy coarse shoes of the victim and the trowsers he wore when i discovered it was black moving quickly in front so as to get a view of the face i recognised the distorted features of petrus or pete guert ten eycks negro this man had been left with the surveyors it will be remembered and he had either fallen into the hands of his captors while at the hut engaged in his ordinary duties or he had been met in the forest while going to or coming from those he served and had thus been treated we never ascertained the facts which remain in doubt to this hour  give me your tomahawk trackless i cried as soon as horror would permit me to speak that i may cut down this sapling and liberate the unfortunate creature  no goodbetter so answered the indian bearwolf cant get him now let blackskin hanggood as buryno safe stay here long look round and count huron then go  look round and count the hurons i thought to myself and in what manner is this to be done by this time however it was sufficiently light to see footprints if any there were and the onondago set about examining such traces of what had passed at that terrible spot as might be intelligible to one of his experience  at the foot of a huge oak that grew a few yards from the fatal saplings we found the two wooden covered pails in which we knew pete had been accustomed to carry food to mr traverse and the chainbearers they were empty but whether the provisions they unquestionably had contained fell to the share of those for whom they were intended or to that of the captors we never learned no traces of bones potatoskins or other fragments were discovered and if the hurons had seized the provisions they doubtless transferred them to their own repositories without stopping to eat susquesus detected proof that the victim had been seated at the foot of the oak and that he had been seized at that spot there were the marks of many feet there and some proofs of a slight scuffle blood too was to be traced on the leaves from the foot of the oak to the place where poor pete was suspended a proof that he had been hurt previously to being abandoned to his cruel fate  but the point of most interest with trackless was to ascertain the number of our foes this might be done in some measure according to his view of the matter by means of the footprints there was no want of such signs the leaves being much disturbed in places though after a short but anxious search my companion thought it wisest to repair to the hut lest those it contained might be surprised in their sleep he gave me to understand that the enemy did not appear to be numerous at that spot three or four at most though it was quite possible nay highly probable that they had separated and that their whole force was not present at this miserable scene  it was broad daylight when we came in sight of the hut again and i perceived jaap was up and busy with his pots and kettles near the spring no one else was visible and we inferred that guert and dirck were still on their pallets we took a long and distrustful survey of the forest around the cabin from the height where we stood ere we ventured to approach it any nearer discovering no signs of danger and the forest being quite clear of underbrush or cover of any sort large trees excepted for some distance from the hut we then advanced without apprehension this open character of the woods near our dwelling was felt to be a very favourable circumstance rendering it impossible for an enemy to get very near us by daylight without being seen it was owing to the fact that we had used so much of the smaller timber in our own operations while the negroes had burned most of the underbrush for fuel  sure enough i found my two friends fast asleep and certainly much exposed when aroused and told all that had occurred to me and the indian their surprise was great nor was their horror less jaap who missing us on rising supposed we had gone in pursuit of game had followed us into the hut and heard my communications his indignation was great at the idea of one of his own colours being thus treated and i heard him vowing vengeance between his set teeth in terms that were by no means measured  by st nicholas exclaimed guert who had now finished dressing and who accompanied me out into the open air m my poor fellow shall be revenged if the rifle will do it scalped too do you say corny  as far as we could ascertain suspended as he was from the tree but scalped he must be as an indian never permits a dead captive to escape this mutilation  and you have been out in the forest three hours you tell me cornyyou and trackless  about that time i should judge the heart must have been of stone that could resist those cries  i do not blame you littlepage though it would have been kinder and wiser had you taken your friends with you we must stick together in future let what may happen poor petrus i wonder doortje should have hinted nothing of that niggers fate  we then held a long consultation on the subject of our mode of proceeding next it is unnecessary to dwell on this conference as its conclusions will be seen in the events of the narrative but it was brought to a close by a very sudden interruption and that was the sound of an axe in the forest the blows came in the direction of the scene of petes murder and we had collected our rifles and were preparing to move towards the suspected point when we saw jaap staggering along coming to the hut beneath the load of his friends body the fellow had stolen away unseen on this pious duty and had executed it with success in a minute or two he reached the spring and began to wash away the revolting remains of the massacre from the head of the hurons victim  we now ascertained that poor pete had been badly cut by knives as well as scalped and suspended in the manner related both arms appeared to be dislocated and the only relief to our feelings was in the hope that an attempt to inflict so much suffering must have soon defeated itself guert in particular expressed his hope that such was the case though the awful sounds of the past night were still too fresh in my ears to enable me to believe all i could wish on that subject a grave was dug and we buried the body at once rolling a large log or two on the spot in order to prevent wild beasts from disinterring it jaap worked hard in the performance of these rites and guert ten eyck actually repeated the lords prayer and the creed over the grave when the body was placed in it with a fervour and earnestness that a little surprised me  he was but a nigger corny it is true said the albanian a little apologetically perhaps after all was over but he was a very goot nigger in the first place then he had a soul as well as a white manpete had his merits as well as a tominie and i trust they will not be forgotten in the last great account he was an excellent cook as you must have seen and i never knew a nigger that had more of the doglike fidelity to his master the fellow never got into a frolic without coming honestly to ask leave though to be sure i was not a hard master in these particulars on reasonable occasions  we next ate our breakfasts with as much appetite as we could shouldering our packs and placing all around and in the hut as much as possible in the condition in which we had found the place we then commenced our march susquesus leading as usual  we went in quest of the surveyors who were supposed to be in the southeast corner of the patent employed as usual and ignorant of all that had passed at first we had thought of discharging our rifles as signals to bring them in but these signals might apprize our enemies as well as our friends of our presence and the distance was too great moreover to render it probable the reports could be heard by those for whom alone they would be intended  the route we took was determined by our general knowledge of the quarter of the patent in which the surveyors ought now to be as well as by the direction in which the body of pete had been found the poor fellow was certainly either going to or coming from the party and being in constant communication with them he doubtless knew where they were at work then the different trails of the surveyors were easily enough found by trackless and he told us that the most recent led off in the direction i have named towards the southeast therefore we held our way marching as before in indian file the onondago leading and the negro bringing up the rear     chapter xxvi    tis too horrible   the weariest and most loathed worldly life   that age ache penury and imprisonment   can lay on nature is a paradise   to what we fear of death    measure for measure   we were not long in reaching the point of the patent in which the surveyors had been at work after which we could have but little difficulty in finding their present actual position the marked trees were guides that told the whole story of their labours for an hour and a half however we moved rapidly forward susquesus on the lead silent earnest watchful and i fear i must add revengeful not a syllable had been uttered during the whole of that time though our senses were keenly on the alert and we avoided everything like a cover that might conceal an ambush suddenly the indian halted at the next instant he was behind a tree each of us imitated him quick as thought for this was our previous training in the event of encountering an enemy and we all well knew the importance of a cover in forest warfare still no foe could be seen after examining around us in every direction for a minute or two and finding the woods vacant and silent as ever guert and i quitted our own trees and joined the trackless at the foot of his own huge pine  why this susquesus demanded the albanian sharply for he began to suspect a little acting got up to magnify the indians usefulness here is neither paleface nor redskin have done with this folly and let us go forward  no goodwarrior been here prhaps gone prhaps no soon see open eye and look  as a gesture accompanied this speech we did look again and this time in the right direction at the distance of a hundred yards from us was a chestnut that might be seen from its roots to its branches on the ground partly concealed by the tree and partly exposed was the leg of a man placed as the limb would be apt to lie on the supposition that its owner lay on his back asleep it showed a moccasin and the usual legging of an indian but the thigh and all the rest of the frame was concealed the quick eye of the onondago had caught this small object even at that distance comprehended it at a glance when he instantly sought a cover as described guert and i had some difficulty at first even after it was pointed out to us in recognising this object but it soon became distinct and intelligible  is that a redskins leg asked guert dropping the muzzle of his rifle as if about to try his skill on it  dont know answered the indian got leggin got moccasin cant see colour look most paleface leg big  what there was to enable one at that distance to distinguish between the leg of a white man and the leg of an indian at first greatly exceeded our means of conjecturing but the onondago explained it when asked in his own usual sententious manner by saying  toe turn outinjin turn inno like at all paleface big injin no very big  the first was true enough in walking and it did seem probable that the difference might exist in sleep guert now declared there was no use in hesitating any longer if asleep he would approach the chestnut cautiously and capture the stranger if an indian before he could rise and if a white man it must be some one belonging to our own set who was taking a nap probably after a fatiguing march susquesus must have satisfied himself by this time that there was no immediate danger for merely saying all go together he quitted the cover and led down towards the chestnut with a rapid but noiseless step as we moved in a body all five of us reached the tree at the same instant where we found sam one of our own hunters and whom we supposed to be with mr traverse stretched on his back dead with a wound in his breast that had been inflicted by a knife he too had been scalped  the looks we exchanged said all that could be said on the subject of the gravity of this new discovery susquesus alone was undisturbed i rather think he expected what he found after examining the body he seemed satisfied simply saying kill last night  that poor sam had been dead several hours was pretty certain and the circumstance removed all apprehension of any immediate danger from his destroyers the ruthless warriors of the woods seldom remained long near the spot they had desolated but passed on like the tornado or the tempest guert who was ever prompt when anything was to be done pointed to a natural hollow in the earth one of those cavities that are so common in the forest and which are usually attributed to the upturning of trees in remote ages and suggested that we should use it as a grave the body was accordingly laid in the hole and we covered it in the best manner we could succeeding in placing over it something like a foot deep of light loam together with several flat stones rolling logs on all as we had done at the grave of pete by this time guerts feelings were so thoroughly aroused that in addition to the prayer and the creed which he again repeated in a very decorous and devout manner he concluded the whole ceremony by a brief address nor was guert anything but serious in what he did or said on either of these solemn occasions his words like his acts being purely the impulses of a simple mind which possesses longings after devotion and scriptural truths without knowing exactly how to express them and this moreover in spite of the mere animal propensities and gay habits of his physical conformation and constitutional tendencies  deat my friends said guert most seriously becoming dutch as usual as he became interested deat is a sutten visiter he comes like a thief in the night as you must all have often hert the tominie say and happy is he whose loins are girlet and whose lamp is trimmed such i trust is the case with each of you for it is not to be concealet that we are likely to have serious work before us here have been injins beyont a question and they are injins too that are out on the warpath in search of english scalps or what is of equal importance to mr follock and myself dutch scalps in the pargain which makes it so much the more necessary for every man to be on his guart and to stant up to his work when it may come as the pulltog stants up to the ox got forpit tat i should preach revenge over te grave of a frient but the soltier fights none the worse for knowing tat he has peen injuret in his feelins as has certainly peen the case with ourselves perhaps i ought to say a wort in behalf of the teat as this is the last and only time that a fellowcreature will ever have occasion to speak of him sam was an excellent hunter as his worst enemy must allow and now he is gone few petter remain pehint he had one weakness which stanting over his grave an honest man ought not to try to conceal he dit love liquor put in this he was not alone nevertheless he was honest and his wort might pass where many a mans pont would be wortless and i leave him in the merciful hants of his creator my frients i haf but little more to say and that is thisthat life is uncertain and deat is sure samuel has gone before us only a little while and may we all be equally preparet to meet our great account amen  did any one smile at this address far from it singular disconnected and unsophisticated as it may seem to certain persons it had one great merit that is not always discernible in the speeches of those who officiate at the most elaborate funeral rites guert was sincere though he might not be either logical or very clear this was apparent in his countenance his voice his whole manner for myself i will allow i saw nothing particularly out of place in this address at the time nor do i now regard it as either irreverent or unseasonable  we left the grave of the hunter in the depths of that interminable forest as the ship passes away from the spot on the ocean where she has dropped her dead at some future day perhaps the ploughshare may turn up the bones and the husbandman ruminate on the probable fate of the lonely man whose remains will then again be brought to the light of day as we left the spot the indian detained us a moment to put us on our guard  huron do that he said meaninglyno see difference eh saw no hang up like pete  that is true enough susquesus guert answered for guert by his age his greater familiarity with the woods his high courage and his personal prowess had now assumed unresistingly on our part a sort of chieftainship over us can you tell us the reason however  muss you call him back sorethat all know him well dont love flog no injin love flog  and you think then jaaps prisoner has had a hand in this and that the warpath is open to revenge as well as public servicethat we are hunted less for our scalps than to put a plaster on the hurons back  sartain tree canoe go by on laketat muss you call himknow him well he no want sleep till back get well see how he use nigger hang him on treeonly kill paleface and take away scalp  do you suppose that he made this difference in the treatment of his two captives on account of the colour that he was so cruel to petrus because jaap another nigger had flogged him  sartainjust so back feel better after tat good for back to hang nigger jaap see some time  i will do my fellow the justice to say that in the way of courage few men were his equals as i have said before he only feared spooks or dutch ghosts for the awe he had of me was so blended with love as not to deserve the name of fear in general unless the weather happened to be cold his face was of a deep glistening black coffincolour as the boys sometimes called it but i observed notwithstanding his nerve and his keen desire to be revenged for the cruel treatment bestowed on his companion and brother that his skin now assumed a greyish hue such as is seen only in hard frosts as a rule in the people of his race it was evident that the trackless manner of speaking had produced an effect and i have always thought the impresssion then made on jaap was of infinite service to us by setting in motion and keeping in lively activity every faculty of his mind and body i had a specimen of this as we moved off jaap walking for some distance close at my heels in order to make me the repository of his griefs and solicitude  i hopes masser corny sah commenced the negro you doesnt tink anyting of what dis here injin say  i think jaap it will be necessary for you to keep you eyes open and by no means to fall into the hands of your friend muss as you call him or he may serve you even worse than he served poor pete i hope too this will be warning to you of the necessity of treating your prisoners kindly should you ever make another  i dont tink masser corny you consider pretty much sah what good it do a nigger to captivate an injin if he let him go agin and dont lick him little only little masser corny ebbery ting so handy too sahrope all ready back bare and feelin up like after such a time in takin e varmint sah  well jaap what is done is done and there is no use in regretting it in words of one thing however you may be certain no mercy will be shown you should this fellow muss be actually out here on our heels and should you be so unfortunate as to fall into his hands  the negro growled out his discontent and i could see that his mind was made up to give stout battle ere his wool should be disturbed by the knife of a savage a moment later he stepped aside and respectfully permitted dirck to take his proper place next to me in the line  we may have proceeded two miles from the spot where we had buried sam the hunter when on rising a little hillock the indian tossed his arm the sign that a new discovery was made this time however the gesture was rather made in exultation than in horror as he came to a dead halt at the same instant we all closed eagerly up and got an early view of the cause of this exhibition of feeling  the ground fell away in a sort of swell for some distance in our front and the trees being all of the largest size and totally without underbrush the place had somewhat of the appearance of a vast forest edifice to which the canopy of leaves above formed the roof and the stems of oaks lindens beeches and maples might be supposed to be the columns that upheld it within this wide gloomy yet not unpleasant hall a sombre light prevailed like that which is cast through the casements of an edifice of the ancient style of architecture rendering everything mellow and grave a spring of sweet water gushed from a rock and near it were seated in a circle mr traverse and his two chainbearers seemingly taking their mornings meal or rather reclining after it with the pail platters and fragments before them like men reposing after appeasing their hunger and passing a few minutes in idle talk tom the second hunter and axeman lay asleep a little apart  here has been even no alarm thank got said guert cheerfully and we are in time to let them know their danger i will give the call it will sound sweetly to their ears  no call said trackless quickly hollow no good now soon get there and tell him in low voice  as this was clearly prudent we pushed forward in a body taking no pains however to conceal our approach but making somewhat of a measured tread with our footsteps a strange sensation came over me as we advanced and i found that neither of the surveyors stirred a suspicion of the dread truth forced itself on my mind but i can hardly say that the shock was any the less when on getting near we saw by the pallid countenances fixed glassy eyes and fallen jaws that all our friends were dead the savage ingenuity of indians had propped the bodies in reclining positions and thrown them into attitudes that had a horrible resemblance to the species of indulgence that i have just described  holy heaven exclaimed guert dropping the butt of his rifle on the ground we are too late  no one else spoke on removing the caps it was found that each man had been scalped and that all of those whom we had left a few days before proud of their strength and instinct with life had departed in spirit soon to be seen no more jumper the other indian alone remained to be accounted for rifleballs had been at work here each of the four having been shot mr traverse in no less than three places  i will confess that a suspicion of the oneida crossed my mind now for the first time and i did not scruple to mention it to my companions as soon as either of us had power to speak or listen  no true said trackless positively jumper poor injinthat solove rumno rascal to kill friend musohoeenah warrior to do so just like him no jumper foollove rumno bad injin  where then was jumper he alone of all whom we had left behind us remained to be found we made a long search for his body but without any success susquesus examined the trails and the bodies and gave it as his opinion that the surveyor and chainbearers might have been killed about three or four hours and that the murderers for such in our eyes they who had done the foul deed were to be accounted had not been away from the place more than twenty minutes when we arrived this might well have happened and we not hear the rifles as the distance from the hut was several miles and two hours before we must have been not far from the place where we had passed the night that the attack occurred after daylight was reasonably certain and as pete was surely seized while alive some intelligence might have been obtained from him that directed the savages to the point where the outlying party would probably be expecting him nevertheless this was pretty much conjecture and we never knew which victim fell first or whether the negro was taken at all near the spot where he was gibbeted the infernal cruelty of his conquerors may have kept him as a prisoner for some time before the final catastrophe and caused them to carry him about with them as a captive in order to subject the wretch to as much misery as possible for as susquesus said muss back very sore  we buried poor traverse and his chainbearers near the spring using one of the same natural hollows in the earth as that in which we had interred the hunter on a search it was ascertained that their arms and ammunition had been carried off and that the pockets of the dead men had been rifled the american indian is seldom a thief in the ordinary sense of the term but he treats the property of those whom he slays as his own in this particular he does not differ materially from the civilized soldier i believe plunder being usually considered as a legitimate benefit of war the hurons had laid their hands on the compass and chains for we could discover neither but they had left the fieldbook and notes of traverse as things that to them were useless in other respects the visit of the savages to this fatal spot left the appearance of having been hurried  on this occasion guert made no attempts at morals or eloquence the shock had disqualified us all for anything of the sort and we discharged our duties with the earnest diligence and grave thoughtfulness of men who did not know but the next moment might bring themselves into the midst of a scene of deadly strife we worked hard and a little hastily and were soon ready to depart it was determined on a hurried consultation to follow the trail of the hurons as the most certain method of surprising them on the one hand and of preventing them from surprising us on the other the indian would have no difficulty in pursuing the very obvious trail that was left and which bore all the proofs of having been left by a dozen men  the reader who is unacquainted with the usages of the american savage is not to suppose that this party had moved through the forest in a disorderly group regardless of the nature of the vestiges of their passage left behind them the native warrior never does that usually he marches in a line of single files which has obtained the name of indian file with us and whenever there are strong reasons for concealing his numbers it is his practice for each succeeding man to follow as nearly as possible in the footsteps of the warrior who precedes him thereby rendering a computation difficult if not impossible in this manner our foes had evidently marched but susquesus who had been busy examining the marks around the spring the whole time we were occupied in burying the dead gave it as his opinion that our enemies could not number less than a dozen warriors this was not very pleasing intelligence since it would render success in a conflict next to hopeless so at least i viewed the matter though guert saw things differently this highly intrepid man could not find it in his heart to abandon the idea of driving foes so ruthless out of the country and i do believe he would have faced a hundred savages at once when we quitted the spring  the onondago had no difficulty in following the trail which led us at first for some distance in a line towards ravensnest then made a sudden inclination in the direction of the hut it was probably owing to this circuit and want of settled purpose in the hurons that we did not encounter them on our advance towards the bloody spring as the spot where traverse was slain has been subsequently called  it was not long ere we found ourselves quite near our own trail though perhaps fortunately for us we did not actually strike it had our movement been discovered doubtless the enemy would have got into our rear a position in which indians are always most formidable as it was however we possessed that great advantage ourselves and pursued our way with so much the greater confidence knowing full well that danger was only to be apprehended in our front the quarter on which all our eyes were fixed  although our returnmarch was swift it was silent as that of a train of mourners mourners we were indeed for it was not possible for human hearts to be so obdurate as to feel insensible to the amount of misery that our late companions must have suffered and to the suddenness of their fates no one spoke and susquesus had never found us so close on his heels as we kept ourselves all that morning the foot of the fileleader was scarcely out of its place ere that of his successor covered the same spot  the trail led us quite close to the hut which we reached as near as might be to noon on approaching the cabin we used the utmost caution lest our enemies might then be in it in ambush the trail did not extend quite to the building however but diverged in a westerly direction from a point that may have been a hundred yards distant from our habitation though in full view of it here we found the signs of a gathering of the party into a cluster and we inferred that a counsel had been held on the subject of once more going to the hut or of turning aside to pursue some other object susquesus made a close examination at this spot and gave it as his opinion again that the hostiles must at least number the dozen he had already mentioned leaving us to watch the signs about our dwelling from covers we took for that purpose he followed the trail for half a mile in order to make certain it did not approach the loghouse on its opposite side so far from this proving to be the case however he ascertained that it led off in a straight line towards ravensnest this was if anything more unpleasant news to guert and myself than if the onondago had brought back a confirmation of his first suspicion that the hurons might be waiting for us in our own temporary house complaints were useless however and we smothered our apprehensions as well as we could  susquesus was not a warrior to confide entirely in the signs of an open march experienced woodsmen frequently left their trails visible expressly to deceive and the onondago who personally knew muss as jaap called his prisoner was fully aware that he had to deal with a profoundly artful foe not satisfied with even what he had seen he cautioned us about quitting the cover except under his guidance and then commenced a mode of approach that was purely indian and which in its way had much of the merit of the approaches of more civilized besiegers by means of their entrenchments and zigzags our advance was regulated in this way each man was told to select the nearest tree that led him towards the hut and to pass from the old to the new cover in as rapid and sudden a manner as his agility would allow by observing this precaution and by using great activity we had got within twenty yards of the door of the cabin in the course of ten minutes guert could not submit to this slow and as he called it unmanly procedure any longer but quitting his cover he now walked straight and steadily to the door of the cabin threw it open and announced to us that the place was empty susquesus made another close examination around the building and told us he felt quite certain that the spot had not been visited since we had left it that morning that was grateful intelligence to us all since it was the only probable clue by which our enemies could have learned our return to the patent at all  the question now arose as to future proceedings nothing was to be gained by remaining on the property while prudence and the danger of our friends united to call us away we felt it would be a most hazardous thing to attempt reaching ravensnest though we felt it was a hazard we were bound to incur while the matter was talked over those among us who had any appetite profited by the halt to dine an indian on a warpath is equally ready to eat or to fast his powers of endurance both ways more especially when the food is game amounting to something wonderful  while susquesus and jaap in particular were performing their parts in a very serious manner in this way and the rest of us were picking up a few morsels more like men whose moral feelings cheeked their physical propensities i caught a distant glimpse of a mans form as it glided among the trees at some distance from us surprise and awe were so strong in me that i did not speak but pointed with a finger eagerly in the necessary direction in order to let the onondago see the same object too susquesus was not slow in detecting the stranger however for i think he must have seen him even before he was descried by myself instead of manifesting any emotion however the onondago did not even cease to eat but merely nodded his head and muttered goodnow hear newsjumper come  sure enough it was jumper and his appearance in the flesh not only alive but unharmed produced a general shout among us as he came in on such a long loping gait as usually marked a runners movement in a moment he was among us calm collected and without motion he gave no salutation but seated himself quietly on a log waiting to be questioned before he spoke impatience being a womanly weakness  jumper my honest fellow cried guert not without emotion for joy was struggling powerfully with his organs of speech you are heartily welcome these devils incarnate the hurons have not injured you at least  liquor had rendered jumpers faculties somewhat obtuse in general though he was now perfectly sober he gave a sort of dull look of recognition at the speaker and muttered his answer in a low sluggish tone  plenty huron he said clearin full paleface in fort send jumper with message  we should have overwhelmed the fellow with questions had he not unfolded a corner of his calico shirt and exhibited several letters each of which was soon in the hand of the individual to whom it was addressed guert dirck and myself severally got his communication while there was a fourth in the handwriting of herman mordaunt that bore the superscription of poor traverses name subsequent events have placed it in my power to give copies of all the letters thus received my own was in the following words      my dearest father is so much occupied as to desire me to write     you this note mr bulstrode sent an express yesterday who was     bearer of the sad tidings from ticonderoga he also announced his     own approach and we expect him in a horselitter this evening     reports are flying about the settlement that savages have been seen     in our own woods i endeavour to hope that this is only one of those     idle rumours of which we have had so many lately my father     however is taking all necessary precautions and he desires me to     urge on you the necessity of collecting all your party should you     be again at mooseridge and of joining us without delay we have     heard of your safety and gallant conduct through the man sent     forward by mr bulstrode his master having heard of you all safe     in a canoe on the lake the night after the battle through a mr     lee a gentleman of great eccentricity of character though it is     said of much talent with whom papa happens to be acquainted i     trust this note will find you at your hut and that we shall see you     all with the least possible delay      anneke  this certainly was not a note to appease the longings of a lover though i had infinite gratification in seeing the pretty characters that had been traced by anne mordaunts hand and of kissing the page over which that hand must have passed but there was a postscript the part of a letter in which a woman is said always to give the clearest insight into her true thoughts it was in these words viz  i see that i have underscored the me where i speak of papas desire that i should write to you in preference to another we have gone through one dreadful scene in company and i confess corny i should feel far happier if another is to occur that you and yours should be with us here behind the defences of this house than exposed as you otherwise might be in the forest come to us then i repeat with the least possible delay  this postscript afforded me far more satisfaction than the body of the note and i was quite as ready to comply with annekes request as the dear girl herself could be to urge it guerts letter was as follows      mr mordaunt has commanded anneke and myself to write to those of     your party with whom he fancies each has the most influence to     urge you to come to ravensnest as speedily as possible we have     received most melancholy news and a panic prevails among the poor     people of this settlement we learn that mr bulstrode accompanied     by mr worden is within a few hours journey of us and the     families of the vicinity are coming to us frightened and weeping i     do not know that i feel much alarmed myself my great dependence is     on a merciful providence but the dread being on whom i rely works     through human agents and i know of none in whom i can place more     confidence than on guert ten eyck      mary wallace   by st nicholas corny these are such summonses as a man never hesitates about obeying cried guert rising and beginning to replace his knapsack by using great diligence we may reach the nest yet before the family goes to bed and make not only them but ourselves so much the more comfortable and secure  guert had a willing auditor in me nor was dirck at all backward about complying the letters certainly much quickened our impulses though in fact there remained nothing else to do unless indeed we intended to lie out exposed to all the risks of a vindictive and savage warfare dircks letter was from herman mordaunt and it told the truth in plainer language than it had been related by either of the ladies here it is      dear dirckthe savages are certainly approaching us my young     kinsman and it is for the good of us all to unite our forces come     in for gods sake with your whole party as speedily as possible     i have had scouts out and they have all come in with reports that     the signs of trails in the forest abound i expect at least a     hundred warriors will be upon us by tomorrow and am making my     preparations accordingly in approaching the nest i would advise     you to enter the ravine north of the house and to keep within its     cover until you get to its southern termination this will bring you     within a hundred rods of the gate and greatly increase your chances     of entering should we happen to be invested when you get here god     bless you dear dirck and guide you all safely to your friends      herman mordaunt      ravensnest july 11th 1758  guert and i read this letter hastily before we commenced our march then abandoning the hut and all it contained to the mercy of any who might pass that way we set off for our point of destination on a quick step carrying little besides our arms ammunition and the food that was necessary to assure our strength  as before trackless led keeping the jumper a little on his flank the danger of encountering foes being now considered to be greatly increased it was true we were still in the rear of the party that had committed the deeds at mooseridge but the onondago no longer followed its trail pursuing a different course or one that led directly to his object     chapter xxvii    my father had a daughter lovd a man   as it might be perhaps were i a woman   i should your lordship    viola   as the reader must by this time have a pretty accurate idea of our manner of marching in the wilderness i shall not dwell on this part of our proceedings any longer on we went and at a rapid rate the guide having abandoned the common route which had got to be a pretty visible trail and taking another on which as it appeared to me he had no other clue than an instinct guert had told susquesus of the ravine and how desirable it was to reach it getting for an answer a quiet nod of the head and a low ejaculation it was understood however that we were to approach herman mordaunts fortress by that avenue  it was past the turn of the day when we quitted mooseridge and none of us hoped to reach ravensnest before dark it fell out as we expected night drawing its veil over the scene about half an hour before the trackless plunged into the northern or forestend of the ravine thus far we had got no evidence whatever of the proximity of foes our march had been silent rapid and watchful but it proved to be perfectly undisturbed we knew however that the critical portion of it was still before us and just as the sun set we had made a halt in order to look to our arms it may now be well to say a word or two on the subject of the position of herman mordaunts garrison as well as of the adjacent settlement i call ravensnest the garrison for that is the word which new york custom has long applied to the fortress itself as well as those who defend it some critics pretend there is authority to justify the practice and i see by the dictionaries that they are not entirely in the wrong  the nest stood quite half a mile from the nearest point of the forest a belt of trees that fringed the margin and which filled the cavity of the ravine excepted near it and in plain sight was the heart of the settlement itself which extended in an east and west direction fully four miles this area however was cleared only in a settlement fashion having patches of virgin forest scattered pretty profusely over its surface the milllot as jasons purchase was termed lay at the most distant extremity of the view but as yet the axe had not been applied to it i had remarked in my last visit to the place that standing before herman mordaunts door something like a dozen log cabins were to be seen at a time in different parts of the settlement and that this number might have been increased to twenty by varying the observers position  of course the whole of the open space was more or less disfigured by stumps dead and girdled trees charred stubs logheaps brush and all the other unseemly accompaniments of the first eight or ten years of the existence of a new settlement this period in the history of a country may be likened to the hobbledehoy condition in ourselves when we have lost the graces of childhood without having attained the finished forms of men  herman mordaunts settlement would have been thought a strong country in one sense for a field fight had there been men enough to contend with a hostile party of any force but i had heard him say that he had but about seventeen rifles and muskets that could be in the least relied on inasmuch as some of his people were europeans and had no knowledge of firearms while experience had shown that others on the occurrence of an alarm invariably fled to the woods with their families instead of rallying around the settlement colours such delinquencies usually take place i believe on all emergencies love of life being even a stronger instinct than love of property here and there a sturdy fellow however would bar himself in with a determination to go for the whole under his own bark roof and occasionally defences were made that would do credit to a hero  it should be apparent to those who have any accurate notion of savage warfare that the ravine being as it was the only wooded spot near herman mordaunts fortress would be the place of all others most likely to contain an enemy who made his approaches against a garrison by means of natural facilities alone we were aware of this and guert who took an active command among us as we drew near to danger issued his commands for every man to be on the alert in order that there might be no confusion we were instructed as to the manner of proceeding the moment an alarm was given and guert who was a capital mimic had previously taught us several calls and rallying signals all of which were good imitations of the cries of different tenants of the woods principally birds these signals had their origin with the redman who often resorted to them and were said to be more successfully practised by our own hunters and riflemen than even by those with whom they originated  on entering the ravine the order of our march was changed while susquesus and jumper were still kept in advance guert dirck jaap and myself moved abreast and quite close together the density of the foliage and the deep obscurity that prevailed in the bottom of this delllike hollow rendered this precaution necessary it soon became so dark indeed that our only guide was the brook that gurgled along the bottom of the ravine and which we knew issued into the open ground at its termination to join a small river that meandered through some natural meadows to the westward of the nest but which in the language of the country was called a creek this abuse of good old english words i am sorry to say is getting to be only too common among us yet i have heard americans boast that we speak the language better than the mother country that we have no class among us that uses an unintelligible dialect like that of lancashire or yorkshire is true enough and that we have fewer persons who use decided vulgarisms in the way of false grammar than is the case in england may be also accurate but it might be well for us to correct a great many faults into which we have certainly fallen before we declaim with so much confidence about the purity of our english 37 to return to the ravine  we had gone so far in the hollow dark dell as to have reached a point where the faint light of the open ground and the stars in the firmament became visible to us when we suddenly found ourselves alongside of the trackless and jumper these indians had halted for their quick jealous eaglelike glances had detected the signs of enemies nor was this discovery very difficult to make though some pains had actually been taken to conceal what was going on in our front a party of some forty savages every man of whom was in his warpaint had lighted a fire beneath a shelving rock and were gathered around it at supper the fire had already done its duty and was now merely smouldering throwing a faint flickering light on the dark fierce features of the group that was clustered round we might have approached the spot in any other direction without seeing the danger in time to avoid it but a kind providence had carried the two indians directly to a point where the dying embers immediately caught their attention and where they halted as has been said i do not think we were more than forty yards from this fearful band of savages when they first met my eye and hardened as i had certainly somewhat become by the service and scenes i had so lately gone through i will confess that my blood was a little chilled at the sight  our conference was in whispers there we stood huddled together beneath a huge oak the shade of which rendered the darkness that formed our only safeguard so much the more intense so close were we in fact that even jaaps body was in absolute contact with my own susquesus proposed making a détour by crossing the brook which fortunately tumbled down some rocks at this point making a very favourable noise and thus pass our enemies who would not probably end their meal until we had time to reach the garrison to this guert applied his veto he was of opinion and i have always thought it was the decision of a man born to be a soldier that we were exactly in the position we might desire to occupy in order to be of great service to the family and to strike the enemy with a panic by attacking we should certainly surprise the party in our front and might make such an impression as would induce them to abandon the settlement both dirck and myself coincided in this opinion which even received the support of jaaps voice  yes sahyes masser corny now e time to wengeance poor pete he muttered and that rather louder than was thought quite prudent  as soon as the trackless found how things were going he and jumper prepared for the conflict as coolly as any of us our arrangements were very simple and were soon made we were to deliver a single fire from the spot where we stood shout and charge with the knife and tomahawk no time was to be wasted however and instead of remaining near the light small as it was we were to push for the mouth of the ravine and thence make the best of our way singly or in company as chance should offer to the gate of ravensnest in a moment we were in open files and had our orders  remember traverse said guert sternlyremember poor sam and all our murteret frients  the reader knows that guert was apt to be very dutch when much excited we did remember the dead and i have often thought but never knew precisely that each of us sacrificed a victim to the manes of our lost companions on that stern occasion our rifles rang or cracked would be the better word almost simultaneously a yell arose from the savages around the fire our own shouts mingled with that yell and forward we went endeavouring to make our numbers appear as if we were a hundred  one retains but very indistinct notions of a charge like that made as it was in the dark beyond its general characteristics we swept directly among the slain and wounded and i heard jaap dealing one or two awful blows on the bodies but no one opposed us a moment after we had passed the smouldering fire three or four shot were discharged at us but there was no sign of their telling on any of our party the distance from the fire to the mouth of the ravine might have been a hundred yards and the external light or lesser darkness may be a better expression served us for a guide thither we pushed fast as we could though by no means in compact order  for this part of the affair i can only speak for myself i saw men moving swiftly among the trees and i supposed them to be my companions but we had become separated it being understood that each man was now to shift for himself as our rifles were discharged and there was no time to reload them there was little use indeed in any halt perceiving this i did not issue from the ravine at the brook but clinging more to its side left it at a little height above the level of the adjacent plain here i paused to load the cover being good and the position every way favourable while thus employed i found time to look around me and to ascertain the situation of things in the settlement so far as the hour and the obscurity would permit  the plain was glimmering with the remains of a dozen large fires the ruins of so many loghouses and barns their light amounted to no more than to render the darkness of the night distinctly visible and to afford some small clues to the extent of the ravages that had been already committed the house of ravensnest however was untouched there it stood looking dark and gloomy for having no external windows no other light was to be seen than a single candle that was probably placed in a loophole as a signal profound stillness reigned in and around the building producing a species of mystery that was in itself under such circumstances an element of force there was not light enough to distinguish objects at any distance and having reloaded my rifle i thought it wisest to make the best of my way to the gate at that moment the stillness in my rear seemed to possess something affirmatively fearful about it  it was certainly a somewhat hazardous thing to break cover at such a moment and under such circumstances but it was absolutely necessary to incur its risks my first leap carried me halfway down the declivity and i was soon on the level land in my front were two men one of whom seemed to me to be in the grasp of the other as they were moving though slowly in the direction of the house i ventured to ask who goes there  oh corny my lad is that you answered guert got be praised you seem unhurt and are just in time to help me along with this huron on whom i blundered in the dark and have disarmed and captured give him a kick or a push if you please for the fellow holds back like a hog  i had too much knowledge of indian vindictiveness however to adopt the means recommended but seizing the captive by one arm while guert held the other we ran him up to the abbatis that covered the gate of the garrison with very little difficulty here we found herman mordaunt and a dozen of his people all armed ready to receive us they were in expectation of our appearance both on account of the hour and on account of the clamour in the ravine which had been distinctly heard at the house in less than a minute everybody was in safe and unharmed the fact was that our attack had been so sudden as to sweep everything before it and the enemy had not time to recover from his panic before we were all snugly housed once within the gate of ravensnest we ran no risks beyond those which were common to all such log fortresses in the warfare of the wilderness  it would not be easy for a pen as unskilful as mine to portray the change from the gloom of the ravine the short but bloody assault the shouts the rush and the retreat of the outer world to the scene of domestic security we found within the nest embellished as was the last by womans loveliness and graces and in many respects by womans elegance anneke and her friend received us in a bright cheerful comfortable apartment that was rendered so much the more attractive by their tears and their smiles neither of which were spared i could see that both had been dreadfully agitated but joy restored their colour and brought back the smiles to their sweet faces the situation of the place was such perhaps as to render cheerfulness neither very lasting nor very lively but the tenderest female can find her heart suddenly so lightened from its burthen of apprehensions as to be able to seem momentarily happy even when environed by the horrors of war such in a measure was the character of the reception we now received together with a thousand thanks for having so promptly answered their letters in person the dear creatures had the ingenuity not to seem to ascribe that prompt obedience to their own requests which we had manifested to any care for ourselves but solely to a wish to oblige and protect them the reader will understand that all explanations still remained to be made on both sides these soon came however facts pressing themselves on the attention at such times with a weight that is irresistible the ice was broken by herman mordaunts entering the room and speaking to us like one who felt that a great omission had been made  we had closed the gate and set the lookout at the loops again he said before i ascertained that all your party is not here i see nothing of traverse and his chainbearers nor of sam or tom your hunters surely they are not left behind in the forest  neither of us three spoke our looks must have told the sad story for herman mordaunt seemed to understand us on the instant  no he exclaimedcan it be possible not all surely  all mr mordaunt even to my poor slave petrus answered guert solemnly they were set upon while dispersed i suppose and have been murdered while we were still absent on our expedition  the dear girls clasped their hands and i thought annekes pallid lips moved as if in prayer her father shook his head and for some time he paced the room in silence then rousing himself like one conscious of the necessity of calmness and exertion he resumed the discourse  thank god mr bulstrode reached us safely last evening just after we despatched the runner and he is beyond the reach of these demons for the present  after this we were enabled to converse more connectedly exchanging such statements as enabled each party to understand the precise condition of the other we were then carried to bulstrodes room for he had expressed a desire to see us as soon as we could be spared our fellow campaigner received us in good spirits for one in his situation speaking of the events in front of ticonderoga sensibly and without any attempt to conceal the mortification that he felt in common with the whole british empire his hurt was by no means a bad one likely to cripple him for a few weeks but the leg was in no danger  i have had the resolution and address corny to work my way into good quarters this unexpected siege excepted he observed to me when the others had withdrawn leaving us alone this rivalry of ours is a generous one and may now have fair play if we quit this nest of herman mordaunts without ascertaining the true state of annekes feelings we shall deserve to be condemned to celibacy for the remainder of our days there never were two such opportunities for wooing to advantage  i confess our situation does not strike me as being quite as favourable mr bulstrode i answered anneke must have too many apprehensions on her own account and on account of others to be as sensible to the tender sentiments of love as might be the case in the peace and security of lilacsbush  ah it is very evident you know nothing of the female sex corny by that remark i will grant you that unwooed previously and without any foundation laid if i may express myself so irreverently your theory might turn out to be true but not so under actual circumstances here is a young lady in her nineteenth year who knows she is not only sought but has long been sought ay warmly ardently sought by two reasonably unobjectionable young men placed in the very situation to have all her sensibilities excited by one or the other and depend on it the matter will be determined within this blessed week if i should prove to be the fortunate man i hope to be able to manifest a generous sympathy and vice versâ i shall expect the same though this sad sad business before ty has been a good preparative for humiliation  i could not avoid smiling at bulstrodes singular views of our suit but as anneke was ever with me an engrossing theme spite of our situation which certainly was not particularly appropriate to love i did not feel equal to quitting it abruptly the matter was consequently pursued as i asked bulstrode to explain himself i got from him the following account of his theory  why i reason in this wise corny anneke loves one of us two beyond all question that she loves i will swear her blushes her beaming eyes even her beauty is replete with the loveliness of the sentiment now it is not possible that she should love any other person than one of us two for the simple reason that she has no other suitor i shall be frank with you and confess that i think i am the favoured fellow while i dare say you are just as sanguine and think it is yourself  i give you my honour major bulstrode so presuming so improper a thought has never  yes yesi understand all that you are not worthy of anne mordaunts love and therefore have never presumed to imagine that she could bestow it on such a poor miserable worthless goodfornothing a fellow as yourself i have a great deal of the same very proper feeling but at the same time each of us is quite confident of his own success or he would have given up the pursuit long since  i do assure you bulstrode anything but confidence mingles with my feelings on this subject you may have reasons for your own security but i can boast of none  i have no other than selflove of which every man has a just portion for his own comfort and peace of mind i say that hope is indispensable to love and hope is allied to confidence my reasoning on these points is very simple and now for the peculiar advantages we enjoy for bringing matters to a crisis in the first place i am hurt you will understand suffering under an honourable wound received in open battle fighting for king and country then i have been brought fresh from the field on my litter into the presence of my mistress bearing on my person the evidence of my risk and i hope of my good conduct there is not one woman in a thousand if she hesitated between us that would not decide in my favour on these grounds alone you have no notion corny how the hearts of these sweet gentle devoted generous little american girls melt to sympathy and the sufferings of a poor wretch that they know adores them make a nurse of a female and she is yours nine times out of ten this has been a masterstroke of mine but i hope you will pardon it stratagems are excusable in love as in war  i have no difficulty in understanding your policy bulstrode though i confess to some in understanding your frankness such as it is however i trust you feel certain it will not be abused now as to my situation what peculiar countervailing advantages do i enjoy  those of a defender oh that is a batteringram of itself this confounded assault on the settlement which they tell me is rather serious and may keep alive apprehensions for some days yet is a most unlucky thing for me while it is of great advantage to you a wounded man cannot excite onehalf the interest he otherwise might when there is a chance that others may be slain every minute then the character of a defender is a great deal and being a generous rival as i have always told you corny my advice is to make the most of it i conceal nothing and intend to do all i can with my wound  it was scarcely possible not to laugh at this strangely frank yet i fully believe strangely sincere communication for bulstrode was a humorist with all his conventionalism and london notions and was more addicted to saying precisely what he thought than is common with men of his class after sitting and chatting with him half an hour longer on the subject of the late military operations of which he spoke with both feeling and good sense i took my leave for the night  god bless you corny he said squeezing my hand as i left him improve the opportunity in your own way for i assure you i shall do it in mine it is present valour against past valour if it were not my own case that is concerned there is not a man living to whom i should more freely wish success  and i believe bulstrode did not exceed the truth in his declarations that i should succeed with anneke he did not think as was apparent to me by his general manner and the consciousness he must have possessed of his own advantages in the way of rank and fortune as well as in having herman mordaunts good wishes oddly enough in quitting my rival and under circumstances so very peculiar i was accidentally thrown into the presence of my mistress and that too alone anneke was the sole occupant of the little room in which the girls habitually staid when i returned to it guert having managed to induce mary wallace to walk with him in the court the only place the ladies now possessed for exercise while herman mordaunt mr worden and dirck were together in the publicroom making some arrangement with the confused body of the settlers who had crowded into the nest for the nightwatch i shall not stop to express the delight i felt at finding anneke there nor was it in any degree diminished as i met the soft expression of her sweet eyes and saw the blushes that suffused her cheek the conversation i had just held doubtless had its effect for i determined at once that so favourable an occasion for pressing my suit should not be lost i was goaded on if the truth must be told by apprehension of bulstrodes wound  what i said precisely in the commencement of that interview is more than i could record did i think it would redound to my advantage as i fear it would not but i made myself understood which is more i fancy than happens to all lovers in such scenes at first i was confused and a little incoherent i suspect but feeling so far got the better of these defects as to enable me to utter what i wished to express towards the end if i spoke in the least as warmly and distinctly as i felt there must have been some slight touch of eloquence about my manner and language this being the first occasion too on which i had ever had an opportunity of urging my suit very directly there was so much to be said so many things to be explained and so many seemingly slighted occasions to account for that anneke had little else to do for the first ten minutes but to listen i have always ascribed the selfpossession which my companion was enabled to command during the remainder of this interview to the time that was thus accorded her to rally her thoughts  dear precious anneke how admirably did she behave that memorable night it was certainly an extraordinary situation in which to speak of love yet i much question if the feelings be not more likely to be true and natural at such times than when circumstances admit of more of the expedients of everyday life i could see that my sweet listener was touched from the moment i commenced and that her countenance betrayed a tender interest in what i said presuming on this or encouraged by her blushes and her downcast eyes i ventured to take a hand and perceived i was not repulsed then it was that i found words that actually brought tears to my companions eyes and anneke was enabled to answer me  this is so unusualso extraordinary a time to speak of such things corny she said that i hardly know what ought to be my reply of one thing however i feel certain persons surrounded as we are by dangers that may at any instant involve our destruction have an unusual demand on them for sincerity affectation i hope i am never much addicted to and prudery i know you would condemn i have a feeling uppermost at this instant that i wish to express yet scarce know how  do not suppress it beloved anneke be as generous as i am certain you are sincere  corny it is this i know we are in dangervery great danger of being overcome captured perhaps slain by the ruthless beings who are prowling around our dwelling and that no one in this house can count on a single day of existence even with the ordinary vain security of man now should anything befall you after this and i survive you i should survive for the remainder of my days to mourn your loss and to feel the keenest regrets that i had hesitated to own how much interest i have long felt in you and how happy i have been with the consciousness of the preference that you so frankly and honestly avowed in my favour months ago  as the tears as well as blushes of anneke accompanied these admissions it was not possible for me to doubt what i heard from that moment a world of confidence and a flow of pure sweet strong natural feeling bound us more and more closely together guert was in a happy mood to detain mary wallace and business greatly befriended me as respected the others more than an hour had i anne mordaunt all to myself and when the heart is open how much can be uttered and understood on such a subject as love in an hour of unreserved confidence and of strong feeling anneke admitted to me before we separated that she had often thought of the chivalrous boy who had volunteered to do battle in her behalf when she was little more than a child herself and thought of him as a generousminded girl would be apt to think of a lad under the circumstances this very early preference had been much quickened and increased by the affair of the lion and our subsequent intercourse bulstrode that formidable encouraged rival encouraged by her father if not by herself had never interested her in the least beyond the feeling natural to the affinity of blood and i might have spared myself many hours of anxious concern on his account could i only have seen what was now so unreservedly told to me poor bulstrode a feeling of commiseration came over me as i listened to my companions assurances that he had never in the least touched her heart while at the same time blushing very red she confessed my own power over it an expression to this effect even escaped her aloud  have no concern on mr bulstrodes account corny anneke answered smiling archly like one who had well weighed the pros and cons of the whole subject in her own mind he may be a little mortified but his fancy will soon be forgotten in rejoicing that he had not yielded to a passing inclination and connected himself with a young inexperienced american girl who is hardly suited to move in the circles in which his wife must livei do believe mr bulstrode prefers me just now to any other female he may tappen to know but his attachment if it deserve the name has not the heart in it dear corny that i know is to be found in yours we women are said to be quick in discovering when we are really loved and i confess that my own little experience inclines me to believe that the remark does us no more than justice  i then spoke of guert and expressed a hope that his sincere obvious manly devotion might finally touch her heart and that my new friend towards whom however i began already to feel as towards an old friend might finally meet with a return for a passion that i was persuaded was as deep and as sincere as my own a comparison that i felt was as strong as any i could make in guerts behalf  on this subject you are not to expect me to say much corny answered anneke smiling every woman is the mistress of her own secrets on such a subject and did i know fully mary wallaces mind or wishes in reference to mr ten eyck as i do not profess to know either i should not feel at liberty to betray her even to you i have no longer any secret of my own as respects corny littlepage but must not be expected to be as weak in betraying my whole sex as i have been in betraying myself  i was obliged to be satisfied with this sweet admission and with the knowledge that i had been long loved when anneke left me which at the expiration of more than an hour she insisted on doing under the consciousness of all that had passed between us i had a good deal of difficulty in believing that i was not dreaming this ecclaircissement was so sudden so totally unexpected i fancy to us both that well might it so seem to either yet i fancy we did not part without a deep conviction that both were happier than when we met i solemnly declare notwithstanding that i felt sorrow almost regret on behalf of bulstrode the poor fellow had been so evidently confident of success only an hour or two before that i could not have acquainted him with my own success had he been up and able to prefer his own suit in his actual situation such a procedure would have appeared brutal  as for guert ten eyck he rejoined me sadder and more despairing than ever  it struck me corny that if mary wallace had the smallest inclination in my behalf she would manifest it at a moment when we may all be said to be hanging between life and deaf i have often heard it said that the woman who would trifle with a young fellow at a ball or on a sleighride and use him like a dog while every one was laughing and making merry would come round like one of the weathercocks on our dutch barns at a shift of the wind the instant that distress or unhappiness alighted on her suitor in other worts that the very girl who would be capricious and uncertain in happiness and prosperity would suddenly become tender and truthful as soon as sorrow touched the man who wished to have her on the strength of this then i thought i would urge mary to the best of my poor abilities and you know they are no great matter corny to give me only a glimmering of hope but without success not a syllable more could i get out of her than that the time was unseasonable to talk of such things and i do think i should be ready to go and meet these huron devils hand to hand were it not for the fact that the very girl who thus remonstrated staid with me quite two hours listening to what i had to say though i spoke of nothing else there was a crumb of comfort in that lad or i do not understand human nature  there was truly still i could not but compare anne mordaunts generous confessions under the influence of the same facts and fancy that the prospects of the simpleminded warmhearted manly young albanian were far less flattering than my own  footnote 37 it is northern american to call a small lake a pond a small river a creek even though it should be an

what we may be the eternal surge   of time and tide rolls on and bears afar   our bubbles as the old burst new emerge   lashed from the foam of ages while the graves   of empires heave but like some passing wave    byron   it was now announced by herman mordaunt in person that the watch was set for the night and that each man might seek his rest the crowded state of the nest was such as to render it no easy matter to find a place in which to sleep straw being our only beds at length we found our pallets such as they were and spite of all that had passed that evening truth compels me to admit that i was soon in a profound sleep there was no exception to this rule among the mooseridge party i believe fatigue proving to to be more powerful than either successful love unsuccessful love or personal apprehension  it was about three oclock when i felt a significant pressure of the arm such as one gives when he especially wishes to attract attention it was jason newcome employed in awakening the men of the house without giving such an alarm as might reach the ears without in a few minutes everybody was up and armed  as the morning just before the appearance of light when sleep is heaviest is the hour when savages usually attack no one was surprised at these preparations which were understood to be ordered by herman mordaunt who was afoot and on the lookout himself at a place favourable to observation in the mean time we men three or fourandtwenty in all assembled in the court in waiting for a summons to the gate or the loop jason had executed his trust so dexterously that neither female nor child knew anything of our movement all sleeping or seeming to sleep in the security of a peaceful home i took an occasion to compliment the expedagogue and new miller on the skill he had shown and we fell into a low discourse in consequence  i have been thinking that this warfare may put a new face on these settlements corny continued jason after we had conversed some little time more especially as to the titles  i cannot see how they are to be affected mr newcome unless the french should happen to conquer the colony a thing not very likely to happen  thats just it exactly what i mean as to principle have not these hurons conquered this particular settlement i say they have they are in possession of the whull of it this house excepted and it appears to me that if we ever get repossession it will be by another conquest now what i want to know is thisdoes not conquest give the conquerors a right to the conquered territory i have no books here yet but im dreadful forgetful or i have read that such is the law  i may say that this was the first direct demonstration that jason ever made on the property of herman mordaunt since that time he has made many more some of which i or he who may be called on to continue this narrative will probably relate but i wish to record here this as the first in a long series of attempts which jason newcome has practised in order to transfer the feesimple of the milllot at ravensnest from the ownership of those in whom it is vested by law to that of his own humble but meritorious person  i had little time to answer this very singular sort of reasoning for just then herman mordaunt appeared among us and gave us serious duty to perform the explanations with which his orders were preceded were these as had been anticipated the indians had adopted the only means that could prove effective against such a fortress as the nest without the aid of artillery they were making their preparations to set the building on fire and had been busy all night in collecting a large amount of pineknots roots c which they had succeeded in piling against the outer logs at the point where one wing touched the cliff and where the formation of the ground enabled them to approach the building without incurring much risk their mode of proceeding is worthy of being related one of the boldest and most skilful of their number had crept to the spot and posted himself so close to the logs as to be safe from observation as well as reasonably safe from shot his associates had then extended to him one end of a long pole they standing below some on a shelf of the cliff and the rest on the ground all being safe from harm so long as they kept close to their respective covers thus disposed these children of the forest passed hours in patient toil in forwarding by means of a basket the knots and other combustibles up to the warrior who kept his position close under the building and who piled them in the way most favourable to his object  susquesus had the merit of discovering the projected attempt the arrangements for which had completely escaped the vigilance of the sentinels it would seem that the onondago aware of the artifices of the redman and acquainted in particular with the personal character of jaaps friend muss did not believe the night would go by without some serious attempt on the house the side of the cliff was much the weakest point of the fortress having no other protection than the natural obstacles of the rocks which were not inaccessible though somewhat difficult of ascent and the low picketing already mentioned under such circumstances the indian felt certain the assault would be made on that side placing himself on watch therefore he discovered the first attempts of the hurons but did not let them be known to herman mordaunt until they were nearly completed his reason for the delay being the impatience of the palefaces which would not have suffered the enemy to accomplish his object so far as preparations were concerned the thing of all others he himself thought to be the most desirable by allowing the hurons to waste their time and strength in making arrangements for an assault that was foreseen and which might be met and defeated a great advantage was obtained whereas by driving them prematurely from an artifice they were known to be engaged in they would have recourse to another and the difficulty of discovery would be added to our other disadvantages so susquesus reasoned as was said at the time and it is certain that so he acted  but the time had come to meet these covert preparations herman mordaunt now held a consultation on the subject of our proceedings the question submitted was whether we ought to let the hurons go any further whether we should shoot the adventurous savage who was known still to be posted under the logs of the house and scatter his pile of knots by a sortie or whether it were wiser to let the enemy proceed to the extremity of actually lighting his fire before we unmasked something was to be said in favour of each plan by shooting the savage who had made a lodgment under our walls and scattering his pile we should unquestionably defeat the present attempt but in all probability another would be made the succeeding night whereas by waiting to the last moment such an effectual repulse might be given to our foes as would at once terminate their expedition  on consultation and weighing all the points as they offered it was decided to adopt the latter policy but one spot commanded a view of the pile at all and that was a loop that had been cut only the day before and which looked directly down on the place from a projection that existed in the second story and which ran around the whole building these projections were common enough in the architecture of the provinces at that day being often adopted in exposed positions purposely to afford the means of protecting the inferior and external portions of the dwellings the nest possessed this advantage though the loops necessary to complete the arrangement had only quite recently been cut at this loop then i stationed myself for a short time watching what was going on below the night was dark but there was no difficulty in distinguishing the pile of knots which to me seemed several feet high besides being of some length or in noting the movements of the indian who had built it at the moment i took my stand at the loop this man was actually engaged in setting fire to his combustibles  for several minutes guert and i watched our enemy while he was thus employed for the huron was obliged to proceed with the utmost caution lest a light prematurely shed around should betray him he cautiously lighted his knots quite within the pile having left a place for that purpose and his combustibles were well in flames before the latter began to throw their rays to any distance we had a quantity of water provided in the room from which we beheld all these movements and might at any time have extinguished the fire by pouring a stream through our loop provided we did not wait too long but guert objected to spoiling the sport as he called it insisting that the logs of the house would be slow to ignite and that we might at any moment scatter the knots by a rapid sortie his wish was to let the enemy proceed in his designs as far as would be at all safe in order to render his defeat more overwhelming  owing to our position directly over his head we had no chance to see the face of the incendiary while he was thus engaged at length he cast a glance upward as if to note the effect of the flames which were beginning to throw their forked tongues above the pile when we both recognised jaaps prisoner muss the sight proved too much for guerts philosophy and thrusting the muzzle of his rifle through the loop he blazed away at him without much regard to aim this report was a sort of signal for action the whole house and all the outer world appearing to be in a clamour in an instant i had no means of seeing muss but some of our lookouts who had him in view most of the time told me after all was over that the fellow seemed much astonished at the suddenness of this assault that he gazed up at the loop an instant uttered a loud exclamation then yelled the warwhoop at the top of his voice and went bounding off into the darkness like a buck put up unexpectedly from his lair the fields all around the nest seemed to be alive with whooping demons herman mordaunt had done little towards embellishing the place and stumps were standing in hundreds all about it many having been left within twenty yards of the buildings it now seemed as if every one of these stumps had an indian warrior lodged behind it while bands of them appeared to be leaping about in the gloom under the rocks at one time i fancied we must be surrounded by hundreds of these ruthless foes though i now suppose that their numbers were magnified by their activity and their infernal yells they manifested no intention to attack nevertheless but kept screaming around us in all directions occasionally discharging a rifle but as a whole waiting the moment when the flames should have done their work  considering the fearful circumstances in which he was placed herman mordaunt was wonderfully collected for myself i felt as if i had fifty lives to lose anneke being uppermost in my thoughts the females however behaved uncommonly well making no noise and using all the selfcommand they could assume in order not to distract the exertions of their husbands and friends some of the wives of the sturdy settlers indeed actually exhibited a species of stern courage that would have done credit to soldiers appearing in the court armed and otherwise rendering themselves useful it often happened that women of this class by practising on deer and wolves and bears got to be reasonably expert with firearms and did good service in attacks on their dwellings i remarked in all the commoner class of females that night a sort of fierce hostility to their savage foes in whom they doubtless saw only the murderers of children and wretches who made no distinction of sex or age in pursuing their heartless warfare many of them appeared like the dams of the inferior animals when their young were in danger  an interval of ten or fifteen minutes must have occurred between the moment when guert discharged his rifle and that in which the battle really began all this time the fire was gathering head our tardy attempts to extinguish it proving a complete failure but little apprehension was felt on this account however the flames proving an advantage by casting their light far into the fields and even below the rocks while they did not reach the court at all thus placing a portion of the enemy should they venture to attack under a bright light while it left us in darkness the only point however at which we could fear a serious assault was on the side of the rocks where the court had no other protection than the low but close and tolerably strong picket fortunately the formation of the ground on that side prevented one who stood on the meadows below from firing into the court from any point within the ordinary range of the rifle it was this circumstance that had determined the site of the garrison  such was the state of things when annekes own girl came to ask me to go to her mistress if it were possible for me to quit my station were it only for a minute having no particular duty to perform there was no impropriety in complying with a request which in itself was every way so grateful to my feelings guert was near me at the time and heard what the young negress said this induced him to inquire if there was no message for himself but even at that serious moment mary wallace did not relent she had been kinder than common in manner the previous night as the albanian had admitted but at the same time she had appeared to distrust her own resolution so much as even to give less direct encouragement than had actually escaped her on previous occasions  i found anneke expecting me in that little parlour where i had so recently listened to her sweet confessions of tenderness the evening before she was alone the instinct of her sex teaching her the expediency of having no witness of the feelings and language that might escape two hearts that were united as were ours under circumstances so trying the dear girl was pale as death when i entered she had doubtless been thinking of the approaching conflict and of what might be its frightful consequences but my presence instantly caused her face to be suffused with blushes it being impossible for her sensitive mind not to revert to what had so lately occurred this truth to the instinctive principle of her nature could hardly be extinguished in woman even at the stake itself notwithstanding the liveliness and varying character of her feelings anneke was the first to speak  i have sent for you corny she said laying a hand on her heart as if to quiet its throbbings to say one word in the way of cautioni hope it is not wrong  you can do nothing wrong beloved anneke i answered or nothing that would seem so in my eyes be not thus agitated your fears have increased the danger which we consider as trifling the risks guert dirck and myself have already run are tenfold those which now beset us  the dear girl submitted to have an arm of mine passed around her waist when her head dropped on my breast and she burst into tears enabled by this relief to command her feelings a little it was not long ere anneke raised herself from the endearing embrace i felt impelled to give her though still permitting me to hold both her hands and she looked up into my face with the full confidence of affection renewing the discourse  i could not suffer you to engage in this terrible scene corny she said without one word one look one sign of the interest i feel in you my dear dear father has heard all and though disappointed he does not disapprove you know how warmly he has wished mr bulstrode for a son and can excuse that preference but he desired me not ten minutes since as he left me after giving me a kiss and his blessing to send for you and to say that he shall hereafter look upon you as my and his choice heaven alone knows whether we are to be permitted to meet again dear corny but should that never be granted us i feel it will relieve your mind to know that we shall meet as the members of one family  we are the only children of our parents anneke and our union will gladden their hearts almost as much as it can gladden our own  i have thought of this already i shall have a mother now a blessing i hardly ever knew  and one that will dearly dearly love you as i know by her own opinions again and again expressed in my presence  thank you cornyand thanks to that respected parent too now go corny i am fearful this selfish gratification only adds to the danger of the housego i will pray for your safety  one word dearestpoor guertyou cannot know how disappointed he is that i alone should be summoned here at such a moment  anneke seemed thoughtful and it struck me she was a little distressed  what can i do to alter this she said after a short pause a womans judgment and her feelings may not impel her the same way then mary wallace is a girl who appreciates propriety so highly  i understand you anneke but guert is of so noble a disposition and acknowledges all his defects so meekly and with so much candour man cannot love woman better than he loves mary wallace her extreme prudence is a virtue in his eyes even while he suffers by it  i cannot change mary wallaces nature corny said anneke smiling sadly and as i fancied in a way that said were it i the virtues of guert should soon outweigh his defects but mary will be mary and we must submit perhaps tomorrow may bring her wavering mind to something like decision for these late events have proved greatly mr ten eycks friends but mary is an orphan and prudence has been taught her as her great protection now go corny lest you be missed  the dear girl parted from me hurriedly but not without strong manifestation of feeling i folded her to my heart that being no moment for affectations or conventional distance and i know i was while i trusted anneke might be none the less happy for remembering we had exchanged these proofs of mutual attachment  just as i reached the court i heard a yell without which my experience before ty had taught me was the whoop the hurons give when they attack a rattling fire succeeded and we were instantly engaged in a hot conflict our people fought under one advantage which more than counterbalanced the disadvantage of their inferiority in numbers while two sides of the buildings including that of the meadows or the one on which an assault could alone be successful were in bright light the court still remained sufficiently dark to answer all the purposes of defence we could see each other but could not be distinguished at any distance our persons when seen from without must have been confounded too with the waving shadows of the pickets  as i approached the pickets through the openings of which our people were already keeping up a dropping fire on the darklooking demons who were leaping about on the meadows below i learned from herman mordaunt himself who received me by an affectionate squeeze of the hand that a large body of the enemy was collected directly under the rocks and that guert had assumed the duty of dislodging them he had taken with him on this service dirck jaap and three or four more of the best men including both of our indians the manner in which he proposed to effect this object was bold and like the character of the leader of the party as so much depended on it and on its success i will explain a few of its more essential details  the front of the house ranged north and south facing westward the two wings consequently extended east and west the fire had been built at the verge of the cliff and at the northeast angle of the building this placed the north and east sides of the square in light while it left the west and south in deep darkness the gate opening to the west it was not a very hopeless thing to believe it practicable to lead a small party round the southwest angle of the house to the verge of the cliff where the formation of the ground would allow of a volleys being given upon those savages who were believed to be making a lodgment directly beneath our pickets with a view of seizing a favourable moment to scale them on this errand then herman mordaunt now gave me to understand my friends had gone  who guards the gate the while i asked almost instinctively  mr worden and your old acquaintance and my new tenant newcome they are both armed for a parson will not only fight the battles of the spirit but he will fight those of the field when concerned mr worden has shown himself a man in all this business  without replying i left herman mordaunt and proceeded to the gate myself since there was little to be done in the court there we were strong enough stronger perhaps than was necessary but i greatly distrusted guerts scheme the guard at the gate and most of all the fire  i was soon at mr wordens side there the reverend gentleman was sure enough with jason newcome at his elbow their duty was to keep the gate in that precise condition in which it could be barred or unbarred at the shortest notice as friends or foes might seek admission the parties appeared to be fully aware of the importance of the trust they filled and i asked permission to pass out my first object was the fire for it struck me herman mordaunt felt too much confidence in his means of extinguishing it and that our security had been neglected in that quarter i was no sooner outside the buildings therefore than i turned to steal along the wall to the northwest corner where alone i could get a view of the dangerous pile  the brightness of the glare that was gleaming over the fields and stumps that came within the compass of the light from the fire added to my security by the contrast though it did not tell well for that particular source of danger the dark stumps many of which were charred by the fires of the clearing and were absolutely black seemed to be dancing about in the fields under the waving light and twice i paused to meet imaginary savages ere i had gained the corner of the house each alarm however was idle and i succeeded in obtaining the desired view not only were the knots burning fiercely but a large sheet of flame was clinging to the logs of the house menacing us with a speedy conflagration the danger would have been greater but a thundershower had passed over the settlement only an hour before we were alarmed and coming from the north all that side of the house had been well drenched with rain this occurred after muss had commenced his pile or he might have chosen another side of the building the deep obscurity of that gust however was probably one of the means of his success he must have been at work during the whole continuance of the storm  i was not absent from the gate two minutes that brief space was sufficient for my first purpose i now desired jason to enter the court and to tell herman mordaunt not to delay a moment in applying the means for extinguishing the flames there was greater danger from them than there possibly could be from any other attack upon the pickets made in the darkness of the morning jason was cool by temperament and he was a good agent to be employed on such a duty promising to be quick he left us and i turned my face towards guert and his party as yet nothing had been heard of the last this very silence was a source of alarm though it was difficult to imagine the adventurer had met with an enemy since such a collision must have been somewhat noisy a few spattering shot all of which came from the west side of the buildings and the flickering light of the fire were the only interruptions to the otherwise deathlike calm of the hour  the same success attended me in reaching the southwest as in reaching the northwest angle of the house to me it seemed as if the savages had entirely abandoned the fields in my vicinity when i took my stand at this corner of the building i found all its southern side in obscurity though sufficient light was gleaming over the meadows to render the ragged edges of the cliff visible in that direction i looked along the log walls to this streak of light but could see no signs of my friends i was certain they were not under the house and began to apprehend some serious indiscretion on the part of the bold albanian while engaged in endeavouring to get a clue to guerts movements by devouring every dark object i could perceive with my eyes i felt an elbow touched lightly and saw a savage in his halfnaked fighting attire at my side i could see enough to ascertain this but could not distinguish faces i was feeling for my huntingknife when the tracklesss voice stayed my hand  he wrongsaid the onondago with emphasis head too younghand goodheart goodhead very bad too much firedark heremuch better  this characteristic criticism on poor guerts conduct served to tell the whole story guert had put himself in a position in which the onondago had refused to remain in other words he had gone to the verge of the cliff where he was exposed to the light of the fire and where he was necessarily in danger of being seen still no signs of him were visible and i was on the point of moving along the south side of the building to the margin of the rocks when the trackless again touched my arm and said there  there our party was sure enough it had managed to reach the verge of the rocks at a salient point which placed them in an admirable position for raking the enemy who were supposed to be climbing to the pickets with a view to a sudden spring but at a dangerous distance from the buildings the darkness had been the means of their reaching that point which was about a hundred yards from the spot where i had expected to find them and admirably placed for the intended object the whole procedure was so much like guerts character that i could not but admire its boldness while i condemned its imprudence there was however no time to join the party or to warn its leader of the risks he ran we who stood so far in the rear could see and fully appreciate all the danger while he probably did not there the whole party of them stood plainly though darkly drawn in high relief against the light beyond each poising his rifle and making his dispositions for the volley guert was nearest to the verge of the rocks actually bending over them dirck was close at his side jaap just behind dirck jumper close at jaaps elbow and four of the settlers bold and hardy men behind the oneida  i could scarcely breathe for painful expectation when i saw guert and his companions thus rising from the earth bringing their entire figures in front of the background of light i could have called out to warn them of the danger they ran but it would have done no good nor was there time for remonstrances guert must have felt he occupied a dangerous position and what he did was done very promptly ten seconds after i saw the dark forms all their rifles were discharged as it might be at a single crack one instant passed in deathlike stillness through all the fields and in the court then came a volley from among the stumps at a little distance from our side of the building and the adventurers on the rocks or those that could rushed towards the gate two of the settlers however and the oneida i saw fall myself the last actually leaped upward into the air and went down the cliff but guert dirck jaap and the other two settlers had moved away it was at that moment that my ears were filled with such yells as i had not supposed the human throat could raise and all the fields on our side of the house seemed alive with savages to render the scene more appalling that was the precise instant when the water previously provided by herman mordaunt fell upon the flames and the light vanished almost as one extinguishes a candle but for this providential coincidence there was scarce a chance for the escape of one of the adventurers as it was rifle followed rifle from among the stumps though it was no longer with any certain aim  the battle had now become a mélée the savages went leaping and whooping forward in the darkness and heavy blows were given and taken guerts clear manly voice was heard rising above the clamour encouraging his companions to press through the throng of their assailants in tones full of confidence both the trackless and myself discharged our rifles at the foremost of the hurons and each certainly brought down his man but it was not easy to see what we could do next to stand aloof and see my friends borne down by numbers was impossible however and susquesus and myself fell upon the enemys rear this charge of ours had the appearance of a sortie and it produced a decided effect on the result opening a passage by which dirck and the two settlers issued from the throng and joined us this was no sooner done than we all had to stand at bay retreating little by little as we could the result would still have been doubtful even after we had succeeded in reaching the southwestern angle of the building had it not been for a forward movement on the part of herman mordaunt at the head of halfadozen of his settlers this reinforcement came into the affair with loaded rifles and a single discharge given as soon as we were in a line with our friends caused our assailants to vanish as suddenly as they had appeared on reflecting on the circumstances of that awful night in afterlife i have thought that the force in the rear of the hurons began to melt away even before herman mordaunts support was received leaving their front weak and unsustained at any rate the enemy fled to their covers as has just been related and we entered the gate in a body closing and barring it as soon as possible  i can scarcely describe the change that had come over the appearance of things in that eventful night the fire was extinguished even to the embers and deep darkness had succeeded to the glimmering waving red light of the flames the yells and whoops and screams and shouts for our men had frequently thrown back the defiance of their foes in cheers were done a stillness as profound as that of the grave reigning over the whole place the wounded seemed ashamed even to groan but our hurt of whom there were four went into the house to be cared for stern and silent no enemy was any longer to be apprehended beneath the pickets for the streak of morning was just appearing above the forest in the east and indians rarely attack under the light of day in a word that night at least was passed and we were yet protected by providence  herman mordaunt now bethought him of ascertaining his precise situation the extent of his own loss and as far as possible of that which we had inflicted on the enemy guert was called for to aid in this inquiry but no guert was to be found jaap too was absent a muster was had and then it was found that guert ten eyck jaap satanstoe gilbert davis and moses mudge were all wanting the jumper too did not appear but i accounted for him and for the two settlers named having actually seen them fall day returned to us slowly while agitated by the effect of these discoveries but it brought no relief we soon ventured to reopen the gates knowing no indian would remain very near the building while it was light and having examined all the dangerous covers we passed outside the court with confidence in quest of the bodies of our friends not an indian was seen jumper excepted the oneida lay at the foot of the rocks dead and scalped as did davis and mudge on the summit everything else human had disappeared dirck was confident that six or seven of the hurons fell by the volley from the cliff but the bodies had been carried off as to guert and jaap no traces of them remained dead or alive     chapter xxix    she looked on many a face with vacant eye   on many a token without knowing what   she saw them watch her without asking why   and reckd not who around her pillow sat   not speechless though she spoke not not a sigh   relieved her thoughts dull silence and quick chat   were tried in vain by by those who served she gave   no sign save breath of having left the grave    byron   it was a most painful moment to me when herman mordaunt an hour after all these facts were established came to summon me to the presence of anneke and mary wallace one gleam of joy one ray of the sunshine of the heart shone on annekes sweet countenance as she saw me unharmed enter the room but it quickly disappeared in the strong sympathy she felt for the sufferings of her friend as for mary wallace death itself could hardly have left her more colourless or with features more firmly impressed with the expression of mental suffering anneke was the first to speak  god be praised that this dreadful night is passed and you and my dearest father are spared the precious girl said with fervour pressing the hand that had taken one of hers in both her own for this much at least we can be grateful would i could add for the safety of us all  tell me the worst at once mr littlepage added mary wallace i can bear anything better than uncertainty mr mordaunt says that you know the facts better than any one else and that you must relate them speak then though it break my heart to hear itis he killed  i hope through heavens mercy not indeed i think not though i fear he must be a prisoner  thank you for that dear dear mr littlepage oh thank you for that from the bottom of my heart but may they not torture him do not these hurons torture their prisoners conceal nothing from me corny you cannot imagine how much selfcommand i have and how well i can behave oh conceal nothing  poor girl at the very moment she was boasting of her fortitude and ability to endure her whole frame was trembling from head to foot her face was of the hue of death and the smile with which she spoke was frightfully haggard that pentup passion which had so long struggled with her prudence could no longer be suppressed that she really loved guert and that her love would prove stronger than her discretion i had not doubted now for some months but never having before witnessed the strength of any feeling that had been so long and so painfully suppressed i confess that this exhibition of a suffering so intense in a being so delicate so excellent and so lovely almost unmanned me i took mary wallaces hand and led her to a chair scarce knowing what to say to relieve her mind all this time her eye never turned from mine as if she hoped to learn the truth by the aid of the sense of sight alone how anxious jealous distrustful and yet beseeching was that gaze  will he be tortured she rather whispered huskily than asked aloud  i trust by gods mercy not they have taken my slave jaap also and it is far more probable that he would be the victim in such a case than mr ten eyck  why do you call him mr ten eyck you have always called him guert of lateyou are his friendyou think well of himyou cannot be less his friend now that he is miserable than when he was happy and the pride of all human eyes in his strength and manly beauty  dear miss wallace compose yourself i do entreat of youno one will cling to guert longer than i  yes i have always thought thisalways felt this guert cannot be low or mean in his sentiments while an educated gentleman like corny littlepage is his friend i have written to my aunt and we must not be too hasty in our judgments the spirit and follies of youth will soon be over and then we shall see a shining character in guert ten eyck is not this true anneke  anneke knelt at the side of her friend folded her in her arms drew the quivering head down upon her own sympathising bosom and held it there a moment in the very attitude of protecting solacing love after a brief pause mary wallace burst into tears and i have ever thought that that relief under gods mercy saved her reason in a few minutes the sufferer became more calm when she retired into herself as was her wont leaving anneke and me to discuss the subject  after turning all the chances and probabilities in our minds i promised my companions not to lose a moment but to use immediate means of ascertaining all that could be ascertained in guerts behalf and of doing everything that could be done to save him  you will not deceive me corny whispered mary wallace pressing my hand at leavetaking in both her own i know i can depend on you for he boasts of being your friend  annekes painful smile added force to this request and i tore myself away unwilling to quit such a sufferer yet unable to remain herman mordaunt was seen conversing with susquesus in the court and i joined him at once determined to lose no time  i was speaking to the trackless on this very subject answered herman mordaunt as soon as i had explained my purpose and am now waiting for his answer do you think it then safe to send a messenger out to the hurons in order to inquire after our friends and to treat with them  no sendwhy not returned the indian red man glad to see messenger go when he want come back when he want how can make bargain if scalp messenger  i had heard that the most savage tribes respected a messenger and indeed the necessity of so doing was of itself a sort of security that such must be the case it was true that the bearer of a flag might be in more danger on such an errand than would be the case in a camp of civilized men but these canadaindians had been long serving with the french and their chiefs beyond a question had obtained some of the notions of paleface warfare without much reflection therefore and under an impulse in behalf of my friend and my slavefor jaaps fate was of lively interest with mei volunteered to bear a flag myself herman mordaunt shook his head and seemed reluctant to comply  anneke would hardly pardon me for consenting to that he answered you must remember now corny that a very tender and sensitive heart is bound up in you and you must no longer act like a thoughtless single man it would be far better to send this onondago if he will agree to go he understands the red men and will be able to interpret the omens with more certainty than any of us what say you susquesus will you be a messenger to the hurons  sartainwhy no go if he want good to be messenger sometime where wampumwhat tell him  thus encouraged we deliberated together and soon had susquesus in readiness to depart as for the indian he laid aside all his arms washed the warpaint from his face put a calico shirt over his shoulders and assumed the guise of peace we gave him a small white flag to carry feeling certain that the huron chiefs must understand its meaning and thinking it might be better in bearing a message from palefaces that he who carried it should have a paleface symbol of his errand susquesus found some wampum too having as much faith in that probably as in anything else he then set forth being charged to offer liberal ransom to the hurons for the living uninjured bodies of guert ten eyck and jaap satanstoe  we entertained no doubt that the enemy would be found in the ravine for that was the point in every respect most favourable to the operations of the siege being near the house having a perfect cover possessing water wood and other conveniences from that point the nest could be watched and any favourable chance improved thither then susquesus was told to proceed though it was not thought advisable to fetter one so shrewd with too many instructions several of us accompanied the onondago to the gate and saw him moving across the fields towards the wood in his usual loping trot a bird could scarcely have flown more directly to its object  the halfhour that succeeded the disappearance of susquesus in the mouth of the ravine was one of intensely painful suspense we all remained without the gate waiting the result including dirck mr worden jason and halfadozen of the settlers at length the onondago reappeared and to our great joy a group followed him in which were both the prisoners the last were bound but able to walk this party might have contained a dozen of the enemy all of whom were armed it moved slowly out of the ravine and ascended to the fields that were on a level with the house halting when about four hundred yards from us seeing this movement we counted out exactly the same number of men and went forward halting at a distance of two hundred yards from the indians here we waited for our messenger who continued on after the hurons had come to a stand thus far everything looked propitious  do you bring us good news herman mordaunt eagerly asked are our friends unhurt  got scalpno hurttake prisonerjump on em ten two sixcotch em then open eyes you see  and the huronsdo they seem inclined to accept the ransom rum rifle blanket and powder you offered all i hope susquesus  sartain no forget that bad say take all that some more too  and they have come to treat with us what are we to do now susquesus  put down riflego near and talk you gopriest goyoung chief gothat tree then tree warrior lay down rifle come talk too prisoner wait all good  this was sufficiently intelligible and believing that anything like hesitation might make the condition of guert desperate we prepared to comply i could see that the rev mr worden had no great relish for the business but was ashamed to hang back when he saw herman mordaunt cheerfully advancing to the interview we three were met by as many hurons among whom was jaaps friend muss who was evidently the leading person of the party guert and jaap were held bound about a hundred yards in the rear but near enough to be spoken to by raising the voice guert was in his shirt and breeches with his head uncovered his fine curly hair blowing about in the wind and i thought i saw some signs of blood on his linen this might be his own or it might have come from an enemy i called to him therefore inquiring how he did and whether he were hurt  nothing to speak of corny i thank you was the cheerful answer these red gentlemen have had me tied to a tree and have been seeing how near they could hurl their tomahawks without hitting this is one of their customary amusements and i have got a scratch or two in the sport i hope the ladies are in good spirits and do not let the business of last night distress them  there is blessed news for you guertsusquesus ask these chiefs if i may go near my friend to give him one word of consolationon my honour no attempt to release him will be made by me until i return here  i spoke earnestly and the onondago interpreted what i had said into the language of the hurons i had made this somewhat hardy request under an impulse that i found ungovernable and was surprised as well as pleased to find it granted these savages confided in my word and trusted to my honour with a stately delicacy that might have done credit to the manners of civilized kings giving themselves no apparent concern about my movements although they occurred in their own rear it was too late to retract and leaving herman mordaunt endeavouring to drive a bargain with muss and his two companions i proceeded unconcerned myself boldly towards the armed men who held guert and jaap prisoners i thought my approach did cause a slight movement among these savages and there was a question and answer passed between them and their leaders the latter said but a word or two but these were uttered authoritatively and with a commanding toss of a hand brief as they were they answered the purpose and i was neither molested nor spoken to during the short interview i had with my friend  god bless you corny for this guert cried with feeling as i warmly shook his hand it requires a warm heart and a bold one too to lead a man into this lions den stay but a moment lest some evil come of it i beg of you this squeeze of the hand is worth an estate to a man in my situation but remember anneke ah corny my dear friend i could be happy even here did i know that mary wallace grieved for me  then be happy guert my sole object in venturing here was to tell you to hope everything in that quarter there will be no longer any coyness any hesitation any misgivings when you shall be once restored to us  mr littlepage you would not trifle with the feelings of a miserable captive hanging between torture and death is my present case i can hardly credit my senses yet you would not mock me  believe all i saynay all you wish guert it is seldom that woman loves as she loves and this i swear to you i go now only to aid herman mordaunt in bringing you where your own ears shall hear such proofs of what i say as have been uttered in mine  guert made no answer but i could see he was profoundly affected i squeezed his hand and we parted in the full hope on my side at least that the separation would be short i have reason to think guert shed tears for on looking back i perceived his face turned away from those who were nearest to him i had but a single glance at jaap my fellow stood a little in the rear as became his colour but he watched my countenance with the vigilance of a cat i thought it best not to speak to him though i gave him a secret sign of encouragement  these chiefs are not very amicably disposed corny said herman mordaunt the instant i rejoined him they have given me to understand that jaap will be liberated on no terms whatever they must have his scalp as susquesus tells me on account of some severity he himself has shown to one of these chiefs to use their own language they want it for a plaster to this warriors back his fate it would seem is sealed and he has only been brought out yonder to raise hopes in him that are to be disappointed the wretches do not scruple to avow this in their own sententious manner as for guert they say he slew two of their warriors and that their wives will miss their husbands and will not be easily quieted unless they see his scalp too they offer to release him however on either of two sets of terms they will give up guert for two of what they call chiefs or for four common men if we do not like those conditions they will exchange him on condition we give two common men for him and abandon the nest to them by marching out with all my people before the sun is up above our heads  conditions that you cannot accept under any circumstances i fear sir  certainly not the delivery of any two is out of the questionwould be so even to save my own life as for the nest and its contents i would very willingly abandon all a few papers excepted had i the smallest faith in the chiefs being able to restrain their followers but the dreadful massacre of williamhenry is still too recent to confide in anything of the sort my answer is given already and we are about to part possibly when they see us determined they may lower their demands a little  a grave parting wave of the hand was given by muss who had conducted himself with great dignity in the interview and the three hurons walked away in a body  best go said susquesus significantly maybe want rifle hurons in arnest  on this hint we returned to our friends and resumed our arms what succeeded i learned in part by the relations of others while a part was witnessed by my own eyes it seems that jaap from the first understood the desperate nature of his own position the remembrance of his misdeeds in relation to muss whose prisoner he had more especially become most probably increased his apprehensions and his thoughts were constantly bent on obtaining his liberty by means entirely independent of negotiation from the instant he was brought out of the ravine he kept all his eyes about him watching for the smallest chance of effecting his purpose it happened that one of the savages so placed himself before the negro who was kept behind all near him as to enable jaap to draw the hurons knife from its sheath without being detected he did this while i was actually with the party and all eyes were on me guert and himself were bound by having their arms fastened above the elbows behind the back and when guert turned aside to shed tears as mentioned jaap succeeded in cutting his fastenings this could be done only while the savages were following my retreating form with their eyes at the same time jaap gave the knife to guert who did him a similar service as the indians did not take the alarm the prisoners paused a moment holding their arms as if still bound to look around them the indian nearest guert had two rifles his own and that of muss both leaning negligently against his shoulder with their breeches on the ground to these weapons guert pointed and when the three chiefs were on the point of rejoining their friends who were attentive to their movements in order to ascertain the result guert seized this savage by his arm which he twisted until the indian yelled with pain then caught one rifle while jaap laid hold of the other each fired and brought down his man then they made an onset with the butts of their pieces on the rest of the party this bold assault though so desperate in appearance was the wisest thing they could do as immediate flight would have left their enemies an opportunity of sending the swift runners of their pieces in pursuit  the first intimation we had of any movement of this sort was in the reports of the rifles then i not only saw but i heard the tremendous blow jaap gave to the head of muss a blow that demolished both the victim and the instrument of his destruction though the breech of the rifle was broken the heavy barrel still remained and the negro flourished it with a force that swept all before him it is scarcely necessary to say guert was not idle in such a fray he fought for mary wallace as well as for himself and he overturned two more of the indians as it might be in the twinkling of an eye here dirck did good service to our friends his rifle was in his hands and levelling it with coolness he shot down a powerful savage who was on the point of seizing guert from behind this was the commencement of a general war volleys now coming from both parties from ourselves and from the enemy who were in the cover of the woods intimidated by the fury of the personal assault under which they were suffering the remaining indians near guert and the negro leaped away towards their friends yelling leaving their late prisoners free but more exposed to fire than they could have been when encircled even by enemies  everything passed with fearful rapidity guert seized the rifle of a fallen indian and jaap obtained another when they fell back towards us like two lions at bay with riflebullets whizzing around them at every step of course we fired and we also advanced to meet them an imprudent step since the main body of the hurons were covered rendering the contest unequal but there was no resisting the sympathetic impulses of such a moment or the exultation we all felt at the exploits of guert and jaap enacted as they were before our eyes as we drew together the former shouted and cried  hurrah corny my noble fellowlet us charge the woottherell not be a reatskin left in it in five minutes forwart my friendsforwart all  it certainly was an exciting moment we all shouted in our turns and all cried forward in common even mr worden joined in the shout and pressed forward jason too fought bravely and we went at the wood like so many bulldogs i fancy the pedagogue thought the feesimple of his mills depended on the result on we went in open order reserving our fire for the last moment but receiving dropping shots that did us no harm until we dashed into the thicket  the hurons were discomfited and they fled though a panic is not usual among those wild warriors they seldom rally on the field if once driven against their will a close pursuit will usually disperse them for a time and such was the case now by the time i got fairly into the ravine i could see or hear of no enemy my friends were on my right and left shouting and pressing on but there was no foe visible guert and jaap were in advance for we could not overtake them and they had fired for they got the last glimpses of the enemy but one more shot did come from the hurons in that inroad it was fired from some one of the retreating party who must have been lingering in its rear the report sounded far up the ravine and it came like a farewell and final gun distant as it was however it proved the most fatal shot to us that was fired in all that affair i caught a glimpse of guert through the trees and saw him fall in an instant i was at his side  what a change is that from the triumph of victory to the sudden approach of death i saw by the expression of guerts countenance as i raised him in my arms that the blow was fatal the ball indeed had passed directly through his body missing the bones but injuring the vitals there is no mistaking the expression of a deathwound on the human countenance when the effect is direct and not remote nature appears to admonish the victim of his fate so it was with guert  this shot has done for me corny he said and it seems to be the very last they intended to fire i almost hope there can be no truth in what you told me of mary wallace  that was neither the time nor the place to speak on such a subject and i made no answer from the instant the fall of guert became known the pursuit ceased and our whole party collected around the wounded man the indian alone seemed to retain any consciousness of the importance of knowing what the enemy was doing for his philosophy was not easily disturbed by the sudden appearance of death among us still he liked guert as did every one who could get beyond the weaknesses of his outer character and fairly at the noble traits of his manly nature susquesus looked at the sufferer a moment gravely and not without concern then he turned to herman mordaunt and said  this badsave scalp that good though carry him in house susquesus follow trail and see what injin mean  as this was well he was told to watch the enemy while we bore our friend towards the nest dirck consented to precede us and let the melancholy truth be known while i continued with guert who held my hand the whole distance we were a most melancholy procession for victors not a serious hurt had any of our party received in this last affair the wound of guert ten eyck excepted yet i question if more real sorrow would have been felt over two or three other deaths we had become accustomed to our situation it is wonderful how soon the soldier does rendering death familiar and disarming him of half his terrors but calamities can and do occur to bring back an army to a sense of its true nature and its dependence on providence such had been the effect of the loss of lord howe on the troops before ticonderoga and such was the effect of the fall of guert ten eyck on the small band that was collected to defend the possessions and firesides of ravensnest  we entered the gate of the house and found most of its tenants already in the court collected like a congregation in a church that awaits the entrance of the dead herman mordaunt had sent an order to have his own room prepared for the sufferer and thither we carried guert he was placed on the bed then the crowd silently withdrew i observed that guerts eyes turned anxiously and inquiringly around and i told him in a low voice i would go for the ladies myself a smile and a pressure of the hand showed how well i had interpreted his thoughts  somewhat to my surprise i found mary wallace pale it is true but comparatively calm and mistress of herself that instinct of propriety which seems to form a part of the nature of a welleducated woman had taught her the necessity of selfcommand that no outbreak of her feelings should affect the sufferer as for anneke she was like herself gentle mourning and full of sympathy for her friend  as soon as apprised of the object of my visit the two girls expressed their readiness to go to guert as they knew the way i did not attend them purposely proceeding an another direction in order not to be a witness of the interview anneke has since told me however that marys selfcommand did not altogether desert her while guerts cheerful gratitude probably so far deceived her as to create a shortlived hope that the wound was not mortal for myself i passed an hour in attending to the state of things in and around the house in order to make certain that no negligence occurred still to endanger our security at the end of that time i returned to guert meeting herman mordaunt near the door of his room  the little hope we had is vanished said the last in a sorrowful tone poor ten eyck has beyond a question received his deathwound and has but a few hours to live were my people safe i would rather that everything at ravensnest house and estate were destroyed than had this happen  prepared by this announcement i was not as much surprised as i might otherwise have been at the great change that had occurred in my friend since the time i quitted his room it was evident he anticipated the result nevertheless he was calm nay apparently happy nor was he so much enfeebled as to prevent his speaking quite distinctly and with sufficient ease when the machine of life is stopped by the sudden disruption of a vital ligament the approaches of death though more rapid than with disease are seldom so apparent the first evidences of a fatal termination are discovered rather through the nature of the violence than by means of apparent effects  i have said that guert seemed even happy though death was so near anneke told me subsequently that mary wallace had owned her love in answer to an earnest appeal on his part and from that moment he had expressed himself as one who was about to die contented poor guert it was little he thought of the dread future or of the church on earth except as the last was entitled to and did receive on all occasions his outward respect it seemed that mary wallace habitually so reserved and silent among her friends had been accustomed to converse freely with guert and that she had made a serious effort during her residence in albany to enlighten his mind or rather to arouse his feelings on this allimportant subject and that guert sensible of the pleasure of receiving instruction from such a source always listened with attention when i entered the room some allusion had just been made to this theme  but for you mary i should be little better than a heathen said guert holding the hand of his beloved and scarce averting his eyes from their idol a single instant if god has mercy on me it will be on your account  oh nononoguert say not think not thus exclaimed mary wallace shocked at this excess of his attachment even for herself at such a moment we all receive our pardons through the death and mediation of his blessed son nothing else can save you or any of us my dear dear guert and i implore you not to think otherwise  guert looked a little bewildered still he looked pleased the first expression was probably produced by his not exactly comprehending the nature of that mysterious expiation which baffles the unaided powers of man and which indeed is to be felt rather than understood the look of pleasure had its origin in the dear dear guert and more than that in the consciousness of possessing the affections of the woman he had so long loved almost against hope guert ten eyck was a man of bold and reckless character in all that pertained to risks frolic and youthful adventure but the meekest christian could scarcely possess a more lowly opinion of his own frailties and sins than this dashing young fellow possessed of his own claims to be valued by such a being as mary wallace i often wondered how he ever presumed to love her but suppose the apparent vanity must be ascribed to the resistless power of a passion that is known to be the strongest of our nature it was also a sort of moral anomaly that two so opposed to each other in character the one verging on extreme recklessness the other pushing prudence almost to prudery the one so gay as to seem to live for frolic the other quiet and reserved should conceive this strong predilection for each other but so it was i have heard persons say however that these varieties in temperament awaken interest and that they who have commenced with such dissimilarities but have assimilated by communion attachment and habits after all make the happiest couples  mary wallace lost all her reserve in the gush of tenderness and sympathy that now swept all before it throughout the whole of that morning she hung about guert as the mother watches the ailing infant if his thirst was to be assuaged her hand held the cup if his pillow was to be replaced her care suggested the alteration if his brow was to be wiped she performed that office for him suffering no other to come between her and the object of her solicitude  there were moments when the manner in which mary wallace hung over guert was infinitely touching anneke and i knew that her very soul yearned to lead his thoughts to dwell on the subject of the great change that was so near nevertheless the tenderness of the woman was so much stronger than even the anxiety of the christian that we perceived she feared the influence on his wound at length happily for an anxiety that was beginning to be too painful for endurance guert spoke on the subject himself whether his mind adverted naturally to such a topic or he perceived the solicitude of his gentle nurse i could not say  i cannot stay with you long mary he said and i should like to have mr wordens prayers united to yours offered up in my behalf corny will seek the dominie for an old friend  i vanished from the room and was absent ten minutes at the end of that time mr worden was ready in his surplice and we went to the sick room certainly our old pastor had not the way of manifesting the influence of religion that is usual to the colonies especially to those of the more northern and eastern portion of the country yet there was a heartiness in his manner of praying at times that almost persuaded me he was a good man i will own however that mr worden was one of those clergymen who could pray much more sincerely for certain persons than for others he was partial to poor guert and i really thought this was manifest in his accents on this melancholy occasion  the dying man was relieved by this attention to the rites of the church guert was not a metaphysician and at no period of his life i believe did he ever enter very closely into the consideration of those fearful questions which were connected with his existence origin destination and position in the long scale of animated beings he had those general notions on these subjects that all civilized men imbibe by education and communion with their fellows but nothing more he understood it was a duty to pray and i make no doubt he fancied there were times and seasons in which this duty was more imperative than at others and times and seasons when it might be dispensed with  how tenderly and how anxiously did mary wallace watch over her patient during the whole of that sad day she seemed to know neither weariness nor fatigue towards evening it was just as the sun was tinging the summits of the trees with its parting light she came towards anneke and myself with a face that was slightly illuminated with something like a glow of pleasure and whispered to us that guert was better within ten minutes of that moment i approached the bed and saw a slight movement of the patients hand as if he desired me to come nearer  corny said guert in a low languid voiceit is nearly all over i wish i could see mary wallace once more before i die  mary was not could not be distant she fell upon her knees and clasped the yielding form of her lover to her heart nothing was said on either side or if aught were said it was whispered and was of a nature too sacred to be communicated to others in that attitude did this young woman long so coy and so difficult to decide remain for near an hour and in that quiet cherishing womanly embrace did guert ten eyck breathe his last  i left the sufferer as much alone with the woman of his heart as comported with prudence and a proper attention on my part but it was my melancholy duty to close his eyes thus prematurely terminated the earthly career of as manly a spirit as ever dwelt in human form that it had imperfections my pen has not concealed but the long years that have since passed away have not served to obliterate the regard so noble a temperament could not fail to awaken     chapter xxx    how slow the day slides on when we desire   times haste he seems to lose a match with lobsters   and when we wish him stay he imps his wings   with feathers plumed with thought    albamazar   it is unnecessary to dwell on the grief that we all felt for our loss that night was necessarily one of watchfulness but few were inclined to sleep the return of light found us unmolested however and an hour or two later susquesus came in and reported that the enemy had retreated towards ticonderoga there was nothing more to fear from that quarter and the settlers soon began to return to their dwellings or to such as remained in the course of a week the axe again rang in the forest and rude habitations began to reappear in the places of those that had been destroyed as bulstrode could not well be removed herman mordaunt determined to pass the remainder of the season at ravensnest with the double view of accommodating his guest and of encouraging his settlers the danger was known to be over for that summer at least and ere the approach of another it was hoped that the humiliated feelings of great britain would so far be aroused as to drive the enemy from the province as indeed was effectually done  on consultation it was decided that the body of guert ought to be sent for interment among his friends to albany dirck and myself accompanied it as the principal attendants all that remained of our party going with us herman mordaunt thought it necessary to remain at ravensnest and anneke would not quit her father the rev mr wordens missionary zeal had by this trial effectually evaporated and he profited by so favourable an occasion to withdraw into the safer and more peopled districts i well remember as we marched after the horselitter that carried the remains of poor guert the divines making the following sensible remarks  you see how it is on this frontier corny he said it is premature to think of introducing christianity christianity is essentially a civilized religion and can only be of use among civilized beings it is true my young friend that many of the early apostles were not learned after the fashion of this world but they were all thoroughly civilized palestine was a civilized country and the hebrews were a great people and i consider the precedent set by our blessed lord is a command to be followed in all time and that his appearance in judea is tantamount to his saying to his apostles go and preach me and my gospel to all civilized people  i ventured to remark that there was something like a direct command to preach it to all nations to be found in the bible  ay that is true enough answered mr worden but it clearly means all civilized nations then this was before the discovery of america and it is fair enough to presume that the command referred solely to known nations the texts of scripture are not to be strained but are to be construed naturally corny and this seems to me to be the natural reading of that passage no i have been rash and imprudent in pushing duty to exaggeration and shall confine my labours to their proper sphere during the remainder of my days civilization is just as much a means of providence as religion itself and it is clearly intended that one should be built on the other a clergyman goes quite far enough from the centre of refinement when he quits home to come into these colonies to preach the gospel letting alone these scalping devils the indians who i greatly fear were never born to be saved it may do well enough to have societies to keep them in view but a meeting in london is quite near enough ever to approach them  such ever after appeared to be the sentiments of the rev mr worden and i took no pains to change them i ought however to have alluded to the parting with anneke before i gave the foregoing extract from the parsons homily circumstances prevented my having much private communication with my betrothed before quitting the nest for annekes sympathy with mary wallace was too profound to permit her to think much just then of aught but the latters sorrows as for mary herself the strength and depth of her attachment and grief were never fully appreciated until time came to vindicate them her seeming calm was soon restored for it was only under a tempest of feeling that mary wallace lost her selfcommand and the affliction that was inevitable and irremediable one of her regulated temperament and high principles struggled to endure with christian submission it was only in afterlife that i came to know how intense and absorbing had in truth been her passion for the gay highspirited illeducated and impulsive young albanian  anneke wept for a few minutes in my arms a quarter of an hour before our melancholy procession quitted the nest the dear girl had no undue reserve with me though i found her a little reluctant to converse on the subject of our own loves so soon after the fearful scenes we had just gone through still she left me in no doubt on the allimportant point of my carrying away with me her whole and entirely undivided heart bulstrode she never had never could love this she assured me over and over again he amused her and she felt for him some of the affection and interest of kindred but not the least of any other interest poor bulstrode now i was certain of success i had very magnanimous sentiments in his behalf and could give him credit for various good qualities that had been previously obscured in my eyes herman mordaunt had requested nothing might be said to the major of my engagement though an early opportunity was to be taken by himself to let the suitor understand that anneke declined the honour of his hand it was thought the information would best come from him  i shall be frank with you littlepage and confess i have been very anxious for the union of my daughter and mr bulstrode added herman mordaunt in the interview we had before i left the nest and i trust to your own good sense to account for it i knew bulstrode before i had any knowledge of yourself and there was already a connection between us that was just of a nature to render one that was closer desirable i shall not deny that i fancied anneke fitted to adorn the station and circles to which bulstrode would have carried her and perhaps it is a natural parental weakness to wish to see ones child promoted we talk of humility and contentment corny though there is much of the nolo episcopari about it after all but you see that the preference of the child is so much stronger than that of the parent that it must prevail i dare say after all you would much rather be annekes choice than be mine  i can have no difficulty in admitting that sir i answered and i feel very sensible of the liberal manner in which you yield your own preferences to our wishes certainly in the way of rank and fortune i have little to offer mr mordaunt as an offset to mr bulstrodes claims but in love for your daughter and in an ardent desire to make her happy i shall not yield to him or any other man though he were a king  in the way of fortune littlepage i have very few regrets as you are to live in this country the joint means of the two families which some day must centre in you and anneke will prove allsufficient and as for posterity ravensnest and mooseridge will supply ample provisions as the colony grows your descendants will increase and your means will increase with both no no i may have been a little disappointed that much i will own but i have not been at any time displeased god bless you then my dear boy write us from albany and come to us at lilacs bush in september your reception will be that of a son  it is needless to dwell on the melancholy procession we formed through the woods dirck and myself kept near the body on foot until we reached the highway when vehicles were provided for the common transportation on reaching albany we delivered the remains of guert to his relatives and there was a suitable funeral given the bricked closet behind the chimney was opened as usual and the six dozen of madeira that had been placed in it twentyfour years before or the day the poor fellow was christened was found to be very excellent i remember it was said generally that better wine was drunk at the funeral of guert ten eyck than had been tasted at the obsequies of any individual who was not a van rensselaer a schuyler or a ten broeck within the memory of man i now speak of funerals in albany for i do suppose the remark would scarcely apply to many other funerals lower down the river as a rule however very good wine was given at all our funerals  the rev mr worden officiated and was universally regarded with interest as a pious minister of the gospel who had barely escaped the fate of the person he was now committing dust to dust while devotedly and ardently employed in endeavouring to rescue the souls of the very savages who sought his life from the fate of the heathen  i remember there was a very well worded paragraph to this effect in the new york gazette and i had heard it said but do not remember to have ever seen it myself that in one of the reports of the society for the promulgation of the gospel in foreign parts the circumstances were alluded to in a very touching and edifying manner  poor guert i passed a few minutes at his grave before we went south it was all that was left of his fine person his high spirit his lionhearted courage his buoyant spirits and his unextinguishable love of frolic a finer physical man i never beheld or one who better satisfied the eye in all respects that the noble tenement was not more intellectually occupied was purely the consequence of a want of education notwithstanding all the books in the world could not have converted guert ten eyck into a jason newcome or jason newcome into a guert ten eyck each owed many of his peculiarities doubtless to the province in which he was bred and born and to the training consequent on these accidents but nature had also drawn broad distinctions between them all the wildness of guerts impulses could not altogether destroy his feelings tone and tact as a gentleman while all the soaring extravagant pretensions of jason never could have ended in elevating him to that character alas poor guert i sincerely mourned his loss for years nor has his memory yet ceased to have a deep interest with me  dirck follock and i would have been a good deal caressed at albany on our return both on account of what had happened and on account of our dutch connections had we been in the mood to profit by the disposition of the people but we were not the sad events with which we had been connected were still too recent to indulge in gaieties or company and as soon as possible after the funeral we seized the opportunity of embarking on board a sloop bound to new fork our voyage was generally considered a prosperous one lasting indeed only six days we took the ground three times it is true but nothing was thought of that such accidents being of frequent occurrence among the events of this sort one occurred in the overslaugh and i passed a few hours there very pleasantly as it was so near the scene of our adventure on the river anneke always occupied much of my thoughts but pleasing pictures of her gentle decision her implicit reliance on myself her resignation her spirit and her intelligence were now blended without any alloy in my recollections the dear girl had confessed to me that she loved me even on that fearful night for her tenderness in my behalf dated much farther back this was a great addition to the satisfaction with which i went over every incident and speech in recollection endeavouring to recall the most minute tone or expression to see if i could now connect it with any sign of that passion which i was authorized in believing did even then exist thus aided equally by annekes gentle blushing admissions and my own wishes i had no difficulty in recalling pictures that were infinitely agreeable to myself though possibly not minutely accurate  in the tappaan sea dirck left us proceeding into rockland to join his family i continued on in the sloop reaching port next day my uncle and aunt legge were delighted to see me and i soon found i should be a lion had i leisure to remain in town in order to enjoy the notoriety my connection with the northern expedition had created i found a deep mortification pervading the capital in consequence of our defeat mingled with a high determination to redeem our tarnished honour  satanstoe with all its endearing ties however called me away and i left town on horseback leaving my effects to follow by the first good opportunity the morning of the day succeeding that on which i had arrived i shall not attempt to conceal one weakness as usual i stopped at kingsbridge to dine and bait and while the notable landlady was preparing my dinner i ascended the heights to catch a distant view of lilacsbush there lay the pretty cottagelike dwelling placed beneath the hill amid a wilderness of shrubbery but its lovely young mistress was far away and i found the pleasure with which i gazed at it blended with regrets  you have been north i hear mr littlepage my landlady observed while i was discussing her lamb and peas and asparagus pray sir did you hear or see anything of our honoured neighbours herman mordaunt and his charming daughter  much of both mrs light and that under trying circumstances mooseridge my fathers property in that part of the province is quite near to ravensnest herman mordaunts estate and i have passed some time at it have no tidings of the family reached you lately  none unless it be the report that miss anneke will never return to us  anneke not return in the name of wonder how do you hear this  not as miss anneke but as lady anneke or something of that sort isnt there a general bulstrom or some great officer or other who seeks her hand and on whom she smiles sir  i presume i understand you now well what do you learn of him  only that they are to be married next monthsome say they are married already and that the old gentleman gives lilacsbush out and out and four thousand pounds currency down in order to purchase so high an honour for his child i tell the neighbours it is too much miss anneke being worth any lord in england on her own sole account  this intelligence did not disturb me of course for it was taverntidings and neighbours news neighbours how much is that sacred word prostituted you shall find people opening their ears with avidity to the gossip of a neighbourhood when nineteen times in twenty it is less entitled to credit than the intelligence which is obtained from a distance provided the latter come from persons of the same class in life as the individuals in question and are known to them what means had this woman of knowing the secrets of herman mordaunts family that were onehalf as good as those possessed by friends in albany for instance this neighbourhood testimony as it is called does a vast deal of mischief in the province and most especially in those parts of it where our own people are brought in contact with their fellowsubjects from the more eastern colonies in my eyes jason newcomes opinions of herman mordaunt and his acts would be nearly worthless shrewd as i admit the man to be for the two have not a distinctive opinion custom and i had almost said principle in common just appreciation of motives and acts can only proceed from those who feel and think alike and this is morally impossible where there exist broad distinctions in social classes it is just for this reason that we attach so little importance to the ordinary reports and even to the sworn evidence of servants  our reception at satanstoe was just what might have been expected my dear mother hugged me to her heart again and again and seemed never to be satisfied with feasting her eyes on me my father was affected at seeing me too and i thought there was a very decided moisture in his eyes as for old capt hugh roger threescoreandten had exhausted his fluids pretty much but he shook me heartily by the hand and listened to my account of the movements before ty with all a soldiers interest and with somewhat of the fire of one who had served himself in more fortunate times i had to fight my battles oer and oer again as a matter of course and to recount the tale of ravensnest in all its details we were at supper when i concluded my most laboured narrative and when i began to hope my duties in this respect were finally terminated but my dear mother had heavier matters still on her mind and it was necessary that i should give her a private conference in her own little room  corny my beloved child commenced this anxious and most tender parent you have said nothing particular to me of the mordaunts it is now time to speak of that family  have i not told you mother how we met at albany and of what occurred on the river i had not spoken of that adventure in my letters because i was uncertain of the true state of annekes feelings and did not wish to raise expectations that might never be realizedand of our going to ravensnest in company and of all that happened at ravensnest after our return from ty  what is all this to me child i wish to hear you speak of annekeis it true that she is going to be married  it is true i can affirm that much from her own mouth  my dear mothers countenance fell and i could hardly pursue my wicked equivoque any further  and she has even had the effrontery to own this to you corny  she has indeed though truth compels me to add that she blushed a great deal while admitting it and seemed only halfdisposed to be so frank that is at first for in the end she rather smiled than blushed  well this amazes me it is only a proof that vanity and worldly rank and worldly riches stand higher in the estimation of anneke mordaunt than excellence and modest merit  what riches and worldly rank have i mother to tempt any woman to forget the qualities you have mentioned  i was not thinking of you my son in that sense at all of course i mean mr bulstrode  what has mr bulstrode to do with my marriage with anne mordaunt or any one else but her own sweet self who has consented to become my wife her father who accepts me for a son my father who is about to imitate his example by taking anneke to his heart as a daughter and you my dearest dearest mother who are the only person likely to raise obstacles as you are now doing  this was a boyish mode of producing a most delightful surprise i am very ready to acknowledge and when i saw my mother burst into tears i felt both regret and shame at havingpractised it but youth is the season of folly and happy is the man who can say he has never trifled more seriously with the feelings of a parent i was soon pardonedwhat offence would not that devoted mother have pardoned her only childwhen i was made to relate all that was proper to be told of what had passed between anneke and myself it is scarcely necessary to say i was assured of the cheerful acquiescence in my wishes of all my own family from capt hugh roger down to the dear person who was speaking they had set their minds on my becoming the husband of this very young lady and i could not possibly have made any communication that would be more agreeable as i was given to understand from each and all that very night  my return to satanstoe occurred in the last half of the month of july the mordaunts were not to be at lilacsbush until the middle of september and i had near two months to wait for that happy moment this time was passed as well as it could be i endeavoured to interest myself in the old neck and to plan schemes of future happiness there that were to be realized in annekes society it was and is a noble farm rich beautifully placed having water on more than three of its sides in capital order and well stocked with such apples peaches apricots plums and other fruits as the world can scarcely equal it is true that the provinces a little further south such as new jersey pennsylvania maryland and virginia think they can beat us in peaches but i have never tasted any fruit that i thought would compare with that of satanstoe i love every tree wall knoll swell meadow and hummock about the old place one thing distresses me i love old names such as my father knew the same places by and i like to mispronounce a word when custom and association render the practice familiar i would not call my friend dirck follock anything else but follock unless it might be in a formal way or when asking him to drink a glass of wine with me for a great deal so it is with satanstoe the name is homely i am willing to allow but it is strong and conveys an idea it relates also to the usages and notions of the country and names ought always to be preserved except in those few instances in which there are good reasons for altering them i regret to say that ever since the appearance of jason newcome among us there has been a disposition among the ignorant and vulgar to call the neck dibbleton under the pretence i have already mentioned that it once belonged to the family of dibblees or as some think as a pious diminutive of devilstown i indignantly repel this supposition though i do believe that dibbleton is only a sneaking mode of pronouncing devilton as i admit i have heard the old people laughingly term the neck this belongs to the gaul darn ye school and it is not to my taste i say the ignorant and vulgar for this is just the class to be squeamish on such subjects i have been toldthough i cannot say that i have heard it myselfbut i am told there have been people from the eastward among us of late years who affect to call hellgate hurlgate or whirlgate or by some other such sentimental whirlagig name and these are the gentry who would wish to alter satanstoe into dibbleton since the eastern troops have begun to come among us indeed they have commenced a desperate inroad on many of our old venerated dutch names names that the english direct from home have generally respected indeed changechange in all things seems to be the besetting passion of these people we of new york are content to do as our ancestors have done before us and this they ridicule making it matter of accusation against us that we follow the notions of our fathers i shall never complain that they are deserting so many of their customs for i regard the changes as improvements but i beg that they may leave us ours  that there is such a thing as improvement i am willing enough to admit as well as that it not only compels but excuses changes but i am yet to learn it is matter of just reproach that a man follows in the footsteps of those who have gone before him the apothegms of david and the wisdom of solomon are just as much apothegms and wisdom in our own time as they were the day they were written and for precisely the same reasontheir truth where there is so much stability in morals there must be permanent principles and something surely is worthy to be saved from the wreck of the past i doubt if all this craving for change has not more of selfishness in it than either of expediency or of philosophy and i could wish at least that satanstoe should never be frittered away into so sneaking a substitute as dibbleton  that was a joyful day when a servant in herman mordaunts livery rode in upon our lawn and handed me a letter from his master informing me of the safe arrival of the family and inviting me to ride over next day in time to take a late breakfast at lilacsbush anneke had written to me twice previously to this two beautifully expressed feminine yet spirited affectionate letters in which the tenderness and sensibility of her nature were barely restrained by the delicacy of her sex and situation on the receipt of this welcome invitation i was guilty of the only piece of romantic extravagance that i can remember having committed in the course of my life herman mordaunts black was well treated and dismissed with a letter of acceptance one hour after he left satanstoei do love that venerable name and hope all the yankees in christendom will not be able to alter it to dibbletonbut one hour after the negro was off i followed him myself intending to sleep at the wellknown inn at kingsbridge and not present myself at the bush until the proper hour next morning  i had got to the house of the talkative landlady two hours before sunset put up my horse secured my lodgings and was eating a bite myself when the good housewife entered the room  your servant mr littlepage commenced this loquacious person how are the venerable captain hugh roger and the major your honoured father well i see by your smile well it is a comfortable thing to have our friends enjoy good healthmy own poor man enjoyed most wretched health all last winter and is likely to enjoy very much the same that which is coming i should think you had come to the wedding at lilacsbush mr corny had you not stopped at my door instead of going on direct to that of herman mordaunt  i started but supposed that the news of what was to happen had leaked out and that this good woman whose ears were always open had got hold of a neighbourhood truth for once in her life  i am on no such errand mrs light but hope to be married one of these days to some one or other  i was not thinking of your marriage sir but that of miss anneke over at the bush to this lord bulstrom its a great connection for the mordaunts after all though herman mordaunt is of good blood himself they tell me the knights man often comes here to taste new cider which he admits is as good as english cider and i believe it is the only thing which he has found in the colonies that he thinks is onehalf as good but thomas tells me all is settled and that the wedding must take place right soon it has only been put off on account of miss wallace who is in deep mourning for her own husband having lost him within the honeymoon which is the reason she still bears her own name they tell me a widow who loses her husband in the honeymoon is obliged to bear her maiden name otherwise miss mary would be mrs van goort or something like that  as it was very clear the neighbourhood knew little about the true state of things in herman mordaunts family i took my hat and proceeded to execute the intention with which i had left home i was sorry to hear that bulstrode was at lilacsbush but had no apprehension of his ever marrying anneke i took the way to the heights and soon reached the field where i had once met the ladies on horseback there seated under a tree i saw bulstrode alone and apparently in deep contemplation it was no part of my plan to be seen or to have my presence known and i was retiring when i heard my name discovered that i was recognised and joined him  the first glance at bulstrode showed me that he knew the truth he coloured bit his lips forced a smile and came forward to meet me limping just enough to add interest to his gait and offered his hand with a frank manliness that gave him great merit in my eyes it was no trifle to lose anne mordaunt and i am afraid i could not have manifested half so much magnanimity but bulstrode was a man of the world and he knew how to command the exhibition of his feelings if not to command the feelings themselves  i told you once corny he said offering his hand that we must remain friends coute qui coutéyou have been successful and i have failed herman mordaunt told me the melancholy fact before we left albany and i can tell you his regrets were not so very flattering to you nevertheless he admits you are a capital fellow and that if it were not for alexander he could wish to be diogenes so you have only to provide yourself with a lantern and a tub marry anneke and set up housekeeping as for the honest man i propose saving you some trouble by offering myself in that character even before you light your wick come take a seat on this bench and let us chat  there was something a little forced in all this it is true but it was manly i took the seat and bulstrode went on  it was the river that made your fortune corny and undid me  i smiled but said nothing though i knew better  there is a fate in love as in war well i am as well off as abercrombie we both expected to be victorious while each is conquered i am more fortunate indeed for he can never expect to get another army while i may get another wife i wish you would be frank with me and confess to what you particularly ascribe your own success  it is natural mr bulstrode that a young woman should prefer to live in her own country to living in a strange land and among strangers  ay corny that is both patriotic and modest but it is not the real reason no sir it was scrub and the theatricals by which i have been undone with most provincials mr littlepage it is a sufficient apology for anything that the metropolis approves so it is with you colonists in general let england say yes and you dare not say no there is one thing that persons who live so far from home seldom learn and it is this there are two sorts of great worlds the great vulgar world which includes all but the very best in taste principles and manners whether it be in a capital or a country and the great respectable world which infinitely less numerous contains the judicious the instructed the intelligent and on some questions the good now the first form fashion whereas the last produce something far better and more enduring than fashion fashion often stands rebuked in the presence of the last class small as it ever is numerically very high rank very finished tastes very strong judgments and very correct principles all unite more or less to make up this class one or more of these qualities may be wanting perhaps but the union of the whole forms the perfection of the character we have daily examples of this at home as well as elsewhere though in our artificial state of society it requires more decided qualities to resist the influence of fashion when there is not positive social rank to sustain it perhaps than it would in one more natural that which first struck me in anneke as is the case with most young men was her delicacy of appearance and her beauty this i will not deny in this respect your american women have quite taken me by surprise in england we are so accustomed to associate a certain delicacy of person and air with high rank that i will confess i landed in new york with no expectation of meeting a single female in the whole country that was not comparatively coarse and what we are accustomed to consider common in physique yet i must now say that apart from mere conventional finish i find quite as large a proportion of aristocraticallooking females among you as if you had a full share of dutchesses the last thing i should think of calling an american woman would be coarse she may want manner in one sense she may want finish in a dozen things she may and often does want utterance as utterance is understood among the accomplished but she is seldom indeed coarse or vulgar according to our european understanding of the terms  and of what is all this ápropos bulstrode  oh of your success and my defeat of course corny answered the major smiling what i mean is thisthat anneke is one of your second class or is better than what fashion can make her and scrub has been the means of my undoing she does not care for fashion in a play or a novel or a dress even but looks for the proprieties yes scrub has proved my undoing  i did not exactly believe the last but finding bulstrode so well disposed to give his rejection this turn it was not my part to contradict him we talked together half an hour longer in the most amicable manner when we parted bulstrode promising not to betray the secret of my presence  i lingered in sight of the house until evening when i ventured nearer hoping to get a glimpse of anneke as she passed some window or appeared by the soft light of the moon under the piazza that skirted the south front of the building lilacsbush deserved its name being a perfect wilderness of shrubbery and favoured by the last i had got quite near the house when i heard light footsteps on the gravel of an adjacent walk at the next instant soft low voices met my ears and i was a sort of compelled auditor of what followed  no anne my fate is sealed for this world said mary wallace and i shall live guerts widow as faithfully and devotedly as if the marriagevow had been pronounced this much is due to his memory on account of the heartless doubts i permitted to influence me and which drove him into those terrible scenes that destroyed him when a woman really loves anneke it is vain to struggle against anything but positive unworthiness i fear poor guert was not unworthy in any sense he was erring and impulsive but not unworthy nononot unworthy i ought to have given him my hand and he would have been spared to us as it is i can only live his widow in secret and in love you have done well dearest anneke in being so frank with corny littlepage and in avowing that preference which you have felt almost from the first day of your acquaintance  although this was music to my ears honour would not suffer me to hear more and i moved swiftly away stirring the bushes in a way to apprize the speaker of the proximity of a stranger it was necessary to appear and i endeavoured so to do without creating any alarm  it must be mr bulstrode said the gentle voice of anneke who is probably looking for ussee there he comes and we will meet  the dear speaker became tonguetied for by this time i was near enough to be recognised at the next instant i held her in my arms mary wallace disappeared how or when i cannot say i place a veil over the happy hour that succeeded leaving the old to draw on their experience for its pictures and the young to live in hope at the end of that time by annekes persuasion i entered the house and had to brave herman mordaunts disposition to rally me i was not only mercifully but hospitably treated however annekes father merely laughing at my little adventure saying that he looked upon it favourably and as a sign that i was a youth of spirit  early in october we were married the rev mr worden performing the ceremony our home was to be lilacsbush which herman mordaunt conveyed to me the same day leaving it as it was furnished entirely in my hands he also gave me my wifes mothers fortune a respectable independence and the death of capt hugh roger soon after added considerably to my means we made but one family between town lilacsbush and satanstoe anneke and my mother in particular conceiving a strong affection for each other  as for bulstrode he went home before the marriage but keeps up a correspondence with us to this hour he is still single and is a declared old bachelor his letters however are too lighthearted to leave us any concern on the subject though these are matters that may fall to the share of my son mordaunt should he ever have the grace to continue this family narrative   the end
