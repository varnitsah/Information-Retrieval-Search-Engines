98501427	among malay pirates  a tale of adventure and peril  by g a henty     among malay pirates     chapter i   i wish most heartily that something would happen harry parkhurst a midshipman of some sixteen years of age said to his chum dick balderson as they leaned on the rail of her majestys gunboat serpent and looked gloomily at the turbid stream that rolled past the ship as she lay at anchor  one day is just like anotherone is in a state of perspiration from morning till night and from night till morning there seems to be always a mist upon the water and if it were not that we get up steam every three or four days and run out for twentyfour hours for a breath of fresh air i believe that we should be all eaten up with fever in no time of course they are always talking of malay pirates up the river kicking up a row but it never seems to come off  there is one thing harrythere is always something to look at for there are canoes constantly going up and down and there is plenty of variety among themfrom the sluggish dhows laden with up country produce to the long canoes with a score of paddlers and some picturesque ruffian sitting in the stern it adds to the interest when you know that the crews are cutthroats to a man and would make but the shortest possible work of you if they had got you in their power  yes dick look at that canoe coming up stream what a good looking chap that is in the stern though by the way he scowls at us i can quite believe he would as you say cut our throats if he had the chance that is a pretty little child sitting by him and what a gorgeous dress she has there you see he can look pleasant enough when he speaks to her i fancy they must have come from a long way up the river for they look wilder than most of the fellows who pass us if that fool who is steering her does not mind what he is about dick he will either run into that canoe coming down or else get across our chain there i told you so  the man at the tiller was in fact looking with mingled curiosity and hostility at the gunboat that he was passing but a few yards away and did not notice a canoe manned by six rowers that was coming down with the stream taking an oblique course across the bows of the serpent and was indeed hidden from his view by the hull of the vessel until he had passed beyond her then there was a sudden shout and a yell from a dozen throats as the two canoes came into collision the one proceeding up the river being struck on the quarter with a force that almost cut her in two and in an instant her occupants were in the water as the malays were to a man almost as much at home in the water as on land the accident would have had little effect beyond the loss of the boat and its contents had it not been that the stern of the other craft struck the malay chief with such force as to completely disable him and he would have sunk at once had not two of the boatmen grasped him and kept his head above water  what has become of the child harry parkhurst exclaimed and he and dick balderson both leaped on to the rail throwing off their jackets as they shouted to the men to lower a boat nothing could be seen of the child until after half a minutes suspense a little face suddenly appeared in the swirl of the muddy water some fifteen yards from the vessels side it was gone again in an instant but as it disappeared both lads sprang from the side and with a few strokes reached the spot where they had seen the face disappear then they dived under water and soon grasped her as soon as they came to the surface a sailor who had seized a coil of rope flung it to them and grasping it they were quickly by the side of the gunboat  a minute later some sailors who had at once tumbled into a boat on the alarm being given came up the child was first handed into it then the midshipmen scrambled in and by their directions two of the sailors standing on the thwarts lifted the child high above their heads to the hands of the men leaning over the bulwark  take the little thing to the doctor dick said now lads row on lets pick up some of those malay fellows  a babel of shouts and sounds rose from the water the bow of the second canoe had been stove in and she also had sunk to the water level a fierce fight was going on between several of the malays the chief who was being supported by two of his crew was shouting furiously and others of his men in obedience to his orders were diving under water harry turned to the gunboat and called to the men to bring soh hay the interpreter to the side a minute later the man was hustled to the rail  tell that chief that we have got his child safely on board harry shouted  again and again the interpreter called out but it was some time before he could make the chief pay attention to him as the latter caught the purport of his words his face changed at once and after calling to his men to desist from their search his head sank on to the shoulder of one of the men supporting him and he evidently lost consciousness  he is badly hurt dick we had better get him on board too old horsley was wishing this morning that he had something to do beyond administering doses of quinine to the men  taking the tiller he brought the boat alongside the chief and four of the sailors directed by dick gently raised him from the water and laid him on the bottom of the boat blood was flowing freely from an ugly gash in his face and it was evident from the manner in which his left arm hung limp as they lifted him up that either the shoulder or the arm itself was broken  get him alongside at once lads dick said i expect he is more injured than we see the other fellows will be all right they can all swim like fish  in two or three minutes the injured man was laid down under an awning over the fore deck of the cruiser and the surgeon at once came up  how is the child doctor  she is still insensible he said but she will soon be all right i cant discover any injury and i think it likely that it was the sudden shock and perhaps a knock against the side of the boat that stunned her for i have no doubt she could swim small as she is this is a much more serious affair he has an ugly gash in his temple his collarbone is broken and he went on as he passed his hands down the patients side he has two if not more ribs broken  well we will leave him to you doctor there are a lot of these fellows in the water and i suppose they must be brought on board until we can get a boat to take them ashore  in a few minutes eighteen malays were brought to the side and the two canoes which were floating level with the water were towed up and fastened by a rope to the stern of the gunboat even when safely on deck the two parties were still so infuriated that they had to be separated and placed under guards apart from each other three or four had been killed by the stabs of the deadly krises and their bodies could be seen floating astern several of those rescued had wounds more or less severe  we should not have much chance with those fellows in the water mr parkhurst an old sailor said to harry  no indeed davis they could swim round and round us and our cutlasses would be very little good against those ugly looking krises if we were to leave them to themselves they would fight to the death and after all it was no ones fault in particular mr balderson and i were watching them one was crossing the ships bow just as the other came out from her side and they were into each other before either had time to hold their boat up  that chap the doctor is bandaging up was in a nice taking about his child sir it was a lucky job that you and mr balderson happened to catch sight of her  yes poor little thing it was only just a glimpse we got of her face but as we were looking for her and ready to dive it was enough  lucky we are inside the bar mr parkhurst or the sharks would have had half the fellows  i did not think of it at the time davis and it would not have made any difference if i had we were only in the water a couple of minutes and the malays were making noise enough to frighten away any number of sharks you will have the job of washing out our trousers againwe had only put them on clean half an hour before  that aint no matter sir especially if you go down and change at once the mud will come out easy enough if i leave them in a bucket of fresh water for half an hour  the two midshipmen joined the group of officers who were standing near the doctor the latter had on closer examination announced that four of the ribs were broken he had finished his work just as the lads came up news had been brought up by the steward that the little girl had opened her eyes while he was speaking the malay conversed rapidly with the interpreter  what is he saying soh hay the captain asked  he is asking why his daughter is not here and if she is hurt and how she came to be saved the man replied me tell him she come up to see him soon the doctor say she no hurt  two minutes later the doctor reappeared carrying the child in his arms she looked round fearlessly at the white faces until her eye fell upon her father when she slipped out of the doctors arms like an eel and ran to him the grim features of the malay lit up with a pleasant smile as he held out his right hand to her she was a strange little figure for the doctor had not waited to obtain any suitable garments for her but had wrapped her up in one of the signal flags which the child herself had wound round her waist and over her shoulder like a native sarong  you tell him soh hay that he must not talk to her the doctor said if he keeps quiet he will get well in short time if he talk he ill many days but i will let him say a few words to her now  the malays eyes passed over the group of officers and rested on the two midshipmen whose wet clothes showed that they were the officers who had as the interpreter had told him dived in and rescued the child he said something to the interpreter  malay man want to speak to you young gentlemen the man said he wish to thank you  oh tell him there is nothing to thank us for harry said hastily it was nothing more than taking a bath  yes officer but he wishes to speak to you  somewhat reluctantly the two lads approached the side of the injured man he took each of them by the hand and as he did so said something which soh hay interpreted  the chief says that you have given him back what he loved best in the world and that his life is yours whenever it may be of use to you he may be of service to you gentlemen should you ever go up the rivera malay never forgives an injury or forgets a service  tell him we are very glad to have brought his little girl out of the water harry said and that if we ever go up the river we will pay him a visit  the chief was now laid in a cot which was swung from the stanchions of the awning while the little girl was carried away by the doctor who laid her in a berth gave her a cup of tea which she drank obediently to his orders but evidently regarded as being extremely nasty and she was then told through the interpreter to go to sleep until her sarong was dried a couple of hours later she was on deck again in her native garb and ornaments the interpreter pointed out to her the two midshipmen who had rescued her and she at once went up to them and slipping her hands into theirs began to prattle freely they were unable to understand what she said but they took her round the ship showing her the guns and introduced her to ponto the captains great newfoundland who submitted gravely to be patted by her to jacko the monkey who was by no means disposed to be friendly but chattered and showed his teeth and to julius caesar the negro cook who grinned from ear to ear and presented her with some cakes from a batch which he had just made for the captains table  the rest of the malays had already left the ship two native boats had been hailed and in these the two parties of malays had taken their places and with their boats towing behind had been rowed away the captain giving strict instructions that they were to be landed on opposite sides of the river the little maid speedily became a general pet on board the serpent and was soon the proud possessor of several models of ships two patchwork quilts several carved tobacco boxes and other specimens of sailors handiwork small as she was she had evidently a strong idea of her own importance and received these presents and attentions with a pretty air of dignity which at once earned for her the title of the princess  on the second day after the accident the chiefs boat came off from the shore the damage having been speedily and neatly repaired little bahi stood on the top of the accommodation ladder as they approached and addressed them with great asperity using much gesticulation with her arms  what is she saying soh hay dick balderson asked  she is telling them that they are bad men to let the boat be run down that she is very angry with them and they will all be punished  the men looked very crestfallen under their little mistress reproaches and held up their hands in a deprecating manner while the helmsman stood up and after salaaming deeply entered upon a long explanation which ended in his asking if he might come on board to see his chief permission was at once granted by the captain upon the request being interpreted to him when he mounted the steps bahi led him to the side of her fathers cot the doctor however interposed  tell him he must not talk he said to the interpreter the chief is ill and must not be allowed to excite himself but he can say a few words if he wants to  the cot had been lowered to within a few inches of the deck in order that the chief might watch his daughter as she trotted about and romped with ponto who had now quite taken her into his friendship the chiefs face expressed alarm when he first saw the great dog but when he saw how gentle the animal was and how when one of the sailors placed the child on his back it walked gravely up and down the deck wagging its tail as if pleased with its novel burden he was satisfied that no harm could come to her from this formidable looking animal he had first spoken a few words sharply to the man in answer to his excuses and indeed had the helmsman been minding his business instead of looking at the ship the collision might have been prevented but hassan jebash was at the present moment so well contented with the recovery of his child that he accepted the mans excuses and the latter went back to his boat evidently greatly relieved  in a few days the chief began to show signs of impatience and through the interpreter constantly demanded of the doctor when he would be well enough to leave  you ask him soh hay whether he wishes to be able to lead his tribe in battle again or to go through life unable to use a kris or hurl a spear in another ten days if he remains quiet he will be able to go and in a couple of months will be as strong and active as ever if he will but keep quiet until the bones have knit surely a chief is not like an impatient child ready to risk everything for the sake of avoiding a little trouble  the chief on this being translated to him scowled angrily  tell him it is of no use his scowling at me soh hay i am not doctoring him for my own amusement but for his good and because he is the father of that little child  the chief when this was translated to him lay without speaking for two or three minutes and then said quietly tell the doctor i am sorry he is right and i have been foolish i will stay till he says i may go    chapter ii   four or five days later the chief was allowed to get up and to walk quietly up and down the deck and a week afterwards the doctor said you can go now chief if you desire it but you must be content to keep quiet for another couple of months and not make any great exertions or move quickly how long will it take you to go up the river to your home  six days easy paddling  well that is in your favor but do not travel fast take it quietly and be as long as you can on the voyagelying in a canoe is as good a rest as you can take  thank you doctor i will obey your instructions you have all been very kind to me and a malay chief never forgets benefits i have been hostile to the white men but now i see i have been mistaken and that you are good and kind is it true that your boat is going up the river soh hay tells me that it is so  yes one of the chiefs sehi pandash wishes to place himself under our protection and he has sent to ask that the ship might go up and fire her big guns that the tribes round may see that he has strong friends who can help him  it is two days rowing up the river to my place from his and when you are there i shall come down to see you sehi is not a good chief he quarrels with his neighbors and shelters their slaves who run away to him he is not a good man  well we shall all be glad to see you chief and i hope that you will bring your daughter with you she has won all our hearts and we shall miss her sadly  i will bring her if i can do so safely the chief said gravely but i am no friends with sehi he stops my trade as it comes down the river and takes payment for all goods that pass down it is because he knows that many of us are angered that he wishes to put himself under your protection i think that you do not do well to aid so bad a fellow  we did not know that he was a bad fellow chief the best plan will be for you and the other chiefs who are aggrieved to send down complaints against him or to come down yourselves when we are up there and talk it over with our captain who will doubtless impress upon sehi the necessity for abstaining from such practices and that he cannot expect aid from us if he embroils himself with his neighbors by interfering with their trade is he strong  he has many war prahus which sometimes come down to the sea and return with plunder either collected from the cultivators near the coast or from trading ships captured and burnt  i will mention what you tell me to the captain and it will prepare him to listen to any complaint that may be made to him but you must remember that he is only acting under the orders of the governor of the straits settlements and must refer all important matters to him  i will come when you are there hassan said gravely if nothing is done there will be war  there was general regret on board the serpent when the little princess said goodby to all her friends and went down the accommodation ladder to the boat with her father the chief had said but little to the two young midshipmen for he saw that they preferred that the matter should not be alluded to but he held their hands at parting and said  i shall see you again before long but if at any time you should want me i will come even if your summons reach me in the middle of a battle  it is such nonsense doctor harry said as the boat pushed off to have so much made of such a thing as jumping into the water if one had been alone and had tried to save a man or a woman in such a state of funk that there was a good chance of their throwing their arms round your neck and pulling you down with them there might be something in it though everyone takes his chance of that when he jumps in to save anyone from drowning but with a little child and two of us to do it and the ship close at hand it was not worth thinking of for a moment  no parkhurst from your point of view the thing was not as you say worth giving a thought to but you see that is not the point of view of the chief to him it is nothing whether your exploit was a gallant one or not or whether you ran any danger the point simply is his child would have been drowned had you not seen her and fished her out and that it is to you that he owes her life i think you have reason to congratulate yourselves on having made a friend who may be very useful to you it may be that there will be trouble up the river and if so he might possibly be of real service to you but in any case he may be able to give you some good hunting and fishing and show you things that you would never have had an opportunity of seeing without his friendship and assistance  i did not think of that doctor yes that would certainly be a great thing  i can assure you i look at it in that light myself parkhurst and i am looking forward to paying him a visit as under his protection i should get opportunities of collecting which i could never have in the ordinary way for unless they are greatly maligned one could not trust ones self among the malays without some special protection  but they are not savages doctor hassan is a perfect gentleman in manner and in that silk jacket of his and handsome sarong he really looks like a prince i could not help thinking that all of us looked poor creatures by his side  they certainly cannot be called savages though from our point of view many of their customs are of a very savage nature piracy is very general among those living on the seacoast or on the great rivers but it must be remembered that it is not so very many centuries ago that a toll was demanded of all passersby by the barons having castles on the rhine and other navigable rivers the crews of wrecked ships were plundered on every coast of europe our own included not so very long ago and in the days of elizabeth drake and hawkins were regarded by the spaniards as pirates of the worst class and i fear that there was a good deal of justice in the accusation but the malays are people with a history they believe themselves that they were the original inhabitants of the island of sumatra however it is certain that in the twelfth century they had extended their rule over the whole of that island and many of its neighbors and in the thirteenth had established themselves on this peninsula and had founded an empire extending over the greater part of the islands down to the coast of australia they had by this time acquired the civilization of india and their sultans were powerful monarchs they carried on a great trade with china hindoostan and siam and their maritime code was regulated and confirmed as early as 1276 by mohammed shah  how is it that they have come to such grief doctor  principally by the fact that they had the feudal or you may call it the tribal system each petty chief and his followers made war on his neighbors if he was strong enough and as some tribes conquered others the empire became split up into an indefinite number of clans whose chiefs paid but a very nominal allegiance to the sultan so islands broke off from the empire until it had practically ceased to exist and the malays were a people united only by similar customs and language but in no other respect and were therefore able to offer but slight resistance on the arrival of the dutch and portuguese in these regions still the upper classes preserve the memory of their former greatness the people are intelligent and most of the trade in this part of the world is carried on by them they are enterprising and ready to emigrate if they see a chance of improving their fortunes you know we saw many of them at the cape when we touched there nominally they are mohammedans in religion but they do not strictly observe the ordinances of the koran and their mohammedanism is mixed up with traces of their original religion  ah that explains why the chiefs name was hassan i wondered that a malay should have a mohammedan name they are not much like arabs in figure of course hassan is a very fine looking man and some of the other chiefs we saw at penang were so but most of them are shorter than we are and very ugly  yes in figure and some other points they much resemble the burmese who are probably blood relations of theirs the chiefs are finer men as you will always find in the case in savage or semi savage peoples for of course they have the pick of the women and naturally choose the best looking their food too is better and their work less rough than that of the people at large  the sons and daughters of the chiefs naturally intermarry and the result is that in most cases you will find the upper classes taller better formed lighter in color and of greater intelligence than the rest of the people this would be specially the case in a trading people like the malays their ships would bring over girls purchased in india just as the ruling classes in turkey used to obtain their wives from circassia and this no doubt has helped to modify the original malay type  thank you doctor i think i shall like the malays now i know something about them is it true that they are so treacherous  i dont know parkhurst doubtless they are treacherous in their wars that is to say that they consider any means fair to deceive an enemy but i do not think that they are so beyond that the dutch have never had any very great difficulty with them nor have we in the portion of the peninsula where we have established our rule of course i know little about them myself as i have only been out here a few months but i am told that as traders they can be trusted and that the word of a malay chief can be taken with absolute confidence of course among the majority of the people of the peninsula we are regarded with jealousy and hostilitythey dread that we should extend our dominion over them and it is not surprising that they should by every means in their power strive to prevent our coming far inland the chiefs on the rivers are as a rule specially hostile  in the first place because their towns and villages are more accessible to us and they know more of our power than those dwelling in the hill country and secondly because they depend largely upon the revenue that they derive from taxing all goods passing up and down and which they not unreasonably think they might lose if we were to become paramount no doubt there is much that hassan said of sehi that is true and is applicable to other chiefs who have placed themselves under our protectionnamely that they have so injured trade by their exactions as to incur the hostility of their neighbors of course i am not speaking of such men as the rajahs of johore and perac who are enlightened men and have seen the benefits to be derived from intercourse with us their people are agriculturists and they are really on a par with the protected states in india  there is a great future before the country gold is found in many of the rivers tin is probably more abundant than in any other part of the world and the exports are now very large there are immense quantities of valuable timber such as teak sandalwood and ebony the climate is except on the low land near the rivers very healthy nutmegs cloves and other spices can be grown there and indigo chocolate pepper opium the sugarcane coffee and cotton are all successfully cultivated some day probably the whole peninsula will fall under our protection and when the constant tribal feuds are put a stop to the forests cleared and the ground cultivated as is the case in our own settlement of malacca it will be found one of the most valuable of our possessions any amount of labor can be obtained from china and it is probable that the races who inhabit the mountainous districts who are said to be industrious and peaceable will also readily adapt themselves to the changed conditions they are not malays like the people of the lowlands but are a black race with curly wool like the natives of africa and probably inhabited the whole peninsula before the arrival of the malays  how funny that there should be niggers here harry said  they are not exactly negroes but one of the races known as negritos having of course many negro characteristics but differing from the african negroes in some important particulars to them our supremacy would be an unmixed blessing their products would reach the coast untaxed and they would obtain all european goods at vastly cheaper rates a minor benefit to be obtained by our supremacy is that our sportsmen would certainly speedily diminish the number of wild beasts that at present are a scourge to cultivators the tigers would be killed down the elephants captured and utilized and the poor people would not see their plantations ravaged but would be able to travel through their forests without the constant danger of being carried off by tigers and panthers and possibly be able to cross their rivers without the risk of being snapped up by alligators though doubtless it would take some time before this would be brought about  and when do you think that we shall be going up the river doctor  that i cannot say the captain has been expecting orders ever since we came here six weeks ago but possibly something may have been learned of sehis characteristics and there may be doubts as to the expediency of taking under our protection a chief whose conduct appears to be anything but satisfactory on the other hand it may be considered that by so doing we may establish some sort of influence over the surrounding tribes and so make a step towards promoting trade and putting a stop to these tribal wars that are the curse of the country  it would be an awful sell if they were to change their minds harry exclaimed  i should be sorry myself parkhurst for you know i am a collector but i can tell you that you wont find it all sport and pleasure you will have no cool sea breezes there will be occasion for continual watchfulness and perhaps long boat expeditions up sluggish streams in an atmosphere laden with moisture and miasma  one expects some drawbacks doctor  you will find a good many i can tell you youngster still i hope we shall go up and i think that we shall do so for it will be the captains report that will help the authorities to decide whether to appoint a resident there or not  a fortnight later a small dispatch boat steamed in and the news soon spread through the ship that the serpent was to ascend the river on the following day all was at once bustle and animation sailors like anything for a change and all were impatient at the long delay that had occurred    chapter iii   the gunboat was a large one and carried two midshipmen besides parkhurst and balderson who were however their seniors the mess consisted of the four lads a masters mate the doctors assistant and the paymasters clerk in the gun room were the three lieutenants the doctor the lieutenant of the marines and the chief engineer the crew consisted of a hundred and fifty seamen and forty marines the serpent having a somewhat strong complement she had been sent out specially for service in the rivers being of lighter draught than usual with unusually airy and spacious decks and so was well fitted for the work the conversation in the junior mess of the serpent was very lively that evening the vessel since her arrival on the station had made two runs between singapore and penang but those on board had seen but little of the country and were delighted at the thought of a possibility of active service and the talk was all of boat expeditions attacks from piratical prahus of the merits of the bayonet and rifle opposed to kris and spear and of sporting expeditions in which elephants tigers and other wild beasts were to fall victims of their prowess  you will find that you wont get much of that the mate who was president of the mess said after listening to their anticipations of sport i have been on the west coast of africa and know what it is poking about in muddy creeks in boats tramping through the jungle knee deep in mud half the crew down with fever and the rest worn out with work and heat i can tell you it is not all fun as you youngsters seem to think but downright hard work  ah well any amount of work is better than standing here doing nothing dick said cheerfully for the mate was known as a proverbial grumbler he had been unfortunate and as is usually the case his misfortunes were in some degree due to himself for he was fond of liquor and although when on board he took no more than his share he was often somewhat unsteady in his speech when he returned from a run ashore and although the matter was not grave enough for his captains to report altogether unfavorably of him it was sufficiently so for them to shrink from recommending him for promotion and in consequence he had seen scores of younger men raised over his head he had been for some time unemployed before he had joined the serpent and had been appointed to her only because captain forest who was a friend of his family had used his interest on his behalf he had however when he joined spoken frankly to him  i have asked for you morrison he said simply for the sake of your father but i tell you frankly that unless my report is a thoroughly favorable one you are not likely to be again employed i was told that there was nothing special against you but that in no case since you passed have you been warmly spoken of it has been said that you know your duty well but they had privately learned that you were fond of liquor and although no charge of absolute drunkenness had been brought against you it was considered that you would not make a desirable officer in a higher rank now your future depends upon yourself if you have the resolution to give up the habit you may yet retrieve yourself if i find that you do so i shall certainly take the opportunity of giving you a chance to distinguish yourself and shall strongly urge your claim to promotion if i am not able to do this you must make up your mind to be permanently put upon the shelf  the admonition had not been in vain and since joining the serpent morrison had made a successful effort to break himself of the habit he had very seldom gone ashore and when he did so never went alone and always returned at an early hour and without having taken more than he would have done in the ordinary way on board he had not however given up his habit of grumbling and his messmates were so accustomed to his taking a somber view of everything that his prognostication as to the nature of their work up the river had but little effect upon them  what do you think sandy harry parkhurst asked the scotch assistant surgeon  i know nothing about it except what i have read they say that the country is healthy but it stands to reason that this cannot be so while you have got rivers with swamps and jungles and such heat as this however we have a good supply of quinine on board and with that and our allowance of spirits i hope that we shant as morrison says have half the ships company down with the fever it is all in our favor that we have only just come out for they say that newcomers can resist the effects of these tropical rivers much better than those whose constitution has been weakened by a residence in the country as to the sport i have no desire to kill any animal that does not meddle with me my business is all the other way and if any of you get mauled i will do my best to help the doctor to pull you through but i am very well on board the ship and have no desire to go tramping about among the swamps whether it be to hunt animals or fight malays  you think that everyone should stick to his last sandy dick said with a laugh well i only wish there were more on board of your opinion for that would give more chances to us who like to stretch our legs ashore for a change  i can stretch my legs here if i want to the scotchman said quietly and am not anxious to do more i suppose if there are expeditions against the malays i shall have to go with them but the fewer of them there are the better i shall be pleased  the talk was more serious aft where the doctor and first lieutenant were dining with the captain it ended by the latter saying well doctor if what your friend hassan said be true we are likely enough to have our hands pretty full and shall have to watch this fellow sehi as sharply as we do his neighbors he is not under our protection yet and if he sends his prahus down the river to plunder on the coast as hassan says he is not the sort of character likely to do us credit and the position of a british resident with him would be the reverse of a pleasant one however we must hope that he is not as black as he is painted he has evidently put the other chiefs backs up and we must receive their reports of him with some doubt however i have no doubt that if he turns out badly we shall be able to give him a lesson that will be of benefit to him  the first days voyage up the river by no means came up to the anticipations of the midshipmen as to the country through which they were to pass the width of the river varied from a quarter of a mile to three hundred yards the banks on each side were lined with mangroves presenting a dreary and monotonous aspect progress was slow the steam launch going ahead and sounding the depth of water the captain having but little faith in the assertion of the native pilot that he was perfectly acquainted with every bank and shallow being now the dry season the tops of many of these shoals were dry and numbers of alligators were lying half in and half out of the water basking in the sun  several of the officers who possessed rifles amused themselves by shooting at these creatures but it was very rarely that any attention was paid to their firing the balls glancing off the scaly armor without the alligators appearing to be conscious of anything unusual there was more amusement in watching how when the swell of the steamer rushed through the shallow water and broke on the shoals the reptiles turned and scrambled back into the river evidently alarmed at this to them strange phenomenon  i should not care about bathing here davis harry parkhurst remarked to the old sailor  you are right sir i would rather have a stand up fight with the malays than trust myself for two minutes in this muddy water why they are worse than sharks sir a shark does hoist his fin as a signal that he is cruising about but these chaps come sneaking along underneath the water and the first you know about them is that they have got you by the leg  which is the worse davis a bite from an alligator or a shark  well as far as the bite goes mr parkhurst the shark is the worst he will take your leg off or a big un will bite a man in two halves the alligator dont go to work that way he gets hold of your leg and no doubt he mangles it a bit but he dont bite right through the bone he just takes hold of you and drags you down to the bottom of the river and keeps you there until you are drowned then he polishes you off at his leisure  the brutes harry exclaimed with deep emphasis see the first lieutenant has hit that big fellow there in the eye or the soft skin behind the leg anyhow he has got it hard look how he is roaring and lashing his tail  what is the best way of killing them dick asked  i have heard sir that in africa the natives bait a big hook with a lump of pork or something of that sort then when an alligator has swallowed it they haul him up holus bolus i should say a good plan to kill them would be with tricity the last ship i was in we had an officer of the marine artillery who knew about such things and he put a big cartridge into a lump of pork with two wires and as soon as the shark had swallowed it he would touch a spring or something and there would be an explosion there was not as much fun in it as having a hook but it was quicker and he did not do it for sport but because he hated the sharks i heard say that he had had a young brother killed by one of them he would sit there on the taffrail for hours on the lookout for them with three or four loaded lumps of pork why i have known him kill as many as a dozen in a day i expect the best part of his pay must have gone in dynamite  he had a narrow escape one day somehow the thing went wrong and in trying to set it right he fell over the taffrail the shark had bolted the bait but this was not enough for his appetite and he went straight at the officer he had had a young ensign sitting beside him who had often watched his work and knew how the thing went i was standing near at the time and he began twisting some screws and things as cool as a cucumber though i could see as his hand shook a bit well he got it right just in time for the shark was not half a length away from the captain and was turning himself over for a bite when the thing went off and there was an end of the shark the captain was a bit shaken up but he made a grab at the rope and held on to it till we lowered a boat and picked him up he had to be got up on deck in a chair and it was two or three days before he was himself again when he got round he set to work again more earnestly than ever and i believe that if we had stopped in the west indies long enough there would not have been a shark left in those waters  it was a capital plan davis and if we ever take possession of these rivers we shall have to do something of that sort to get rid of the brutes are the malays afraid of them  i dont know mr parkhurst but i think they are i had a chat with a mate i met in the myrtle which went home the day after we relieved them here he had been up some of the rivers and told me that every village had a bathing place palisaded off so that the alligators could not get at the bathers  well there is one thingwe shall have to be very careful when we are out in boats for if we were to run upon a sunken log and knock a hole in the boats bottom there would not be much chance of our ever reaching the shore  you are about right there sir i aint afraid of malays but it gives me the creeps down my back when i think of one of them chaps getting hold of me by the leg bob pearson told me that the only chance you have is to send your knife or if you cant get at that your thumbs into the creatures eyes but it would require a mighty cool hand to find the eyes with the brutes teeth in ones leg and the water so thick with mud that you could not see an inch beyond your nose  well i will make a note of that anyhow davis and i will take a good look at the next alligator i see dead so as to know exactly where to feel for its eyes  on the second day the scenery changed in place of the mangroves a dense forest lined the river birds of lovely plumage occasionally flew across it and after they had anchored in the evening the air became full of strange noises great beasts rose and snorted near the banks sounds of roaring and growling were heard in the wood and the lads who had been so eager before to take part in a hunt on shore listened with something like awe to the various strange and often mysterious noises  what in the world does it all mean doctor dick balderson asked as the surgeon came up to the spot where the four midshipmen were leaning on the rail  it means that there is a good deal of life in the woods that splashing sound you hear with deep grunts and snorts is probably made by a hippopotamus wallowing in shallow water but it may be a rhinoceros or even a buffalo that roar is either a tiger or a panther and that snarling sound on the other bank is no doubt made by smaller animals of the same family indulging in a domestic quarrel some of the other sounds are made by night birds of some kind or other and perhaps by monkeys and i fancy that distant vibrating sound that goes on without intermission is a concert of a party of frogs  what is that as a shrill cry as from a child followed by a confused outburst of cries chattering and as it seemed to them a barking sound followed  i fancy that is the death cry of a monkey probably some python or other snake has seized it in its sleep and the other noise is the outcry of its companions heaping abuse upon the snake but unable to do anything to rescue their friend  i dont think doctor harry parkhurst said in a tone that was half in earnest that i feel so anxious as i did for sport in the forest and certainly i should decline to take part in it after nightfall  i can quite understand that lad at night all the sounds of a tropical forest seem mysterious and weird but in the broad daylight the bush will be comparatively still the nocturnal animals will slink away to their lairs and there will seem nothing strange to you in the songs and calls of the birds i should recommend you all to take a sound dose of quinine tonight i have a two and a half gallon keg of the stuff mixed and any officer or man can go and take a glass whenever he feels he wants it it would be good for your nerves as well as neutralize the effect of the damp rising from the river i should advise you who are not on the watch to turn in early it is of no use your exposing yourselves more than is necessary to the miasma  the next day progress was more rapid for the captain found that the assurance of the pilot that there was amply sufficient water for the serpent had been verified and he therefore steamed forward at half speed without sending the launch on ahead to take soundings several villages were passed by the way but though the inhabitants assembled on the banks and watched the steamer no boats were put out nor were any attempts made to barter their products with the strangers  it does not look as if we were popular mr ferguson the captain said to the first lieutenant it may be that they object to our presence altogether or it may be because they believe that we are going to the assistance of this rajah sehi it certainly does not look well for the future  not at all sir however we shall be at the rajahs place tomorrow morning and shall then have a better opportunity of seeing how things are likely to go at any rate he is sure to be civil for a time and we shall be likely to procure fruit and vegetables which as the doctor says are absolute necessities if the men are to be kept in good health  the next morning they anchored about ten oclock opposite the campong of the rajah it was a good deal larger than any that they had passed on the way up but the houses were mere huts with the exception of a large wooden structure which they at once concluded was the residence of the rajah as soon as the serpent turned the last bend of the river before reaching the place the sound of drums and gongs was heard and a large boat manned by eighteen rowers shot out from the bank as the anchor was dropped the two officials on board at once mounted the accommodation ladder and on reaching the deck were received by the first lieutenant behind whom stood a guard of honor of the marines  upon stating that they came to express on behalf of the rajah the pleasure he felt at their arrival they were conducted to the captains cabin compliments were exchanged through the medium of the interpreter and a bottle of champagne was opened and its contents appeared to gratify the visitors they announced that the rajah would receive the captain that afternoon at his palace    chapter iv   neither of the midshipmen was present at the interview between the captain and the rajah the second lieutenant the captain of the marines and the doctor alone accompanied him with an escort of twenty bluejackets and as many marines a large crowd of people had collected to see them pass along to the palace which was a bare barnlike structure but they looked on sullenly and silently as the party passed through them on their way they were kept waiting some little time outside the building then entered through a doorway which led them into a large unfurnished room at the end of which the rajah was seated he rose when the officers entered and received them with an appearance of great cordiality his chiefs standing behind him  the conversation was wholly of a complimentary character the subject of the business on which the british ship had come was not even touched upon refreshments consisting of native sweets and palm wine were then passed round and the captain seeing that all business talk was to be deferred took his leave  the doctor who was fond of the two midshipmen was always ready to chat freely with them  what did you think of our ally dr horsley dick asked him when having changed his full uniform for a suit of undress he came up on deck  between you and me balderson i have seldom seen a more unmitigated looking ruffian in my life even for a malay he is ugly soh hay tells me that in his young days he was a great fighter and his face and shoulders are seamed with scars i asked how he came to be rajah for he does not look at all the type of the better class of people soh told me that in the first place he took to the jungle owing to his having krised in a quarrel the son of the chief here he was joined by other fugitives set up as a pirate and captured by surprise one of the chiefs prahus his force grew rapidly and he made a night attack on the chiefs campong killed him and all the members of his family and caused himself to be elected chief of the tribe which was then a small one gradually he swallowed up one after another of his weaker neighbors sometimes by force sometimes by treachery i believe he is now confronted by more powerful chiefs and that it is only because he is possessed of some six or eight piratical prahus that he has been able to maintain his position no doubt he has become alarmed by a prospect of a combination against him and has so invited us to support him such a step will of course greatly add to his unpopularity but doubtless he thinks that with our help he could defy his enemies  but he cannot suppose doctor harry said indignantly that we are going to fight for such a rascal as he is against the men he has been plundering  i dont expect he does think that we are going to fight for him unless he can show us that it is to our interest to do so i should imagine that he hopes that the effect of our appearance here will be to either induce his neighbors to come to some arrangement with him or that he will endeavor to make peace with them by offering to throw us over and to join with them against us  then i should say doctor that the best thing would be to hang the ruffian up at once  well yes that might be a good plan parkhurst the doctor said with a smile and might save us a good deal of trouble but you see we have come up here at his invitation we have just been eating his food and drinking his liquor and it would scarcely place us in a favorable position in the eyes of the natives in general were we to commence our alliance with him by hanging him  harry laughed no i suppose not doctor still what are we to do  we must wait lad we are here to ascertain the precise situation and it will be some time before that will be cleared up certainly for the present there will be nothing for us to do but to keep quiet and see how matters turn out and to get through the time as best we may we shall have fine opportunities for shooting and botanizing for whatever the chiefs designs may be it is certain that at present he will do all in his power to please us the captain today at my suggestion said that in order to keep the men in good health it would be desirable that they should have every opportunity of going ashore and that the officers should make expeditions in search of game into the interior he promised at once to afford us every facility and to provide us with guides and beaters  the next day permission was granted to several of the officers and to twenty sailors and a dozen marines to go on shore before starting the whole ships company were drawn up and the captain addressed them upon the absolute necessity for good behavior  the malays he said are a fierce race very proud and independent and quick to resent the smallest insult each man carries a kris and is ready to use it on the slightest provocation every man who goes ashore must remember that not only his own life but those of many others and the success of the mission on which we have come hither may be forfeited by any careless act of aggression many of you have served on the coast of africa but you must remember that the malays are not to be treated in the same free and easy manner that may go down with negroes you must comport yourselves with the same decency of behavior that you would were you in the port of a friendly european power any breach of these orders will be most severely punished and i appeal to every officer and man to use his utmost efforts to keep on good terms with these people and to behave as if the honor and credit of the ship depended upon him personally any man who comes on board in the slightest degree the worse for liquor will not be allowed to land again even if we are stationed here for six months and if there is any misbehavior on shore all leave will be stopped  two days later the captain with the second lieutenant and doctor again paid a visit to the rajah and this time business matters were entered upon the chief began by stating that he rejoiced at the thought of being under the protection of the great english queen the captain replied that her majesty was anxious to be on good terms with all the malay chiefs that those rajahs and sultans who had accepted her protection had greatly benefited by so doing and by listening to the advice of the officers whom she sent to reside at their seat of government but that of course before receiving his state under her protection it was necessary that her representative the governor of the straits settlements should be thoroughly satisfied that the rajah intended to be guided by the advice so given  he said that it was thoroughly necessary this should be understood for that the allegiance offered to the queen could not be lightly thrown off if a chief once owned her as his sovereign he could not change his mind afterwards and should he disobey the advice and orders of the resident he would be liable to be dethroned and his government bestowed upon one better fitted for it he could not for instance be allowed to engage in hostilities against his neighbors without the consent of the resident for it was clear that the english could not assist him in wars in which they considered that he was in the wrong in these matters there must be benefits on both sides the chief would obtain protection against warlike neighbors would benefit by the presence and advice of a british officer and by the trade that would spring up while in return for these benefits he must acknowledge the queen as his sovereign and must obey the orders of her officers just as her native born subjects would do  the chief looked very serious at this cannot he asked at last a chief obtain the protection of the british and afterwards remain as an ally of theirs  not so the captain said he cannot come to us when he is in danger and ask us to send ships and men to aid him and afterwards when the danger has passed wish us good morning and give us nothing in return for the benefits he had received  what orders would a resident give the rajah asked after a pause  he would give such orders as would be necessary for the good of the state without interfering in matters of home government he would not allow acts of tyranny and cruelty that would imperil the peace of the state and perhaps bring about a rising he would not suffer trade passing through the dominions to be hampered and injured by heavy and unjust exactions although doubtless he would allow legitimate tolls to be taken he would not permit expeditions to be fitted out for attacks upon harmless neighbors his interference would always be for the good of the state and consequently for the good of its prince the incomes of the various rulers who have placed themselves under british protection have always been largely augmented by the prosperity and well doing of the state the increase in its population the extension of its trade and agriculture all of which enabled the people to pay a larger amount of taxation  you see rajah we force no one to place himself under our protection we war with no one unless by attack upon ourselves or upon princes under our protection he compels us to punish him and in extreme cases to take possession of his dominions i am explaining all this to you because i wish you thoroughly to understand what your position will be if the queen takes you under her protectionwhich she certainly will not do unless it is found that you are likely on your part to carry out faithfully the obligations you have assumed in return for that protection  when this had been translated to the rajah by the interpreter the chief sat for some time silent it was evident that he was ill pleased and that he had reckoned upon obtaining the british aid without undertaking any responsibilities whatever  and the officer who will come up he said at last would he reside on shore  certainly he would a portion of ground would be allotted for the residency on this a fort would be erected which would be manned by a small force for his protection and he might either reside in the fort or in a residence erected for him close to it and under shelter of its guns the fort would of course be used for the protection of the town against enemies as well as for the protection of the officer against any rising on the part of your people in which case you as well as himself would find a refuge in it  then i should no longer be a ruler the rajah said angrily i should not be able to order those who offended me to be punished  not at all the captain replied quietly your powers as a ruler would not be interfered with in any way as long as they were properly exercised you would have the power of executing ill doers in accordance with the custom of your country but the murder of a person who had committed no crime whatever is not to be permitted and anything like wholesale cruelty and tyranny would be sternly repressed  for some time the rajah sat without speaking then he said with an evident effort of self control i must think all this over it is all new to me  by all means do so the captain replied the matter is an important one and you will do well to consider it in all lights before you take a step that once taken cannot be undone  i dont like the fellows looks doctor the captain said he intended to use us as a cats paw against his neighbors  i think that he is a thoroughly bad lot sir and if he accepted the terms i should be very sorry to be appointed resident for i should not feel that my life was worth a days purchase  well there is nothing to do but to wait until we get a definite answer from him and my instructions are that if i find that he is not a desirable man to have to deal with i am to enter into negotiations with other rajahs and to endeavor to do something to open the trade of the river and to render it safe for merchants who come up to trade if hassans account of this mans doings is correct he is the main cause of the falling off in the trade and moreover the author of the piracies of which we have had so many complaints indeed it is possible that when the governor learns the true state of things i may get an order to present an ultimatum to this fellow and to sink his piratical craft at any rate we may make up our minds to be here for some time  on the following day a message was received from the rajah saying that if any of the officers wished to go on excursions for sport guides would be placed at their disposal and that all who wished to do so could at any time travel through the country without the slightest fear of molestation for some time affairs remained in the same condition the doctor went daily on shore with butterfly and beetle nets tin boxes and other paraphernalia he was generally accompanied by a couple of bluejackets and always took a native guide to prevent the risk of being lost in the jungle and also because the man was able to take him to places where villages had stood and it was in these clearings that insect life especially among the lepidoptera was most abundant the malay he first engaged was a young fellow who proved so intelligent and willing that he was permanently retained for the service as long as the serpent remained on the station  the officers obtained no sport with big game for although at night the forest was full of sounds showing the number of wild animals that abounded these never were met with during the daytime and it would have been hopeless endeavoring to penetrate the thick jungle in search of them there was however an abundance of birds for the most part of brilliant plumage and the doctor was delighted with the spoils they brought in while the messes were kept well supplied with jungle fowl and other edible birds the natives learning from the guide of the doctors passion for insects brought in large numbers for sale and he was able to purchase a great many specimens altogether new to science  the two midshipmen made excursions with their guns whenever they could get leave davis and two other sailors always accompanied them as the captains orders were strict that no officer or man should go outside the limits of the campong unless accompanied by two armed seamen  sometimes they took a native canoe and went up the river fishing but as an abundance of fish could be caught by lines from the ships side they only did this as a change and often in the cool of the evening they lay lazily in the canoe while the fishermen were employed rowing them up one or other of the numerous streams which flowed into the river the doctors prognostications as to the health of the crew were only partially verified for the precautions taken if they did not secure a perfect immunity against fever at least greatly diminished the number of those who suffered from it the abundance of fish either caught from the ship or purchased from the natives formed a wholesome diet aided by the fruit of which the natives brought off a very large quantity it was very varied and much of it delicious the mangosteens were specially appreciated and those who could overcome their repugnance to the disgusting odor of the durians found them delicious eating besides these were custard apples bananas and many other kinds of fruit all were very cheap and upon the doctors suggestion a supply was purchased daily for the use of the ships company and the sailors who had no other use for their money laid out no small portion of their pay on these luxuries  the captain had taken every opportunity when boats passed up the river to send messages and presents to the chiefs of the tribes higher up with assurances that he had not come up as an enemy but that he desired to be on good terms with all and would gladly see any of them who would come down to pay him a visit and would guarantee their safe return without molestation on the part of sehi no answers had however been received to these overtures and a proposal he made to the rajah to send some of the ships boats up the river to endeavor to bring about an understanding between him and his neighbors was received with extreme disfavor    chapter v   so far nothing had been seen of the rajahs prahus when questioned on the subject he replied that they were all down on the coast trading with the natives but it was so improbable that they should have been sent away while the rajah was in fear of an attack by his neighbors that no credence was given to the assertion the ships boats often went out for long rows on the river ostensiblyas the captain told the rajah who inquired suspiciously as to the meaning of these excursionsfor the sake of giving the crews active exercise but principally in order to take soundings of the river and to investigate the size and positions of the creeks running into it one day the gig and cutter had proceeded farther than usual they had started at daybreak and had turned off into what seemed a very small creek that had hitherto been unexplored as from the width of its mouth it was supposed to extend but a short distance into the forest the masters mate was in command of one boat the second lieutenant of the other harry parkhurst accompanied the latter after pushing through the screen of foliage that almost closed the entrance to the creek the boats rowed on for some distance for half a mile the width was but some fifteen yards and the trees met in an arch overhead then it widened considerably  this is just the sort of place the lieutenant said to harry where the rajahs prahus may be hidden away we had best go along as noiselessly as possible if we were to come upon them suddenly they might fire upon us and that would bring on a general row if we should catch sight of them it would be best to take the news to the captain and let him act as he thinks fit  he ordered the men to cease rowing until the gig came alongside  mr morrison he said it seems to me that this is a likely place for the prahus to be hidden we had better try and discover if this is the case without being ourselves seen therefore have all the oars except four laid in and let the men muffle those with their stockings and be most careful to dip them into the water without making a splash let absolute silence be preserved in the boat i will lead the way as before and if i hold up my hand stop rowing instantly  aye aye sir the mate replied  the same precautions were taken by the cutter and the boats proceeded noiselessly presently the stream narrowed again until it seemed that they were approaching its termination and the boat stopped rowing  i fancy we have come to the end of it mr morrison the lieutenant said in a low voice  i am afraid so too sir there is no room for the oars and we shall either have to punt the boats or to drag them by the bushes  the lieutenant was about to give the order to turn when harry said suddenly there is a current sir i have had my eye upon that root and we have drifted backwards a couple of feet since we lost way so there must be a stretch of water above us  the lieutenant watched the root of the tree to which harry had pointed for a minute in silence then he said you are right my lad there is a current and as you say there must be a stretch of water above us lay in your oars lads stand up and pull her along by the boughs and bushes but dont make the slightest sound  twenty yards farther the creek widened and the oars were again got out  take your place in the bow mr parkhurst and hold up your hand the instant you see anything unusual and do you men be ready to hold her up the instant i give the order  they proceeded for a quarter of a mile the gig following close behind suddenly at a bend in the stream a glare of light was seen ahead harry held up his hand and passed the word down in a whisper that just ahead the creek widened into a broad sheet of water the lieutenant stopped the gig by holding up his hand passed the order for the men to lay in their oars noiselessly and told the coxswain to keep in well under the bushes on the left hand side then he made his way forward and joined harry telling the men to pull the boat forward by means of the branches overhead which were well within reach but to avoid breaking even a twig  in a minute or two the bow of the boat arrived at the end of the screen of bushes and a low exclamation broke from the lieutenant and harry simultaneously they were looking out on to an almost circular pool some two hundred yards in diameter in the center were moored six prahus two of them lay broadside on to the creek the other four were in a line behind these and it seemed that their broadsides were directed to the opposite side of the pool for the other two boats were in the way of their firing at the creek they were long low vessels rowing some twenty oars on each side each carried a number of small brass guns and they were evidently full of men for numbers could be seen on deck and boats were passing to and fro between them and a small village at the edge of the pool having taken in all the details of the scene the lieutenant passed the word for the mate to leave his own boat and join him when he did so he whispered to him i thought it was as well that you should have a view of these fellows position too morrison as it would be of use to you if you have to take a boat in to attack them  two minutes later the boats were drawn back again to the open water in their rear and rowed as noiselessly as before down the creek no word being spoken until they were half a mile away from the pool  that is a snug hiding place mr morrison the lieutenant said  it is indeed sir who would have thought the scoundrels were so close to us or that they lay up this narrow creek which i have passed half a dozen times and never thought worth examining i should not have dreamt that one of those craft could have passed through  i doubt whether they did pass through they hardly could have done so without breaking down a good many of these branches and we must have seen signs of that i think they must have got into that pool by some creek coming in on the opposite side you see four out of the six boats were anchored in line so as to bring their broadsides to bear on some point opposite to them while the other two guarded them against any attack from this side naturally they thought it unlikely that any boat would come up here and so directed their main attention to the other opening the next thing to find out will be where the other stream joins the river otherwise as soon as we make our appearance they will escape that way and there is not the least doubt that they could row away from our fastest boats however it is a great thing that we have discovered their whereabouts without their having the least notion that we have done so and i am sure the captain will be very pleased when he hears that we have found them it will give him the whip hand over that lying rascal sehi  captain forest smiled grimly when the lieutenant made his report of the discovery that he had made  thank you mr hopkins that is a very valuable discovery just at present matters have not come to a point when we can turn it to account the next thing will be to find out where the other passage comes out it will be a serious business to attack them in the boats alone these prahus carry a tremendous lot of men and the malays will fight desperately i do not say that we might not succeed but we should lose a lot of men in the attempt it would be hot work even with the ship attacked by six of these fellows at once if it was in the night we might fail to see any of them before they were upon us and we should have hard work to beat back four or five hundred of them if they all came swarming on deck together however we can wait and the first time the rajah shows any signs of treachery we can pounce upon his fleet he will not dream that we have discovered their hiding place and will therefore let them hide there without movement however we must try to find the ether end of the entrance to the creek  please impress upon mr morrison and young parkhurst that it is of the highest importance no words shall be spoken about it and it might be advisable also to give notice to the men who were in the boats to keep their mouths shut i have no reason to believe that the interpreter is not faithful to our interests but it is just as well not to trust anyone moreover it may be that some of these malays who come on board with fruit may have been for a time at singapore or penang and picked up a little english and a chance word might let them know that we have discovered the prahus  i wonder why our friend hassan has not turned up dick balderson said to his chum one day after they had been lying for a month opposite the town  i expect something has occurred to keep him harry said i am quite convinced that he would have come if he could he may be in trouble himself with some of his neighbors or he may have tried to exert himself too soon and done himself damage i am quite convinced that he meant what he said at any rate till this business here comes to a head we are not likely to be able to go up and pay a visit to him  no i am quite sure that the captain would not let us go now and indeed i would not ask him even if i were sure he would for we may get to blows with the rajah any day he cannot put off giving a final answer much longer i wonder the captain stood his shilly shallying so long as he has  it was but two evenings after this that as the two midshipmen were leaning against the bulwarks watching the reflection of the stars in the sluggish stream a native sampan stole silently out from the shadow of the shore and dropped down alongside the serpent so noiseless was the movement that the two men on the lookout in the bow did not notice it and the midshipmen thought it was a shadow of some dark object floating down stream when it came alongside and a man stood up  hello harry said you must not come alongside like this what do you want  dick harry doctor come from hassan  oh that is it all right come on board and leaning over he stretched out his hand to the native who seized it and in a moment stood by his side on the deck holding the head rope of his sampan in his mouth  davis harry said to the sailor who was standing two paces away just go down to the wardroom and tell the doctor with my compliments that i shall be obliged if he will come on deck at once say that it is something particular  a minute later the doctor appeared i was just in the middle of a rubber dick and if you have not an uncommonly good reason for calling me up i will make you smart for it the first time you get under my hands whom have we got here  he is a messenger from hassan he mentioned our names and yours  ah i am glad of that the doctor said rubbing his hands together they have been chaffing me in the wardroom about it and prophesying that i should never hear of him again well what does he say  he has not said anything except our names doctor and that he comes from hassan i dont suppose he knows any more english and i thought we had better consult you whether it would be best to send for soh hay he may have brought some message of importance  right lad i think the most prudent thing will be to tell the captain first it may only be a message to say why he has not come or it may be a matter of some importance i will go to him at once  two or three minutes later he returned you are to bring him to the captains cabin here davis pass the word forward that the captain wants to see soh hay in his cabin  harry touched the native who had been standing quietly by his side and signed him to accompany them and with dr horsley and dick went direct to the cabin  so your friend has sent a message at last lad captain forest said i am glad of that for i own that i had doubts whether we should hear any more of him  you come from the chief hassan the captain who had been working at the malay language with the interpreter since he had arrived at the mouth of the river asked in that tongue the mans face brightened  yes my lord he said  is he well  the chief is quite well  i wish i knew enough to question him without soh hays interference but i shall only make a mess of it and perhaps get a wrong idea altogether of his message now soh hay he broke off as the interpreter entered you will ask this man the questions exactly as i put them and tell me his answer word for word it may be of importance now ask him first what message he brings from his chief to the officers  the question was put and the native speaking slowly and quietly and evidently repeating a lesson that he had learned by heart said the chief sends his greeting to his three friends harry dick and doctor also to captain he is well in body he is cured and can throw a spear and lead his men to battle he has sent four messengers one after another but none have returned with an answer they have no doubt been krised now he sends me  tell him that no messenger has arrived until now the captain said when this was interpreted to him  the man nodded all krised i travel at night hide in trees all day float down at night in shadow of bushes and have got through safe chief hassan says not been able to come down other chiefs very angry because english warship come send message to hassan to join them when he say no they threaten to kill him and destroy tribe when warship go away two of rajah sehis prahus go up and down river stop all boats sehi send message to all chiefs say that english war boat here english come take his country and after they done that take the countries of the others make themselves kings of the river he ask them to join him in killing english every man then he would have no more quarrel with them no trouble trade any more be good friends with all neighbors some chiefs say one thing some another some more afraid of rajah than of english some think better have english here than rajah  hassan says must take great care sehi very treacherous attack when they do not expect it he thinks his prahus can easily take english ship but hassan says sehi wants the other chiefs to aid so that if the english send up more ships then can all join him in fighting them hassan says he will do what he can he has eight war canoes but no good against prahusthey run at canoes and cut them in half but will come to help if english attack he does not know where prahus are begs captain to attack these first it is they that make sehi master of the river if they destroyed other chiefs not afraid of sehi and he might get some of them to join against him hassan said tell harry and dick and doctor he does not forget their kindness and will do what he can to watch over them such is hassans message  ask him when he is going back to his chief the captain said  he go now the interpreter said after asking the question he get as far as he can before morning he sure many eyes watch ship night and day to see that no message comes or any word of what rajah is doing he float down stream in sampan some distance then paddle to opposite bank then keep in shadow of bushes up the river and hide away till night comes again  very well then tell him that he is to thank his master for sending us warning that we had already found out that what he told us before he went away was true and that sehi is a very bad man say that we are not afraid of prahus and will make short work of them when we get a chance tell him we will take great care and not let ourselves be surprised and that when we have finished with this fellow here the ship will come as far up the river as she can go and show the chiefs that the english have no evil intentions against them and will send his three friends with a strong boat party to pay him a visit by the way ask the man if he knows this part of the country  yes captain he says that he has been since his boyhood a boatman and has worked for some years with a trader who used to go up the creeks and trade with the villagers  ask him if he knows a creek that turns off from the river four or five miles above this it is a very small one but it leads into a pool on which is a large village  the man nodded at once when the question was put then spoke for a minute or two  he says captain that he knows the pool and village but he has never been up the small creek that you speak of did not know that a boat could get through he has been there by a large creek that runs into the other branch of the river the one that turns off twelve miles below this from that river it is an hours paddle in a sampan to the pool  how should we know the entrance the captain asked  entrance difficult to find the native replied strip of land runs out from both sides covered with trees one goes a little beyond the other so that anyone who did not know it would pass the entrance without noticing it it is just wide enough for a large craft to go in and out there is a village stands a hundred yards below the entrance it would be known by a big tree that grows before a large house close to the bank the water is deep on that side you have only after passing the village to keep close in shore and you will then see the entrance to the creek it is called alligator creek because more than any place it swarms with these creatures  thank you the captain said will you tell the chief that i say you have rendered me a valuable service  he opened a case in which he kept presents intended for the chiefs and took out a brace of handsome pistols a powder flask and a bullet mold  take these he said in token of the service you have rendered when i see your chief you shall be well recompensed for the risk that you have run in bearing me his message  the malay looked longingly at the pistols and then said i came by order of my chief and not for reward  quite so i understand that and am not offering you a reward for that service but for the information that you have given me which may be of value if i have trouble with the rajah here  the man bowed and took the pistols offered i will use them against your enemies he said warmly but all of us know the creek for it is that which renders it so difficult for us to fight against sehi he is master of the water and we cannot attack him without first crossing that creek we should have to carry canoes with us to do it for the creek is too full of alligators for anyone to swim across and our small canoes would have no chance of passing the creek when his war boats were there  the captain nodded when this was translated to him  sehis place in fact stands upon an island formed by the two branches of the river and this creek as soon as he became master of the river he could hardly be assailed while at any time he could sally out and fall upon his enemies ask the man if he will take any refreshment before he goes  the man declined he had he said sufficient fruit and dried fish for his journey back a few minutes later he took his place in the little canoe and drifted away into the darkness and was soon lost to sight    chapter vi   things are coming to a crisis harry dick balderson said in a tone of delight as they left the captains cabin we now know what we all along suspectedthe rajah is a rascal and we have not only found out where his prahus are hidden but have them corked up in a bottle  nothing could be better dick and i expect we shall have some pretty hot work of course the serpent cannot get up that creek though she can place herself at the entrance and prevent their getting away but there still remains the work of capturing or driving them down the creek and that is likely to be a very tough job  the next morning the second lieutenant the mate and harry parkhurst were sent for to the captains cabin the first lieutenant was there they were each asked their opinion as to whether the prahus could force their way through the creek by which they had ascended  it is a most important point the captain said and indeed everything might depend upon it  i am sure sir mr hopkins said that they could not go straight down it they might cut their way through but it would be a work of considerable time for with their masts they would have to clear away the branches to a considerable height down near the water the branches by which we pushed ourselves along were those of the undergrowth with many rattans and other creepers varying from the thickness of ones thumb to that of ones wrist and these would take a great deal of chopping before one of their war boats could be pushed through but higher up they would probably have much thicker branches to contend with it may be that they can lower their masts but even if they could do so i should think that it would take them over an hours work even with the number of hands they carry to get a passage through that bit of thick undergrowth fifty or sixty yards up the mouth of the creek there are two or three other places where some chopping would have to be done but that would be comparatively easy work  the mate and harry both agreed with the lieutenant  practically then the captain said the malays have but one mode of escape while we have two of attack at any rate if we send up a boat beforehand and fasten two or three iron chains from side to side among the branches that passage would be securely sealed  thank you gentlemen that is all i have to ask at present it is a very difficult nut we have to crack mr ferguson he went on when he and the first lieutenant were alone to attack six strongly armed prahus with the boats of this ship would be a serious enterprise indeed and its success would be very doubtful while the loss would certainly be very heavy especially as if any of the boats were sunk the crews would have but little chance in a place swarming with alligators i dont think i should be justified in risking such an enterprise  there is no doubt sir the loss would be very heavy indeed by all accounts these malays fight like demons on the decks of their own boats and for aught we know they may after nightfall trice up rattans to prevent boarders getting on board i have heard that it is their custom when they expect an attack and that these are far more formidable obstacles than our boarding nets of course i should be quite ready to lead an attack should you decide upon making one but i cannot conceal from myself that it would be a well nigh desperate undertaking  i am glad that you are of that opinion the captain said there seems to me but one course and that a difficult onenamely to carry a couple of heavy guns through the forest to the edge of the pool it would be a serious undertaking and we should have to send a strong force to defend them but if we could succeed in planting them in position we should soon drive the malays out of the pool  that would be a capital plan captain if it could be managed i suppose before we attempt it you will take possession of this place and capture the rajah  that of course i dont suppose we shall capture him i have no doubt that we are closely watched night and day and that the instant the boats are lowered and the men get on board the rajah would prepare for flight though he might possibly make some resistance however that would be but trifling our guns would cover the landing and knock the place about his ears but to penetrate the jungle would be vastly more difficult an affair if as is probable he has succeeded in inducing some of his neighbors to join him they may have already sent strong contingents and the forest may be full of them in that case it would be quite beyond our power to rout them out and i certainly should not be justified in attempting it the destruction of his town and the burning of his palace would be a serious blow to him but the destruction of his piratical fleet would be a very much heavier one if we can achieve that we shall have done good service  the first thing to do is to find out whether there is a path either from this river or the other branch to the pool if so at dark after destroying the town we will recall all the men on shore buoy the anchor and drop it noiselessly and drift down the river till we are far enough away to use the engines then steam down to the junction of the two streams and up again to the entrance to the creek on that side then we will at once land a very strong party land also two twentyfour pounders and drag them to the pool we might hope to do so without any opposition for the malays would no doubt be gathered at the edge of the forest near the town to repel any attack we might make from there and before morning we might have the guns in position i should take a hundred empty sacks these you would fill with earth when you get near the pool and form a battery with them behind the screen of bushes then when you are ready you will cut down the bushes and open fire  i dont see why that should not succeed sir of course the most difficult part of the operation is dragging the guns these native paths are only broad enough for men in single file  yes that is the difficulty we could not employ axes to cut down the trees and to saw them down would be an interminable work i think mr ferguson we should have to carry them  i doubt if we could carry a twentyfour pounder sir but we might carry an eighteen they have bamboos of almost any length here and if we were to lash an eighteen pounder between two of them i should say that ten men each side ought to able to carry them while as many more might take the gun carriage  we will get some bamboos today mr ferguson and try the experiment of how many men will be required to carry a gun but now i think of it i fancy that it will be still easier to lay the guns down on a sledge shaped piece of timberthese paths are smooth enough where the natives tread and the men could haul the guns along with ropes  that would be better and easier sir the difficulty with the carriages will be greatest but they might be taken to pieces as far as possible and slung on bamboos  i think that we shall be able to manage all that the captain said cheerfully the first thing is to find the path there is almost sure to be one from the village the malay spoke of as close to the mouth of the creek and the pool and if we send the boats up as soon as we arrive at the creek to row with muffled oars until they get near the pool and then land and find the path it would diminish very much the distance they would have to go and the work to be done  it would be a great thing to find that out beforehand sir if you like i will drop down the river this afternoon in the gig that will attract no attention for it will be thought that we are merely going fishing or shooting as soon as it is dark we will muffle the oars and row up the other branch find the mouth of the creek and row up it first find how far it is to the pool then drop down a quarter of a mile and land strike into the jungle and look for the path i should of course choose a point where the creek bends that way for as the path no doubt goes straight from the village to the pool it would be nearer the creek at a bend than it would be at any other point if it is a sharp bend it might go quite close to it  that would be a very good plan mr ferguson and as you have proposed it you shall take command of the boat otherwise i should have sent either the third lieutenant or morrison i need not say that it will be necessary to use the greatest caution and to avoid all risks as much as possible though i fancy that my gig would run away from any of the ordinary native craft but of course the great point is to avoid being noticed for were one of our boats seen up the other river near the creek the alarm would be given and the prahus might at once shift their position and make up the river where we should have little chance of finding them again  i quite understand that sir and will be as careful as possible i will take one of the midshipmen with me either mr parkhurst or mr balderson if the worst came to the worst and one of the men were hit he could man his oar or if i were myself badly wounded could take the command i think it is baldersons turn for boat duty  either of them will do the captain said they are both strong active lads and as steady as you can expect lads to be  accordingly at four in the afternoon the captains gig was lowered as the rule was that all men on boat duty should go armed no surprise had been excited when the order was given for the men to take their muskets and cutlasses though when an extra supply of ammunition and a brace of pistols were served out to each they thought that something unusual was in the wind and there was a grin on the mens faces when a hamper of provisions was placed in the bow of the boat dick was in a state of high but suppressed delight when informed by the first lieutenant that he was to accompany him on a boat expedition and that he had better take his cloak with him as they might be out all night  you can take your pistols with you mr balderson it is not likely that they will be wanted but it is as well to carry them  dick borrowed a cutlass from the armorer and ground it down to a razor edge for his dirk was an altogether useless weapon if it came to fighting he was the more convinced that something more than usual was intended when he saw the assistant surgeon place a parcel in the stern sheets  bandages i expect he said where do you think we can be going harry  perhaps you are going up the creek again dick whos going in command  i have not heard morrison says he has not been told off so i suppose it is hopkins in fact if you are going up the creek it is sure to be him as one of us who went up there before would certainly be in command it is rum theyre taking the captains gig he is very particular about it and it is very seldom indeed that even the first luff uses it  i suppose they think it possible that you may be chased and there is no doubt she is far away the fastest boat on board she is not a dockyard boat but as you know is one the captain had specially built for himself and for racing if we were at any station where there were other warships  when four oclock came and the first lieutenant with his cloak over his arm came out and took his place in the boat there was a general look of surprise among the sailors leaning on the rail to see her put off for it was a very unusual thing for the first officer to take the command when only a single boats crew were going out on any expedition  row easy men mr ferguson said as he sat down on one side of the coxswain while dick took his place on the other drop quietly down the river there is my fishing rod by your side mr balderson you may as well begin to put it together at once so that the natives on shore may see that we are going on a fishing expedition  they rowed some ten miles down at a leisurely pace and then the boats grapnel was dropped at a bend of the stream where the water was unusually deep and several baskets of fish had been taken at various times a spare rod was brought out from under the seat and mr ferguson and dick began to fish one on each side of the boat while the men lay on their oars and a look of satisfaction came over their faces as the lieutenant told them that they could smoke hitherto dick had been in ignorance as to the object of the expedition he had been much surprised when the order had been given for the boat to row down the river and it was therefore evident that it was not the intention of the first officer to again explore the creek  several fish were caught but as soon as it became dark the lieutenant said you can throw them overboard again mr balderson we dont want any extra weight in the boat and these fish must weigh thirty pounds at least now what do you suppose we are going to do  i have no idea sir i thought that we might be going up the creek that lieutenant hopkins explored the other day to have another look at the prahus but as we came down the river instead of going up of course it is not that  no we are going to explore the creek but from the other end  that will be first rate sir but i am afraid that we shant find water enough for the serpent  no i fear that there is little chance of that still we may obtain information that will be valuable  the night was a dark one and an hour after sunset the grapnel was got up and the boat continued its way down the river the oars being now muffled and the strictest silence ordered  keep your eyes open mr balderson the lieutenant said i think that it must be another three miles to the point where the river forks the other branch comes in on the right so we will keep on the left bank i dont think there is much fear of our missing the junction of the stream but if we do we will row on to a mile below the point where we think it is then cross and keep up on the other side in that way we cannot miss it  for the next half hour no word was spoken in the boat dick kept his eyes fixed on the opposite bank suddenly he touched the lieutenant  there sir that must be it the line of the trees has suddenly stopped and i think i can make out a lower line behind it  yes no doubt that is the junction we will go two hundred yards farther down before we cross it is unlikely in the extreme that anyone is watching us still i dont want to run the slightest risk  in another five minutes they crossed the river whose increased width showed them that they had assuredly passed the junction of the stream then they turned and followed the right hand bank  stretch out a bit now lads you have fifteen miles straight rowing before you and the sooner you get to the other end the better we may have a long nights work before us and i want to be able to get to the place where we fished before morning  the men bent to their oars and the boat sped swiftly along the current was very slight and after two hours rowing the lieutenant judged that they must be but a short distance from the village hassans messenger spoke of accordingly he told the coxswain to steer across to the other bank and warned the men that the slightest splash of their oars might attract attention and that they were to row easier for the present in a quarter of an hour the wall of forest ceased and a hundred yards farther they saw houses two or three dim lights were visible and the sound of voices could be heard the boats head was now turned out somewhat farther into the stream so as to be out of sight of anyone who might by chance come down late to draw water after rowing a hundred yards they could dimly make out the outline of a white house there was a break just in the center and the outline of a tree could be seen above the roof dick leant forward and again touched the lieutenant  that must be the house sir he whispered  mr ferguson nodded without speaking and after the boat had gone another hundred yards the line of forest could again be seen and the boat was rowed into the bank and two minutes later shot through a narrow channel and entered a creek some forty yards wide  now you can give way again lads  an hours paddling in a sampan would mean about three miles and after twenty minutes sharp rowing the men were ordered to row easy again and the lieutenant and dick kept an anxious lookout ahead the creek was here little more than fifty yards across and accustomed as their eyes were to darkness they presently saw that it widened out suddenly the word was passed down for the men to paddle easily and in two minutes the pool opened before them they could not make out the prahus lying as they did against the shadow of the trees on the farther side but they could see a number of lights apparently from swinging lanterns and hear a loud murmur of voices  easy all the lieutenant ordered now back her very quietly now pull bow  noiselessly the boat was brought round and its head directed to the right hand bank they had passed a sharp bend nearly half a mile back and the lieutenant said look out for a landing place at the deepest point of the curve harris  aye aye sir the coxswain said standing up a minute later he brought the boat alongside at a point which was free from bushes and where the bank was but two feet above the waters edge    chapter vii   now mr balderson take harper and winthorpe and make your way through the jungle as noiselessly as possible it is probable that the path runs within fifty yards of this point possibly it is only half a dozen when you have found it send winthorpe back to me with the news take that long coil of thin rope that is in the bow and pay it out as you go along you might get lost even within two yards of the stream and it would be dangerous to call or whistle it will enable me to join you leave your muskets behind lads they would only be in the way in the jungle and you have your pistols and cutlasses you take the lantern winthorpe and harper do you take the rope fasten one end to the thwart before you start or without knowing it you might drag it after you  dick led the way the others following close behind but as soon as they were among the trees he was obliged to take the lantern for the darkness was so intense that he could not see an inch before him and would have been torn to pieces by the thorny creepers had he tried to penetrate without a light  as it was he received several nasty scratches and could hear muttered exclamations from the men behind him creeping under some of the rattans making detours to avoid others and cutting some of the smaller ones in two with his cutlass he made his way forward and was delighted indeed when after proceeding some twenty yards he came upon the edge of what looked like a ditch but which was he knew the native path  here we are lads he exclaimed in a low tone thank goodness we have not had to go farther  so say i sir one of the men grumbled if it had not been for your lantern i should have been torn to pieces as it is i aint sure whether my eyes aint gone and my nose and cheeks are scratched as if i had been fighting with a mad cat  here winthorpe take the lantern and make your way back darken it as soon as you get through to the edge of the creek you cannot go wrong with the cord to guide you  two or three minutes later dick saw the light approaching again and the lieutenant the coxswain and two bluejackets joined him winthorpe and another having been left as boat keepers  now harris do you and one of the others go on ahead we will follow fifty yards behind you if you hear anyone coming give a low whistle we will then turn off the light you can walk on confidently for there is no chance of any of these prickly creepers running across the path when you see the trees are getting thinner or that there is an opening before you stop and send back word to us so that we can shut up the lantern before joining you  the lieutenant headed the party now followed by dick he held the lantern close to the ground the bottom was like all jungle paths worn perfectly smooth by the passage of the barefooted natives  nothing could be better he said in a low voice to dick we ought to be able to haul the guns along here at a trot and the opening is wide enough on each side for a gun carriage to be carried along without any difficulty  in ten minutes one of the men ahead came back  we have got to the end of the path sir it ends on the bank of that pool we saw ahead  the lantern was now extinguished and the party hurried forward on reaching the bank they found that the path ended as they had expected just opposite the village the prahus lay somewhat to the right  it could not be better the lieutenant whispered now let us see whether we can find a suitable place for the guns  this was much easier than they had expected for the trees were cleared probably to furnish firewood for a distance of some fifteen yards from the bank between this cleared place and the water was a fringe of thick bushes  this will do capitally lads now we will be off at once we have found out all that we wanted and nothing could be more satisfactory  they retraced their steps rapidly till they came to the coil of cord looped on a low bough the coxswain took it down and they were soon all on board the boat again now lads row as noiselessly as you can to the mouth of the pool again then turn and lay on your oars except bow and two who are to paddle very slowly hand mr balderson that twenty foot bamboo i want to sound the river as we come back  as soon as the boat was again turned dick took the pole and standing up thrust it down into the water  only about seven feet sir he whispered  that is bad it is evident that the ship cannot get up here still we may as well go on sounding  the water is gradually deepening dick said thrusting the pole down again there are nearly ten feet  it was not long before he announced fifteen and at that continued until they reached the entrance to the creek where it was only fourteen feet  it would be a touch and go there the lieutenant said but i dare say she could be pushed through it is very unfortunate that there is that shallow bar this side of the pool and now lads you can lay out for ten minutes and then we can fasten up to a bough and see what is in the hamper we have done our work earlier than i had expected and can take it easy  the steward had provided them with an ample store of food and the men ate their hunks of cold meat and bread and passed round the pannikins of grog with great contentment while the officers divided a cold chicken and a bottle of claret  now men the lieutenant said when they had finished you can have a quarter of an hours smoke you must open the lantern in the bottom of the boat and hold a jacket over it to prevent the light falling on any of you  when the men had lit their pipes the lantern was passed aft and while the coxswain put his jacket over it the lieutenant lit a cigar  you smoke dont you balderson  yes sir i began when we came up the river the doctor said it is a good thing to keep off miasma  very well then light up i think that it is a good thing myself we have done a very satisfactory nights work and i think we see our way now to getting rid of most of those piratical craft which will not only be a benefit to traders on the coast of the river but will greatly please all the other chiefs and will enable them to hold their own against sehi  five minutes were added to the promised quarter and then the pipes were laid down and the boat proceeded at a steady stroke until they reached the spot where they had fished  somewhere about here lad  yes sir i think that this is just the place i noticed that tall tree rising above the general line just opposite where we were anchored  then lower the grapnel in oars  another bottle was produced from the hamper the lieutenant filled a wine glass full and drank it off and then passed the glass over to dick  what is it sir  it is some grog with a large dose of quinine the doctor begged me to give it an hour or two before daylight now lads you are each to take a glass of this it will protect you against the effect of the mist on the river you can show the lantern now it is just as well that they should see it if they are on the lookout  every man took his glass of the mixture  now wrap yourselves in your blankets lads and lie down for a couple of hours sleep  after a minute or twos scuffling while each found a plank to suit him all was quiet in the boat dick who felt far too excited over the events of the night to be sleepy had volunteered to keep watch and lighting another pipe at the lantern smoked till it was broad daylight then he roused the crew and in less than two hours afterwards they rowed alongside the serpent the captain was greatly pleased with mr fergusons report  it is unlucky about that bar in the creek otherwise we might have taken the ship right into the pool and fought it out with them there still it may be that this will be the best in the end for we could hardly have counted upon sinking the whole of them and once past us they would have been off like the wind and though we might have followed some of them the others would have made off some one way and some another whereas by laying the vessel across the mouth of the creek we have a good chance of catching them all as they come down there is no doubt a lot more fellows have arrived to help the rajah we can see that there are a great many more about on the shore than there have been before i think things will come to a crisis before many hours have passed we have made out that men keep coming and going behind that row of six huts facing the river and i should not be surprised if they are not hard at work establishing a battery there  presently two malays whom they recognized as belonging to the rajahs council advanced to the edge of the shore which was but some fifty yards away one of them held a pole to which a white cloth was attached  i have a message from the rajah he shouted out the captain sent for the interpreter and went to the side of the quarterdeck  the rajah says that he does not want to have any more to say to you you want to take his country he will not let you have it and if you do not go away in an hour he will sink your ship  tell him the captain said that it will be the worse for him if he tries it i came up here at his invitation and shall stay just as long as i please  the two malays retired walking in a quiet and dignified way  the news soon ran through the ship of the defiance that had been given and excited the liveliest satisfaction the men were shaking hands cutting capers and indulging in much joking and laughter half an hour later there was a sudden uproar in the town drums were beaten horns sounded and the malays by the river bank speedily retired behind the huts  you had better get the magazine opened mr ferguson and everything in readiness but we wont beat to quarters till they begin  the tumult on shore increased and soon a few shots were fired from behind houses and walls the balls whistling overhead  there wont be much of that the captain said as he walked up and down the quarterdeck with the first lieutenant we have seen very few guns among them i should doubt if there are a hundred in the town what there are were no doubt captured from trading vessels the scoundrels have plundered and burned  a few minutes later the bamboos forming the wall of the six houses where a bustle had been observed fell outward the lashings having been cut by a swarm of malays who as soon as the last fell ran back showing eight brass cannon  beat to quarters mr ferguson the captain maid quietly and at the first tap of the drum the sailors who had been expecting the order ran to their stations as they gained them the little battery on shore opened fire although the distance was but a hundred yards only three of the balls hit the hull the others passing through the masts  load with grape the captain ordered  captain hugeson he said to the marine officer will you place your men on the poop and tell them to open fire as soon as the guns send the malays flying from their battery i can see that there are large numbers gathered round it mr ferguson will you see that the guns are all laid on that battery when they are ready fire a broadside that will clear the place out at once  two minutes later there was a crash as the whole of the guns on the starboard side were discharged at the same moment the effect was tremendous and the storm of grape swept away the whole of the buildings beneath which the guns were standing three of these were dismounted and not one of the men who had been crowded round them remained on his feet numbers were seen running away in all directions and a volley from the marines brought several of these down  there is an end to the attack the captain said quietly order the men to load with shell and to direct their aim in the first place at the rajahs palace there is no occasion for rapid firing  gun after gun sent its messenger into the palace and in three or four minutes flames were seen rising from it the order was then given to fire with grape at all the houses facing the water in the meantime the men were called from their guns on the port side and the boats lowered the marines and all the sailors save those serving the starboard guns took their places in them the first lieutenant taking the command and on the word being given they dashed with a cheer towards the shore and leaping out formed up and led by their officers ran forward not a shot being fired by the malays as they did so  the fire of the ships guns was now directed towards the portion of the town facing the forest as it was here that the malays would probably be gathered port fires had been distributed among the landing party as these were lost to sight as they entered the town those on board ship watched eagerly for the sound of combat nothing however was heard for a minute or two then came a single shot and then a rattle of musketry  they are making a stand now the captain said  mr hopkins will you please go round and tell the gunners to be very careful in their aim let them watch the smoke rising among the houses and aim a short distance beyond it impress upon them that it is better to fire too far than to risk hurting our own men  the order was obeyed soon flames were seen to rise beyond the spot where the fighting was going on the resistance to the advance speedily ceased and a dropping fire took the place of the sustained roll of musketry which five minutes later broke out again at the edge of the town facing the wood and the fire of the guns was now directed against the edge of the forest to which the malays had evidently fled in a few minutes smoke began to rise all round the place showing that the men with port fires were at work and in a quarter of an hour the bluejackets and marines were seen issuing from the houses and coming down to the shore the place was by this time a sheet of fire the lightly built huts dried in the heat of the sun catching like tinder and blazing up in a fierce flame that in a few minutes left no vestige behind it  the ships fire had by this time ceased and the sailors as they looked out of the portholes cheered as the boats came up their appearance was far less orderly than it had been when they put off from the ship every man having carted off some sort of lootsarongs spears krises and other articles some obtained from the huts others thrown away by the malays in their flight there were too some articles of european manufacture which had been carried off from the palace before the flames had obtained entire possession these were in themselves strong proofs that the rajahs prahus had been engaged in piratical attacks upon european craft for they consisted of bales of silk chronometers watches double barreled guns mirrors and other articles which had evidently formed a portion of a ships fittings  any casualties mr ferguson the captain asked as the lieutenant stepped on board  half a dozen spear wounds sir but only one of a serious nature our fire was too hot for them to face  what do you suppose their loss has been  as far as i can judge sir some eighty or ninety were killed by our fire and at least as many must have fallen in the battery the place was choked up with dead i have brought the eight guns off they are only four pounders  they may be useful for the boats i see the men have brought off a good deal of rubbish you had better give orders that whatever there is is to be fairly divided among all hands any articles more valuable than the rest had better be put up to auction and whatever they fetch also divided among the men were the malays in force  the place swarmed with them sir but they were evidently demoralized by the fire of the guns and their attacks were really feeble the only trouble we had was that some would shut themselves up in houses it looked at first as if they really meant to fight but directly the shells began to fall behind them and fire broke out they lost heart altogether and made a bolt for the forest  well the work has been thoroughly done mr ferguson and sehi has had a lesson that he wont forget now we have to tackle his fleet  everything is ready sir we have got the sledges made for the two guns and a store of long bamboos for the carriages and anything else we may want to take with us  this will be a more serious business by a long way the captain said the men had better take a hundred rounds of ammunition with them and it would be as well to take a few boxes of spare cartridges and the men not occupied in dragging the cannon and carrying the carriages must take up as many rounds of shell as possible and eight or ten rounds of grape for each gun you have got the sacks ready for forming the battery that will be absolutely necessary for the protection of the men firing each of the prahus has probably got at least half a dozen small guns and it would be hardly possible to work our pieces unless the men were protected from their concentrated fire tell the chief engineer that steam must be got up by six oclock in the meantime let a slow fire be kept up towards the edge of the forest just a shot every five minutes which will be enough to show them we are still here and have not done with them yet when the place cools down a bit we will send a party on shore to keep up a dropping fire against the forest and so induce them to believe that we mean to attack them there    chapter viii   during the rest of the day preparations were actively carried on for the nights work the fifty marines and a hundred bluejackets were to take part in the landing expedition the ammunition to be carried was ranged along the deck and the men told off for the various work there was to be done some being allotted to carry stretchers and surgical requirements for the wounded the first lieutenant was to command the party having with him the third lieutenant the masters mate and the two senior midshipmen besides of course the marine officers dr horsley was also to accompany them some cartridges were made up with powder and musket bullets for two of the brass guns captured in order that if the malays succeeded in landing they might meet with a hot reception it was decided that no carriages should be taken for them but that they should be simply laid on the sandbags  the party on shore had kept up a fire all day at the forest the yells of defiance which at times rose showed that the malays were in great force all round its edge towards evening all on shore returned to the ship as soon as it became absolutely dark the anchor chain was unshackled and a buoy being attached to the end it was noiselessly lowered into the water then the screw began to revolve and the vessel gradually backed down the river all lights had been extinguished and no sound from the forest showed that the movement had been observed a mile lower down the ship was turned the screw began to revolve more rapidly and at half speed she ran down to the junction of the two branches of the river and steamed up the other arm until within half a mile or so of the village at the mouth of the creek then a light anchor was let go the boats were lowered and the landing party took their places in them the oars were all muffled and keeping close to the right bank of the river they rowed up until past the village and then crossing entered the mouth of the creek and rowed up it until they reached the spot where the landing had been effected on the previous night  half a dozen men provided with well greased saws first landed under dick baldersons command and cleared a passage six feet wide to the path then the landing began in earnest the guns were first put on shore and carried bodily to the path the rest of the marines and the bluejackets then landed each carrying in addition to his arms and ammunition a gun cartridge or a box of rifle ammunition and a couple of empty sacks as fast as they landed they proceeded up the path dick balderson led the way and the men were directed to step as closely as they could to each other as they arrived near the pool each deposited his burden and then went back to assist to drag up the guns and carriages  scarcely a sound was heard during the operation their feet fell noiselessly on the soft earth of the track and no one a few yards away would have guessed that a hundred and fifty men were engaged in laborious toil there was far more noise than there had been the night before on board the prahus an incessant jabber being maintained and voices rang high in excitement as the men discussed the destruction of the town and the orders that had been received for a portion of them to land on the following morning and take part in the annihilation of the whites if they entered into the forest as soon as the two heavy guns were placed upon their carriages just behind the screen of bushes the greater portion of the men were sent back as far as the point where they had landed there to fill the sacks with earth from the bank of the river a number of shovels having been brought for the purpose  several large bundles of bamboos cut into lengths six feet long and sharpened at both ends had been among the articles taken up to the battery and while most of the men were engaged filling and carrying the sacks of earth some were employed in constructing chevaux de frise ten paces on each side of the spot where the battery was being constructed the bamboos were set diagonally a foot and a half into the soft earth and bound together by being lashed to strong poles running along them these fences extended from the edge of the bushes by the water to the trees the forest behind was so thick and entangled with creepers that there was little fear of an attack being made from that quarter  accustomed to work in the darkness the sailors had no difficulty in carrying out the operation and before morning broke the battery was complete it was six feet high on the side facing the water with two embrasures for the guns four feet high on the sides covered by the chevaux de frise the front face was twentyfive feet in length the sides forty morning was breaking as the work was finished and bread and cold meat were served out with a full ration of grog by the time these were consumed it was broad daylight for there is little twilight so near the equator  now for it dick harry parkhurst said as the lieutenant gave the signal for all to rise and take their places filing out of the battery the marines lined the bank on one side and the sailors other than those who were to work the guns on the other some of the sailors climbed over the front wall and with their jackknives cut away the boughs in front of the guns there was silence on board the prahus where the malays had dropped off to sleep a couple of hours before daylight mr ferguson himself superintended the laying of the guns seeing that each was most carefully trained upon the waterline of a prahu as the distance was some seventy or eighty yards he had little doubt that the two vessels aimed at would be sunk at once when he was thoroughly satisfied he drew back and gave the order to fire  the two reports sounded as if one and were mingled with the explosion of shells as they struck the prahus exactly on the waterline there was a momentary silence and then a wild hubbub of yells of surprise and fury while a loud cheer broke from the british as they saw the success of the shots almost instantly the two craft struck began to settle down and in a minute disappeared the water being covered with the heads of the crew who were swimming to the other prahus the guns of these had evidently been kept loaded for before the two eighteen pounders were again ready a fire was opened by the four craft one or two balls striking the sandbags while the rest went crashing into the forest behind every shot from the british guns struck the prahus but none effected such damage as the first two fired  they are taking to their boats ferguson the doctor who was standing beside him said  yes but i fancy they have no thought of giving it up at present they are going to make a dash at us they can still work their guns and spare any amount of men to attack us  the next minute indeed a dozen boats crammed with men shot round from behind the prahus  grape now the lieutenant ordered while at the same moment the marines and seamen who had hitherto been silent opened fire from under the bushes beneath which they were enabled to obtain a view of what was going on  two of the boats were sunk by the discharge of the grape but the others without checking their course pushed on  quick lads give them another round before it is too late  the guns were loaded with incredible quickness and two more of the boats were shattered their swarthy occupants striking out for the shore making for the most part towards the battery as did the boats twenty of the sailors and as many marines were at once called in from the bank to aid in the defense of the battery and a desperate conflict was presently raging here and along the bank the malays swarming up striving to force their way up through the embrasures or to climb the sandbags but as fast as they did so they were cut down or bayoneted by its defenders those trying to land at other points were impeded by the bushes and numbers were killed but they pressed on so furiously that at last mr ferguson who had been moving backwards and forwards along the line thought it best to call the men in and in a minute or two the whole party were collected in the little fort and ranged along the sides  with furious yells the malays came on and although swept by volleys of musketry reached the bamboos which they strove in vain to pluck up or climb in the meantime the eighteen pounders had never ceased their fire the sailors working them steadily regardless of the fight that was going on on either flank here the little brass guns did good service each time they were fired the recoil sent them tumbling from the top of the sandbags only however to be seized sponged and loaded by the four sailors in charge of each and then lifted to their place again crammed with bullets to the muzzle in readiness to check the next charge of the malays suddenly their yells redoubled and were answered by similar shouts from the forest  the rajahs troops have come up the first lieutenant said to the marine officer our position is getting serious do you think that we could make our way back to the boats without great loss we have sunk two of their craft have badly damaged the others and inflicted very heavy loss on them  it would be a very risky operation but it might be done ferguson listen  there was a fresh outburst of shouts this time on the path by which they had come evidently a number of the newly arrived malays had struck into it by some other track from the town  that settles it the lieutenant said shortly we must fight it out here it is lucky we have a fair stock of ammunition and can keep it up for some hours yet you see the sailors have not had to use their pistols yet and they will astonish those fellows if they do manage to scale the sandbags  for another half hour the fighting continued again and again the malays fell back but only to return to the attack with fresh fury and the defenders had been obliged to betake themselves more than once to their pistols the two heavy guns were now removed from their position to the sides for the attack by boats had ceased entirely and the destruction of the prahus was of less importance than the defense of the little fort from the attacks on its flanks the operation began just as the malays made one of their retreats and by the time they returned the guns were placed in their new position their muzzles peeping out from among the sandbags while the embrasures on the water face had been closed by bags taken from the upper line the effect of the fire at such close quarters was to drive the malays flying into the forest shortly afterwards the sound of chopping was heard  the beggars are trying to cut a path through the jungle to our rear dick harry parkhurst said  obstinate brutes but i dont think much of that harry they will get on well enough until they arrive within twenty or thirty yards of us when we can pepper them so hotly that they will soon get sick of it  at this moment there was the report of a heavy gun and a shell crashed through the forest fifty yards in the rear of the fort loud yells of rage and alarm rose from the malays while a hearty cheer broke from the defenders of the fort closely following came the sound of another gun and then a rain of grape some of which whistled over the fort  keep yourselves well down behind the sandbags men lieutenant ferguson shouted the captain knows that we have shelter and will sweep the malays out of the forest round us that shot must have done great execution among the malays on the path between us and the boats  the guns of the ship kept up a heavy fire searching the wood for some distance round with shell and pouring volleys of grape into the trees near the battery presently the fire ceased  i fancy they have all bolted dick his comrade said after the first five minutes we have not heard a sound i wonder what the prahus are doing  a minute later the lieutenant said mr morrison take a dozen men and make your way along the path until you get to the boats i hope they have escaped if they are within hail go on board and report to the captain that we have sunk two of the prahus and that for the present the malays who have been attacking us have made off say that large numbers of them have gone on board the four prahus and that i am about to open fire upon them again  as soon as the mate had left parties of men were set to work to shift the guns to their old positions and fire was again opened upon the piratical prahus who replied as before with their little guns a very few minutes later a shell flew overhead and fell in the water near where the craft were anchored another and another followed quickly intense excitement was manifest on board the prahus and almost immediately their cables were cut oars got out and at a great rate they started down the creek  the place has got too hot for them altogether harry they think it better to run the gauntlet of the ships guns than to be sunk at their moorings  scarcely had the prahus issued from the pool than the guns of the ship were heard  i am afraid that some of them will get away harry the beggars row so fast that there wont be time to give them more than one broadside as they pass if the ship is aground which is likely enough for the captain pushed up farther than we thought possible they will be pretty safe when they have once got past her  presently the guns were heard to fire in rapid succession loud yells and cries followed then came shouts of triumph and defiance then all was still save that a few cannon shot were discharged at regular intervals  they have got one of the guns round to fire over the stern dick there it has stopped now evidently the prahus have got round the next corner it is a pity that any of them should have escaped and they would not have done so if the serpent had remained at the mouth of the creek but i suppose the captain became anxious at the continuation of the heavy firing here and so came up to our help it is lucky he did so for though we might have beaten them off they were in such tremendous force that i fancy it would have gone hard with us in the long run i was beginning to think so myself harry  dr horsley had been busy enough from the time that the fighting began in earnest ten men had been killed by balls that had passed through the embrasures or by kris or lance wounds and twentyeight others had been more or less severely wounded a quarter of an hour after the firing ceased captain forrest himself with the mate rowed into the pool in one of the cutters and landed at the end of the path close to the battery  i congratulate you on your success mr ferguson he said shaking hands with the first lieutenant it has been a very hot affair and by mr morrisons report it was just as well that i decided to change my plan and come up to your aid though it has resulted in two of the prahus getting away  then you sank two of them sir  no indeed we only sank one the third went down just after we saw her come out from the pool certainly we had not hit her so that the honor of accounting for three out of six of the craft falls to you and your party well doctor what is your report i am afraid it is a bad one  serious indeed he went on after he had received the figures still it is much less than might have been expected from attacking such a host of pirates i am glad to hear that none of the officers are dangerously wounded  parkhurst had his forearm laid open with a cut from a kris and balderson had one of their spears through his ear dr horsley said if it had been half an inch more to the left it would probably have killed him lieutenant somers of the marines is more badly hurt a spear having gone through the thigh it cut an artery luckily the doctor was close to him at the moment and clapped on a tourniquet and then cut down to the artery and tied it as he says a delay of two minutes and it would have been all up with the young fellow are the boats safe sir  yes the boat keepers pushed off a little way when the firing began in the forest and when they heard the shouts of a large party of the enemy coming along the path they went out almost into the middle of the creek and it was well they did for many of the malays came down through the path you cut and would have riddled them with their spears had they been within reach the boat keepers acted very wisely all of them got into the gig and towed the other boats astern so that if the malays came along either in their prahus or in their boats they could have cut them adrift and made a race of it down to the ship  well i think that there is nothing more to be done here the men may as well have a tot of grog served out and then the sailors can march down to the landing place and bring up the boats and take the guns and what ammunition you have left on board mr morrison will go back with me to the ship he has one of his arms broken by a ball from the prahus  i did not know that he was wounded sir he did not report it i should not have sent him if i had known it  it is just as well as it is ferguson it will give me an opportunity of specially recommending him for promotion in my report the assistant surgeon temporarily bandaged his arm when he reached the ship  is she afloat sir  no i want you back as soon as possible we shall have to get out the anchors and heave on them we put on a full head of steam and drove her two or three hundred yards through the mud before she finally brought up i wanted to get as near to you as possible in order to clear the woods round you  by two oclock the whole ships company were on board again and set to work to get her off but it was not until after some hours exertion that the serpent was again afloat she was at once turned round steamed down to the mouth of the creek and cast anchor opposite the village    chapter ix   the party landed at the village the next morning but found it entirely deserted  it is most important that we should take a prisoner ferguson the captain said as he and the first lieutenant paced up and down the quarterdeck we must catch the two prahus if we can at present we dont know whether they have gone up or down the river and it would be absolutely useless for us to wait until we get some clew to their whereabouts after we have finished with them we will go up the other branch and try to find the two we know to be up there i should not like to leave our work unfinished  certainly not sir i am afraid though it is of no use landing to try to get hold of a prisoner no doubt the woods are full of them there are the townspeople and those who came to help them and though many of those who tried to swim ashore from the sunken boats may have been taken by the alligators still the greater portion must have landed all right  i should think mr ferguson that it would be a good plan to send a party of twenty men on shore after nightfall and to distribute them two men to a hut possibly two or three of the malays may come down to the village before morning either to fetch valuables they may have left behind or to see whether we are still here they may come tonight or they may come some time tomorrow crawling through the plantations behind the houses at any rate i will wait here a day or two on the chance  whom shall i send with the men sir  you had better send parkhurst and balderson they will have more authority among the men than the younger midshipmen the men better take three days cooked provisions on shore and ten small kegs of water one for each hut i will give parkhurst his instructions before he lands  now mr parkhurst he said when the boat was lowered soon after dark you must bear in mind that the greatest vigilance will be necessary choose ten huts close together one man in each hut must be always awake there must be no talking above a whisper and during the daytime no one must leave his hut on any account whatever after nightfall you and mr balderson will move from hut to hut to see that a vigilant watch is kept you must of course take watch and watch night and day you must remember that not only is it most important that a native should be captured but you must be on your guard against an attack on yourselves it is quite conceivable that a party may come down to see if there are any of us in the village  in case of attack you must gather in one hut and fire three shots as a signal to us a musket shot will be fired in return when you hear it every man must throw himself down for the guns will be already loaded with grape and i shall fire a broadside towards the spot where i have heard your signal  as soon as the broadside is fired make down to the shore occupy a house close to the water and keep the malays off till the boats come ashore to fetch you off your crew has been very carefully picked i have consulted the warrant officers and they have selected the most taciturn men in the ship there is to be no smoking of course the men can chew as much as they like but the smell of tobacco smoke would at once deter any native from entering a hut if a malay should come in and try to escape he must be fired on as he runs away but the men are to aim at his legs  the instructions were carried out a small hole was bored in the back of each of the huts so that a constant watch could be kept up unseen by the closest observer in the forest a hundred yards behind the night passed off quietly as did the next day the men slept and watched by turns on the afternoon of the second day a native was seen moving cautiously from tree to tree along the edge of the forest as soon as it was dark dick whose watch it was crawled cautiously from hut to hut  that fellow we saw today may come at any moment he said if one of you see him coming the other must place himself close to the door and if he enters throw himself upon him and hold his arms tightly till the others come up to help keep your rope handy to twist round him and remember these fellows are as slippery as eels  having made the round he returned to the hut in the center of the others that he and harry occupied half an hour later they heard a sudden outcry from the hut next to them and rushing in found the two men there struggling with a malay with their aid he was speedily bound then the men were called from the other huts and the whole party ran down to the waters edge where harry hailed the ship a boat put off at once and they were taken on board the prisoner was led to the captains cabin and there examined through the medium of the interpreter he refused to answer any questions until by the captains orders he was taken on deck again and a noose placed round his neck and the interpreter told him that unless he spoke he was to be hauled up to the yards arm the man was still silent  tighten the strain very gradually the captain said to the sailors holding the other end of the rope raise him two or three feet above the deck and then when the doctor holds up his hand lower him at once again  this was done the man though half strangled was still conscious and on the noose being loosened and soh hay saying that unless he spoke he would be again run up he said as soon as he got his breath that he would answer any question on being taken to the cabin he said that the prahus had gone down the river and had ascended the other arm they had only gone a few miles above the town for one had been so injured that there had been difficulty in keeping her afloat and it was necessary to run her into a creek in order to repair her before going up farther  half an hour later steam was up and before morning the serpent lay off the mouth of the creek which the malay pointed out as the one that the prahu had entered the second officer was this time placed in command of the boats he himself going in the launch the third officer took the first cutter the two midshipmen the second no time was lost in making preparations for it was desirable to capture the prahu before she was aware that the serpent had left her position in the other river for a mile the boats rowed up the creek which narrowed until they were obliged to go in single file it widened suddenly and as the launch dashed through a shower of balls tore up the water round her while at the same moment a great tree fell across the creek completely barring their retreat and narrowly shaving the stern of the midshipmens boat which was the last in the line fortunately the launch had escaped serious injury and with a shout of treachery lieutenant hopkins drew his pistol to put a ball through the head of their guide but as he did so the man sprang overboard and dived towards the shore  row men we have all our work cut out for us there are three prahus ahead steer for the center one coxswain  with a cheer the men bent to their oars and dashed at the prahu which as was evident by patches of plank freshly fastened to her side was one of those that had before escaped them  follow me the lieutenant shouted to the boat behind we must take them one by one the three boats dashed at the pirate craft which was crowded with men regardless of the fire from the other two vessels the launch steered for her stem the first cutter for her bow while the midshipmen swept round her and boarded her on the opposite side a furious contest took place on her deck the malays being so confused by being assailed at three points simultaneously that the midshipmens party were enabled to gain a footing with but very slight resistance the shouts of the malays near them brought many running from the other points and the parties there gained a footing with comparatively little loss then a desperate struggle began but the malays were unable to withstand the furious attack of the british and ere long began to leap overboard and swim to the other craft which were both coming to their aid  the launchs gun had not been fired and calling to dick harry leaped down into the boat the two midshipmen trained the gun upon the nearest prahu and aiming at the waterline fired it when the craft was within twenty feet of them a moment later its impetus brought it against the side of the launch which was crushed like an eggshell between it and the captured prahu the two midshipmen springing on board just in time it was the malays turn to board now that of the british to prevent them the musketry of the sailors and marines for a time kept the enemy off but they strove desperately to gain a footing on board until a loud cry was heard and the craft into which the midshipmen had fired sank suddenly and a loud cheer broke from the british  the two midshipmen were engaged with the other pirate from whom a cry of dismay arose at seeing the disappearance of their friends  now lads follow me harry shouted as the malays strove to push their craft away followed by a dozen sailors they leaped on to her deck but the efforts of the malays succeeded in thrusting the vessels apart in vain the midshipmen and their followers fought desperately harry was felled by a blow with a war club dick cut down with a kris half the seamen were killed the others jumped overboard and swam back to their vessel lieutenant hopkins shouted to the men to take to the boats and the two cutters were speedily manned one however was in a sinking condition but lieutenant hopkins with the other started in pursuit of the prahu whose crew had already got their oars out and in spite of the efforts of the sailors soon left them behind pursuit was evidently hopeless and reluctantly the lieutenant ordered the men to row back on returning to the scene of combat they saw sunk near the bank the fourth of the prahus the spy was so far right the second lieutenant mutteredthis fellow did sink now we must see that she does no more mischief he brought the captured prahu alongside the others whose decks were but a foot or two below the water and fired several shots through their bottoms then he set the captured craft on fire and took to the boats which with great difficulty forced their way under the fallen tree and rowed back to the ship  the third lieutenant had been shot dead twelve men had been killed ten of the midshipmens party were missing and of the rest but few had escaped without wounds more or less serious  harry was the first to recover his senses being roughly brought to by a bucket of water being dashed over him he looked round the deck of those who had sprung on board with him none were visible save dick balderson who was lying near him with a cloth tightly bound round his shoulder  as he rose into a sitting position a murmur of satisfaction broke from some malays standing near it was some time before he could rally his senses  i suppose he thought at last they are either keeping us for torture or as hostages the rajah may have given orders that any officers captured were to be spared and brought to him i dont know what his expectations are he muttered to himself but if he expects to be reinstated as rajah and perhaps compensated for the loss of his palace he is likely to be mistaken and in that case it will go mighty hard with us for there is no shadow of doubt that he is a savage and cruel brute  he had now shaken off the numbness caused by the blow that he had received and he managed to stagger to where dick was lying and knelt beside him and begged the malays to bring water they had evidently received orders to do all they could to revive the two young officers and one at once brought half a gourd full harry had already assured himself that his friends heart still beat he began by pouring some water between his lips it was not necessary to pour any over his head for he had already received the same treatment as himself  dick old chap he said sharply and earnestly  the sound was evidently heard and understood for dick started slightly opened his eyes and murmured its not time to turn out yet  you are not in your hammock dick you have been wounded and we are both prisoners in the hands of these malays try and pull yourself together but dont move they have put a sort of bandage round your shoulder and i am going to try and improve it  what is the matter with my shoulder dick murmured  chopped with a kris old man now i am going to turn you on your side and then cut the sleeve off the jacket take another drink of water then we will set about it  dick did as he was ordered and was evidently coming back to consciousness for he looked round and then said where are the other fellows  i dont know what has become of them i think i went down before you did however here we are alone now i am going to begin  he cut off the sleeve of the jacket and shirt at the shoulder ripped open the seam to the neck first taking off the rough bandage  its a nasty cut old man he said but nothing dangerous i should say i fancy it has gone clean through the shoulder bone and there is no doubt that it will knit again as hassans did if they do but give you time  he rolled the shirt sleeve into a pad saturated it with water and laid it on the wound  you see i know all about it dick he said cheerily from having watched the doctor at work on hassan now i will tear this cloth into strips  he first placed a strip of the cloth over the shoulder crossed it under the arm and then took the ends of the bandage across the chest and back and tied them under his other arm he repeated this process with half a dozen other strips then he placed dicks hand upon his chest tied some of the other strips together and bound them tightly round the arm and body so that no movement of the limb was possible one of the malays knelt down and gave him his assistance and nodded approvingly when he had finished then he helped harry raise him into a sitting position against the bulwark  that is better dick said as far as it goes how was it these fellows did not kill us at once  i expect the rajah has ordered that all officers who may fall into their hands are to be kept as hostages so that he can open negotiations with the skipper if he gets what he wants he hands us back if not there is no manner of doubt that he will put us out of the way without compunction  the men were still working at the oars and for four hours rowed without intermission through a labyrinth of creeks at last they stopped before a small village tied the prahu up to a tree and then the man who seemed to be the captain went ashore with two or three others the lads heard a loud outburst of anger and a voice which they recognized as that of the rajah storming and raging for some time then the hubbub ceased an hour later the rajah himself came on board with two or three attendants and a man whom they recognized as speaking a certain amount of english the rajah scowled at them and from the manner in which he kept fingering his kris they saw that it needed a great effort on his part to abstain from killing them at once he spoke for some time in his own language and the interpreter translated it  you are dogsyou and all your countrymen the rajah is sending a message to your captain to tell him that he must build up his palace again pay him for the warships that he has destroyed and provide him with a guard against his enemies until a fresh fleet has been built if he refuses to do this you will both be killed  tell him harry said that if we are dogs anyhow we have shown him that we can bite as to what he says it is for the captain to answer but i do not think that he will grant the terms though possibly he may consent to spare the rajahs life and to go away with his ship if we are sent back to him without injury  the rajah uttered a scornful exclamation i have six thousand men he said and i do not need to beg my life for were there twenty ships instead of one they could never find me and not a man who landed and tried to come through the country would return alive i have given your captain the chance if at the end of three days an answer does not come granting my command you will be krised keep a strict watch upon them captain and kill them at once if they try to escape  i will guard them safely rajah the captain who from the rich materials of his sarong and jacket was evidently himself a chief said quietly but as to escape where could they go they could but wander in the jungle until they died  by night both lads felt more themselves they had been well supplied with food and though harrys head ached until as he said it was splitting and dicks wound smarted severely they were able to discuss their position they at once agreed that escape was impossible and would be even were they well and strong and could manage to obtain possession of a sampan for they would but lose themselves in the labyrinth of creeks and would moreover be certain to be overtaken by the native boats that would be sent off in all directions after them  there is nothing to do but to wait for the captains answer dick said at last  we know what that will be harry said he will tell the chief that it would be impossible for him to grant his commands but that he is ready to pay a certain sum for our release that if harm comes to us he will make peace with the chiefs who have assisted sehi against us on condition of their hunting him down and sending him alive or dead to the ships but the rascal knows that he could hide himself in these swamps for a month and he will proceed to chop off our heads without a moments delay we must keep our eyes open tomorrow and endeavor to get hold of a couple of weapons it is a deal better to die fighting than it is to have our throats cut like sheep    chapter x   the next two days passed quietly the lads were both a great deal better and agreed that ifwhich would almost certainly not be the casea means of escape should present itself they would seize the chance however hopeless it might be for that at worst they could but be cut down in attempting it no chance however presented itself two malays always squatted near them and their eyes followed every movement  some time tomorrow the messenger will return harry said it is clear to me that our only chance is to escape before morning those fellows will be watchful till the night is nearly over now i propose that just before the first gleam of daylight we throw ourselves upon them suddenly seize their krises and cut them down then leap on shore and dash into the jungle the night will be as dark as pitch what with there being no moon and with the mist from the swamps at any rate we might get out of sight before the malays knew what had happened we could either go straight into the jungle and crawl into the thick bushes and lie there until morning and then make our start or what would i think be even better take to the water wade along under the bank till we reach one of those sampans fifty yards away get in and manage to paddle it noiselessly across to the opposite side lift the craft out of the water and hide it among the bushes and then be off  the worst of it is the alligators harry  yes but we must risk that we shall have the krises and if they seize either of us the other must go down and try and jab his kris into the beasts eyes i know it is a frightfully dangerous business and the chances are one hundred to one against our succeeding but there is just a chance and there is no chance at all if we leave it until tomorrow of course if we succeed in getting over to the other side we must wait close to the water until daylight we should tear ourselves to pieces if we tried to make through the jungle in the dark  i tell you what would give us a better chancewe might take off two or three yards of that bandage of yours cut the strip in half and twist it into a rope then when those fellows doze off a little we might throw the things round their necks and it would be all up with them  but you see i have only one arm harry  bother it i never thought of that well i might do the securing one fellow first and then the other you could get close to him and if he moves catch up his kris and cut him down  yes i could do that well anyhow harry we can but try anything is better than waiting here hour after hour for the messenger to come back with what will be our death warrant  they agreed to keep awake by turns and accordingly lay down as soon as it became dark the malays as usual squatting at a distance of a couple of paces each side of them it was about two oclock in the morning when dick who was awake saw as he supposed one of the crew standing up a few yards away he was not sure for just at that moment the figure disappeared  what on earth could that fellow want to stand up for and lie down again for i can swear he was not there half a minute ago there is another farther on he pinched himself to make sure that he was awake figure after figure seemed to flit along the deck and disappear one of the guard rose and stretched his arms put a fresh bit of some herb that he was chewing into his mouth moved close to the prisoners to see if they were asleep and then resumed his former position during the time that he was on his feet dick noticed that the phenomenon which had so puzzled him ceased a quarter of an hour later it began again he touched harry keeping his hand on his lips as a warning to be silent suddenly a wild yell broke on the still air and in an instant the deck was alive with men and as the two malay watchers rose to their feet both were cut down  there were sounds of heavy blows screams and yells a short and confused struggle and the fall of heavy bodies while from the little village there were also sounds of conflict the midshipmen had started to their feet half bewildered at the sudden and desperate struggle when a hand was laid on each of their shoulders and a voice said english friends hassan has come  the revulsion of feeling was so great that for a minute neither could speak then dick said chief we thank you with all our hearts tomorrow we should have been killed  the chief shook hands with them both warmly having seen that mode of salutation on board ship  hassan glad he said hassan watch all time no let sehi kill friends friends save hassans child he save them  torches were now lighted the deck was thickly encumbered with dead for every one of the crew of the prahu had been killed  sehi killed too the chief said come and see he swung himself on shore the boys followed his example two of the malays helping dick down they went to the village where a number of malays were moving about torches had been brought from the ship and a score of these soon lit up the scene two of the rajahs men had been killed outside their huts but the majority had fallen inside the chief asked a question of one of his followers who pointed to a hut  this they entered and by the light of the torches saw the rajah lying dead upon the ground hassan said something to one of his men who with a single blow chopped off the rajahs head  send to chiefs hassan said if not see not think dead much afraid of him when know he dead not fight any more make peace quick  one of the men asked a question and the lads limited knowledge of the language was sufficient to tell them that he was asking whether they should fire the village hassan shook his head many men he said waving his arm to the forest see fire come fight plenty of fight been no need for more for a time he stood with them in front of the pool a series of splashes in the water told what was going on the prahu was being cleared of its load of dead bodies then several men filled buckets with water and handed them up to the deck the boys knew that an attempt was being made to wash away the blood the process was repeated a dozen times while this was going on the pool was agitated in every direction the lads shuddered as they looked and remembered that they had proposed to wade along the edge the place swarmed with alligators who scrambled and fought for the bodies thrown over until the number was so great that all were satisfied and the pool became comparatively quiet although fresh monsters guided by the smell of blood kept arriving on the scene  at last the chief said come and together they returned to the prahu the morning was now breaking and but few signs remained of the terrible conflict of the night at the chiefs order a large basket of wine that had been found in the rajahs hut was brought on board together with another full of bananas and other fruit  well harry said laughing we little thought when we saw the champagne handed over to the rajah that we were going to have the serving of it  hassan joined them at the meal he had been given wine regularly by the doctor and although he had evinced no partiality for it but had taken it simply at the doctors orders he now drank a little to keep the others company in a short time the whole of the chiefs followers were gathered on deck and the boys saw that they were no more numerous than the prahus crew and that it was only the advantage of surprise that had enabled them to overcome so easily both those on board the prahu and the rajahs followers in the village the oars were got out and the prahu proceeded up the creek in the opposite direction to which it had entered it going to ship harry asked pointing forward  hassan shook his head going home he said sent messenger sampan tell captain both safe sehi killed prahu taken must go home others angry because hassan not join may come and fight hassan ask captain bring ship up river messenger show channel tell how far can go then come in boats hold great meeting make peace  the lads were well satisfied they had a longing to see hassans home and perhaps to do some shooting and they thought that a few days holiday before rejoining would be by no means unpleasant they wished however that they had known that the sampan was leaving so that they could have written a line to the captain saying what had taken place and that they could not rejoin there was at first some splashing of the oars for many of hassans men had had no prior experience except with sampans and large canoes however it was not long before they fell into the swing and the boat proceeded at a rapid pace several times as they went natives appeared on the bank in considerable numbers and receiving no answer to their hails sent showers of lances harry however with the aid of two or three malays soon loaded the guns of the prahu  no kill hassan said we want make friends no good kill  accordingly the guns were fired far over the heads of the assailants who at once took to the bushes after three hours rowing they entered the river and continued their course up it until long into the night for the rowers were as anxious as was hassan himself to reach their village they were numerous enough to furnish relays at the oars and the stroke never flagged until an hour before midnight fires were seen burning ahead as they turned a bend of the river the malays raised a yell of triumph which was answered from the village and in a few minutes the prahu was brought up to the bank a crowd composed mostly of women and children received them with shouts of welcome and gladness hassan at once led the midshipmen to a large hut that had evidently been prepared in readiness for them piles of skins lay in two of the corners and the lads who were utterly worn out threw themselves down and were almost instantly asleep  the sun was high when the mat at the entrance was drawn aside and hassan entered followed by four of his followers one carried a great water jar and two calabashes with some cotton cloths and towels the other brought fruit of several varieties eggs and sweetmeats together with a large gourd full of steaming coffee  hassan come again the chief said and left the hut with his followers the lads poured calabashes of water over each other and felt wonderfully refreshed by their wash which was accomplished without damage to the floor which was of bamboos raised two feet above the ground when they were dressed they fell to at their breakfast and then went out of doors hassan had evidently been watching for them for he came out of his house which was next to that which they occupied holding his little girls hand she at once ran up to them saluting them by their names  bahi very glad to see you she said very glad to see good kind officers the child had picked up during her month on board the ship a great deal of english from her constant communication with the officers and crew  bad men wound dick she went on pitifully wicked men to hurt him  bahi will you tell your father how much we are obliged to him for having come to our rescue we should have been killed if he had not come  the child translated the sentence the chief smiled  tell them he said that hassan is glad to have been able to pay back a little of the obligation he was under to them besides sehi pandash was my enemy good thing to help friends and kill enemy at the same time tell them that hassan does not want thanks they did not like him to thank them for saving you  the child translated this with some difficulty then he led the midshipmen round the village and showed them the strong palisade which had evidently just been erected and explained through the child that it had only been built before he left as but fifteen men were available for guarding the place in his absence  the next four days were spent in shooting expeditions and although they met with no wild beasts they secured a large number of bird skins for the doctor on the fifth day a native ran in and said that boats with white men were coming the midshipmen ran down to the bank and saw the ships two cutters and a gig approaching the captain himself was in the stern of the latter and the doctor was sitting beside him a minute or two later they were shaking hands with the officers and saying a few words to the men who were evidently delighted to see them again just as the greetings were over hassan in a rich silk sarong and jacket came down towards them he was leading his little daughter and six malays followed them  welcome captain he said gravely hassan very glad to see you all come right now  thank you chief we have learned from your messenger how gallantly you have rescued my two officers and put an end to our troubles by killing the rajah sehi and capturing the last of the piratical craft  this was too much for hassan and had to be translated by soh hay since the chiefs return a number of his men had been occupied in constructing bamboo huts for the use of the captain officers and men also a large hall to be used for councils and meetings and to this he now led the captain and his officers when they were seated he made a speech of welcome saying what gladness it was to him to see there those who had been so kind to him had he known when they would arrive food would have been ready for them and he assured them that however long they might stay they would be most heartily welcome and that there should be no lack of provisions they had done an immense service to him and to all the other chiefs on the river by breaking up the power of one who preyed upon all his neighbors and was a scourge to trade as there were still several bottles of the rajahs wine left champagne was now handed round  it makes my heart glad to see you doctor the chief said see i am as strong and as well as ever had it not been for you my arm might now have been useless and my ribs have grown through the flesh  i dont think it would have been as bad as that the doctor replied but there is no doubt that it was fortunate that you were able to receive surgical treatment so soon after the accident and it has been fortunate for us too especially for our young friends here  conversation became general now and the interpreter was kept hard at work and bahi divided her attention between the officers and the men flitting in and out of the hall and chattering away to the sailors and marines who were breakfasting outside on the stores they had brought up supplemented by a bountiful supply of fruit which grew in abundance round the village it was not long before a meal was served to the officers fowl having been hastily killed as soon as the boats were seen approaching several jungle fowl had been brought in that morning plaintains and rice were boiled and cakes baked tea was forthcoming from the boats stores and a hearty meal was eaten    chapter xi   after the meal was concluded the captain said to the chief  now hassan we want to know how it was that you arrived at the nick of time to save my officers lives  i had been watching for some days the chief said quietly when i heard that many chiefs had joined sehi pandash i said i must go and help my white brothers but i dared not take many men away from here and as i had to hide the fewer there were with me the better so i came down into the forest near sehis town and found the wood full of men we had come down in sampans so that i could send off messengers as might be required one of these i sent down to you to warn you to be prepared for an attack other messengers i had sent before from here but they must have been caught and killed for i had been watched closely when they found that i would not join against you  when my last messenger returned i was glad i knew that you would be on your guard and would not be caught treacherously two of my men were in the town when they began to fire on the ship and i saw the town destroyed and followed sehi to the place where the six prahus were lying and crossed the creek and lay down in the woods near the village on the other side for i thought that something might happen one of my men went down in the night and brought me news that the ship was gone as my messenger had told me that you had questioned him as to the other entrance to the creek i felt sure that you had gone there so i was not surprised when just before daybreak two guns were fired we saw the fight the sinking of two of their vessels and the attack by the water pirates and by the men of the rajah and the chiefs with him and i feared greatly that my friends would be overpowered  i sent one of my men down to the mouth of the creek to tell you how much aid was wanted but he saw the ship steaming up as he went and so came back to me then we heard the ships great guns begin to fire and soon all was quiet where the fight had been going on then i saw the other four boats start one of them sank before she was out of sight and i soon heard that your ship had sunk another and that two had got away it was not for another two days that i learned where they were and then i heard that they had gone into a creek twenty miles away there one had sunk and the other had been joined by the two prahus that had been far up the river and i also learned that one of sehis men had gone into the village and let himself be captured so that he might guide the ships boats to the place where as they thought they would find but one prahu while three would be waiting for them i was not sure where the exact place was for there are many creeks but with one of my men i rowed in a sampan all night in hopes to arrive in time to warn the boats but it was not till i heard the firing that i knew exactly where they were  when i got there the fighting was over and but one prahu had escaped and i learned from the men who had swum ashore from those that had been sunk that one of the english boats had been destroyed and many men killed but that two boats had gone down the creek again it was also said that the white officers and sailors had boarded the boat that had escaped and had been all killed i thought it best to follow the prahu so that i could send word to you where she was to be found as there were many passages it was difficult to find her and i should have lost her altogether had i not heard where sehi was hiding and guessed that she would go there it was late when i arrived at the village there one of my men learned that two young officers who had been wounded had been brought there and that sehi was sending word to you that unless you gave him the conditions he asked they would be put to death  i did not know whether to send down to you or to send up the river for help but i thought the last was best for if you came in boats then sehis men would hear you and the officers would be killed so i sent off my man with the sampan i told him that he must not stop until he got here he must tell them that all my men except fifty old ones who were to guard the village were to start in their canoes and paddle their hardest till they came within half a mile of the village and he was to come back with them to guide them and i was to meet them as the prahus that had been up there were destroyed the river was safe for them to descend i said that they must be at the point i named last evening they were two hours late though they had paddled their hardest as soon as they disembarked i led them to the spot and the rest was easy i knew that the prisoners who had been taken were my two friends for i saw them on the deck of the prahu and glad indeed i was to be able to pay my debt to them  you have paid it indeed most nobly hassan the captain said holding out his hand and grasping that of the chief when sentence by sentence the story was translated to him little did we think when you were brought on board the serpent that your friendship would turn out of such value to us  there was now some discussion as to the proposed meeting of chiefs and half an hour after a dozen small canoes started with invitations to the various chiefs to meet the captain at hassans campong with assurances that he was ready to overlook their share in the attack on the ship and be on friendly terms with them and that the safety of each who attended was guaranteed whether he was willing to be on good terms with the english or not four days later the meeting took place in the newly erected hall ten or twelve of the chiefs attended others who had taken a leading part as sehis allies did not venture to come themselves but sent messages with assurances of their desire to be on friendly terms a good deal of ceremonial was observed the marines and bluejackets were drawn up in line before the hall which was decorated with green boughs a union jack waved from a pole in front of it  the chiefs were introduced by hassan to the captain the former then addressed them rehearsing the service that the english had done to them by destroying the power of the tyrant who had long been a scourge to his neighbors and who intended without doubt to become master of the whole district as a proof of the good will of the english towards the malays he related how the two english officers had leaped into the water to save his child and how kindly he himself had been treated then the captain addressed them through the interpreter he told them that he had only been sent up the river by the governor in accordance with an invitation from sehi of whose conduct he was ignorant to undertake the protectorate of his district and that on learning his true character he at once reported to the governor that the rajah was not a proper person to receive protection as not only did he prevent trade and harass his neighbors but was the owner of a number of piratical craft that often descended the river and plundered the coast  england he went on has no desire whatever to take under her protection any who do not earnestly desire it and who are not willing in return to promote trade and keep peace with their neighbors nor can she make separate arrangements with minor chiefs it was only because she understood that sehi ruled over a considerable extent of territory and was all powerful in this part that his request was listened to  i shall shortly return down the river he said and have no thought or intention of interfering in any way with matters here i wish to leave on good terms with you all and to explain to you that it is to your interest to do all in your power to further trade both by sending down your products to the coast and by throwing no hindrance in the way of the products of the highlands coming down the river charging at the utmost a very small toll upon each boat that passes up and down it is the interest of all of you of the people of the hills and of ourselves that trade should increase now that sehi is dead and his people altogether dispersed and all his piratical craft destroyed with the exception of the one captured by hassan there is no obstruction to trade and you are free from the fear that he would one day eat you up  be assured that there is nothing to be feared from us you all know how greatly the states protected by us have flourished and how wealthy their rajahs have become from the increase of cultivation and the cessation of tribal wars if in the future all the chiefs of this district should desire to place themselves under english protection their request will be considered but there is not the slightest desire on the part of the governor to assume further responsibility and he will be well satisfied indeed to know that there is peace among the river tribes security for trade and a large increase in the cultivation of the country and in its prosperity  there was a general expression of satisfaction and relief upon the face of the chiefs as sentence by sentence the speech was translated to them and one by one they rose after its conclusion and expressed their hearty concurrence with what had been said  we know one of them said that these wars do much harm but if we quarrel or if one ill treats another or encourages his slaves to leave him or ravages his plantations what are we to do  that i have thought of the captain said i have spoken with the chief hassan and he has agreed to remove with his people to the spot where sehis town stood there doubtless he will be joined by sehis former subjects who cannot but be well pleased at being rid of a tyrant who had forcibly taken them under his rule he will retain the prahu that he has taken and will use it to keep the two rivers free of robbers but in no other respect will he interfere with his neighbors his desire is to cultivate the land clear away the forest and encourage his people to raise products that he can send down the river to trade with us he will occupy the territory only as far as the creek that runs between the two rivers i propose that all of you shall come to an agreement to submit any disputes that may arise between you to his decision swearing to accept his judgment whichever way it may go this is the way in which the disputes are settled in our country both sides go before a judge and he hears their statements and those of their witnesses and then decides the case and even the government of the country is bound by his decision i dont wish you to give me any reply as to this i make the suggestion solely for your own good and it is for you to talk it over among yourselves and see if you cannot all come to an agreement that will put a stop to the senseless wars and enable your people to cultivate the land in peace and to obtain all the comforts that arise from trade  a boat had been sent down to the ship and this returned with a number of the articles that had been put on board her as presents for sehi and other chiefs these were now distributed a feast was then held and the next morning the chiefs started for their homes highly gratified with the result of the meeting on the following day the british boats also took their way down the river followed by the prahu with a considerable number of hassans men who were to clear away the ruins of sehis campong to bury the dead still lying among them and to erect huts for the whole community the serpent remained for a week opposite the town a considerable quantity of flour sugar and other useful stores being landed for the use of hassans people dr horsley was gladdened by hassans promise that his people should be instructed to search for specimens of birds butterflies and other insects and that these should be treated according to his instructions and should be from time to time as occasion offered sent down to him in large cases to singapore to the two midshipmen the chief gave krises of the finest temper  i have no presents to give you worthy of your acceptance he said but you know that i shall never forget you and always regard you as brothers i intend to send twelve of my young men down to penang there to live for three years and learn useful trades from your people the doctor has advised me also to send bahi and has promised to find a comfortable home for her where she will learn to read and write your language and many other useful things it is hard to part with her but it is for her good and that of her people if you will write to me sometimes she will read the letters to me and write letters to you in return so that though we are away from each other we may know that neither of us has forgotten the other  bahi and twelve young malays were taken to penang in the serpent where the doctor found a comfortable home for her with some friends of his to whom payment for her board and schooling was to be paid by hassan in blocks of tin which he would obtain from boats coming down from the hills in exchange for other articles of trade the malays were placed with men of their own race belonging to the protected states and settled as carpenters smiths and other tradesmen in penang three years later they and bahi were all taken back in the serpent to their home  the river was acquiring considerable importance from the great increase of trade they found hassans town far more extensive and flourishing than it had been in the time of its predecessor the forest had been cleared for a considerable distance round it the former inhabitants had returned tobacco sugar canes cotton pepper and other crops whose products were useful for trade purposes were largely cultivated while orchards of fruit trees had been extensively planted hassan reported that tribal wars had almost ceased and that disputes were in almost all cases brought for his arbitration owing to the abolition of all oppressive tolls trade from the interior had very largely increased a great deal of tin together with spices and other products now finding its way down by the river hassan was delighted with the progress bahi had made and ordered that three or four boys should at once be placed for instruction under each of the men who had learned trades at penang  there was much regret on both sides when the serpent again started down the river for it was known that she would not return as in a few months she would be sent to a chinese station and from there would go direct to england the composition of her crew was already somewhat changed lieutenant ferguson had received his promotion for the fight with the prahus and had been appointed to the command of a gunboat whose captain had been invalided home lieutenant hopkins was now the serpents first lieutenant and morrison was second harry parkhurst was third lieutenant dick balderson to the regret of both having left the ship on his promotion and having been transferred as third lieutenant to captain fergusons craft both have since kept up a correspondence with bahi who has married a neighboring chief and who tells them that the river is prospering greatly and that although he assumes no authority her father is everywhere regarded as the paramount chief of the district from time to time each receives chests filled with spices silks and other malay products and sends back in return european articles of utility to the rajah for such is the rank that hassan has now acquired on the river      bears and dacoits a tale of the ghauts    chapter i   a merry party were sitting in the veranda of one of the largest and handsomest bungalows of poonah it belonged to colonel hastings colonel of a native regiment stationed there and at present in virtue of seniority commanding a brigade tiffin was on and three or four officers and four ladies had taken their seats in the comfortable cane lounging chairs which form the invariable furniture of the veranda of a well ordered bungalow permission had been duly asked and granted by mrs hastings and the cheroots had just begun to draw when miss hastings a niece of the colonel who had only arrived the previous week from england said uncle i am quite disappointed mrs lyons showed me the bear she has got tied up in their compound and it is the most wretched little thing not bigger than rover papas retriever and its full grown i thought bears were great fierce creatures and this poor little thing seemed so restless and unhappy that i thought it quite a shame not to let it go  colonel hastings smiled rather grimly  and yet small and insignificant as that bear is my dear it is a question whether he is not as dangerous an animal to meddle with as a man eating tiger  what that wretched little bear uncle  yes that wretched little bear any experienced sportsman will tell you that hunting those little bears is as dangerous a sport as tiger hunting on foot to say nothing of tiger hunting from an elephants back in which there is scarcely any danger whatever i can speak feelingly about it for my career was pretty nearly brought to an end by a bear just after i entered the army some thirty years ago at a spot within a few miles from here i have got the scars on my shoulder and arm still  oh do tell me all about it miss hastings said and the request being seconded by the rest of the party none of whom with the exception of mrs hastings had ever heard the story beforefor the colonel was somewhat chary of relating this special experiencehe waited till they had all drawn up their chairs as close as possible and then giving two or three vigorous puffs at his cheroot began as follows  thirty years ago in 1855 things were not so settled in the deccan as they are now there was no idea of insurrection on a large scale but we were going through one of those outbreaks of dacoity which have several times proved so troublesome bands of marauders kept the country in confusion pouring down on a village now carrying off three or four of the bombay money lenders who were then as now the curse of the country sometimes making an onslaught upon a body of traders and occasionally venturing to attack small detachments of troops or isolated parties of police they were not very formidable but they were very troublesome and most difficult to catch for the peasantry regarded them as patriots and aided and shielded them in every way the headquarters of these gangs of dacoits were the ghauts in the thick bush and deep valleys and gorges there they could always take refuge while sometimes the more daring chiefs converted these detached peaks and masses of rock numbers of which you can see as you come up the ghaut by railway into almost impregnable fortresses many of these masses of rock rise as sheer up from the hillside as walls of masonry and look at a short distance like ruined castles some are absolutely inaccessible others can only be scaled by experienced climbers and although possible for the natives with their bare feet are impracticable to european troops many of these rock fortresses were at various times the headquarters of famous dacoit leaders and unless the summits happened to be commanded from some higher ground within gunshot range they were all but impregnable except by starvation when driven to bay these fellows would fight well  well about the time i joined the dacoits were unusually troublesome the police had a hard time of it and almost lived in the saddle and the cavalry were constantly called up to help them while detachments of infantry from the station were under canvas at several places along the top of the ghauts to cut the bands off from their strongholds and to aid if necessary in turning them out of their rock fortresses the natives in the valleys at the foot of the ghauts who have always been a semiindependent race ready to rob whenever they saw a chance were great friends with the dacoits and supplied them with provisions whenever the hunt on the deccan was too hot to make raids in that direction  this is a long introduction you will say and does not seem to have much to do with bears but it is really necessary as you will see i had joined about six months when three companies of the regiment were ordered to relieve a wing of the 15th who had been under canvas at a village some four miles to the north of the point where the line crosses the top of the ghauts there were three white officers and little enough to do except when a party was sent off to assist the police we had one or two brushes with the dacoits but i was not out on either occasion however there was plenty of shooting and a good many pigs about so we had very good fun of course as a raw hand i was very hot for it and as the others had both passed the enthusiastic age except for pig sticking and big game i could always get away i was supposed not to go far from camp because in the first place i might be wanted and in the second because of the dacoits and norworthy who was in command used to impress upon me that i ought not to go beyond the sound of a bugle of course we both knew that if i intended to get any sport i must go further afoot than this but i merely used to say all right sir i will keep an ear to the camp and he on his part never considered it necessary to ask where the game which appeared on the table came from but in point of fact i never went very far and my servant always had instructions which way to send for me if i was wanted while as to the dacoits i did not believe in their having the impudence to come in broad daylight within a mile or two of our camp i did not often go down the face of the ghauts the shooting was good and there were plenty of bears in those days but it needed a long day for such an expedition and in view of the dacoits who might be scattered about was not the sort of thing to be undertaken except with a strong party norworthy had not given any precise orders about it but i must admit that he said one day  of course you wont be fool enough to think of going down the ghauts hastings but i did not look at that as equivalent to a direct orderwhatever i should do now the colonel put in on seeing a furtive smile on the faces of his male listeners  however i never meant to go down though i used to stand on the edge and look longingly down into the bush and fancy i saw bears moving about in scores but i dont think i should have gone into their country if they had not come into mine one day the fellow who always carried my spare gun or flask and who was a sort of shikaree in a small way told me he had heard that a farmer whose house stood near the edge of the ghauts some two miles away had been seriously annoyed by his fruit and corn being stolen by bears   ill go and have a look at the place tomorrow i said there is no parade and i can start early you may as well tell the mess cook to put up a basket with some tiffin and a bottle of claret and get a boy to carry it over  the bears not come in day rahman said  of course not i replied still i may like to find out which way they come just do as you are told  the next morning at seven oclock i was at the farmers spoken of and there was no mistake as to the bears a patch of indian corn had been ruined by them and two dogs had been killed the native was in a terrible state of rage and alarm he said that on moonlight nights he had seen eight of them and they came and sniffed around the door of the cottage  why dont you fire through the window at them i asked scornfully for i had seen a score of tame bears in captivity and like you mary was inclined to despise them though there was far less excuse for me for i had heard stories which should have convinced me that small as he is the indian bear is not a beast to be attacked with impunity upon walking to the edge of the ghauts there was no difficulty in discovering the route by which the bears came up to the farm for a mile to the right and left the ground fell away as if cut with a knife leaving a precipice of over a hundred feet sheer down but close by where i was standing was the head of a water course which in time had gradually worn a sort of cleft in the wall up or down which it was not difficult to make ones way further down this little gorge widened out and became a deep ravine and further still a wide valley where it opened upon the flats far below us about half a mile down where the ravine was deepest and darkest was a thick clump of trees and jungle  thats where the bears are i asked rahman he nodded it seemed no distance i could get down and back in time for tiffin and perhaps bag a couple of bears for a young sportsman the temptation was great how long would it take us to go down and have a shot or two at them  no good go down master come here at night shoot bears when they come up  i had thought of that but in the first place it did not seem much sport to shoot the beasts from cover when they were quietly eating and in the next place i knew that norworthy could not even if he were willing give me leave to go out of camp at night i waited hesitating for a few minutes and then i said to myself it is of no use waiting i could go down and get a bear and be back again while i am thinking of it then to rahman no come along we will have a look through that wood anyhow  rahman evidently did not like it not easy to find bear sahib he very cunning  well very likely we shant find them i said but we can try anyhow bring that bottle with you the tiffin basket can wait here till we come back in another five minutes i had begun to climb down the watercoursethe shikaree following me i took the double barreled rifle and handed him the shotgun having first dropped a bullet down each barrel over the charge the ravine was steep but there were bushes to hold on by and although it was hot work and took a good deal longer than i expected we at last got down to the place which i had fixed upon as likely to be the bears home  sahib climb up top rahman said come down through wood no good fire at bear when he above  i had heard that before but i was hot the sun was pouring down there was not a breath of wind and it looked a long way up to the top of the wood  give me the claret it would take too long to search the wood regularly we will sit down here for a bit and if we can see anything moving up in the wood well and good if not we will come back again another day with some beaters and dogs so saying i sat down with my back against a rock at a spot where i could look up among the trees for a long way through a natural vista i had a drink of claret and then i sat and watched till gradually i dropped off to sleep i dont know how long i slept but it was some time and i woke up with a sudden start rahman who had i fancy been asleep too also started up  the noise which had aroused us was made by a rolling stone striking a rock and looking up i saw some fifty yards away not in the wood but on the rocky hillside on our side of the ravine a bear standing as though unconscious of our presence snuffing the air as was natural i seized my rifle cocked it and took aim unheeding a cry of no no sahib from rahman however i was not going to miss such a chance as this and i let fly the beast had been standing sideways to me and as i saw him fall i felt sure i had hit him in the heart i gave a shout of triumph and was about to climb up when from behind the rock on which the bear had stood appeared another growling fiercely on seeing me it at once prepared to come down stupidly being taken by surprise and being new at it i fired at once at its head the bear gave a spring and thenit seemed instantaneousdown it came at me whether it rolled down or slipped down or ran down i dont know but it came almost as if it had jumped straight at me  my gun rahman i shouted holding out my hand there was no answer i glanced round and found that the scoundrel had bolted i had time and only just time to take a step backwards and to club my rifle when the brute was upon me i got one fair blow at the side of its head a blow that would have smashed the skull of any civilized beast into pieces and which did fortunately break the brutes jaw then in an instant he was upon me and i was fighting for life my hunting knife was out and with my left hand i had the beast by the throat while with my right i tried to drive my knife into its ribs my bullet had gone through his chest the impetus of his charge bad knocked me over and we rolled on the ground he tearing with his claws at my shoulder and arm i stabbing and struggling my great effort being to keep my knees up so as to protect my body with them from his bind claws after the first blow with his paw which laid my shoulder open i do not think i felt any special pain whatever there was a strange faint sensation and my whole energy seemed centered in the two ideasto strike and to keep my knees up i knew that i was getting faint but i was dimly conscious that his efforts too were relaxing his weight on me seemed to increase enormously and the last idea that flashed across me was that it was a drawn fight  the next idea of which i was conscious was that i was being carried i seemed to be swinging about and i thought i was at sea then there was a little jolt and a sense of pain a collision i muttered and opened my eyes beyond the fact that i seemed in a yellow worlda bright orange yellowmy eyes did not help me and i lay vaguely wondering about it all till the rocking ceased there was another bump and then the yellow world seemed to come to an end and as the daylight streamed in upon me i fainted again this time when i awoke to consciousness things were clearer i was stretched by a little stream a native woman was sprinkling my face and washing the blood from my wounds while another who had with my own knife cut off my coat and shirt was tearing the latter into strips to bandage my wounds the yellow world was explained i was lying on the yellow robe of one of the women they had tied the ends together placed a long stick through them and carried me in the baglike hammock they nodded to me when they saw i was conscious and brought water in a large leaf and poured it into my mouth then one went away for some time and came back with some leaves and bark these they chewed and put on my wounds bound them up with strips of my shirt and then again knotted the ends of the cloth and lifting me up went on as before  i was sure that we were much lower down the ghaut than we had been when i was watching for the bears and we were now going still lower however i knew very little hindustani nothing of the language the women spoke i was too weak to stand too weak even to think much and i dozed and woke and dozed again until after what seemed to me many hours of travel we stopped again this time before a tent two or three old women and four or five men came out and there was great talking between them and the young womenfor they were youngwho had carried me down some of the party appeared angry but at last things quieted down and i was carried into the tent i had fever and was i suppose delirious for days i afterwards found that for fully a fortnight i had lost all consciousness but a good constitution and the nursing of the women pulled me round when once the fever had gone i began to mend rapidly i tried to explain to the women that if they would go up to the camp and tell them where i was they would be well rewarded but although i was sure they understood they shook their heads and by the fact that as i became stronger two or three armed men always hung about the tent i came to the conclusion that i was a sort of prisoner this was annoying but did not seem serious if these people were dacoits or as was more likely allies of the dacoits i could be kept only for ransom or exchange moreover i felt sure of my ability to escape when i got strong especially as i believed that in the young women who had saved my life both by bringing me down and by their careful nursing i should find friends  were they pretty uncle mary hastings broke in  never mind whether they were pretty mary they were better than pretty  no but we should like to know uncle  well except for the soft dark eyes common to the race and the good temper and lightheartedness also so general among hindu girls and the tenderness which women feel towards a creature whose life they have saved whether it is a wounded bird or a drowning puppy i suppose they were nothing remarkable in the way of beauty but at the time i know that i thought them charming    chapter ii   just as i was getting strong enough to walk and was beginning to think of making my escape a band of five or six fellows armed to the teeth came in and made signs that i was to go with them it was evidently an arranged thing the girls only were surprised but they were at once turned out and as we started i could see two crouching figures in the shade with their cloths over their heads i had a native garment thrown over my shoulders and in five minutes after the arrival of the fellows found myself on my way it took us some six hours before we reached our destination which was one of those natural rock citadels had i been in my usual health i could have done the distance in an hour and a half but i had to rest constantly and was finally carried rather than helped up i had gone not unwillingly for the men were clearly by their dress dacoits of the deccan and i had no doubt that it was intended either to ransom or exchange me  at the foot of this natural castle were same twenty or thirty more robbers and i was led to a rough sort of arbor in which was lying on a pile of maize straw a man who was evidently their chief he rose and we exchanged salaams  what is your name sahib he asked in mahratta  hastingslieutenant hastings i said and yours  sivajee punt he said  this was bad i had fallen into the hands of the most troublesome most ruthless and most famous of the dacoit leaders over and over again he had been hotly chased but had always managed to get away and when i last heard anything of what was going on four or five troops of native police were scouring the country after him he gave an order which i did not understand and a wretched bombay writer i suppose a clerk of some moneylender was dragged forward sivajee punt spoke to him for some time and the fellow then told me in english that i was to write at once to the officer commanding the troops telling him that i was in his hands and should be put to death directly he was attacked  ask him i said if he will take any sum of money to let me go  sivajee shook his head very decidedly  a piece of paper was put before me and a pen and ink and i wrote as i had been ordered adding however in french that i had brought myself into my present position by my own folly and would take my chance for i well knew the importance which government attached to sivajees capture i read out loud all that i had written in english and the interpreter translated it then the paper was folded and i addressed it the officer commanding and i was given some chupattis and a drink of water and allowed to sleep the dacoits had apparently no fear of any immediate attack  it was still dark although morning was just breaking when i was awakened and was got up to the citadel i was hoisted rather than climbed two men standing above with a rope tied round my body so that i was half hauled half pushed up the difficult places which would have taxed all my climbing powers had i been in health  the height of this mass of rock was about a hundred feet the top was fairly flat with some depressions and risings and about eighty feet long by fifty wide it had evidently been used as a fortress in ages past along the side facing the hill were the remains of a rough wall in the center of a depression was a cistern some four feet square lined with stone work and in another depression a gallery had been cut leading to a subterranean storeroom or chamber  this natural fortress rose from the face of the hill at a distance of a thousand yards or so from the edge of the plateau which was fully two hundred feet higher than the top of the rock in the old days it would have been impregnable and even at that time it was an awkward place to take for the troops were armed only with brown bess and rifled cannon were not thought of looking round i could see that i was some four miles from the point where i had descended the camp was gone but running my eye along the edge of the plateau i could see the tops of tents a mile to my right and again two miles to my left turning round and looking down into the wide valley i saw a regimental camp  it was evident that a vigorous effort was being made to surround and capture the dacoits since troops had been brought up from bombay in addition to the troops above and below there would probably be a strong police force acting on the face of the hill i did not see all these things at the time for i was as soon as i got to the top ordered to sit down behind the parapet a fellow armed to the teeth squatting down by me and signifying that if i showed my head above the stones he would cut my throat without hesitation there were however sufficient gaps between the stones to allow me to have a view of the crest of the ghaut while below my view extended down to the hills behind bombay it was evident to me now why the dacoits did not climb up into the fortress there were dozens of similar crags on the face of the ghauts and the troops did not as yet know their whereabouts it was a sort of blockade of the whole face of the hills which was being kept up and there were probably enough several other bands of dacoits lurking in the jungle  there were only two guards and myself on the rock plateau i discussed with myself the chances of my overpowering them and holding the top of the rock till help came but i was greatly weakened and was not a match for a boy much less for the two stalwart mahrattas besides i was by no means sure that the way i had been brought up was the only possible path to the top the day passed off quietly the heat on the bare rock was frightful but one of the men seeing how weak and ill i really was fetched a thick rug from the storehouse and with the aid of a stick made a sort of leanto against the wall under which i lay sheltered from the sun  once or twice during the day i heard a few distant musket shots and once a sharp heavy outburst of firing it must have been three or four miles away but it was on the side of the ghaut and showed that the troops or police were at work my guards looked anxiously in that direction and uttered sundry curses when it was dusk sivajee and eight of the dacoits came up from what they said i gathered that the rest of the band had dispersed trusting either to get through the line of their pursuers or if caught to escape with slight punishment the men who remained being too deeply concerned in murderous outrages to hope for mercy sivajee himself handed me a letter which the man who had taken my note had brought back in reply major knapp the writer who was the second in command said that he could not engage the government but that if lieutenant hastings was given up the act would certainly dispose the government to take the most merciful view possible but that if on the contrary any harm was suffered by lieutenant hastings every man taken would be at once hung sivajee did not appear put out about it i do not think he expected any other answer and imagine that his real object in writing was simply to let them know that i was a prisoner and so enable him the better to paralyze the attack upon a position which he no doubt considered all but impregnable  i was given food and was then allowed to walk as i chose upon the little plateau two of the dacoits taking post as sentries at the steepest part of the path while the rest gathered chatting and smoking in the depression in front of the storehouse it was still light enough for me to see for some distance down the face of the rock and i strained my eyes to see if i could discern any other spot at which an ascent or descent was possible the prospect was not encouraging at some places the face fell sheer away from the edge and so evident was the impracticability of escape that the only place which i glanced at twice was the western side that is the one away from the hill here it sloped gradually for a few feet i took off my shoes and went down to the edge below some ten feet was a ledge on to which with care i could get down but below that was a sheer fall of some fifty feet as a means of escape it was hopeless but it struck me that if an attack was made i might slip away and get on to the ledge once there i could not be seen except by a person standing where i now was just on the edge of the slope a spot to which it was very unlikely that anyone would come  the thought gave me a shadow of hope and returning to the upper end of the platform i lay down and in spite of the hardness of the rock was soon asleep the pain of my aching bones woke me up several times and once just as the first tinge of dawn was coming i thought i could hear movements in the jungle i raised myself somewhat and i saw that the sounds had been heard by the dacoits for they were standing listening and some of them were bringing spare firearms from the storehouse in evident preparation for attack  as i afterwards learned the police had caught one of the dacoits trying to effect his escape and by means of a little of the ingenious torture to which the indian police then frequently resorted when their white officers were absent they obtained from him the exact position of sivajees band and learned the side from which the ascent must be made that the dacoit and his band were still upon the slopes of the ghauts they knew and were gradually narrowing their circle but there were so many rocks and hiding places that the process of searching was a slow one and the intelligence was so important that the news was off at once to the colonel who gave orders for the police to surround the rock at daylight and to storm it if possible the garrison was so small that the police were alone ample for the work supposing that the natural difficulties were not altogether insuperable  just at daybreak there was a distant noise of men moving in the jungle and the dacoit halfway down the path fired his gun he was answered by a shout and a volley the dacoits hurried out from the chamber and lay down on the edge where sheltered by a parapet they commanded the path they paid no attention to me and i kept as far away as possible the fire begana quiet steady fire a shot at a time and in strong contrast to the rattle kept up from the surrounding jungle but every shot must have told as man after man who strove to climb that steep path fell it lasted only ten minutes and then all was quiet again  the attack had failed as i knew it must do for two men could have held the place against an army a quarter of an hour later a gun from the crest above spoke out and a round shot whistled above our heads beyond annoyance an artillery fire could do no harm for the party could be absolutely safe in the store cave the instant the shot flew overhead however sivajee punt beckoned to me and motioned me to take my seat on the wall facing the guns hesitation was useless and i took my seat with my back to the dacoits and my face to the hill one of the dacoits as i did so pulled off the native cloth which covered my shoulders in order that i might be clearly seen  just as i took my place another round shot hummed by but then there was a long interval of silence with a field glass every feature must have been distinguishable to the gunners and i had no doubt that they were waiting for orders as to what to do next  i glanced round and saw that with the exception of one fellow squatted behind the parapet some half dozen yards away clearly as a sentry to keep me in place all the others had disappeared some no doubt were on sentry down the path the others were in the store beneath me after half an hours silence the guns spoke out again evidently the gunners were told to be as careful as they could for some of the shots went wide on the left others on the right a few struck the rock below me the situation was not pleasant but i thought that at a thousand yards they ought not to hit me and i tried to distract my attention by thinking out what i should do under every possible contingency  presently i felt a crash and a shock and fell backwards to the ground i was not hurt and picking myself up saw that the ball had struck the parapet to the left just where my guard was sitting and he lay covered with its fragments his turban lay some yards behind him whether he was dead or not i neither knew nor cared  i pushed down some of the parapet where i had been sitting dropped my cap on the edge outside so as to make it appear that i had fallen over and then picking up the mans turban ran to the other end of the platform and scrambled down to the ledge then i began to wave my arms abouti had nothing on above the waistand in a moment i saw a face with a uniform cap peer out through the jungle and a hand was waved i made signs to him to make his way to the foot of the perpendicular wall of rock beneath me i then unwound the turban whose length was i knew amply sufficient to reach to the bottom and then looked round for something to write on i had my pencil still in my trousers pocket but not a scrap of paper  i picked up a flattish piece of rock and wrote on it get a rope ladder quickly i can haul it up ten men in garrison they are all under cover keep on firing to distract their attention  i tied the stone to the end of the turban and looked over a noncommissioned officer of the police was already standing below i lowered the stone he took it waved his hand to me and was gone  an hour passed it seemed an age the round shots still rang overhead and the fire was now much more heavy and sustained than before presently i again saw a movement in the jungle and norworthys face appeared and he waved his arm in greeting  five minutes more and a party were gathered at the foot of the rock and a strong rope was tied to the cloth i pulled it up a rope ladder was attached to it and the top rung was in a minute or two in my hands to it was tied a piece of paper with the words can you fasten the ladder i wrote on the paper no but i can hold it for a light weight  i put the paper with a stone in the end of the cloth and lowered it again then i sat down tied the rope round my waist got my feet against two projections and waited there was a jerk and then i felt someone was coming up the rope ladder the strain was far less than i expected but the native policeman who came up first did not weigh half so much as an average englishman there were now two of us to hold the officer in command of the police came up next then norworthy then a dozen more police i explained the situation and we mounted to the upper level not a soul was to be seen quickly we advanced and took up a position to command the door of the underground chamber while one of the police waved a white cloth from his bayonet as a signal to the gunners to cease firing then the officer hailed the party within the cave  sivajee punt you may as well come out and give yourself up we are in possession and resistance is useless  a yell of rage and surprise was heard and the dacoits all desperate men came bounding out firing as they did so half of their number were shot down at once and the rest after a short sharp struggle were bound hand and foot  that is pretty well all of the story i think sivajee punt was one of the killed the prisoners were all either hung or imprisoned for life i escaped my blowing up for having gone down the ghauts after the bear because after all sivajee punt might have defied their force for months had i not done so  it seemed that that scoundrel rahman had taken back word that i was killed norworthy had sent down a strong party who found the two dead bears and who having searched everywhere without finding any signs of my body came to the conclusion that i had been found and carried away especially as they ascertained that natives used that path they had offered rewards but nothing was heard of me till my note saying i was in sivajees hands arrived  and did you ever see the women who carried you off  no mary i never saw them again i did however after immense trouble succeed in finding out where it was that i had been taken to i went down at once but found the village deserted then after much inquiry i found where the people had moved to and sent messages to the women to come up to the camp but they never came and i was reduced at last to sending them down two sets of silver bracelets necklaces and bangles which must have rendered them the envy of all the women on the ghauts they sent back a message of grateful thanks and i never heard of them afterwards no doubt their relatives who knew that their connection with the dacoits was now known would not let them come however i had done all i could and i have no doubt the women were perfectly satisfied so you see my dear that the indian bear small as he is is an animal which it is as well to leave alone at any rate when he happens to be up on the side of a hill while you are at the foot      the paternosters   and do you really mean that we are to cross by the steamer mr virtue while you go over in the seabird i do not approve of that at all fanny why do you not rebel and say we wont be put ashore i call it horrid after a fortnight on board this dear little yacht to have to get on to a crowded steamer with no accommodation and lots of seasick women perhaps and crying children you surely cannot be in earnest  i do not like it any more than you do minnie but as tom says we had better do it and my husband agrees with him i am afraid we must submit do you really think it is quite necessary mr virtue minnie and i are both good sailors you know and we would much rather have a little extra tossing about on board the seabird than the discomforts of a steamer  i certainly think that it will be best mrs grantham you know very well we would rather have you on board and that we shall suffer from your loss more than you will by going the other way but theres no doubt the wind is getting up and though we dont feel it much here it must be blowing pretty hard outside the seabird is as good a seaboat as anything of her size that floats but you dont know what it is to be out in anything like a heavy sea in a thirty tonner it would be impossible for you to stay on deck and we should have our hands full and should not be able to give you the benefit of our society personally i should not mind being out in the seabird in any weather but i would certainly rather not have ladies on board  you dont think we should scream or do anything foolish mr virtue minnie graham said indignantly  not at all miss graham still i repeat the knowledge that there are women on board delightful at other times does not tend to comfort in bad weather of course if you prefer it we can put off our start till this puff of wind has blown itself out it may have dropped before morning it may last some little time i dont think myself that it will drop for the glass has fallen and i am afraid we may have a spell of broken weather  oh no dont put it off mrs grantham said we have only another fortnight before james must be back again in london and it would be a great pity to lose three or four days perhaps and we have been looking forward to cruising about among the channel islands and to st mao and all those places oh no i think the other is much the better planthat is if you wont take us with you  it would be bad manners to say that i wont mrs grantham but i must say i would rather not it will be a very short separation grantham will take you on shore at once and as soon as the boat comes back i shall be off you will start in the steamer this evening and get into jersey at nine or ten oclock tomorrow morning and if i am not there before you i shall not be many hours after you  well if it must be it must mrs grantham said with an air of resignation come minnie let us put a few things into a handbag for tonight you see the skipper is not to be moved by our pleadings  that is the worst of you married women fanny miss graham said with a little pout you get into the way of doing as you are ordered i call it too bad here have we been cruising about for the last fortnight with scarcely a breath of wind and longing for a good brisk breeze and a little change and excitement and now it comes at last we are to be packed off in a steamer i call it horrid of you mr virtue you may laugh but i do  tom virtue laughed but he showed no signs of giving way and ten minutes later mr and mrs grantham and miss graham took their places in the gig and were rowed into southampton harbor off which the seabird was lying  the last fortnight had been a very pleasant one and it had cost the owner of the seabird as much as his guests to come to the conclusion that it was better to break up the party for a few hours  tom virtue had up to the age of fiveandtwenty been possessed of a sufficient income for his wants he had entered at the bar not that he felt any particular vocation in that direction but because he thought it incumbent upon him to do something then at the death of an uncle he had come into a considerable fortune and was able to indulge his taste for yachting which was the sole amusement for which he really cared to the fullest  he sold the little five tonner he had formerly possessed and purchased the seabird he could well have afforded a much larger craft but he knew that there was far more real enjoyment in sailing to be obtained from a small craft than a large one for in the latter he would be obliged to have a regular skipper and would be little more than a passenger whereas on board the seabird although his first hand was dignified by the name of skipper he was himself the absolute master the boat carried the aforesaid skipper three hands and a steward and with them he had twice been up the mediterranean across to norway and had several times made the circuit of the british isles  he had unlimited confidence in his boat and cared not what weather he was out in her this was the first time since his ownership of her that the seabird had carried lady passengers his friend grantham an old school and college chum was a hard working barrister and virtue had proposed to him to take a months holiday on board the seabird  put aside your books old man he said you look fagged and overworked a months blow will do you all the good in the world  thank you tom i have made up my mind for a months holiday but i cant accept your invitation though i should enjoy it of all things but it would not be fair to my wife she doesnt get very much of my society and she has been looking forward to our having a run together so i must decline  virtue hesitated a moment he was not very fond of ladies society and thought them especially in the way on board a yacht but he had a great liking for his friends wife and was almost as much at home in his house as in his own chambers  why not bring the wife with you he said as soon as his mind was made up it will be a nice change for her too and i have heard her say that she is a good sailor the accommodation is not extensive but the after cabin is a pretty good size and i would do all i could to make her comfortable perhaps she would like another lady with her if so by all means bring one they could have the after cabin you could have the little stateroom and i could sleep in the saloon  it is very good of you tom especially as i know that it will put you out frightfully but the offer is a very tempting one i will speak to fanny and let you have an answer in the morning  that will be delightful james mrs grantham said when the invitation was repeated to her i should like it of all things and i am sure the rest and quiet and the sea air will be just the thing for you it is wonderful tom virtue making the offer and i take it as a great personal compliment for he certainly is not what is generally called a ladys man it is very nice too of him to think of my having another lady on board whom shall we ask oh i know she said suddenly that will be the thing of all others we will ask my cousin minnie she is full of fun and life and will make a charming wife for tom  james grantham laughed  what schemers you all are fanny now i should call it downright treachery to take anyone on board the seabird with the idea of capturing its master  nonsense treachery mrs grantham said indignantly minnie is the nicest girl i know and it would do tom a world of good to have a wife to look after him why he is thirty now and will be settling down into a confirmed old bachelor before long its the greatest kindness we could do him to take minnie on board and i am sure he is the sort of man any girl might fall in love with when she gets to know him the fact is hes shy he never had any sisters and spends all his time in winter at that horrid club so that really he has never had any womens society and even with us he will never come unless he knows we are alone i call it a great pity for i dont know a pleasanter fellow than he is i think it will be doing him a real service in asking minnie so thats settled i will sit down and write him a note  in for a penny in for a pound i suppose was tom virtues comment when he received mrs granthams letter thanking him warmly for the invitation and saying that she would bring her cousin miss graham with her if that young lady was disengaged  as a matter of self defense he at once invited jack harvey who was a mutual friend of himself and grantham to be of the party  jack can help grantham to amuse the women he said to himself that will be more in his line than mine i will run down to cowes tomorrow and have a chat with johnson we shall want a different sort of stores altogether from those we generally carry and i suppose we must do her up a bit below  having made up his mind to the infliction of female passengers tom virtue did it handsomely and when the party came on board at ryde they were delighted with the aspect of the yacht below she had been repainted the saloon and ladies cabin were decorated in delicate shades of gray picked out with gold and the upholsterer into whose hands the owner of the seabird had placed her had done his work with taste and judgment and the ladies cabin resembled a little boudoir  why tom i should have hardly known her grantham who had often spent a day on board the seabird said  i hardly know her myself tom said rather ruefully but i hope shes all right mrs grantham and that you and miss graham will find everything you want  it is charming mrs grantham said enthusiastically its awfully good of you tom and we appreciate it dont we minnie it is such a surprise too for james said that while i should find everything very comfortable i must not expect that a small yacht would be got up like a palace  so a fortnight had passed they had cruised along the coast as far as plymouth anchoring at night at the various ports on the way then they had returned to southampton and it had been settled that as none of the party with the exception of virtue himself had been to the channel islands the last fortnight of the trip should be spent there the weather had been delightful save that there had been some deficiency in wind and throughout the cruise the seabird had been under all the sail she could spread but when the gentlemen came on deck early in the morning a considerable change had taken place the sky was gray and the clouds flying fast overhead  we are going to have dirty weather tom virtue said at once i dont think its going to be a gale but there will be more sea on than will be pleasant for ladies i tell you what grantham the best thing will be for you to go on shore with the two ladies and cross by the boat tonight if you dont mind going directly after breakfast i will start at once and shall be at st heliers as soon as you are  and so it had been agreed but not as has been seen without opposition and protest on the part of the ladies  mrs granthams chief reason for objecting had not been given the little scheme on which she had set her mind seemed to be working satisfactorily from the first day tom virtue had exerted himself to play the part of host satisfactorily and had ere long shaken off any shyness he may have felt towards the one stranger of the party and he and miss graham had speedily got on friendly terms so things were going on as well as mrs grantham could have expected  no sooner had his guests left the side of the yacht than her owner began to make his preparations for a start  what do you think of the weather watkins he asked his skipper  its going to blow hard sir thats my view of it and if i was you i shouldnt up anchor today still its just as you likes the seabird wont mind it if we dont she has had a rough time of it before now still it will be a case of wet jackets and no mistake  yes i expect we shall have a rough time of it watkins but i want to get across we dont often let ourselves be weather bound and i am not going to begin it today we had better house the topmast at once and get two reefs in the mainsail we can get the other down when we get clear of the island get number three jib up and the leg of mutton mizzen put two reefs in the foresail  tom and his friend harvey who was a good sailor assisted the crew in reefing down the sails and a few minutes after the gig had returned and been hoisted in the yawl was running rapidly down southampton waters  we need hardly have reefed quite so closely jack harvey said as he puffed away at his pipe  not yet jack but you will see she has as much as she can carry before long its all the better to make all snug before starting it saves a lot of trouble afterwards and the extra canvas would not have made ten minutes difference to us at the outside we shall have pretty nearly a dead beat down the solent fortunately the tide will be running strong with us but there will be a nasty kick up there you will see we shall feel the short choppy seas there more than we shall when we get outside she is a grand boat in a really heavy sea but in short waves she puts her nose into it with a will now if you will take my advice you will do as i am going to do put on a pair of fishermans boots and oilskin and souwester there are several sets for you to choose from below  as her owner had predicted the seabird put her bowsprit under pretty frequently in the solent the wind was blowing half a gale and as it met the tide it knocked up a short angry sea crested with white heads and jack harvey agreed that she had quite as much sail on her as she wanted the cabin doors were bolted and all made snug to prevent the water getting below before they got to the race off hurst castle and it was well that they did so for she was as much under water as she was above  i think if i had given way to the ladies and brought them with us they would have changed their minds by this time jack tom virtue said with a laugh  i should think so his friend agreed this is not a day for a fair weather sailor look what a sea is breaking on the shingles  yes five minutes there would knock her into matchwood another ten minutes and we shall be fairly out and i shant be sorry one feels as if one was playing football only just at present the seabird is the ball and the waves the kickers  another quarter of an hour and they had passed the needles  that is more pleasant jack as the short chopping motion was exchanged for a regular rise and fall this is what i enjoya steady wind and a regular sea the seabird goes over it like one of her namesakes she is not taking a teacupful now over her bows  watkins you may as well take the helm for a spell while we go down to lunch i am not sorry to give it up for a bit for it has been jerking like the kick of a horse  thats right jack hang up your oilskin there johnson give us a couple of towels we have been pretty well smothered up there on deck now what have you got for us  there is some soup ready sir and that cold pie you had for dinner yesterday  that will do open a couple of bottles of stout  lunch over they went on deck again  she likes a good blow as well as we do virtue said enthusiastically as the yawl rose lightly over each wave what do you think of it watkins is the wind going to lull a bit as the sun goes down  i think not sir it seems to me its blowing harder than it was  then we will prepare for the worst watkins get the trysail up on deck when you are ready we will bring her up into the wind and set it thats the comfort of a yawl jack one can always lie to without any bother and one hasnt got such a tremendous boom to handle  the trysail was soon on deck and then the seabird was brought up into the wind the weather foresheet hauled aft the mizzen sheeted almost fore and aft and the seabird lay head to wind rising and falling with a gentle motion in strong contrast to her impetuous rushes when under sail  she would ride out anything like that her owner said last time we came through the bay on our way from gib we were caught in a gale strong enough to blow the hair off ones head and we lay to for nearly three days and didnt ship a bucket of water all the time now let us lend a hand to get the mainsail stowed  ten minutes work and it was securely fastened and its cover on two reefs were put in the trysail two hands went to each of the halliards while as the sail rose tom virtue fastened the toggles round the mast  all ready watkins  all ready sir  slack off the weather foresheet then and haul aft the leeward slack out the mizzen sheet a little jack thats it now shes off again like a duck  the seabird felt the relief from the pressure of the heavy boom to leeward and rose easily and lightly over the waves  she certainly is a splendid seaboat tom i dont wonder you are ready to go anywhere in her i thought we were rather fools for starting this morning although i enjoy a good blow but now i dont care how hard it comes on  by night it was blowing a downright gale  we will lie to till morning watkins so that we get in by daylight tomorrow evening that is all we want see our side lights are burning well and you had better get up a couple of blue lights in case anything comes running up channel and dont see our lights we had better divide into two watches i will keep one with matthews and dawson mr harvey will go in your watch with nicholls we had better get the trysail down altogether and lie to under the foresail and mizzen but dont put many lashings on the trysail one will be enough and have it ready to cast off in a moment in case we want to hoist the sail in a hurry i will go down and have a glass of hot grog first and then i will take my watch to begin with let the two hands with me go down the steward will serve them out a tot each jack you had better turn in at once  virtue was soon on deck again muffled up in his oilskins  now watkins you can go below and turn in  i shant go below tonight sirnot to lie down theres nothing much to do here but i couldnt sleep if i did lie down  very well you had better go below and get a glass of grog tell the steward to give you a big pipe with a cover like this out of the locker and theres plenty of chewing tobacco if the men are short  i will take that instead of a pipe watkins said theres nothing like a quid in weather like this it aint never in your way and it lasts even with a cover a pipe would soon be out  please yourself watkins tell the two hands forward to keep a bright lookout for lights  the night passed slowly occasionally a sea heavier than usual came on board curling over the bow and falling with a heavy thud on the deck but for the most part the seabird breasted the waves easily the bowsprit had been reefed in to its fullest thereby adding to the lightness and buoyancy of the boat tom virtue did not go below when his friend came up to relieve him at the change of watch but sat smoking and doing much talking in the short intervals between the gusts  the morning broke gray and misty driving sleet came along on the wind and the horizon was closed in as by a dull curtain  how far can we see do you think watkins  perhaps a couple of miles sir  that will be enough i think we both know the position of every reef to within a hundred yards so we will shape our course for guernsey if we happen to hit it off we can hold on to st helier but if when we think we ought to be within sight of guernsey we see nothing of it we must lie to again till the storm has blown itself out or the clouds lift it would never do to go groping our way along with such currents as run among the islands put the last reef in the trysail before you hoist it i think you had better get the foresail down altogether and run up the spitfire jib  the seabird was soon under way again  now watkins you take the helm we will go down and have a cup of hot coffee and i will see that the steward has a good supply for you and the hands but first do you take the helm jack whilst watkins and i have a look at the chart and try and work out where we are and the course we had better lie for guernsey  five minutes were spent over the chart then watkins went above and jack harvey came below  you have got the coffee ready i hope johnson  yes sir coffee and chocolate i didnt know which you would like  chocolate by all means jack i recommend the chocolate bring two full sized bowls johnson and put that cold pie on the table and a couple of knives and forks never mind about a cloth but first of all bring a couple of basins of hot water we shall enjoy our food more after a wash  the early breakfast was eaten dry coats and mufflers put on pipes lighted and they then went up upon deck tom took the helm  what time do you calculate we ought to make guernsey tom  about twelve the wind is freer than it was and we are walking along at a good pace matthews cast the log and lets see what we are doing about seven knots i should say  seven and a quarter sir the man said when he checked the line  not a bad guess tom its always difficult to judge pace in a heavy sea  at eleven oclock the mist ceased  thats fortunate tom virtue said i shouldnt be surprised if we get a glimpse of the sun between the clouds presently will you get my sextant and the chronometer up jack and put them handy  jack harvey did as he was asked but there was no occasion to use the instruments for ten minutes later watkins who was standing near the bow gazing fixedly ahead shouted  theres guernsey sir on her lee bow about six miles away i should say  thats it sure enough tom agreed as he gazed in the direction in which watkins was pointing theres a gleam of sunshine on it or we shouldnt have seen it yet yes i think you are about right as to the distance now let us take its bearings we may lose it again directly  having taken the bearings of the island they went below and marked off their position on the chart and they shaped their course for cape grosnez the northwestern point of jersey the gleam of sunshine was transientthe clouds closed in again overhead darker and grayer than before soon the drops of rain came flying before the wind the horizon closed in and they could not see half a mile away but though the sea was heavy the seabird was making capital weather of it and the two friends agreed that after all the excitement of a sail like this was worth a month of pottering about in calms  we must keep a bright lookout presently the skipper said there are some nasty rocks off the coast of jersey we must give them a wide berth we had best make round to the south of the island and lay to there till we can pick up a pilot to take us into st helier i dont think it will be worth while trying to get into st aubyns bay by ourselves  i think so too watkins but we will see what it is like before it gets dark if we can pick up a pilot all the better if not we will lie to till morning if the weather keeps thick but if it clears so that we can make out all the lights we ought to be able to get into the bay anyhow  an hour later the rain ceased and the sky appeared somewhat clearer suddenly watkins exclaimed there is a wreck sir there three miles away to leeward she is on the paternosters  good heavens she is a steamer tom exclaimed as he caught sight of her the next time the seabird lifted on a wave can she be the southampton boat do you think  like enough sir she may have had it thicker than we had and may not have calculated enough for the current  up helm jack and bear away towards her shall we shake out a reef watkins  i wouldnt sir she has got as much as she can carry on her now we must mind what we are doing sir the currents run like a millstream and if we get that reef under our lee and the wind and current both setting us on to it it will be all up with us in no time  yes i know that watkins jack take the helm a minute while we run down and look at the chart  our only chance watkins is to work up behind the reef and try and get so that they can either fasten a line to a buoy and let it float down to us or get into a boat if they have one left and drift to us  they are an awful group of rocks watkins said as they examined the chart you see some of them show merely at high tide and a lot of them are above at low water it will be an awful business to get among them rocks sir just about as near certain death as a thing can be  well its got to be done watkins tom said firmly i see the danger as well as you do but whatever the risk it must be tried mr grantham and the two ladies went on board by my persuasion and i should never forgive myself if anything happened to them but i will speak to the men  he went on deck again and called the men to him look here lads you see that steamer ashore on the paternosters in such a sea as this she may go to pieces in half an hour i am determined to make an effort to save the lives of those on board as you can see for yourselves there is no lying to weather of her with the current and wind driving us on to the reef we must beat up from behind now lads the sea there is full of rocks and the chances are ten to one we strike on to them and go to pieces but anyhow i am going to try but i wont take you unless you are willing the boat is a good one and the zinc chambers will keep her afloat if she fills well managed you ought to be able to make the coast of jersey in her mr harvey watkins and i can handle the yacht so you can take the boat if you like  the men replied that they would stick to the yacht wherever mr virtue chose to take her and muttered something about the ladies for the pleasant faces of mrs grantham and miss graham had during the fortnight they had been on board won the mens hearts  very well lads i am glad to find you will stick by me if we pull safely through it i will give each of you three months wages now set to work with a will and get the gig out we will tow her after us and take to her if we make a smash of it  they were now near enough to see the white breakers in the middle of which the ship was lying she was fast breaking up the jagged outline showed that the stern had been beaten in the masts and funnel were gone and the waves seemed to make a clean breach over her almost hiding her from sight in a white cloud of spray  wood and iron cant stand that much longer jack harvey said another hour and i should say there wont be two planks left together  it is awful jack i would give all i have in the world if i had not persuaded them to go on board keep her off a little more watkins  the seabird passed within a cables length of the breakers at the northern end of the reef  now lads take your places at the sheets ready to haul or let go as i give the word so saying tom virtue took his place in the bow holding on by the forestay  the wind was full on the seabirds beam as she entered the broken water here and there the dark heads of the rocks showed above the water these were easy enough to avoid the danger lay in those hidden beneath its surface and whose position was indicated only by the occasional break of a sea as it passed over them every time the seabird sank on a wave those on board involuntarily held their breath but the water here was comparatively smooth the sea having spent its first force upon the outer reef with a wave of his hand tom directed the helmsman as to his course and the little yacht was admirably handled through the dangers  i begin to think we shall do it tom said to jack harvey who was standing close to him another five minutes and we shall be within reach of her  it could be seen now that there was a group of people clustered in the bow of the wreck two or three light lines were coiled in readiness for throwing  now watkins tom said going aft make straight for the wreck i see no broken water between us and them and possibly there may be deep water under their bow  it was an anxious moment as with the sails flattened in the yawl forged up nearly in the eye of the wind towards the wreck her progress was slow for she was now stemming the current  tom stood with a coil of line in his hand in the bow  you get ready to throw jack if i miss  nearer and nearer the yacht approached the wreck until the bowsprit of the latter seemed to stand almost over her then tom threw the line it fell over the bowsprit and a cheer broke from those on board the wreck and from the sailors of the seabird a stronger line was at once fastened to that thrown and to this a strong hawser was attached  down with the helm watkins now lads lower away the trysail as fast as you can now one of you clear that hawser as they haul on it now out with the anchors  these had been got into readiness it was not thought that they would get any hold on the rocky bottom still they might catch on a projecting ledge and at any rate their weight and that of the chain cable would relieve the strain upon the hawser  two sailors had run out on the bowsprit of the wreck as soon as the line was thrown and the end of the hawser was now on board the steamer  thank god theres grantham jack harvey exclaimed do you see him waving his hand  i see him tom said but i dont see the ladies  they are there no doubt jack said confidently crouching down i expect he would not be there if they werent you may be sure yes there they are those two muffled up figures there one of them has thrown back her cloak and is waving her arm  the two young men waved their caps  are the anchors holding watkins theres a tremendous strain on that hawser  i think so sir they are both tight  put them round the windlass and give a turn or two we must relieve the strain on that hawser  since they had first seen the wreck the waves had made great progress in the work of destruction and the steamer had broken in two just aft of the engines  get over the spare spars watkins and fasten them to float in front of her bows like a triangle matthews catch hold of that boat hook and try to fend off any piece of timber that comes along you get hold of the sweeps lads and do the same they would stave her in like a nutshell if they struck her  thank god here comes the first of them  those on board the steamer had not been idle as soon as the yawl was seen approaching slings were prepared and no sooner was the hawser securely fixed than the slings were attached to it and a woman placed in them the hawser was tight and the descent sharp and without a check the figure ran down to the deck of the seabird she was lifted out of the slings by tom and jack harvey who found she was an old woman and had entirely lost consciousness  two of you carry her down below tell johnson to pour a little brandy down her throat give her some hot soup as soon as she comes to  another woman was lowered and helped below the next to descend was mrs grantham  thank god you are rescued tom said as he helped her out of the sling  thank god indeed mrs grantham said and thank you all oh tom we have had a terrible time of it and had lost all hope till we saw your sail and even then the captain said that he was afraid nothing could be done minnie was the first to make out it was you and then we began to hope she has been so brave dear girl ah here she comes  but minnies firmness came to an end now that she felt the need for it was over she was unable to stand when she was lifted from the slings and tom carried her below  are there any more women mrs grantham  no there was only one other lady passenger and the stewardess  then you had better take possession of your own cabin i ordered johnson to spread a couple more mattresses and some bedding on the floor so you will all four be able to turn in theres plenty of hot coffee and soup i should advise soup with two or three spoonfuls of brandy in it now excuse me i must go upon deck  twelve men descended by the hawser one of them with both legs broken by the fall of the mizzen the last to come was the captain  is that all tom asked  that is all the captain said six men were swept overboard when she first struck and two were killed by the fall of the funnel fortunately we had only three gentlemen passengers and three ladies on board the weather looked so wild when we started that no one else cared about making the passage god bless you sir for what you have done another half hour and it would have been all over with us but it seems like a miracle your getting safe through the rocks to us  it was fortunate indeed that we came along tom said three of the passengers are dear friends of mine and as it was by my persuasion that they came across in the steamer instead of in the yacht i should never have forgiven myself if they had been lost take all your men below captain you will find plenty of hot soup there now watkins let us be off that steamer wont hold together many minutes longer so theres no time to lose we will go back as we came give me a hatchet now lads two of you stand at the chain cables knock out the shackles the moment i cut the hawser watkins you take the helm and let her head pay off till the jib fills jack you lend a hand to the other two and get up the trysail again as soon as we are free  in a moment all were at their stations the helm was put on the yacht and she payed off on the opposite tack to that on which she had before been sailing as soon as the jib filled tom gave two vigorous blows with his hatchet on the hawser and as he lifted his hand for a third it parted then came the sharp rattle of the chains as they ran round the hawser holes the trysail was hoisted and sheeted home and the seabird was under way again tom as before conned the ship from the bow several times she was in close proximity to the rocks but each time she avoided them a shout of gladness rose from all on deck as she passed the last patch of white water then she tacked and bore away for jersey  tom had now time to go down below and look after his passengers they consisted of the captain and two sailorsthe sole survivors of those who had been on deck when the vessel struckthree male passengers and six engineers and stokers  i have not had time to shake you by the hand before tom grantham said as tom virtue entered and i thought you would not want me on deck at present god bless you old fellow we all owe you our lives  how did it happen captain tom asked as the captain also came up to him  it was the currents i suppose the captain said it was so thick we could not see a quarter of a mile any way the weather was so wild i would not put into guernsey and passed the island without seeing it i steered my usual course but the gale must have altered the currents for i thought i was three miles away from the reef when we saw it on our beam not a hundred yards away it was too late to avoid it then and in another minute we ran upon it and the waves were sweeping over us everyone behaved well i got all except those who had been swept overboard or crushed by the funnel up into the bow of the ship and there we waited there was nothing to be done no boat would live for a moment in the sea on that reef and all i could advise was that when she went to pieces everyone should try to get hold of a floating fragment but i doubt whether a man would have been alive a quarter of an hour after she went to pieces  perhaps captain you will come on deck with me and give me the benefit of your advice my skipper and i know the islands pretty well but no doubt you know them a good deal better and i dont want another mishap  but the seabird avoided all further dangers and as it became dark the lights of st heliers were in sight and an hour later the yacht brought up in the port and landed her involuntary passengers  a fortnight afterwards the seabird returned to england and two months later mrs grantham had the satisfaction of being present at the ceremony which was the successful consummation of her little scheme in inviting minnie graham to be her companion on board the seabird  well my dear her husband said when she indulged in a little natural triumph i do not say that it has not turned out well and i am heartily glad for both tom and minnies sake it has so but you must allow that it very nearly had a disastrous ending and i think if i were you i should leave matters to take their natural course in future i have accepted toms invitation for the same party to take a cruise in the seabird next summer but i have bargained that next time a storm is brewing up we shall stop quietly in port  thats all very well james mrs grantham said saucily but you must remember that tom virtue will only be first mate of the seabird in future  that i shall be able to tell you better my dear after our next cruise all husbands are not as docile and easily led as i am      a pipe of mystery   a jovial party were gathered round a blazing fire in an old grange near warwick the hour was getting late the very little ones had after dancing round the christmas tree enjoying the snapdragon and playing a variety of games gone off to bed and the elder boys and girls now gathered round their uncle colonel harley and asked him for a storyabove all a ghost story  but i have never seen any ghosts the colonel said laughing and moreover i dont believe in them one bit i have traveled pretty well all over the world i have slept in houses said to be haunted but nothing have i seenno noises that could not be accounted for by rats or the wind have i ever heard i have never and here he pausednever but once met with any circumstances or occurrence that could not be accounted for by the light of reason and i know you prefer hearing stories of my own adventures to mere invention  yes uncle but what was the once when circumstances happened that you could not explain  its rather a long story the colonel said and its getting late  oh no no uncle it does not matter a bit how late we sit up on christmas eve and the longer the story is the better and if you dont believe in ghosts how can it be a story of something you could not account for by the light of nature  you will see when i have done the colonel said it is rather a story of what the scotch call second sight than one of ghosts as to accounting for it you shall form your own opinion when you have heard me to the end  i landed in india in 50 and after going through the regular drill work marched with a detachment up country to join my regiment which was stationed at jubbalpore in the very heart of india it has become an important place since the railroad across india passes through it and no end of changes have taken place but at that time it was one of the most out of the way stations in india and i may say one of the most pleasant it lay high there was capital boating on the nerbudda and above all it was a grand place for sport for it lay at the foot of the hill country an immense district then but little known covered with forests and jungle and abounding with big game of all kinds  my great friend there was a man named simmonds he was just of my own standing we had come out in the same ship had marched up the country together and were almost like brothers he was an old etonian i an old westminster and we were both fond of boating and indeed of sport of all kinds but i am not going to tell you of that now the people in these hills are called gonds a true hill tribethat is to say aborigines somewhat of the negro type the chiefs are of mixed blood but the people are almost black they are supposed to accept the religion of the hindus but are in reality deplorably ignorant and superstitious their priests are a sort of compound of a brahmin priest and a negro fetish man and among their principal duties is that of charming away tigers from the villages by means of incantations there as in other parts of india were a few wandering fakirs who enjoyed an immense reputation for holiness and wisdom the people would go to them from great distances for charms or predictions and believed in their power with implicit faith  at the time when we were at jubbalpore there was one of these fellows whose reputation altogether eclipsed that of his rivals and nothing could be done until his permission had been asked and his blessing obtained all sorts of marvelous stories were constantly coming to our ears of the unerring foresight with which he predicted the termination of diseases both in men and animals and so generally was he believed in that the colonel ordered that no one connected with the regiment should consult him for these predictions very frequently brought about their own fulfillment for those who were told that an illness would terminate fatally lost all hope and literally lay down to die  however many of the stories that we heard could not be explained on these grounds and the fakir and his doings were often talked over at mess some of the officers scoffing at the whole business others maintaining that some of these fakirs had in some way or another the power of foretelling the future citing many well authenticated anecdotes upon the subject  the older officers were the believers we young fellows were the scoffers but for the well known fact that it is very seldom indeed that these fakirs will utter any of their predictions to europeans some of us would have gone to him to test his powers as it was none of us had ever seen him  he lived in an old ruined temple in the middle of a large patch of jungle at the foot of the hills some ten or twelve miles away  i had been at jubbalpore about a year when i was woke up one night by a native who came in to say that at about eight oclock a tiger had killed a man in his village and had dragged off the body  simmonds and i were constantly out after tigers and the people in all the villages within twenty miles knew that we were always ready to pay for early information this tiger had been doing great damage and had carried off about thirty men women and children so great was the fear of him indeed that the people in the neighborhood he frequented scarcely dared stir out of doors except in parties of five or six we had had several hunts after him but like all man eaters he was old and awfully crafty and although we got several snap shots at him he had always managed to save his skin  in a quarter of an hour after the receipt of the message charley simmonds and i were on the back of an elephant which was our joint property our shikaree a capital fellow was on foot beside us and with the native trotting on ahead as guide we went off at the best pace of old begaum for that was the elephants name the village was fifteen miles away but we got there soon after daybreak and were received with delight by the population in half an hour the hunt was organized all the male population turned out as beaters with sticks guns tomtoms and other instruments for making a noise  the trail was not difficult to find a broad path with occasional smears of blood showed where he had dragged his victim through the long grass to a cluster of trees a couple of hundred yards from the village  we scarcely expected to find him there but the villagers held back while we went forward with cocked rifles we found however nothing but a few bones and a quantity of blood the tiger had made off at the approach of daylight into the jungle which was about two miles distant we traced him easily enough and found that he had entered a large ravine from which several smaller ones branched off  it was an awkward place as it was next to impossible to surround it with the number of people at our command we posted them at last all along the upper ground and told them to make up in noise what they wanted in numbers at last all was ready and we gave the signal however i am not telling you a hunting story and need only say that we could neither find nor disturb him in vain we pushed begaum through the thickest of the jungle which clothed the sides and bottom of the ravine while the men shouted beat their tomtoms and showered imprecations against the tiger himself and his ancestors up to the remotest generations  the day was tremendously hot and after three hours march we gave it up for a time and lay down in the shade while the shikarees made a long examination of the ground all round the hillside to be sure that he had not left the ravine they came back with the news that no traces could be discovered and that beyond a doubt he was still there a tiger will crouch up in an exceedingly small clump of grass or bush and will sometimes almost allow himself to be trodden on before moving however we determined to have one more search and if that should prove unsuccessful to send off to jubbalpore for some more of the men to come out with elephants while we kept up a circle of fires and of noises of all descriptions so as to keep him a prisoner until the arrival of the reinforcements our next search was no more successful than our first had been and having as we imagined examined every clump and crevice in which he could have been concealed we had just reached the upper end of the ravine when we heard a tremendous roar followed by a perfect babel of yells and screams from the natives  the outburst came from the mouth of the ravine and we felt at once that he had escaped we hurried back to find as we had expected that the tiger was gone he had burst out suddenly from his hiding place had seized a native torn him horribly and had made across the open plain  this was terribly provoking but we had nothing to do but follow him this was easy enough and we traced him to a detached patch of wood and jungle two miles distant this wood was four or five hundred yards across and the exclamations of the people at once told us that it was the one in which stood the ruined temple of the fakir of whom i have been telling you i forgot to say that as the tiger broke out one of the village shikarees had fired at and he declared wounded him  it was already getting late in the afternoon and it was hopeless to attempt to beat the jungle that night we therefore sent off a runner with a note to the colonel asking him to send the work elephants and to allow a party of volunteers to march over at night to help surround the jungle when we commenced beating it in the morning  we based our request upon the fact that the tiger was a notorious man eater and had been doing immense damage we then had a talk with our shikaree sent a man off to bring provisions for the people out with us and then set them to work cutting dry sticks and grass to make a circle of fires  we both felt much uneasiness respecting the fakir who might be seized at any moment by the enraged tiger the natives would not allow that there was any cause for fear as the tiger would not dare to touch so holy a man our belief in the respect of the tiger for sanctity was by no means strong and we determined to go in and warn him of the presence of the brute in the wood it was a mission which we could not intrust to anyone else for no native would have entered the jungle for untold gold so we mounted the begaum again and started the path leading towards the temple was pretty wide and as we went along almost noiselessly for the elephant was too well trained to tread upon fallen sticks it was just possible we might come upon the tiger suddenly so we kept our rifles in readiness in our hands  presently we came in sight of the ruins no one was at first visible but at that very moment the fakir came out from the temple he could not see or hear us for we were rather behind him and still among the trees but at once proceeded in a high voice to break into a singsong prayer he had not said two words before his voice was drowned in a terrific roar and in an instant the tiger had sprung upon him struck him to the ground seized him as a cat would a mouse and started off with him at a trot the brute evidently had not detected our presence for he came right towards us we halted the begaum and with our fingers on the triggers awaited the favorable moment he was a hundred yards from us when he struck down his victim he was not more than fifty when he caught sight of us he stopped for an instant in surprise charley muttered both barrels harley and as the beast turned to plunge into the jungle and so showed us his side we sent four bullets crashing into him and he rolled over lifeless  we went up to the spot made the begaum give him a kick to be sure that he was dead and then got down to examine the unfortunate fakir the tiger had seized him by the shoulder which was terribly torn and the bone broken he was still perfectly conscious  we at once fired three shots our usual signal that the tiger was dead and in a few minutes were surrounded by the villagers who hardly knew whether to be delighted at the death of their enemy or to grieve over the injury to the fakir we proposed taking the latter to our hospital at jubbalpore but this he positively refused to listen to however we finally persuaded him to allow his arm to be set and the wounds dressed in the first place by our regimental surgeon after which he could go to one of the native villages and have his arm dressed in accordance with his own notions a litter was soon improvised and away we went to jubbalpore which we reached about eight in the evening  the fakir refused to enter the hospital so we brought out a couple of trestles laid the litter upon them and the surgeon set his arm and dressed his wounds by torchlight when he was lifted into a dhoolie and his bearers again prepared to start for the village  hitherto he had only spoken a few words but he now briefly expressed his deep gratitude to simmonds and myself we told him that we would ride over to see him shortly and hoped to find him getting on rapidly another minute and he was gone  it happened that we had three or four fellows away on leave or on staff duty and several others laid up with fever just about this time so that the duty fell very heavily upon the rest of us and it was over a month before we had time to ride over to see the fakir  we had heard he was going on well but we were surprised on reaching the village to find that he had already returned to his old abode in the jungle however we had made up our minds to see him especially as we had agreed that we would endeavor to persuade him to do a prediction for us so we turned our horses heads towards the jungle we found the fakir sitting on a rock in front of the temple just where he had been seized by the tiger he rose as we rode up  i knew that you would come today sahibs and was joyful in the thought of seeing those who have preserved my life  we are glad to see you looking pretty strong again though your arm is still in a sling i said for simmonds was not strong in hindustani  how did you know that we were coming i asked when we had tied up our horses  siva has given to his servant to know many things he said quietly  did you know beforehand that the tiger was going to seize you i asked  i knew that a great danger threatened and that siva would not let me die before my time had come  could you see into our future i asked  the fakir hesitated looked at me for a moment earnestly to see if i was speaking in mockery and then said  the sahibs do not believe in the power of siva or of his servants they call his messengers imposters and scoff at them when they speak of the events of the future  no indeed i said my friend and i have no idea of scoffing we have heard of so many of your predictions coming true that we are really anxious that you should tell us something of the future  the fakir nodded his head went into the temple and returned in a minute or two with two small pipes used by the natives for opium smoking and a brazier of burning charcoal the pipes were already charged he made signs to us to sit down and took his place in front of us then he began singing in a low voice rocking himself to and fro and waving a staff which he held in his hand gradually his voice rose and his gesticulations and actions became more violent so far as i could make out it was a prayer to siva that he would give some glimpse of the future which might benefit the sahibs who had saved the life of his servant presently he darted forward gave us each a pipe took two pieces of red hot charcoal from the brazier in his fingers without seeming to know that they were warm and placed them in the pipes then he recommenced his singing and gesticulations  a glance at charley to see if like myself he was ready to carry the thing through and then i put the pipe to my lips i felt at once that it was opium of which i had before made experiment but mixed with some other substance which was i imagine hasheesh a preparation of hemp a few puffs and i felt a drowsiness creeping over me i saw as through a mist the fakir swaying himself backwards and forwards his arms waving and his face distorted another minute and the pipe slipped from my fingers and i fell back insensible  how long i lay there i do not know i woke with a strange and not unpleasant sensation and presently became conscious that the fakir was gently pressing with a sort of shampooing action my temples and head when he saw that i opened my eyes he left me and performed the same process upon charley in a few minutes he rose from his stooping position waved his hand in token of adieu and walked slowly back into the temple  as he disappeared i sat up charley did the same  we stared at each other for a minute without speaking and then charley said  this is a rum go and no mistake old man  youre right charley my opinion is weve made fools of ourselves lets be off out of this  we staggered to our feet for we both felt like drunken men made our way to our horses poured a mussuk of water over our heads took a drink of brandy from our flasks and then feeling more like ourselves mounted and rode out of the jungle  well harley if the glimpse of futurity which i had is true all i can say is that it was extremely unpleasant  that was just my case charley  my dream or whatever you like to call it was about a mutiny of the men  you dont say so charley so was mine this is monstrously strange to say the least of it however you tell your story first and then i will tell mine  it was very short charley said we were at messnot in our present mess roomwe were dining with the fellows of some other regiment suddenly without any warning the windows were filled with a crowd of sepoys who opened fire right and left into us half the fellows were shot down at once the rest of us made a rush to our swords just as the niggers came swarming into the room there was a desperate fight for a moment i remember that subadar piranone of the best native officers in the regiment by the waymade a rush at me and i shot him through the head with a revolver at the same moment a ball hit me and down i went at the moment a sepoy fell dead across me hiding me partly from sight the fight lasted a minute or two longer i fancy a few fellows escaped for i heard shots outside then the place became quiet in another minute i heard a crackling and saw that the devils had set the mess room on fire one of our men who was lying close by me got up and crawled to the window but he was shot down the moment he showed himself i was hesitating whether to do the same or to lie still and be smothered when suddenly i rolled the dead sepoy off crawled into the anteroom half suffocated by smoke raised the lid of a very heavy trapdoor and stumbled down some steps into a place half storehouse half cellar under the mess room how i knew about it being there i dont know the trap closed over my head with a bang that is all i remember  well charley curiously enough my dream was also about an extraordinary escape from danger lasting like yours only a minute or two the first thing i rememberthere seems to have been some thing before but what i dont knowi was on horseback holding a very pretty but awfully pale girl in front of me we were pursued by a whole troop of sepoy cavalry who were firing pistol shots at us we were not more than seventy or eighty yards in front and they were gaining fast just as i rode into a large deserted temple in the center was a huge stone figure i jumped off my horse with the lady and as i did so she said blow out my brains edward dont let me fall into their hands  instead of answering i hurried her round behind the idol pushed against one of the leaves of a flower in the carving and the stone swung back and showed a hole just large enough to get through with a stone staircase inside the body of the idol made no doubt for the priest to go up and give responses through the mouth i hurried the girl through crept in after her and closed the stone just as our pursuers came clattering into the courtyard that is all i remember  well it is monstrously rum charley said after a pause did you understand what the old fellow was singing about before he gave us the pipes  yes i caught the general drift it was an entreaty to siva to give us some glimpse of futurity which might benefit us  we lit our cheroots and rode for some miles at a brisk canter without remark when we were within a short distance of home we reined up  i feel ever so much better charley said we have got that opium out of our heads now how do you account for it all harley  i account for it in this way charley the opium naturally had the effect of making us both dream and as we took similar doses of the same mixture under similar circumstances it is scarcely extraordinary that it should have effected the same portion of the brain and caused a certain similarity in our dreams in all nightmares something terrible happens or is on the point of happening and so it was here not unnaturally in both our cases our thoughts turned to soldiers if you remember there was a talk at mess some little time since as to what would happen in the extremely unlikely event of the sepoys mutinying in a body i have no doubt that was the foundation of both our dreams it is all natural enough when we come to think it over calmly i think by the way we had better agree to say nothing at all about it in the regiment   i should think not charley said we should never hear the end of it they would chaff us out of our lives  we kept our secret and came at last to laugh over it heartily when we were together then the subject dropped and by the end of a year had as much escaped our minds as any other dream would have done three months after the affair the regiment was ordered down to allahabad and the change of place no doubt helped to erase all memory of the dream four years after we had left jubbalpore we went to beerapore the time is very marked in my memory because the very week we arrived there your aunt then miss gardiner came out from england to her father our colonel the instant i saw her i was impressed with the idea that i knew her intimately i recollected her face her figure and the very tone of her voice but wherever i had met her i could not conceive upon the occasion of my first introduction to her i could not help telling her that i was convinced that we had met and asking her if she did not remember it no she did not remember but very likely she might have done so and she suggested the names of several people at whose houses we might have met i did not know any of them presently she asked how long i had been out in india  six years i said  and how old mr harley she said do you take me to be  i saw in one instant my stupidity and was stammering out an apology when she went on  i am very little over eighteen mr harley although i evidently look ever so many years older but papa can certify to my age so i was only twelve when you left england  i tried in vain to clear matters up your aunt would insist that i took her to be forty and the fun that my blunder made rather drew us together and gave me a start over the other fellows at the station half of whom fell straightway in love with her some months went on and when the mutiny broke out we were engaged to be married it is a proof of how completely the opium dreams had passed out of the minds of both simmonds and myself that even when rumors of general disaffection among the sepoys began to be current they never once recurred to us and even when the news of the actual mutiny reached us we were just as confident as were the others of the fidelity of our own regiment it was the old story foolish confidence and black treachery as at very many other stations the mutiny broke out when we were at mess our regiment was dining with the 34th bengalees suddenly just as dinner was over the window was opened and a tremendous fire poured in four or five men fell dead at once and the poor colonel who was next to me was shot right through the head everyone rushed to his sword and drew his pistolfor we had been ordered to carry pistols as part of our uniform i was next to charley simmonds as the sepoys of both regiments headed by subadar piran poured in at the windows  i have it now charley said it is the scene i dreamed  as he spoke he fired his revolver at the subadar who fell dead in his tracks  a sepoy close by leveled his musket and fired charley fell and the fellow rushed forward to bayonet him as he did so i sent a bullet through his head and he fell across charley it was a wild fight for a minute or two and then a few of us made a sudden rush together cut our way through the mutineers and darted through an open window on to the parade there were shouts shots and screams from the officers bungalows and in several places flames were already rising what became of the other men i knew not i made as hard as i could tear for the colonels bungalow suddenly i came upon a sowar sitting on his horse watching the rising flames before he saw me i was on him and ran him through i leapt on his horse and galloped down to gardiners compound i saw lots of sepoys in and around the bungalow all engaged in looting i dashed into the compound  may may i shouted where are you  i had scarcely spoken before a dark figure rushed out of a clump of bushes close by with a scream of delight  in an instant she was on the horse before me and shooting down a couple of fellows who made a rush at my reins i dashed out again stray shots were fired after us but fortunately the sepoys were all busy looting most of them had laid down their muskets and no one really took up the pursuit i turned off from the parade ground dashed down between the hedges of two compounds and in another minute we were in the open country  fortunately the cavalry were all down looting their own lines or we must have been overtaken at once may happily had fainted as i lifted her on to my horsehappily because the fearful screams that we heard from the various bungalows almost drove me mad and would probably have killed her for the poor ladies were all her intimate friends  i rode on for some hours till i felt quite safe from any immediate pursuit and then we halted in the shelter of a clump of trees  by this time i had heard mays story she had felt uneasy at being alone but had laughed at herself for being so until upon her speaking to one of the servants he had answered in a tone of gross insolence which had astonished her she at once guessed that there was danger and the moment that she was alone caught up a large dark carriage rug wrapped it round her so as to conceal her white dress and stole out into the veranda the night was dark and scarcely had she left the house than she heard a burst of firing across at the mess house she at once ran in among the bushes and crouched there as she heard the rush of men into the room she had just left she heard them searching for her but they were looking for a white dress and her dark rug saved her what she must have suffered in the five minutes between the firing of the first shots and my arrival she only knows may had spoken but very little since we started i believe that she was certain that her father was dead although i had given an evasive answer when she asked me and her terrible sense of loss added to the horror of that time of suspense in the garden had completely stunned her we waited in the tope until the afternoon and then set out again  we had gone but a short distance when we saw a body of the rebel cavalry in pursuit they had no doubt been scouring the country generally and the discovery was accidental for a short time we kept away from them but this could not be for long as our horse was carrying double i made for a sort of ruin i saw at the foot of a hill half a mile away i did so with no idea of the possibility of concealment my intention was simply to get my back to a rock and to sell my life as dearly as i could keeping the last two barrels of the revolver for ourselves certainly no remembrance of my dream influenced me in any way and in the wild whirl of excitement i had not given a second thought to charley simmonds exclamation as we rode up to the ruins only a hundred yards ahead of us may said  blow out my brains edward dont let me fall alive into their hands  a shock of remembrance shot across me the chase her pale face the words the templeall my dream rushed into my mind  we are saved i cried to her amazement as we rode into the courtyard in whose center a great figure was sitting  i leapt from the horse snatched the mussuk of water from the saddle and then hurried may round the idol between which and the rock behind there was but just room to get along  not a doubt entered my mind but that i should find the spring as i had dreamed sure enough there was the carving fresh upon my memory as if i had seen it but the day before i placed my hand on the leaflet without hesitation a solid stone moved back i hurried my amazed companion in and shut to the stone i found and shot to a massive bolt evidently placed to prevent the door being opened by accident or design when anyone was in the idol  at first it seemed quite dark but a faint light streamed in from above we made our way up the stairs and found that the light came through a number of small holes pierced in the upper part of the head and through still smaller holes lower down not much larger than a good sized knitting needle could pass through these holes we afterwards found were in the ornaments round the idols neck the holes enlarged inside and enabled us to have a view all round  the mutineers were furious at our disappearance and for hours searched about then saying that we must be hidden somewhere and that they would wait till we came out they proceeded to bivouac in the courtyard of the temple  we passed four terrible days but on the morning of the fifth a scout came in to tell the rebels that a column of british troops marching on delhi would pass close by the temple they therefore hastily mounted and galloped off  three quarters of an hour later we were safe among our own people a fortnight afterwards your aunt and i were married it was no time for ceremony then there were no means of sending her away no place where she could have waited until the time for her mourning for her father was over so we were married quietly by one of the chaplains of the troops and as your storybooks say have lived very happily ever after  and how about mr simmonds uncle did he get safe off too  yes his dream came as vividly to his mind as mine had done he crawled to the place where he knew the trapdoor would be and got into the cellar fortunately for him there were plenty of eatables there and he lived there in concealment for a fortnight after that he crawled out and found the mutineers had marched for delhi he went through a lot but at last joined us before that city we often talked over our dreams together and there was no question that we owed our lives to them even then we did not talk much to other people about them for there would have been a lot of talk and inquiry and questions and you know fellows hate that sort of thing so we held our tongues poor charleys silence was sealed a year later at lucknow for on the advance with lord clyde he was killed  and now boys and girls you must run off to bed five minutes more and it will be christmas day  so you see frank that although i dont believe in ghosts i have yet met with a circumstance which i cannot account for  it is very curious anyhow uncle and beats ghost stories into fits  i like it better certainly one of the girls said for we can go to bed without being afraid of dreaming about it  well you must not talk any more now off to bed off to bed colonel harley said or i shall get into terrible disgrace with your fathers and mothers who have been looking very gravely at me for the last three quarters of an hour      white faced dick a story of pine tree gulch   how pine tree gulch got its name no one knew for in the early days every ravine and hillside was thickly covered with pines it may be that a tree of exceptional size caught the eye of the first explorer that he camped under it and named the place in its honor or maybe some fallen giant lay in the bottom and hindered the work of the first prospectors at any rate pine tree gulch it was and the name was as good as any other the pine trees were gone now cut up for firing or for the erection of huts or the construction of sluices but the hillside was ragged with their stumps  the principal camp was at the mouth of the gulch where the little stream which scarce afforded water sufficient for the cradles in the dry season but which was a rushing torrent in winter joined the yuba the best ground was at the junction of the streams and lay indeed in the yuba valley rather than in the gulch at first most gold had been found higher up but there was here comparatively little depth down to the bedrock and as the ground became exhausted the miners moved down towards the mouth of the gulch they were doing well as a whole how well no one knew for miners are chary of giving information as to what they are making still it was certain they were doing well for the bars were doing a roaring trade and the storekeepers never refused credita proof in itself that the prospects were good  the flat at the mouth of the gulch was a busy scene every foot was good paying stuff for in the eddy where the torrents in winter rushed down into the yuba the gold had settled down and lay thick among the gravel but most of the parties were sinking and it was a long way down to the bedrock for the hills on both sides sloped steeply and the yuba must here at one time have rushed through a narrow gorge until in some wild freak it brought down millions of tons of gravel and resumed its course seventy feet above its former level  a quarter of a mile higher up a ledge of rock ran across the valley and over it in the old time the yuba had poured in a cascade seventy feet deep into the ravine but the rock now was level with the gravel only showing its jagged points here and there above it this ledge had been invaluable to the diggers without it they could only have sunk their shafts with the greatest difficulty for the gravel would have been full of water and even with the greatest pains in puddling and timber work the pumps would scarcely have sufficed to keep it down as it rose in the bottom of the shafts but the miners had made common cause together and giving each so many ounces of gold or so many days work had erected a dam thirty feet high along the ledge of rock and had cut a channel for the yuba along the lower slopes of the valley of course when the rain set in as everybody knew the dam would go and the river diggings must be abandoned till the water subsided and a fresh dam was made but there were two months before them yet and everyone hoped to be down to the bedrock before the water interrupted their work  the hillside both in the yuba valley and for some distance along pine tree gulch was dotted by shanties and tents the former constructed for the most part of logs roughly squared the walls being some three feet in height on which the sharp sloping roof was placed thatched in the first place with boughs and made all snug perhaps with an old sail stretched over all the camp was quiet enough during the day the few women were away with their washing at the pools a quarter of a mile up the gulch and the only persons to be seen about were the men told off for cooking for their respective parties  but in the evening the camp was lively groups of men in red shirts and corded trousers tied at the knee in high boots sat round blazing fires and talked of their prospects or discussed the news of the luck at other camps the sound of music came from two or three plank erections which rose conspicuously above the huts of the diggers and were bright externally with the glories of white and colored paints to and from these men were always sauntering and it needed not the clink of glasses and the sound of music to tell that they were the bars of the camp  here standing at the counter or seated at numerous small tables men were drinking villainous liquor smoking and talking and paying but scant attention to the strains of the fiddle or the accordion save when some well known air was played when all would join in a boisterous chorus some were always passing in or out of a door which led into a room behind here there was comparative quiet for men were gambling and gambling high  going backwards and forwards with liquors into the gambling room of the imperial saloon which stood just where pine tree gulch opened into yuba valley was a lad whose appearance had earned for him the name of white faced dick  white faced dick was not one of those who had done well at pine tree gulch he had come across the plains with his father who had died when halfway over and dick had been thrown on the world to shift for himself nature had not intended him for the work for he was a delicate timid lad what spirits he originally had having been years before beaten out of him by a brutal father so far indeed dick was the better rather than the worse for the event which had left him an orphan  they had been traveling with a large party for mutual security against indians and mormons and so long as the journey lasted dick had got on fairly well he was always ready to do odd jobs and as the draught cattle were growing weaker and weaker and every pound of weight was of importance no one grudged him his rations in return for his services but when the company began to descend the slopes of the sierra nevada they began to break up going off by twos and threes to the diggings of which they heard such glowing accounts some however kept straight on to sacramento determining there to obtain news as to the doings at all the different places and then to choose that which seemed to them to offer the surest prospects of success  dick proceeded with them to the town and there found himself alone his companions were absorbed in the busy rush of population and each had so much to provide and arrange for that none gave a thought to the solitary boy however at that time no one who had a pair of hands however feeble to work need starve in sacramento and for some weeks dick hung around the town doing odd jobs and then having saved a few dollars determined to try his luck at the diggings and started on foot with a shovel on his shoulders and a few days provisions slung across it  arrived at his destination the lad soon discovered that gold digging was hard work for brawny and seasoned men and after a few feeble attempts in spots abandoned as worthless he gave up the effort and again began to drift and even in pine tree gulch it was not difficult to get a living at first he tried rocking cradles but the work was far harder than it appeared he was standing ankle deep in water from morning till night and his cheeks grew paler and his strength instead of increasing seemed to fade away still there were jobs within his strength he could keep a fire alight and watch a cooking pot he could carry up buckets of water or wash a flannel shirt and so he struggled on until at last some kind hearted man suggested to him that he should try to get a place at the new saloon which was about to be opened  you are not fit for this work young un and you ought to be at home with your mother if you like i will go up with you this evening to jeffries i knew him down on the flats and i dare say he will take you on i dont say as a saloon is a good place for a boy still you will always get your bellyful of victuals and a dry place to sleep in if its only under a table what do you say  dick thankfully accepted the offer and on red georges recommendation was that evening engaged his work was not hard now for till the miners knocked off there was little doing in the saloon a few men would come in for a drink at dinnertime but it was not until the lamps were lit that business began in earnest and then for four or five hours dick was busy  a rougher or healthier lad would not have minded the work but to dick it was torture every nerve in his body thrilled whenever rough miners cursed him for not carrying out their orders more quickly or for bringing them the wrong liquors which as his brain was in a whirl with the noise the shouting and the multiplicity of orders happened frequently he might have fared worse had not red george always stood his friend and red george was an authority in pine tree gulchpowerful in frame reckless in bearing and temper he had been in a score of fights and had come off them if not unscathed at least victorious he was notoriously a lucky digger but his earnings went as fast as they were made and he was always ready to open his belt and give a bountiful pinch of dust to any mate down on his luck  one evening dick was more helpless and confused than usual the saloon was full and he had been shouted at and badgered and cursed until he scarcely knew what he was doing high play was going on in the saloon and a good many men were clustered round the table red george was having a run of luck and there was a big pile of gold dust on the table before him one of the gamblers who was losing had ordered old rye and instead of bringing it to him dick brought a tumbler of hot liquor which someone else had called for with an oath the man took it up and threw it in his face  you cowardly hound red george exclaimed are you man enough to do that to a man  you bet the gambler who was a new arrival at pine tree gulch replied and picking up an empty glass he hurled it at red george the bystanders sprang aside and in a moment the two men were facing each other with outstretched pistols the two reports rung out simultaneously red george sat down unconcernedly with a streak of blood flowing down his face where the bullet had cut a furrow in his cheek the stranger fell back with a bullet hole in the center of his forehead  the body was carried outside and the play continued as if no interruption had taken place they were accustomed to such occurrences in pine tree gulch and the piece of ground at the top of the hill that had been set aside as a burial place was already dotted thickly with graves filled in almost every instance by men who had died in the local phraseology with their boots on  neither then nor afterwards did red george allude to the subject to dick whose life after this signal instance of his championship was easier than it had hitherto been for there were few in pine tree gulch who cared to excite red georges anger and strangers going to the place were sure to receive a friendly warning that it was best for their health to keep their tempers over any shortcomings on the part of white faced dick  grateful as he was for red georges interference on his behalf dick felt the circumstance which had ensued more than anyone else in the camp with others it was the subject of five minutes talk but dick could not get out of his head the thought of the dead mans face as he fell back he had seen many such frays before but he was too full of his own troubles for them to make much impression upon him but in the present case he felt as if he himself was responsible for the death of the gambler if he had not blundered this would not have happened  he wondered whether the dead man had a wife and children and if so were they expecting his return would they ever hear where he had died and how  but this feeling which tired out as he was when the time came for closing the bar often prevented him from sleeping for hours in no way lessened his gratitude and devotion towards red george and he felt that he could die willingly if his life would benefit his champion sometimes he thought too that his life would not be much to give for in spite of shelter and food the cough which he had caught while working in the water still clung to him and as his employer said to him angrily one day  your victuals dont do you no good dick you get thinner and thinner and folks will think as i starve you darned if you aint a disgrace to the establishment  the wind was whistling down the gorges and the clouds hung among the pine woods which still clothed the upper slopes of the hills and the diggers as they turned out one morning looked up apprehensively  but it could not be they assured each other everyone knew that the rains were not due for another month yet it could only be a passing shower if it rained at all  but as the morning went on men came in from camps higher up the river and reports were current that it had been raining for the last two days among the upper hills while those who took the trouble to walk across to the new channel could see for themselves at noon that it was filled very nigh to the brim the water rushing along with thick and turbid current but those who repeated the rumors or who reported that the channel was full were summarily put down men would not believe that such a calamity as a flood and the destruction of all their seasons work could be impending there had been some showers no doubt as there had often been before but it was ridiculous to talk of anything like rain a month before its time still in spite of these assertions there was uneasiness at pine tree gulch and men looked at the driving clouds above and shook their heads before they went down to the shafts to work after dinner  when the last customer had left and the bar was closed dick had nothing to do till evening and he wandered outside and sat down on a stump at first looking at the work going on in the valley then so absorbed in his own thoughts that he noticed nothing not even the driving mist which presently set in he was calculating that he had with his savings from his wages and what had been given him by the miners laid by eighty dollars when he got another hundred and twenty he would go he would make his way down to san francisco and then by ship to panama and up to new york and then west again to the village where he was born there would be people there who would know him and who would give him work for his mothers sake he did not care what it was anything would be better than this then his thoughts came back to pine tree gulch and he started to his feet could he be mistaken were his eyes deceiving him no among the stones and boulders of the old bed of the yuba there was the gleam of water and even as he watched it he could see it widening out he started to run down the hill to give the alarm but before he was halfway he paused for there were loud shouts and a scene of bustle and confusion instantly arose  the cradles were deserted and the men working on the surface loaded themselves with their tools and made for the high ground while those at the windlasses worked their hardest to draw up their comrades below a man coming down from above stopped close to dick with a low cry and stood gazing with a white scared face dick had worked with him he was one of the company to which red george belonged  what is it saunders  my god they are lost the man replied i was at the windlass when they shouted up to me to go up and fetch them a bottle of rum they had just struck it rich and wanted a drink on the strength of it  dick understood at once red george and his mates were still in the bottom of the shaft ignorant of the danger which was threatening them  come on he cried we shall be in time yet and at the top of his speed dashed down the hill followed by saunders  what is it what is it asked parties of men mounting the hill  red georges gang are still below  dicks eyes were fixed on the water there was a broad band now of yellow with a white edge down the center of the stony flat and it was widening with terrible rapidity it was scarce ten yards from the windlass at the top of red georges shaft when dick followed closely by saunders reached it  come up mates quick for your lives the river is rising you will be flooded out directly everyone else has gone  as he spoke he pulled at the rope by which the bucket was hanging and the handles of the windlass flew round rapidly as it descended when it had run out dick and he grasped the handles  all right below  an answering call came up and the two began their work throwing their whole strength into it quickly as the windlass revolved it seemed an endless time to dick before the bucket came up and the first man stepped out it was not red george dick had hardly expected it would be red george would be sure to see his two mates up before him and the man uttered a cry of alarm as he saw the water now within a few feet of the mouth of the shaft  it was a torrent now for not only was it coming through the dam but it was rushing down in cascades from the new channel without a word the miner placed himself facing dick and the moment the bucket was again down the three grasped the handles but quickly as they worked the edge of the water was within a few inches of the shaft when the next man reached the surface but again the bucket descended before the rope tightened however the water had begun to run over the lipat first in a mere trickle and then almost instantaneously in a cascade which grew larger and larger  the bucket was halfway up when a sound like thunder was heard the ground seemed to tremble under their feet and then at the turn of the valley above a great wave of yellow water crested with foam was seen tearing along at the speed of a race horse  the dam has burst saunders shouted run for your lives or we are all lost  the three men dropped the handles and ran at full speed towards the shore while loud shouts to dick to follow came from the crowd of men standing on the slope but the boy grasped the handles and with lips tightly closed still toiled on slowly the bucket ascended for red george was a heavy man then suddenly the weight slackened and the handle went round faster the shaft was filling the water had reached the bucket and had risen to red georges neck so that his weight was no longer on the rope so fast did the water pour in that it was not half a minute before the bucket reached the surface and red george sprang out there was but time for one exclamation and then the great wave struck them red george was whirled like a straw in the current but he was a strong swimmer and at a point where the valley widened out half a mile lower he struggled to shore  two days later the news reached pine tree gulch that a boys body had been washed ashore twenty miles down and ten men headed by red george went and brought it solemnly back to pine tree gulch there among the stumps of pine trees a grave was dug and there in the presence of the whole camp white faced dick was laid to rest  pine tree gulch is a solitude now the trees are growing again and none would dream that it was once a busy scene of industry but if the traveler searches among the pine trees he will find a stone with the words  here lies white faced dick who died to save red george what can a man do more than give his life for a friend  the text was the suggestion of an exclergyman working as a miner in pine tree gulch  red george worked no more at the diggings but after seeing the stone laid in its place went east and with what little money came to him when the common fund of the company was divided after the flood on the yuba bought a small farm and settled down there but to the end of his life he was never weary of telling those who would listen to it the story of pine tree gulch      a brush with the chinese   it was early in december that h m s perseus was cruising off the mouth of the canton river war had been declared with china in consequence of her continued evasions of the treaty she had made with us and it was expected that a strong naval force would soon gather to bring her to reason in the meantime the ships on the station had a busy time of it chasing the enemys junks when they ventured to show themselves beyond the reach of the guns of their forts and occasionally having a brush with the piratical boats which took advantage of the general confusion to plunder friend as well as foe  the perseus had that afternoon chased two government junks up a creek the sun had already set when they took refuge there and the captain did not care to send his boats after them in the dark as many of the creeks ran up for miles into the flat country and as they not unfrequently had many arms or branches the boats might in the dark miss the junk altogether orders were issued that four boats should be ready for starting at daybreak the next morning the perseus anchored off the mouth of the creek and two boats were ordered to row backwards and forwards off its mouth all night to insure that the enemy did not slip out in the darkness  jack fothergill the senior midshipman was commanding the gig and two of the other midshipmen were going in the pinnace and launch commanded respectively by the first lieutenant and the master the three other midshipmen of the perseus were loud in their lamentations that they were not to take share in the fun  you cant all go you know fothergill said and its no use making a row about it the captain has been very good to let three of us go  its all very well for you jack percy adcock the youngest of the lads replied because you are one of those chosen and it is not so hard for simmons and linthorpe because they went the other day in the boat that chased those junks under shelter of the guns of their battery but i havent had a chance for ever so long  what fun was there in chasing the junks simmons said we never got near the brutes till they were close to their battery and then just as the first shot came singing from their guns and we thought that we were going to have some excitement the first lieutenant sung out easy all and there was nothing for it but to turn round and to row for the ship and a nice hot row it wastwo hours and a half in a broiling sun of course i am not blaming oliphant for the captains orders were strict that we were not to try to cut the junks out if they got under the guns of any of their batteries still it was horribly annoying and i do think the captain might have remembered what beastly luck we had last time and given us a chance tomorrow  it is clear we could not all go fothergill said and naturally enough the captain chose the three seniors besides if you did have bad luck last time you had your chance and i dont suppose we shall have anything more exciting now these fellows always set fire to their junks and row for the shore directly they see us after firing a shot or two wildly in our direction  well jack if you dont expect any fun simmons replied perhaps you wouldnt mind telling the first lieutenant you do not care for going and that i am very anxious to take your place perhaps he will be good enough to allow me to relieve you  a likely thing that fothergill laughed no tom i am sorry you are not going but you must make the best of it till another chance comes  dont you think jack percy adcock said to his senior in a coaxing tone later on you could manage to smuggle me into the boat with you  not i percy suppose you got hurt what would the captain say then and firing as wildly as the chinese do a shot is just as likely to hit your little carcass as to lodge in one of the sailors no you must just make the best of it percy and i promise you that next time there is a boat expedition if you are not put in i will say a good word to the first luff for you  that promise is better than nothing the boy said but i would a deal rather go this time and take my chance next  but you see you cant percy and theres no use talking any more about it i really do not expect there will be any fighting two junks would hardly make any opposition to the boats of the ship and i expect we shall be back by nine oclock with the news that they were well on fire before we came up  percy adcock however was determined if possible to go he was a favorite among the men and when he spoke to the bow oar of the gig the latter promised to do anything he could to aid him to carry out his wishes  we are to start at daybreak tom so that it will be quite dark when the boats are lowered i will creep into the gig before that and hide myself as well as i can under your thwart and all you have got to do is to take no notice of me when the boat is lowered i think they will hardly make me out from the deck especially as you will be standing up in the bow holding on with the boat hook till the rest get on board  well sir i will do my best but if you are caught you must not let out that i knew anything about it  i wont do that percy said i dont think there is much chance of my being noticed until we get on board the junks and then they wont know which boat i came off in and the first lieutenant will be too busy to blow me up of course i shall get it when i am on board again but i dont mind that so that i see the fun besides i want to send home some things to my sister and she will like them all the better if i can tell her i captured them on board some junks we seized and burnt  the next morning the crews mustered before daybreak percy had already taken his place under the bow thwart of the gig the davits were swung overboard and two men took their places in her as she was lowered down by the falls as soon as she touched the water the rest of the crew clambered down by the ladder and took their places then fothergill took his seat in the stern and the boat pushed off and lay a few lengths away from the ship until the heavier boats put off as soon as they were under way percy crawled out from his hiding place and placed himself in the bow where he was sheltered by the body of the oarsmen from fothergills sight day was just breaking now but it was still dark on the water and the boat rowed very slowly until it became lighter percy could just make out the shores of the creek on both sides they were but two or three feet above the level of the water and were evidently submerged at high tide the creek was about a hundred yards wide and the lad could not see far ahead for it was full of sharp windings and turnings here and there branches joined it but the boats were evidently following the main channel after another half hours rowing the first lieutenant suddenly gave the order easy all and the men looking over their shoulders saw a village a quarter of a mile ahead with the two junks they had chased the night before lying in front of it almost at the same moment a sudden uproar was hearddrums were beaten and gongs sounded  they are on the lookout for us the first lieutenant said mr mason do you keep with me and attack the junk highest up the river mr bellew and mr fothergill do you take the one lower down row on men the oars all touched the water together and the four boats leaped forward in a minute a scattering fire of gingals and matchlocks was opened from the junks and the bullets pattered on the water round the boats percy was kneeling up in the bow now as they passed a branch channel three or four hundred yards from the village he started and leaped to his feet  there are four or five junks in that passage fothergill they are poling out  the first lieutenant heard the words  row on men let us finish with these craft ahead before the others get out this must be that piratical village we have heard about mr mason as lying up one of these creeks that accounts for those two junks not going higher up i was surprised at seeing them here for they might guess that we should try to get them this morning evidently they calculated on catching us in a trap  percy was delighted at finding that in the excitement caused by his news the first lieutenant had forgotten to take any notice of his being there without orders and he returned a defiant nod to the threat conveyed by fothergill shaking his fist at him as they neared the junks the fire of those on board redoubled and was aided by that of many villagers gathered on the bank of the creek suddenly from a bank of rushes four cannons were fired a ball struck the pinnace smashing in her side the other boats gathered hastily round and took her crew on board and then dashed at the junks which were but a hundred yards distant the valor of the chinese evaporated as they saw the boats approaching and scores of them leaped overboard and swam for shore  in another minute the boats were alongside and the crews scrambling up the sides of the junks a few chinamen only attempted to oppose them these were speedily overcome and the british had now time to look round and saw that six junks crowded with men had issued from the side creek and were making towards them  let the boats tow astern the lieutenant ordered we should have to run the gantlet of that battery on shore if we were to attack them and might lose another boat before we reached their side we will fight them here  the junks approached those on board firing their guns yelling and shouting while the drums and gongs were furiously beaten  they will find themselves mistaken percy if they think they are going to frighten us with all that row fothergill said you young rascal how did you get on board the boat without being seen the captain will be sure to suspect i had a hand in concealing you  the tars were now at work firing the gingals attached to the bulwarks and the matchlocks with which the deck was strewn at the approaching junks as they took steady aim leaning their pieces on the bulwarks they did considerable execution among the chinamen crowded on board the junks while the shot of the chinese for the most part whistled far overhead but the guns of the shore battery which had now slewed round to bear upon them opened with a better aim and several shots came crashing into the sides of the two captured junks  get ready to board lads lieutenant oliphant shouted dont wait for them to board you but the moment they come alongside lash their rigging to ours and spring on board them  the leading junk was now about twenty yards away and presently grated alongside half a dozen sailors at once sprang into her rigging with ropes and after lashing the junks together leaped down upon her deck where fothergill was leading the gigs crew and some of those rescued from the pinnace while mr bellew with another party had boarded her at the stern several of the chinese fought stoutly but the greater part lost heart at seeing themselves attacked by the white devils instead of as they expected overwhelming them by their superior numbers many began at once to jump overboard and after two or three minutes sharp fighting the rest either followed their example or were beaten below  fothergill looked round the other junk had been attacked by two of the enemy one on each side and the little body of sailors were gathered in her waist and were defending themselves against an overwhelming number of the enemy the other three piratical junks had been carried somewhat up the creek by the tide that was sweeping inward and could not for the moment take part in the fight  mr oliphant is hard pressed sir he asked the master shall we take to the boats  that will be the best plan mr bellew replied  quick lads get the boats alongside and tumble in there is not a moment to be lost  the crew at once sprang to the boats and rowed to the other junk which was but some thirty yards away  the chinese absorbed in their contest with the crew of the pinnace did not perceive the newcomers until they gained the deck and with a shout fell furiously upon them in their surprise and consternation the pirates did not pause to note that they were still five to one superior in number but made a precipitate rush for their own vessels the english at once took the offensive the first lieutenant with his party boarded one while the newcomers leaped on to the deck of the other the panic which had seized the chinese was so complete that they attempted no resistance whatever but sprang overboard in great numbers and swam to the shore which was but twenty yards away and in three minutes the english were in undisputed possession of both vessels  back again mr fothergill or you will lose the craft you captured lieutenant oliphant said they have already cut her free  the chinese indeed who had been beaten below by the boarding party had soon perceived the sudden departure of their captors and gaining the deck again had cut the lashings which fastened them to the other junk and were proceeding to hoist their sails they were too late however almost before the craft had way on her fothergill and his crew were alongside the chinese did not wait for the attack but at once sprang overboard and made for the shore the other three junks seeing the capture of their comrades had already hoisted their sails and were making up the creek fothergill dropped an anchor left four of his men in charge and rowed back to mr oliphant  what shall we do next sir  we will give those fellows on shore a lesson and silence their battery two men have been killed since you left we must let the other junks go for the present four of my men were killed and eleven wounded before mr bellew and you came to our assistance the chinese were fighting pluckily up to that time and it would have gone very hard with us if you had not been at hand the beggars will fight when they think they have got it all their own way but before we land we will set fire to the five junks we have taken do you return and see that the two astern are well lighted mr fothergill mr mason will see to these three when you have done your work take to your boat and lay off till i join you keep the junks between you and the shore to protect you from the fire of the rascals  i cannot come with you i suppose fothergill percy adcock said as the midshipman was about to descend into his boat again  yes come along percy it doesnt matter what you do now the captain will be so pleased when he hears that we have captured and burnt five junks that you will get off with a very light wigging i imagine  thats just what i was thinking jack has it not been fun  you wouldnt have thought it fun if you had got one of those matchlock balls in your body there are a good many of our poor fellows just at the present moment who do not see anything funny in the affair at all here we are clamber up  the crew soon set to work under fothergills orders the sails were cut off the masts and thrown down into the hold bamboos of which there were an abundance down there were heaped over them a barrel of oil was poured over the mass and the fire then applied  that will do lads now take to your boats and lets make a bonfire of the other junk  in ten minutes both vessels were a sheet of flame and the boat was lying a short distance from them waiting for further operations the inhabitants of the village furious at the failure of the plan which had been laid for the destruction of the white devils kept up a constant fusillade which however did no harm for the gig was completely sheltered by the burning junks close to her from their missiles  there go the others percy exclaimed after a minute or two as three columns of smoke arose simultaneously from the other junks and the sailors were seen dropping into their boats alongside  the killed and wounded were placed in the other gig with four sailors in charge they were directed to keep under shelter of the junks until rejoined by the pinnace and fothergills gig after these had done their work on shore  when all was ready the first lieutenant raised his hand as a signal and the two boats dashed between the burning junks and rowed for the shore such of the natives as had their weapons charged fired a hasty volley and then as the sailors leapt from their boats took to their heels  mr fothergill take your party into the village and set fire to the houses shoot down every man you see this place is a nest of pirates i will capture that battery and then join you  fothergill and his sailors at once entered the village the men had already fled the women were turned out of the houses and these were immediately set on fire the tars regarded the whole affair as a glorious joke and raced from house to house making a hasty search in each for concealed valuables before setting it on fire in a short time the whole village was in a blaze  there is a house there standing in that little grove a hundred yards away percy said  it looks like a temple fothergill replied however we will have a look at it and calling two sailors to accompany him he started at a run towards it percy keeping by his side  it is a temple fothergill said when they approached it still we will have a look at it but we wont burn it it will be as well to respect the religion even of a set of piratical scoundrels like these  at the head of his men he rushed in at the entrance there was a blaze of fire as half a dozen muskets were discharged in their faces one of the sailors dropped dead and before the others had time to realize what had happened they were beaten to the ground by a storm of blows from swords and other weapons  a heavy blow crashed down on percys head and he fell insensible even before he realized what had occurred  when he recovered his first sensation was that of a vague wonder as to what had happened to him he seemed to be in darkness and unable to move hand or foot he was compressed in some way that he could not at first understand and was being bumped and jolted in an extraordinary manner it was some little time before he could understand the situation he first remembered the fight with the junks then he recalled the landing and burning the village then as his brain cleared came the recollection of his start with fothergill for the temple among the trees his arrival there and a loud report and flash of fire  i must have been knocked down and stunned he said to himself and i suppose i am a prisoner now to these brutes and one of them must be carrying me on his back  yes he could understand it all now his hands and his feet were tied ropes were passed round his body in every direction and he was fastened back to back upon the shoulders of a chinaman percy remembered the tales he had heard of the imprisonment and torture of those who fell into the hands of the chinese and he bitterly regretted that he had not been killed instead of stunned in the surprise of the temple  it would have been just the same feeling he said to himself and there would have been an end of it now there is no saying what is going to happen i wonder whether jack was killed and the sailors  presently there was a jabber of voices the motion ceased percy could feel that the cords were being unwound and he was dropped on to his feet then the cloth was removed from his head and he could look around  a dozen chinese armed with matchlocks and bristling with swords and daggers stood around and among them bound like himself and gagged by a piece of bamboo forced lengthways across his mouth and kept there with a string going round the back of the head stood fothergill he was bleeding from several cuts in the head percys heart gave a bound of joy at finding that he was not alone then he tried to feel sorry that jack had not escaped but failed to do so although he told himself that his comrades presence would not in any way alleviate the fate which was certain to befall him still the thought of companionship even in wretchedness and perhaps a vague hope that jack with his energy and spirit might contrive some way for their escape cheered him up  as percy too was gagged no word could be exchanged by the midshipmen but they nodded to each other they were now put side by side and made to walk in the center of their captors on the way they passed through several villages whose inhabitants poured out to gaze at the captives but the men in charge of them were evidently not disposed to delay as they passed through without a stop at last they halted before two cottages standing by themselves thrust the prisoners into a small room removed their gags and left them entirely to themselves  well percy my boy so they caught you too i am awfully sorry it was my fault for going with only two men into that temple but as the village had been deserted and scarcely a man was found there it never entered my mind that there might be a party in the temple  of course not jack it was a surprise altogether i dont know anything about it for i was knocked down i suppose just as we went in and the first thing i knew about it was that i was being carried on the back of one of those fellows i thought it was awful at first but i dont seem to mind so much now you are with me  it is a comfort to have someone to speak to jack said yet i wish you were not here percy i cant do you any good and i shall never cease blaming myself for having brought you into this scrape i dont know much more about the affair than you do the guns were fired so close to us that my face was scorched with one of them and almost at the same instant i got a lick across my cheek with a sword i had just time to hit at one of them and then almost at the same moment i got two or three other blows and down i went they threw themselves on the top of me and tied and gagged me in no time then i was tied to a long bamboo and two fellows put the ends on their shoulders and went off with me through the fields of course i was face downwards and did not know you were with us till they stopped and loosed me from the bamboo and set me on my feet  but what are they going to do with us do you think jack  i should say they are going to take us to canton and claim a reward for our capture and there i suppose they will cut off our heads or saw us in two or put us to some other unpleasant kind of death i expect they are discussing it now do you hear what a jabber they are kicking up  voices were indeed heard raised in angry altercation in the next room after a time the din subsided and the conversation appeared to take a more amiable turn  i suppose they have settled it as far as they are concerned jack said anyhow you may be quite sure they mean to make something out of us if they hadnt they would have finished us at once for they must have been furious at the destruction of their junks and village as to the idea that mercy has anything to do with it we may as well put it out of our minds the chinaman at the best of times has no feeling of pity in his nature and after their defeat it is certain they would have killed us at once had they not hoped to do better by us if they had been indians i should have said they had carried us off to enjoy the satisfaction of torturing us but i dont suppose it is that with them  do you think there is any chance of our getting away percy asked after a pause  i should say not the least in the world percy my hands are fastened so tight now that the ropes seem cutting into my wrists and after they had set me on my feet and cut the cords of my legs i could scarcely stand at first my feet were so numbed by the pressure however we must keep up our pluck possibly they may keep us at canton for a bit and if they do the squadron may arrive and fight its way past the forts and take the city before they have quite made up their minds as to what kind of death will be most appropriate to the occasion i wonder what they are doing now they seem to be chopping sticks  i wish they would give us some water percy said i am frightfully thirsty  and so am i percy there is one comfort they wont let us die of thirst they could get no satisfaction out of our deaths now  two hours later some of the chinese reentered the room and led the captives outside and the lads then saw what was the meaning of the noise they had heard a cage had been manufactured of strong bamboos it was about four and a half feet long four feet wide and less than three feet high above it was fastened two long bamboos two or three of the bars of the cage had been left open  my goodness they never intend to put us in there percy exclaimed  that they do jack said they are going to carry us the rest of the way  the cords which bound the prisoners hands were now cut and they were motioned to crawl into the cage this they did the bars were then put in their places and securely lashed four men went to the ends of the poles and lifted the cage upon their shoulders two others took their places beside it and one man apparently the leader of the party walked on ahead the rest remained behind  i never quite realized what a fowl felt in a coop before jack said but if its sensations are at all like mine they must be decidedly unpleasant it isnt high enough to sit upright in it is nothing like long enough to lie down and as to getting out one might as well think of flying do you know percy i dont think they mean taking us to canton at all i did not think of it before but from the direction of the sun i feel sure that we cannot have been going that way what they are up to i cant imagine  in an hour they came to a large village here the cage was set down and the villagers closed round they were however kept a short distance from the cage by the men in charge of it then a wooden platter was placed on the ground and persons throwing a few copper coins into this were allowed to come near the cage  they are making a show of us fothergill exclaimed thats what they are up to you see if it isnt they are going to travel up country to show the white devils whom their valor has captured  this was indeed the purpose of the pirates at that time europeans seldom ventured beyond the limits assigned to them in the two or three towns where they were permitted to trade and few indeed of the country people had ever obtained a sight of the white barbarians of whose doings they had so frequently heard consequently a small crowd soon gathered round the cage eyeing the captives with the same interest they would have felt as to unknown and dangerous beasts they laughed and joked passed remarks upon them and even poked them with sticks fothergill furious at this treatment caught one of the sticks and wrenching it from the hands of the chinaman tried to strike at him through the bars a proceeding which excited shouts of laughter from the bystanders  i think jack percy said it will be best to try and keep our tempers and not to seem to mind what they do to us then if they find they cant get any fun out of us they will soon leave us alone  of course thats the best plan fothergill agreed but its not so easy to follow that fellow very nearly poked out my eye with his stick and no ones going to stand that if he can help it  it was some hours before the curiosity of the village was satisfied when all had paid who were likely to do so the guards broke up their circle and leaving two of their number at the cage to see that no actual harm was caused to their prisoners the rest went off to a refreshment house the place of the elders was now taken by the boys and children of the village who crowded round the cage prodded the prisoners with sticks and putting their hands through the bars pulled their ears and hair this amusement however was brought to an abrupt conclusion by fothergill suddenly seizing the wrist of a big boy and pulling his arm through the cage until his face was against the bars then he proceeded to punch him until the guard coming to his rescue poked fothergill with his stick until he released his hold  the punishment of their comrade excited neither anger nor resentment among the other boys who yelled with delight at his discomfiture but it made them more careful in approaching the cage and though they continued to poke the prisoners with sticks they did not venture again to thrust a hand through the bars at sunset the guards again came round lifted the cage and carried it into a shed a platter of dirty rice and a jug of water were put into the cage two of the men lighted their long pipes and sat down on guard beside it and the doors being closed the captives were left in peace  if this sort of thing is to go on as i suppose it is fothergill said the sooner they cut off our heads the better  it is very bad jack i am sore all over with those probes from their sharp sticks  i dont care for the pain percy so much as the humiliation of the thing to be stared at and poked at as if we were wild beasts by these curs when with half a dozen of our men we could send a hundred of them scampering i feel as if i could choke with rage  you had better try and eat some of this rice jack it is beastly but i dare say we shall get no more until tomorrow night and we must keep up our strength if we can at any rate the water is not bad thats a comfort  no thanks to them jack growled if there had been any bad water in the neighborhood they would have given it to us  for two weeks the sufferings of the prisoners continued their captors avoided towns where the authorities would probably at once have taken the prisoners out of their hands no one would have recognized the two captives as the midshipmen of the perseus their clothes were in ragstorn to pieces by the thrusts of the sharp pointed bamboos to which they had daily been subjectedthe bad food the cramped position and the misery which they suffered had worn both lads to skeletons their hair was matted with filth their faces begrimed with dirt percy was so weak that he felt he could not stand fothergill being three years older was less exhausted but he knew that he too could not support his sufferings for many days longer their bodies were covered with sores and try as they would they were able to catch only a few minutes sleep at a time so much did the bamboo bars hurt their wasted limbs  they seldom exchanged a word during the daytime suffering in silence the persecutions to which they were exposed but at night they talked over their homes and friends in england and their comrades on board ship seldom saying a word as to their present position they were now in a hilly country but had not the least idea of the direction in which it lay from canton or its distance from the coast  one evening jack said to his companion i think its nearly all over now percy the last two days we have made longer journeys and have not stopped at any of the smaller villages we passed through i fancy our guards must see that we cant last much longer and are taking us down to some town to hand us over to the authorities and get their reward for us  i hope it is so jack the sooner the better not that it makes much difference now to me for i do not think i can stand many more days of it  i am afraid i am tougher than you percy and shall take longer to kill so i hope with all my heart that i may be right and that they may be going to give us up to the authorities  the next evening they stopped at a large place and were subjected to the usual persecution this however was now less prolonged than during the early days of their captivity for they had now no longer strength or spirits to resent their treatment and as no fun was to be obtained from passive victims even the village boys soon ceased to find any amusement in tormenting them  when most of their visitors had left them an elderly chinaman approached the side of the cage he spoke to their guard and looked at them attentively for some minutes then he said in pigeon english you officer men  yes jack exclaimed starting at the sound of the english words the first they had heard spoken since their captivity yes we are officers of the perseus  me speeke english velly well the chinaman said me pilot man many years on canton river how you get here  we were attacking some piratical junks and landed to destroy the village where the people were firing on us we entered a place full of pirates and were knocked down and taken prisoners and carried away up the country that is six weeks ago and you see what we are now  pirate men velly bad the chinaman said plunder many junk on river and kill crew me muchee hate them  can you do anything for us jack asked you will be well rewarded if you could manage to get us free  the man shook his head  me no see what can do me stranger here come to stay with wifey people no do what me ask them english ships attack canton much fight and take town people all hate english bad country dis people in one village fight against another velly bad men here  how far is canton away jack asked could you not send down to tell the english we are here  fourteen days journey off the man said no see how can do anything  well jack said when you get back again to canton let our people know what has been the end of us we shall not last much longer  all light the man said will see what me can do muchee think tonight  and after saying a few words to the guards who had been regarding this conversation with an air of surprise the chinaman retired  the guards had for some time abandoned the precaution of sitting up at night by the cage convinced that their captives had no longer strength to attempt to break through its fastenings or to drag themselves many yards away if they could do so they therefore left it standing in the open and wrapping themselves in their thickly wadded coats for the nights were cold lay down by the side of the cage  the coolness of the nights had indeed assisted to keep the two prisoners alive during the day the sun was excessively hot and the crowd of visitors round the cage impeded the circulation of the air and added to their sufferings it was true that the cold at night frequently prevented them from sleeping but it acted as a tonic and braced them up  what did he mean about the villages attacking each other percy asked  i have heard jack replied that in some parts of china things are very much the same as they used to be in the highlands of scotland there is no law or order the different villages are like clans and wage war on each other sometimes the government sends a number of troops who put the thing down for a time chop off a good many heads and then march away and the whole work begins again as soon as their backs are turned  that night the uneasy slumber of the lads was disturbed by a sudden firing shouts and yells were heard and the firing redoubled the village is attacked jack said i noticed that like some other places we have come into lately there is a strong earthen wall round it with gates well there is one comfortit does not make much difference to us which side wins  the guards at the first alarm leaped to their feet caught up their matchlocks and ran to aid in the defense of the wall two minutes later a man ran up to the cage  all lightee he said just what me hopee  with his knife he cut the tough withes that held the bamboos in their places and pulled out three of the bars  come along he said no time to lose  jack scrambled out but in trying to stand upright gave a sharp exclamation of pain percy crawled out more slowly he tried to stand up but could not the chinaman caught him up and threw him on his shoulder  come along quickee he said to jack if takee village kill evely one he set off at a run jack followed as fast as he could groaning at every step from the pain the movement caused to his bruised body  they went to the side of the village opposite to that at which the attack was going on they met no one on the way the inhabitants having all rushed to the other side to repel the attack they stopped at a small gate in the wall the chinaman drew back the bolts and opened it and they passed out into the country for an hour they kept on by the end of that time jack could scarcely drag his limbs along the chinaman halted at length in a clump of trees surrounded by a thick undergrowth  allee safee here he said no searchee so far here food and he produced from a wallet a cold chicken and some boiled rice and unslung from his shoulder a gourd filled with cold tea  me go back now see what happen tomollow nightee come againbringee more food and without another word went off at a rapid pace  jack moistened his lips with the tea and then turned to his companion percy had not spoken a word since he had been released from the cage and had been insensible during the greater part of his journey jack poured some cold tea between his lips  cheer up percy old boy we are free now and with luck and that good fellows help we will work our way down to canton yet  i shall never get down there you may percy said feebly  oh nonsense you will pick up strength like a steam engine now here let me prop you against this tree thats better now drink a drop of this tea its like nectar after that filthy water we have been drinking now you will feel better now you must try and eat a little of this chicken and rice oh nonsense you have got to do it i am not going to let you give way when our trouble is just over think of your people at home percy and make an effort for their sakes good heavens now i think of it it must be christmas morning we were caught on the 2d and we have been just twentytwo days on show i am sure that it must be past twelve oclock and it is christmas day it is a good omen percy this food isnt like roast beef and plum pudding but its not to be despised i can tell you come fire away thats a good fellow  percy made an effort and ate a few mouthfuls of rice and chicken then he took another draught of tea and lay down and was almost immediately asleep  jack ate his food slowly and contentedly till he finished half the supply then he too lay down and after a short but hearty thanksgiving for his escape from a slow and lingering death he too fell off to sleep the sun was rising when he woke being aroused by a slight movement on the part of percy he opened his eyes and sat up  well percy how do you feel this morning he asked cheerily  i feel too weak to move percy replied languidly  oh you will be all right when you have sat up and eaten breakfast jack said here you are here is a wing for you and this rice is as white as snow and the tea is first rate i thought last night after i lay down that i heard a murmur of water so after we have had breakfast i will look about and see if i can find it we should feel like new men after a wash you look awful and i am sure i am just as bad  the thought of a wash inspirited percy far more than that of eating and he sat up and made a great effort to do justice to breakfast he succeeded much better than he had done the night before and jack although he pretended to grumble was satisfied with his companions progress and finished off the rest of the food then he set out to search for water he had not very far to go a tiny stream two feet wide and several inches deep ran through the wood from the higher ground after throwing himself down and taking a drink he hurried back to percy  it is all right percy i have found it we can wash to our hearts content think of that lad  percy could hardly stand but he made an effort and jack half carried him to the streamlet there the lads spent two hours first they bathed their heads and hands and then stripping lay down in the stream and allowed it to flow over them then they rubbed themselves with handfuls of leaves dipped in the water and when they at last put on their rags again felt like new men percy was able to walk back to the spot they had quitted with the assistance only of jacks arm the latter feeling that his breakfast had by no means appeased his hunger now started for a search through the wood and presently returned to percy laden with nuts and berries  the nuts are sure to be all right i expect the berries are too i have certainly seen some like them in native markets and i think it will be quite safe to risk it  the rest of the day was spent in picking nuts and eating them then they sat down and waited for the arrival of their friend he came two hours after nightfall with a wallet stored with provisions and told them that he had regained the village unobserved the attack had been repulsed but with severe loss to the defenders as well as the assailants two of their guards had been among the killed the others had made a great clamor over the escape of the prisoners and had made a close search throughout the village and immediately round it for they were convinced that their captives had not had the strength to go any distance he thought however that although they had professed the greatest indignation and had offered many threats as to the vengeance that government would take upon the village one of whose inhabitants at least must have aided in the evasion of the prisoners they would not trouble themselves any further in the matter they had already reaped a rich harvest from the exhibition and would divide among themselves the share of their late comrades nor was it at all improbable that if they were to report the matter to the authorities they would themselves get into serious trouble for not having handed over the prisoners immediately after their capture  for a fortnight the pilot nursed and fed the two midshipmen he had already provided them with native clothes so that if by chance any villagers should catch sight of them they would not recognize them as the escaped white men at the end of that time both the lads had almost recovered from the effects of their sufferings jack indeed had picked up from the first but percy for some days continued so weak and ill that jack had feared that he was going to have an attack of fever of some kind his companions cheery and hopeful chat did as much good for percy as the nourishing food with which their friend supplied them and at the end of the fortnight he declared that he felt sufficiently strong to attempt to make his way down to the coast  the pilot acted as their guide when they inquired about his wife he told them carelessly that she would remain with her kinsfolk and would travel on to canton and join him there when she found an opportunity the journey was accomplished at night by very short stages at first but by increasing distances as percy gained strength during the daytime the lads lay hid in woods or jungles while their companion went into the village and purchased food they struck the river many miles above canton and the pilot going down first to a village on its banks bargained for a boat to take him and two women down to the city  the lads went on board at night and took their places in the little cabin formed of bamboos and covered with mats in the stern of the boat and remained thus sheltered not only from the view of people in boats passing up or down the stream but from the eyes of their own boatmen  after two days journey down the river without incident they arrived off canton where the british fleet was still lying while negotiations for peace were being carried on with the authorities at pekin peeping out between the mats the lads caught sight of the english warships and knowing that there was now no danger they dashed out of the cabin to the surprise of the native boatmen and shouted and waved their arms to the distant ships  in ten minutes they were alongside the perseus when they were hailed as if restored from the dead the pilot was very handsomely rewarded by the english authorities for his kindness to the prisoners and was highly satisfied with the result of his proceedings which more than doubled the little capital with which he had retired from business jack fothergill and percy adcock declare that they have never since eaten chicken without thinking of their christmas fare on the morning of their escape from the hands of the chinese pirates  the end
