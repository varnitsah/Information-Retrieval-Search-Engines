90798101	captains all  by ww jacobs    the temptation of samuel burge  illustration the temptation of samuel burge  mr higgs jeweller sat in the small parlour behind his shop gazing hungrily at a suppertable which had been laid some time before  it was a quarter to ten by the small town clock on the mantelpiece and the jeweller rubbing his hands over the fire tried in vain to remember what etiquette had to say about starting a meal before the arrival of an expected guest  he must be coming by the last train after all sir said the housekeeper entering the room and glancing at the clock  i suppose these london gentlemen keep such late hours they dont understand us country folk wanting to get to bed in decent time  you must be wanting your supper sir  mr higgs sighed  i shall be glad of my supper he said slowly but i dare say our friend is hungrier still  travelling is hungry work  perhaps he is thinking over his words for the seventh day said the housekeeper solemnly  forgetting hunger and thirst and all our poor earthly feelings in the blessedness of his work  perhaps so assented the other whose own earthly feelings were particularly strong just at that moment  brother simpson used to forget all about mealtimes when he stayed here said the housekeeper clasping her hands  he used to sit by the window with his eyes halfclosed and shake his head at the smell from the kitchen and call it fleshpots of egypt  he said that if it wasnt for keeping up his strength for the work luscious bread and fair water was all he wanted  i expect brother burge will be a similar sort of man  brother clark wrote and told me that he only lives for the work said the jeweller with another glance at the clock  the chapel at clerkenwell is crowded to hear him  its a blessed favour and privilege to have such a selected instrument staying in the house  im curious to see him from what brother clark said i rather fancy that he was a little bit wild in his younger days  hallelujah exclaimed the housekeeper with fervour  i mean to think as hes seen the error of his ways she added sharply as her master looked up  there he is said the latter as the bell rang  the housekeeper went to the sidedoor and drawing back the bolt admitted the gentleman whose preaching had done so much for the small but select sect known as the seventh day primitive apostles  she came back into the room followed by a tall stout man whose upper lip and short stubby beard streaked with grey seemed a poor match for the beady eyes which lurked behind a pair of clumsy spectacles  brother samuel burge inquired the jeweller rising  the visitor nodded and regarding him with a smile charged with fraternal love took his hand in a huge grip and shook it fervently  i am glad to see you brother higgs he said regarding him fondly oh ow my eyes have yearned to be set upon you  oh ow my ears ave longed to hearken unto the words of your voice  he breathed thickly and taking a seat sat with his hands upon his knees looking at a fine piece of cold beef which the housekeeper had just placed upon the table  is brother clark well inquired the jeweller placing a chair for him at the table and taking up his carvingknife  dear brother clark is in excellent ealth i thank you said the other taking the proffered chair  oh what a man he is what a instrument for good  always stretching out them blessed hands of is to make one of the fallen a seventh day primitive  and success attends his efforts said the jeweller  success brother repeated mr burge eating rapidly and gesticulating with his knife  success aint no name for it  why since this day last week he has saved three pickpockets two salvationists one bigamist and a roman catholic  brother higgs murmured his admiration  you are also a power for good he said wistfully  brother clark tells me in his letter that your exhortations have been abundantly blessed  mr burge shook his head  a lot of it falls by the wayside he said modestly but some of it is an eyeopener to them as dont entirely shut their ears  only the day before yesterday i ad two jemmies and a dark lantern sent me with a letter saying as ow the owner had no further use for em  the jewellers eyes glistened with admiration not quite untinged with envy  have you expounded the word for long he inquired  six months replied the other  it come to me quite naturali was on the penitent bench on the saturday and the wednesday afterwards i preached as good a sermon as ever ive preached in my life  brother clark said it took is breath away  and hes a judge too said the admiring jeweller  now continued brother burge helping himself plentifully to pickled walnuts  now there aint standing room in our bethel when im expounding  people come to hear me from all partsold and youngrich and poorand the apostles that dont come early ave to stand outside and catch the crumbs i throw em through the winders  it is enough sighed brother higgs whose own audience was frequently content to be on the wrong side of the window it is enough to make a man vain  i struggle against it brother said mr burge passing his cup up for some more tea  i fight against it hard but once the evil one was almost too much for me and in spite of myself and knowing besides that it was a plot of is i nearly felt uplifted  brother higgs passing him some more beef pressed for details  he sent me two policemen replied the other scowling darkly at the meanness of the trick  one i might ave stood but two come to being pretty near too much for me  they sat under me while i gave em the word ot and strong and the feeling i had standing up there and telling policemen what they ought to do i shall never forget  but why should policemen make you proud asked his puzzled listener  mr burge looked puzzled in his turn  why hasnt brother clark told you about me he inquired  mr higgs shook his head  he sort ofsuggested thatthat you had been a little bit wild before you came to us he murmured apologetically  alittlebitwild repeated brother burge in horrified accents me a little bit wild  no doubt he exaggerated a little said the jeweller hurriedly  being such a good man himself no doubt things would seem wild to him that wouldnt to usto me i mean  a little bit wild said his visitor again  sam burge the converted burglar a little bit wild  well well  converted what shouted the jeweller halfrising from his chair  burglar said the other shortly  why i should think i know more about the inside o gaols than anybody in england ive pretty near killed three policemen besides breaking a gents leg and throwing a footman out of window and then brother clark goes and says ive been a little bit wild  i wonder what he would ave  but youyouve quite reformed now said the jeweller resuming his seat and making a great effort to hide his consternation  i ope so said mr burge with alarming humility but its an uncertain world and far be it from me to boast  thats why ive come here  mr higgs only halfcomprehending sat back gasping  if i can stand this pursued brother burge gesticulating wildly in the direction of the shop if i can stand being here with all these ere pretty little things to be ad for the trouble of picking of em up i can stand anything  tempt me i says to brother clark  put me in the way o temptation i says  let me see whether the evil one or me is the strongest let me ave a good old up and down with the powers o darkness and see who wins  mr higgs gripping the edge of the table with both hands gazed at this new michael in speechless consternation  i think i see his face now said brother burge with tender enthusiasm all in a glow it was and he patted me on the shoulder and says ill send you on a weeks mission to duncombe he says and you shall stop with brother higgs who as a shop full o cunning wrought vanities in silver and gold  but suppose said the jeweller finding his voice by a great effort suppose victory is not given unto you  it wont make any difference replied his visitor  brother clark promised that it shouldnt  if you fall brother he says well help you up again  when you are tired of sin come back to ustheres always a welcome  but began the dismayed jeweller  we can only do our best said brother burge the rest we must leave i ave girded my loins for the fray and taken much spiritual sustenance on the way down from this little hymnbook  mr higgs paid no heed  he sat marvelling over the fatuousness of brother clark and trying to think of ways and means out of the dilemma into which that gentlemans perverted enthusiasm had placed him  he wondered whether it would be possible to induce brother burge to sleep elsewhere by offering to bear his hotel expenses and at last after some hesitation broached the subject  what exclaimed the other pushing his plate from him and regarding him with great severity  go and sleep at a hotel  after brother clark has been and took all this trouble  why i wouldnt think of doing such a thing  brother clark has no right to expose you to such a trial said mr higgs with great warmth  i wonder what hed say if he eard you remarked mr burge sternly after his going and making all these arrangements for you to try and go and upset em  to ask me to shun the fight like a coward to ask me to go and hide in the rearranks in a hotel with everything locked up or a coffer pallis with nothing to steal  i should sleep far more comfortably if i knew that you were not undergoing this tremendous strain said the unhappy mr higgs and besides that if you did give way it would be a serious business for me thats what i want you to look at  i am afraid that ifif unhappily you did fall i couldnt prevent you  im sure you couldnt said the other cordially  thats the beauty of it thats when the evil ones whispers get louder and louder  why i could choke you between my finger and thumb  if unfortunately my fallen nature should be too strong for me dont interfere whatever you do  i mightnt be myself  mr higgs rose and faced him gasping  not evencall forthe policei suppose he jerked out  that would be interfering said brother burge coldly  the jeweller tried to think  it was past eleven  the housekeeper had gone to spend the night with an ailing sister and a furtive glance at brother burges small shifty eyes and fat unwholesome face was sufficient to deter him from leaving him alone with his property while he went to ask the police to give an eye to his house for the night  besides it was more than probable that mr burge would decline to allow such a proceeding  with a growing sense of his peril he resolved to try flattery  it was a great thing for the brethren to secure a man like you he said  i never thought theyd ha done it said mr burge frankly  ive ad all sorts trying to convert me crying over me and praying over me  i remember the first dear good man that called me a lorst lamb  he didnt say anything else for a month  so upset hazarded the jeweller  i broke his jor pore feller said brother burge a sad but withal indulgent smile lighting up his face at the vagaries of his former career  what time do you go to bed brother  any time said the other reluctantly  i suppose you are tired with your journey  mr burge assented and rising from his chair yawned loudly and stretched himself  in the small room with his huge arms raised he looked colossal  i suppose said the jeweller still seeking to reassure himself i suppose dear brother clark felt pretty certain of you else he wouldnt have sent you here  brother clark said what is a jewellers shop compared with a uman soul a priceless uman soul replied mr burge  what is a few gewgaws to decorate them that perish and make them vain when you come to consider the opportunity of such a trial and the good itll do and the draw itll beif i do winand testify to the congregation to that effect  why theres sermons for a lifetime in it  so there is said the jeweller trying to look cheerful  youve got a good face brother burge and youll do a lot of good by your preaching there is honesty written in every feature  mr burge turned and surveyed himself in the small pierglass  yes he said somewhat discontentedly i dont look enough like a burglar to suit some of em  some people are hard to please said the other warmly  mr burge started and eyed him thoughtfully and then as mr higgs after some hesitation walked into the shop to turn the gas out stood in the doorway watching him  a smothered sigh as he glanced round the shop bore witness to the state of his feelings  the jeweller hesitated again in the parlour and then handing brother burge his candle turned out the gas and led the way slowly upstairs to the room which had been prepared for the honoured visitor  he shook hands at the door and bade him an effusive goodnight his voice trembling despite himself as he expressed a hope that mr burge would sleep well  he added casually that he himself was a very light sleeper  tonight sleep of any kind was impossible  he had given up the front room to his guest and his own window looked out on an overgrown garden he sat trying to read with his ears alert for the slightest sound brother burge seemed to be a long time undressing  for half an hour after he had retired he could hear him moving restlessly about his room  twelve oclock struck from the tower of the parish church and was followed almost directly by the tall clock standing in the hall downstairs  scarcely had the sounds died away than a low moaning from the next room caused the affrighted jeweller to start from his chair and place his ear against the wall  two or three hollow groans came through the plaster followed by ejaculations which showed clearly that brother burge was at that moment engaged in a terrified combat with the powers of darkness to decide whether he should or should not rifle his hosts shop  his hands clenched and his ear pressed close to the wall the jeweller listened to a monologue which increased in interest with every word  i tell you i wont said the voice in the next room with a groan i wont  get thee behind meget theeno and dont shove me over to the door if you cant get behind me without doing that stay where you are yes i know its a fortune as well as what you do but it aint mine  the listener caught his breath painfully  diamond rings continued brother burge in a suffocating voice  stop it i tell you  no i wont just go and look at em  a series of groans which the jeweller noticed to his horror got weaker and weaker testified to the greatness of the temptation  he heard brother burge rise and then a succession of panting snarls seemed to indicate a fierce bodily encounter  i dontwant to look at em said brother burge in an exhausted voice whatsthe good oflooking at em  its like you you know diamonds are my weakness  what does it matter if he is asleep  whats my knife got to do with you  brother higgs reeled back and a mist passed before his eyes  he came to himself at the sound of a door opening and impelled with a vague idea of defending his property snatched up his candle and looked out on to the landing  the light fell on brother burge fully dressed and holding his boots in his hand  for a moment they gazed at each other in silence then the jeweller found his voice  i thought you were ill brother he faltered  an ugly scowl lit up the others features  dont you tell me any of your lies he said fiercely  youre watching me thats what youre doing  spying on me  i thought that you were being tempted confessed the trembling mr higgs  an expression of satisfaction which he strove to suppress appeared on mr burges face  so i was he said sternly  so i was but thats my business  i dont want your assistance i can fight my own battles  you go to bedim going to tell the congregation i won the fight singleanded  so you have brother said the other eagerly but its doing me good to see it  its a lesson to me a lesson to all of us the way you wrestled  i thought you was asleep growled brother burge turning back to his room and speaking over his shoulder  you get back to bed the fight aint half over yet  get back to bed and keep quiet  the door closed behind him and mr higgs still trembling regained his room and looked in agony at the clock  it was only halfpast twelve and the sun did not rise until six  he sat and shivered until a second instalment of groans in the next room brought him in desperation to his feet  brother burge was in the toils again and the jeweller despite his fears could not help realizing what a sensation the story of his temptation would create  brother burge was now going round and round his room like an animal in a cage and sounds as of a soul wrought almost beyond endurance smote upon the listeners quivering ear  then there was a long silence more alarming even than the noise of the conflict  had brother burge won and was he now sleeping the sleep of the righteous or mr higgs shivered and put his other ear to the wall  then he heard his guest move stealthily across the floor the boards creaked and the handle of the door turned  mr higgs started and with a sudden flash of courage born of anger and desperation seized a small brass poker from the fireplace and taking the candle in his other hand went out on to the landing again  brother burge was closing his door softly and his face when he turned it upon the jeweller was terrible in its wrath  his small eyes snapped with fury and his huge hands opened and shut convulsively  what agin he said in a low growl  after all i told you  mr higgs backed slowly as he advanced  no noise said mr burge in a dreadful whisper  one scream and ill what were you going to do with that poker  he took a stealthy step forward  ii began the jeweller  his voice failed him  burglars he mouthed downstairs  what said the other pausing  mr higgs threw truth to the winds i heard them in the shop he said recovering thats why i took up the poker  cant you hear them  mr burge listened for the fraction of a second  nonsense he said huskily  i heard them talking said the other recklessly  lets go down and call the police  call em from the winder said brother burge backing with some haste they might ave pistols or something and theyre ugly customers when theyre disturbed  he stood with strained face listening  here they come whispered the jeweller with a sudden movement of alarm  brother burge turned and bolting into his room clapped the door to and locked it  the jeweller stood dumbfounded on the landing then he heard the window go up and the voice of brother burge much strengthened by the religious exercises of the past six months bellowing lustily for the police  for a few seconds mr higgs stood listening and wondering what explanation he should give  still thinking he ran downstairs and throwing open the pantry window unlocked the door leading into the shop and scattered a few of his cherished possessions about the floor  by the time he had done this people were already beating upon the streetdoor and exchanging hurried remarks with mr burge at the window above  the jeweller shot back the bolts and halfadozen neighbours headed by the butcher opposite clad in his nightgown and armed with a cleaver burst into the passage  a constable came running up just as the pallid face of brother burge peered over the balusters  the constable went upstairs three at a time and twisting his hand in the exburglars neckcloth bore him backwards  ive got one he shouted  come up and hold him while i look round  the butcher was beside him in a moment brother burge struggling wildly called loudly upon the name of brother higgs  thats all right constable said the latter thats a friend of mine  friend o yours sir said the disappointed officer still holding him  the jeweller nodded  mr samuel burge the converted burglar he said mechanically  conver gasped the astonished constable  converted burglar here  he is a preacher now added mr higgs  preacher retorted the constable  why its as plain as a pikestaff confederates his part was to go down and let em in  mr burge raised a piteous outcry  i hope you may be forgiven for them words he cried piously  what time did you go up to bed pursued the constable  about halfpast eleven replied mr higgs  the other grunted with satisfaction  and hes fully dressed with his boots off he remarked  did you hear him go out of his room at all  he did go out said the jeweller truthfully but  i thought so said the constable turning to his prisoner with affectionate solicitude  now you come along o me  come quietly because itll be the best for you in the end  you wont get your skull split open then added the butcher toying with his cleaver  the jeweller hesitated  he had no desire to be left alone with mr burge again and a sense of humour which many years association with the primitive apostles had not quite eradicated strove for hearing  think of the sermon itll make he said encouragingly to the frantic mr burge think of the congregation  brother burge replied in language which he had not used in public since he had joined the apostles  the butcher and another man stood guard over him while the constable searched the premises and made all secure again then with a final appeal to mr higgs who was keeping in the background he was pitched to the policestation by the energetic constable and five zealous assistants  a diffidence natural in the circumstances prevented him from narrating the story of his temptation to the magistrates next morning and mr higgs was equally reticent  he was put back while the police communicated with london and in the meantime brother clark and a band of apostles flanked down to his support  on his second appearance before the magistrates he was confronted with his past and his past to the great astonishment of the brethren being free from all blemish with the solitary exception of fourteen days for stealing milkcans he was discharged with a caution  the disillusioned primitive apostles also gave him his freedom
