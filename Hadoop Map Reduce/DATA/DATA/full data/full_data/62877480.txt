62877480	under the greenwood tree or the mellstock quire a rural painting of the dutch school by thomas hardy   preface   this story of the mellstock quire and its old established westgallery musicians with some supplementary descriptions of similar officials in two on a tower a few crusted characters and other places is intended to be a fairly true picture at first hand of the personages ways and customs which were common among such orchestral bodies in the villages of fifty or sixty years ago  one is inclined to regret the displacement of these ecclesiastical bandsmen by an isolated organist often at first a barrelorganist or harmonium player and despite certain advantages in point of control and accomplishment which were no doubt secured by installing the single artist the change has tended to stultify the professed aims of the clergy its direct result being to curtail and extinguish the interest of parishioners in church doings  under the old plan from half a dozen to ten fullgrown players in addition to the numerous more or less grownup singers were officially occupied with the sunday routine and concerned in trying their best to make it an artistic outcome of the combined musical taste of the congregation  with a musical executive limited as it mostly is limited now to the parsons wife or daughter and the school children or to the schoolteacher and the children an important union of interests has disappeared  the zest of these bygone instrumentalists must have been keen and staying to take them as it did on foot every sunday after a toilsome week through all weathers to the church which often lay at a distance from their homes  they usually received so little in payment for their performances that their efforts were really a labour of love  in the parish i had in my mind when writing the present tale the gratuities received yearly by the musicians at christmas were somewhat as follows from the manorhouse ten shillings and a supper from the vicar ten shillings from the farmers five shillings each from each cottagehousehold one shilling amounting altogether to not more than ten shillings a head annuallyjust enough as an old executant told me to pay for their fiddlestrings repairs rosin and musicpaper which they mostly ruled themselves  their music in those days was all in their own manuscript copied in the evenings after work and their musicbooks were homebound  it was customary to inscribe a few jigs reels hornpipes and ballads in the same book by beginning it at the other end the insertions being continued from front and back till sacred and secular met together in the middle often with bizarre effect the words of some of the songs exhibiting that ancient and broad humour which our grandfathers and possibly grandmothers took delight in and is in these days unquotable  the aforesaid fiddlestrings rosin and musicpaper were supplied by a pedlar who travelled exclusively in such wares from parish to parish coming to each village about every six months  tales are told of the consternation once caused among the church fiddlers when on the occasion of their producing a new christmas anthem he did not come to time owing to being snowed up on the downs and the straits they were in through having to make shift with whipcord and twine for strings  he was generally a musician himself and sometimes a composer in a small way bringing his own new tunes and tempting each choir to adopt them for a consideration  some of these compositions which now lie before me with their repetitions of lines halflines and halfwords their fugues and their intermediate symphonies are good singing still though they would hardly be admitted into such hymnbooks as are popular in the churches of fashionable society at the present time  august 1896  under the greenwood tree was first brought out in the summer of 1872 in two volumes  the name of the story was originally intended to be more appropriately the mellstock quire and this has been appended as a sub title since the early editions it having been thought unadvisable to displace for it the title by which the book first became known  in rereading the narrative after a long interval there occurs the inevitable reflection that the realities out of which it was spun were material for another kind of study of this little group of church musicians than is found in the chapters here penned so lightly even so farcically and flippantly at times  but circumstances would have rendered any aim at a deeper more essential more transcendent handling unadvisable at the date of writing and the exhibition of the mellstock quire in the following pages must remain the only extant one except for the few glimpses of that perished band which i have given in verse elsewhere  t h april 1912     part the firstwinter   chapter i mellstocklane   to dwellers in a wood almost every species of tree has its voice as well as its feature  at the passing of the breeze the firtrees sob and moan no less distinctly than they rock the holly whistles as it battles with itself the ash hisses amid its quiverings the beech rustles while its flat boughs rise and fall  and winter which modifies the note of such trees as shed their leaves does not destroy its individuality  on a cold and starry christmaseve within living memory a man was passing up a lane towards mellstock cross in the darkness of a plantation that whispered thus distinctively to his intelligence  all the evidences of his nature were those afforded by the spirit of his footsteps which succeeded each other lightly and quickly and by the liveliness of his voice as he sang in a rural cadence        with the rose and the lily          and the daffodowndilly    the lads and the lasses asheepshearing go  the lonely lane he was following connected one of the hamlets of mellstock parish with upper mellstock and lewgate and to his eyes casually glancing upward the silver and blackstemmed birches with their characteristic tufts the pale grey boughs of beech the darkcreviced elm all appeared now as black and flat outlines upon the sky wherein the white stars twinkled so vehemently that their flickering seemed like the flapping of wings  within the woody pass at a level anything lower than the horizon all was dark as the grave  the copsewood forming the sides of the bower interlaced its branches so densely even at this season of the year that the draught from the northeast flew along the channel with scarcely an interruption from lateral breezes  after passing the plantation and reaching mellstock cross the white surface of the lane revealed itself between the dark hedgerows like a ribbon jagged at the edges the irregularity being caused by temporary accumulations of leaves extending from the ditch on either side  the song many times interrupted by flitting thoughts which took the place of several bars and resumed at a point it would have reached had its continuity been unbroken now received a more palpable check in the shape of hoiiiii from the crossing lane to lower mellstock on the right of the singer who had just emerged from the trees  hoiiiii he answered stopping and looking round though with no idea of seeing anything more than imagination pictured  is that thee young dick dewy came from the darkness  ay sure michael mail  then why not stop for fellowcratersgoing to thy own fathers house too as we be and knowen us so well  dick dewy faced about and continued his tune in an underwhistle implying that the business of his mouth could not be checked at a moments notice by the placid emotion of friendship  having come more into the open he could now be seen rising against the sky his profile appearing on the light background like the portrait of a gentleman in black cardboard  it assumed the form of a lowcrowned hat an ordinaryshaped nose an ordinary chin an ordinary neck and ordinary shoulders  what he consisted of further down was invisible from lack of sky low enough to picture him on  shuffling halting irregular footsteps of various kinds were now heard coming up the hill and presently there emerged from the shade severally five men of different ages and gaits all of them working villagers of the parish of mellstock  they too had lost their rotundity with the daylight and advanced against the sky in flat outlines which suggested some processional design on greek or etruscan pottery  they represented the chief portion of mellstock parish choir  the first was a bowed and bent man who carried a fiddle under his arm and walked as if engaged in studying some subject connected with the surface of the road  he was michael mail the man who had hallooed to dick  the next was mr robert penny boot and shoemaker a little man who though rather roundshouldered walked as if that fact had not come to his own knowledge moving on with his back very hollow and his face fixed on the northeast quarter of the heavens before him so that his lower waistcoatbuttons came first and then the remainder of his figure  his features were invisible yet when he occasionally looked round two faint moons of light gleamed for an instant from the precincts of his eyes denoting that he wore spectacles of a circular form  the third was elias spinks who walked perpendicularly and dramatically the fourth outline was joseph bowmans who had now no distinctive appearance beyond that of a human being  finally came a weak lathlike form trotting and stumbling along with one shoulder forward and his head inclined to the left his arms dangling nervelessly in the wind as if they were empty sleeves  this was thomas leaf  where be the boys said dick to this somewhat indifferentlymatched assembly  the eldest of the group michael mail cleared his throat from a great depth  we told them to keep back at home for a time thinken they wouldnt be wanted yet awhile and we could choose the tuens and so on  father and grandfather william have expected ye a little sooner  i have just been for a run round by ewelease stile and hollow hill to warm my feet  to be sure father did  to be sure a did expect usto taste the little barrel beyond compare that hes going to tap  od rabbit it all  never heard a word of it said mr penny gleams of delight appearing upon his spectacleglasses dick meanwhile singing parenthetically     the lads and the lasses asheepshearing go  neighbours theres time enough to drink a sight of drink now afore bedtime said mail  true truetime enough to get as drunk as lords replied bowman cheerfully  this opinion being taken as convincing they all advanced between the varying hedges and the trees dotting them here and there kicking their toes occasionally among the crumpled leaves  soon appeared glimmering indications of the few cottages forming the small hamlet of upper mellstock for which they were bound whilst the faint sound of church bells ringing a christmas peal could be heard floating over upon the breeze from the direction of longpuddle and weatherbury parishes on the other side of the hills  a little wicket admitted them to the garden and they proceeded up the path to dicks house    chapter ii the tranters   it was a long low cottage with a hipped roof of thatch having dormer windows breaking up into the eaves a chimney standing in the middle of the ridge and another at each end  the windowshutters were not yet closed and the fire and candlelight within radiated forth upon the thick bushes of box and laurestinus growing in clumps outside and upon the bare boughs of several codlintrees hanging about in various distorted shapes the result of early training as espaliers combined with careless climbing into their boughs in later years  the walls of the dwelling were for the most part covered with creepers though these were rather beaten back from the doorwaya feature which was worn and scratched by much passing in and out giving it by day the appearance of an old keyhole  light streamed through the cracks and joints of outbuildings a little way from the cottage a sight which nourished a fancy that the purpose of the erection must be rather to veil bright attractions than to shelter unsightly necessaries  the noise of a beetle and wedges and the splintering of wood was periodically heard from this direction and at some little distance further a steady regular munching and the occasional scurr of a rope betokened a stable and horses feeding within it  the choir stamped severally on the doorstone to shake from their boots any fragment of earth or leaf adhering thereto then entered the house and looked around to survey the condition of things  through the open doorway of a small inner room on the right hand of a character between pantry and cellar was dick dewys father reuben by vocation a tranter or irregular carrier  he was a stout florid man about forty years of age who surveyed people up and down when first making their acquaintance and generally smiled at the horizon or other distant object during conversations with friends walking about with a steady sway and turning out his toes very considerably  being now occupied in bending over a hogshead that stood in the pantry ready horsed for the process of broaching he did not take the trouble to turn or raise his eyes at the entry of his visitors well knowing by their footsteps that they were the expected old comrades  the main room on the left was decked with bunches of holly and other evergreens and from the middle of the beam bisecting the ceiling hung the mistletoe of a size out of all proportion to the room and extending so low that it became necessary for a fullgrown person to walk round it in passing or run the risk of entangling his hair  this apartment contained mrs dewy the tranters wife and the four remaining children susan jim bessy and charley graduating uniformly though at wide stages from the age of sixteen to that of four yearsthe eldest of the series being separated from dick the firstborn by a nearly equal interval  some circumstance had apparently caused much grief to charley just previous to the entry of the choir and he had absently taken down a small lookingglass holding it before his face to learn how the human countenance appeared when engaged in crying which survey led him to pause at the various points in each wail that were more than ordinarily striking for a thorough appreciation of the general effect  bessy was leaning against a chair and glancing under the plaits about the waist of the plaid frock she wore to notice the original unfaded pattern of the material as there preserved her face bearing an expression of regret that the brightness had passed away from the visible portions  mrs dewy sat in a brown settle by the side of the glowing wood fireso glowing that with a heedful compression of the lips she would now and then rise and put her hand upon the hams and flitches of bacon lining the chimney to reassure herself that they were not being broiled instead of smokeda misfortune that had been known to happen now and then at christmastime  hullo my sonnies here you be then said reuben dewy at length standing up and blowing forth a vehement gust of breath  how the blood do puff up in anybodys head to be sure astooping like that  i was just going out to gate to hark for ye  he then carefully began to wind a strip of brown paper round a brass tap he held in his hand  this in the cask here is a drop o the right sort tapping the cask tis a real drop o cordial from the best picked applessansoms stubbards fivecorners and suchlikeyou dmind the sort michael  michael nodded  and theres a sprinkling of they that grow down by the orchard railsstreaked onesrail apples we dcall em as tis by the rails they grow and not knowing the right name  the watercider from em is as good as most peoples best cider is  ay and of the same make too said bowman  it rained when we wrung it out and the water got into it folk will say  but tis ony an excuse  watered cider is too common among us  yes yes too common it is said spinks with an inward sigh whilst his eyes seemed to be looking at the case in an abstract form rather than at the scene before him  such poor liquor do make a mans throat feel very melancholyand is a disgrace to the name of stimmilent  come in come in and draw up to the fire never mind your shoes said mrs dewy seeing that all except dick had paused to wipe them upon the doormat  i am glad that youve stepped upalong at last and susan you run down to grammer kaytess and see if you can borrow some larger candles than these fourteens  tommy leaf dont ye be afeard  come and sit here in the settle  this was addressed to the young man before mentioned consisting chiefly of a human skeleton and a smockfrock who was very awkward in his movements apparently on account of having grown so very fast that before he had had time to get used to his height he was higher  heeheeay replied leaf letting his mouth continue to smile for some time after his mind had done smiling so that his teeth remained in view as the most conspicuous members of his body  here mr penny resumed mrs dewy you sit in this chair  and hows your daughter mrs brownjohn  well i suppose i must say pretty fair  he adjusted his spectacles a quarter of an inch to the right  but shell be worse before shes better a blieve  indeedpoor soul  and how many will that make in all four or five  five theyve buried three  yes five and she not much more than a maid yet  she do know the multiplication table onmistakable well however twas to be and none can gainsay it  mrs dewy resigned mr penny  wonder where your grandfather james is she inquired of one of the children  he said hed drop in tonight  out in fuelhouse with grandfather william said jimmy  now lets see what we can do was heard spoken about this time by the tranter in a private voice to the barrel beside which he had again established himself and was stooping to cut away the cork  reuben dont make such a mess o tapping that barrel as is mostly made in this house mrs dewy cried from the fireplace  id tap a hundred without wasting more than you do in one  such a squizzling and squirting job as tis in your hands  there he always was such a clumsy man indoors  ay ay i know youd tap a hundred beautiful anni know you would two hundred perhaps  but i cant promise  this is a old cask and the woods rotted away about the taphole  the husbird of a feller sam lawsonthat ever i should calln such now hes dead and gone poor hearttook me in completely upon the feat of buying this cask  reub says hea always used to call me plain reub poor old heartreub he said says he that there cask reub is as good as new yes good as new  tis a winehogshead the best portwine in the commonwealth have been in that there cask and you shall have en for ten shillens reuba said says hehes worth twenty ay fiveandtwenty if hes worth one and an iron hoop or two put round en among the wood ones will make en worth thirty shillens of any mans money if  i think i should have used the eyes that providence gave me to use afore i paid any ten shillens for a jimcrack winebarrel a saint is sinner enough not to be cheated  but tis like all your family was so easy to be deceived  thats as true as gospel of this member said reuben  mrs dewy began a smile at the answer then altering her lips and refolding them so that it was not a smile commenced smoothing little bessys hair the tranter having meanwhile suddenly become oblivious to conversation occupying himself in a deliberate cutting and arrangement of some more brown paper for the broaching operation  ah who can believe sellers said old michael mail in a carefullycautious voice by way of tidingover this critical point of affairs  no one at all said joseph bowman in the tone of a man fully agreeing with everybody  ay said mail in the tone of a man who did not agree with everybody as a rule though he did now i knowed a auctioneering feller oncea very friendly feller a was too  and so one hot day as i was walking down the front street o casterbridge jist below the kings arms i passed a open winder and see him inside stuck upon his perch aselling off  i jist nodded to en in a friendly way as i passed and went my way and thought no more about it  well next day as i was oilen my boots by fuelhouse door if a letter didnt come wi a bill charging me with a featherbed bolster and pillers that i had bid for at mr taylors sale  the slimfaced martel had knocked em down to me because i nodded to en in my friendly way and i had to pay for em too  now i hold that that was coming it very close reuben  twas close theres no denying said the general voice  too close twas said reuben in the rear of the rest  and as to sam lawsonpoor heart now hes dead and gone tooill warrant that if so be ive spent one hour in making hoops for that barrel ive spent fifty first and last  thats one of my hoopstouching it with his elbowthats one of mine and that and that and all these  ah sam was a man said mr penny contemplatively  sam was said bowman  especially for a drap o drink said the tranter  good but not religiousgood suggested mr penny  the tranter nodded  having at last made the tap and hole quite ready now then suze bring a mug he said  heres luck to us my sonnies  the tap went in and the cider immediately squirted out in a horizontal shower over reubens hands knees and leggings and into the eyes and neck of charley who having temporarily put off his grief under pressure of more interesting proceedings was squatting down and blinking near his father  there tis again said mrs dewy  devil take the hole the cask and sam lawson too that good cider should be wasted like this exclaimed the tranter  your thumb  lend me your thumb michael  ram it in here michael  i must get a bigger tap my sonnies  idd it cold inthide te hole inquired charley of michael as he continued in a stooping posture with his thumb in the corkhole  what wonderful odds and ends that chiel has in his head to be sure mrs dewy admiringly exclaimed from the distance  i lay a wager that he thinks more about how tis inside that barrel than in all the other parts of the world put together  all persons present put on a speaking countenance of admiration for the cleverness alluded to in the midst of which reuben returned  the operation was then satisfactorily performed when michael arose and stretched his head to the extremest fraction of height that his body would allow of to restraighten his back and shouldersthrusting out his arms and twisting his features to a mass of wrinkles to emphasize the relief aquired  a quart or two of the beverage was then brought to table at which all the new arrivals reseated themselves with widespread knees their eyes meditatively seeking out any speck or knot in the board upon which the gaze might precipitate itself  whatever is father abiding out in fuelhouse so long for said the tranter  never such a man as father for two thingscleaving up old dead appletree wood and playing the bassviol  ad pass his life between the two that a would  he stepped to the door and opened it  father  ay rang thinly from round the corner  heres the barrel tapped and we all awaiting  a series of dull thuds that had been heard without for some time past now ceased and after the light of a lantern had passed the window and made wheeling rays upon the ceiling inside the eldest of the dewy family appeared    chapter iii the assembled quire   william dewyotherwise grandfather williamwas now about seventy yet an ardent vitality still preserved a warm and roughened bloom upon his face which reminded gardeners of the sunny side of a ripe ribstonepippin though a narrow strip of forehead that was protected from the weather by lying above the line of his hatbrim seemed to belong to some town man so gentlemanly was its whiteness  his was a humorous and kindly nature not unmixed with a frequent melancholy and he had a firm religious faith  but to his neighbours he had no character in particular  if they saw him pass by their windows when they had been bottling off old mead or when they had just been called longheaded men who might do anything in the world if they chose they thought concerning him ah theres that goodhearted manopen as a child  if they saw him just after losing a shilling or halfacrown or accidentally letting fall a piece of crockery they thought theres that poor weakminded man dewy again  ah hes never done much in the world either  if he passed when fortune neither smiled nor frowned on them they merely thought him old william dewy  ah soshere you beah michael and joseph and johnand you too leaf a merry christmas all  we shall have a rare logwood fire directly reub to reckon by the toughness of the job i had in cleaving em  as he spoke he threw down an armful of logs which fell in the chimneycorner with a rumble and looked at them with something of the admiring enmity he would have bestowed on living people who had been very obstinate in holding their own  come in grandfather james  old james grandfather on the maternal side had simply called as a visitor  he lived in a cottage by himself and many people considered him a miser some rather slovenly in his habits  he now came forward from behind grandfather william and his stooping figure formed a well illuminated picture as he passed towards the fireplace  being by trade a mason he wore a long linen apron reaching almost to his toes corduroy breeches and gaiters which together with his boots graduated in tints of whitishbrown by constant friction against lime and stone  he also wore a very stiff fustian coat having folds at the elbows and shoulders as unvarying in their arrangement as those in a pair of bellows the ridges and the projecting parts of the coat collectively exhibiting a shade different from that of the hollows which were lined with small ditchlike accumulations of stone and mortardust  the extremely large sidepockets sheltered beneath wide flaps bulged out convexly whether empty or full and as he was often engaged to work at buildings far awayhis breakfasts and dinners being eaten in a strange chimneycorner by a garden wall on a heap of stones or walking along the roadhe carried in these pockets a small tin canister of butter a small canister of sugar a small canister of tea a paper of salt and a paper of pepper the bread cheese and meat forming the substance of his meals hanging up behind him in his basket among the hammers and chisels  if a passerby looked hard at him when he was drawing forth any of these my buttery he said with a pinched smile  better try over number seventyeight before we start i suppose said william pointing to a heap of old christmascarol books on a side table  wi all my heart said the choir generally  number seventyeight was always a teaseralways  i can mind him ever since i was growing up a hard boychap  but hes a good tune and worth a mint o practice said michael  he is though ive been mad enough wi that tune at times to seize en and tear en all to linnit  ay hes a splendid carreltheres no denying that  the first line is well enough said mr spinks but when you come to o thou man you make a mess ot  well have another go into en and see what we can make of the martel halfanhours hammering at en will conquer the toughness of en ill warn it  od rabbit it all said mr penny interrupting with a flash of his spectacles and at the same time clawing at something in the depths of a large sidepocket  if so be i hadnt been as scatterbrained and thirtingill as a chiel i should have called at the schoolhouse wi a boot as i cam up along  whatever is coming to me i really cant estimate at all  the brain has its weaknesses murmured mr spinks waving his head ominously  mr spinks was considered to be a scholar having once kept a nightschool and always spoke up to that level  well i must call with en the first thing tomorrow  and ill empt my pocket o this last too if you dont mind mrs dewy  he drew forth a last and placed it on a table at his elbow  the eyes of three or four followed it  well said the shoemaker seeming to perceive that the interest the object had excited was greater than he had anticipated and warranted the lasts being taken up again and exhibited now whose foot do ye suppose this last was made for  it was made for geoffrey days father over at yalbury wood  ah manys the pair o boots heve had off the last  well when a died i used the last for geoffrey and have ever since though a little doctoring was wanted to make it do  yes a very queer natured last it is now a blieve he continued turning it over caressingly now you notice that there pointing to a lump of leather bradded to the toe thats a very bad bunion that heve had ever since a was a boy  now this remarkable large piece pointing to a patch nailed to the side shows a accident he received by the tread of a horse that squashed his foot amost to a pomace  the horseshoe cam fullbutt on this point you see  and so ive just been over to geoffreys to know if he wanted his bunion altered or made bigger in the new pair im making  during the latter part of this speech mr pennys left hand wandered towards the cidercup as if the hand had no connection with the person speaking and bringing his sentence to an abrupt close all but the extreme margin of the bootmakers face was eclipsed by the circular brim of the vessel  however i was going to say continued penny putting down the cup i ought to have called at the schoolhere he went groping again in the depths of his pocketto leave this without fail though i suppose the first thing tomorrow will do  he now drew forth and placed upon the table a bootsmall light and prettily shapedupon the heel of which he had been operating  the new schoolmistresss  ay no less miss fancy day as neat a little figure of fun as ever i see and just husbandhigh  never geoffreys daughter fancy said bowman as all glances present converged like wheelspokes upon the boot in the centre of them  yes sure resumed mr penny regarding the boot as if that alone were his auditor tis she thats come here schoolmistress  you knowed his daughter was in training  strange isnt it for her to be here christmas night master penny  yes but here she is a blieve  i know how she comes hereso i do chirruped one of the children  why dick inquired with subtle interest  pason maybold was afraid he couldnt manage us all tomorrow at the dinner and he talked o getting her jist to come over and help him hand about the plates and see we didnt make pigs of ourselves and thats what shes come for  and thats the boot then continued its mender imaginatively that shell walk to church in tomorrow morning  i dont care to mend boots i dont make but theres no knowing what it may lead to and her father always comes to me  there between the cidermug and the candle stood this interesting receptacle of the little unknowns foot and a very pretty boot it was  a character in factthe flexible bend at the instep the rounded localities of the small nestling toes scratches from careless scampers now forgottenall as repeated in the telltale leather evidencing a nature and a bias  dick surveyed it with a delicate feeling that he had no right to do so without having first asked the owner of the foots permission  now neighbours though no common eye can see it the shoemaker went on a man in the trade can see the likeness between this boot and that last although that is so deformed as hardly to recall one of gods creatures and this is one of as pretty a pair as youd get for tenand sixpence in casterbridge  to you nothing but tis fathers voot and daughters voot to me as plain as houses  i dont doubt theres a likeness master pennya mild likenessa fantastical likeness said spinks  but i hant got imagination enough to see it perhaps  mr penny adjusted his spectacles  now ill tell ye what happened to me once on this very point  you used to know johnson the dairyman william  ay sure i did  well twasnt opposite his house but a little lower downby his paddock in front o parkmaze pool  i was abearing across towards blooms end and lo and behold there was a man just brought out o the pool dead he had unrayed for a dip but not being able to pitch it just there had gone in flop over his head  men looked at en women looked at en children looked at en nobody knowed en  he was covered wi a sheet but i catched sight of his voot just showing out as they carried en along  i dont care what name that man went by i said in my way but hes john woodwards brother i can swear to the family voot  at that very moment up comes john woodward weeping and teaving ive lost my brother  ive lost my brother  only to think of that said mrs dewy  tis well enough to know this foot and that foot said mr spinks tis longheaded in fact as far as feet do go  i know little tis truei say no more but show me a mans foot and ill tell you that mans heart  you must be a cleverer feller then than mankind in jineral said the tranter  well thats nothing for me to speak of returned mr spinks  a man lives and learns  maybe ive read a leaf or two in my time  i dont wish to say anything large mind you but nevertheless maybe i have  yes i know said michael soothingly and all the parish knows that yeve read sommat of everything amost and have been a great filler of young folks brains  learnings a worthy thing and yeve got it master spinks  i make no boast though i may have read and thought a little and i knowit may be from much perusing but i make no boastthat by the time a mans head is finished tis almost time for him to creep underground i am over fortyfive  mr spinks emitted a look to signify that if his head was not finished nobodys head ever could be  talk of knowing people by their feet said reuben  rot me my sonnies then if i can tell what a man is from all his members put together oftentimes  but still look is a good deal observed grandfather william absently moving and balancing his head till the tip of grandfather jamess nose was exactly in a right line with williams eye and the mouth of a miniature cavern he was discerning in the fire  by the way he continued in a fresher voice and looking up that young crater the schoolmisess must be sung to tonight wi the rest  if her ear is as fine as her face we shall have enough to do to be upsides with her  what about her face said young dewy  well as to that mr spinks replied tis a face you can hardly gainsay  a very good pink face as far as that do go  still only a face when all is said and done  come come elias spinks say shes a pretty maid and have done wi her said the tranter again preparing to visit the ciderbarrel    chapter iv going the rounds   shortly after ten oclock the singingboys arrived at the tranters house which was invariably the place of meeting and preparations were made for the start  the older men and musicians wore thick coats with stiff perpendicular collars and coloured handkerchiefs wound round and round the neck till the end came to hand over all which they just showed their ears and noses like people looking over a wall  the remainder stalwart ruddy men and boys were dressed mainly in snowwhite smockfrocks embroidered upon the shoulders and breasts in ornamental forms of hearts diamonds and zigzags  the cidermug was emptied for the ninth time the musicbooks were arranged and the pieces finally decided upon  the boys in the meantime put the old hornlanterns in order cut candles into short lengths to fit the lanterns and a thin fleece of snow having fallen since the early part of the evening those who had no leggings went to the stable and wound wisps of hay round their ankles to keep the insidious flakes from the interior of their boots  mellstock was a parish of considerable acreage the hamlets composing it lying at a much greater distance from each other than is ordinarily the case  hence several hours were consumed in playing and singing within hearing of every family even if but a single air were bestowed on each there was lower mellstock the main village half a mile from this were the church and vicarage and a few other houses the spot being rather lonely now though in past centuries it had been the most thicklypopulated quarter of the parish  a mile northeast lay the hamlet of upper mellstock where the tranter lived and at other points knots of cottages besides solitary farmsteads and dairies  old william dewy with the violoncello played the bass his grandson dick the treble violin and reuben and michael mail the tenor and second violins respectively  the singers consisted of four men and seven boys upon whom devolved the task of carrying and attending to the lanterns and holding the books open for the players  directly music was the theme old william ever and instinctively came to the front  now mind neighbours he said as they all went out one by one at the door he himself holding it ajar and regarding them with a critical face as they passed like a shepherd counting out his sheep  you two counter boys keep your ears open to michaels fingering and dont ye go straying into the treble part along o dick and his set as ye did last year and mind this especially when we be in arise and hail  billy chimlen dont you sing quite so raving mad as you fain would and all o ye whatever ye do keep from making a great scuffle on the ground when we go in at peoples gates but go quietly so as to strike up all of a sudden like spirits  farmer ledlows first  farmer ledlows first the rest as usual  and voss said the tranter terminatively you keep house here till about halfpast two then heat the metheglin and cider in the warmer youll find turned up upon the copper and bring it wi the victuals to churchhatch as thst know        just before the clock struck twelve they lighted the lanterns and started  the moon in her third quarter had risen since the snowstorm but the dense accumulation of snowcloud weakened her power to a faint twilight which was rather pervasive of the landscape than traceable to the sky  the breeze had gone down and the rustle of their feet and tones of their speech echoed with an alert rebound from every post boundarystone and ancient wall they passed even where the distance of the echos origin was less than a few yards  beyond their own slight noises nothing was to be heard save the occasional bark of foxes in the direction of yalbury wood or the brush of a rabbit among the grass now and then as it scampered out of their way  most of the outlying homesteads and hamlets had been visited by about two oclock they then passed across the outskirts of a wooded park toward the main village nobody being at home at the manor  pursuing no recognized track great care was necessary in walking lest their faces should come in contact with the lowhanging boughs of the old limetrees which in many spots formed dense overgrowths of interlaced branches  times have changed from the times they used to be said mail regarding nobody can tell what interesting old panoramas with an inward eye and letting his outward glance rest on the ground because it was as convenient a position as any  people dont care much about us now  ive been thinking we must be almost the last left in the county of the old string players  barrelorgans and the things next door to em that you blow wi your foot have come in terribly of late years  ay said bowman shaking his head and old william on seeing him did the same thing  mores the pity replied another  time waslong and merry ago nowwhen not one of the varmits was to be heard of but it served some of the quires right  they should have stuck to strings as we did and kept out clarinets and done away with serpents  if youd thrive in musical religion stick to strings says i  strings be safe soullifters as far as that do go said mr spinks  yet theres worse things than serpents said mr penny  old things pass away tis true but a serpent was a good old note a deep rich note was the serpent  clarnets however be bad at all times said michael mail  one christmasyears agone now yearsi went the rounds wi the weatherbury quire  twas a hard frosty night and the keys of all the clarnets frozeah they did freezeso that twas like drawing a cork every time a key was opened and the players o em had to go into a hedgerandditchers chimleycorner and thaw their clarnets every now and then  an icicle o spet hung down from the end of every mans clarnet a span long and as to fingerswell there if yell believe me we had no fingers at all to our knowing  i can well bring back to my mind said mr penny what i said to poor joseph ryme who took the treble part in chalknewton church for twoand forty year when they thought of having clarnets there  joseph i said says i depend upont if so be you have them tooting clarnets youll spoil the whole setout  clarnets were not made for the service of the lard you can see it by looking at em i said  and what came ot  why souls the parson set up a barrelorgan on his own account within two years o the time i spoke and the old quire went to nothing  as far as look is concerned said the tranter i dont for my part see that a fiddle is much nearer heaven than a clarnet  tis further off theres always a rakish scampish twist about a fiddles looks that seems to say the wicked one had a hand in making oen while angels be supposed to play clarnets in heaven or somat like em if ye may believe picters  robert penny you was in the right broke in the eldest dewy  they should ha stuck to strings  your brassman is a rafting dogwell and good your reedman is a dab at stirring yewell and good your drumman is a rare bowelshakergood again  but i dont care who hears me say it nothing will spak to your heart wi the sweetness o the man of strings  strings for ever said little jimmy  strings alone would have held their ground against all the new comers in creation  true true said bowman  but clarinets was death death they was said mr penny  and harmonions william continued in a louder voice and getting excited by these signs of approval harmonions and barrelorgans  ah and groans from spinks be miserablewhat shall i call emmiserable  sinners suggested jimmy who made large strides like the men and did not lag behind like the other little boys  miserable dumbledores  right william and so they bemiserable dumbledores said the choir with unanimity  by this time they were crossing to a gate in the direction of the school which standing on a slight eminence at the junction of three ways now rose in unvarying and dark flatness against the sky  the instruments were retuned and all the band entered the school enclosure enjoined by old william to keep upon the grass  number seventyeight he softly gave out as they formed round in a semicircle the boys opening the lanterns to get a clearer light and directing their rays on the books  then passed forth into the quiet night an ancient and timeworn hymn embodying a quaint christianity in words orally transmitted from father to son through several generations down to the present characters who sang them out right earnestly     remember adams fall       o thou man    remember adams fall       from heaven to hell    remember adams fall    how he hath condemnd all    in hell perpetual       there for to dwell     remember gods goodnesse       o thou man    remember gods goodnesse       his promise made    remember gods goodnesse    he sent his son sinlesse    our ails for to redress       be not afraid     in bethlehem he was born       o thou man    in bethlehem he was born       for mankinds sake    in bethlehem he was born    christmasday i the morn    our saviour thought no scorn       our faults to take     give thanks to god alway       o thou man    give thanks to god alway       with heartmost joy    give thanks to god alway    on this our joyful day    let all men sing and say       holy holy  having concluded the last note they listened for a minute or two but found that no sound issued from the schoolhouse  four breaths and then o what unbounded goodness number fiftynine said william  this was duly gone through and no notice whatever seemed to be taken of the performance  good guide us surely tisnt a empty house as befell us in the year thirtynine and fortythree said old dewy  perhaps shes jist come from some musical city and sneers at our doings the tranter whispered  od rabbit her said mr penny with an annihilating look at a corner of the school chimney i dont quite stomach her if this is it  your plain music well done is as worthy as your other sort done bad a blieve souls so say i  four breaths and then the last said the leader authoritatively rejoice ye tenants of the earth number sixtyfour  at the close waiting yet another minute he said in a clear loud voice as he had said in the village at that hour and season for the previous forty yearsa merry christmas to ye    chapter v the listeners   when the expectant stillness consequent upon the exclamation had nearly died out of them all an increasing light made itself visible in one of the windows of the upper floor  it came so close to the blind that the exact position of the flame could be perceived from the outside remaining steady for an instant the blind went upward from before it revealing to thirty concentrated eyes a young girl framed as a picture by the window architrave and unconsciously illuminating her countenance to a vivid brightness by a candle she held in her left hand close to her face her right hand being extended to the side of the window  she was wrapped in a white robe of some kind whilst down her shoulders fell a twining profusion of marvellously rich hair in a wild disorder which proclaimed it to be only during the invisible hours of the night that such a condition was discoverable  her bright eyes were looking into the grey world outside with an uncertain expression oscillating between courage and shyness which as she recognized the semicircular group of dark forms gathered before her transformed itself into pleasant resolution  opening the window she said lightly and warmlythank you singers thank you  together went the window quickly and quietly and the blind started downward on its return to its place  her fair forehead and eyes vanished her little mouth her neck and shoulders all of her  then the spot of candlelight shone nebulously as before then it moved away  how pretty exclaimed dick dewy  if shed been rale wexwork she couldnt ha been comelier said michael mail  as near a thing to a spiritual vision as ever i wish to see said tranter dewy  o sich i never never see said leaf fervently  all the rest after clearing their throats and adjusting their hats agreed that such a sight was worth singing for  now to farmer shiners and then replenish our insides father said the tranter  wi all my heart said old william shouldering his bassviol  farmer shiners was a queer lump of a house standing at the corner of a lane that ran into the principal thoroughfare  the upper windows were much wider than they were high and this feature together with a broad baywindow where the door might have been expected gave it by day the aspect of a human countenance turned askance and wearing a sly and wicked leer  tonight nothing was visible but the outline of the roof upon the sky  the front of this building was reached and the preliminaries arranged as usual  four breaths and number thirtytwo behold the morning star said old william  they had reached the end of the second verse and the fiddlers were doing the up bowstroke previously to pouring forth the opening chord of the third verse when without a light appearing or any signal being given a roaring voice exclaimed  shut up woll ee  dont make your blaring row here  a feller wi a headache enough to split his skull likes a quiet night  slam went the window  hullo thats a ugly blow for we said the tranter in a keenly appreciative voice and turning to his companions  finish the carrel all who be friends of harmony commanded old william and they continued to the end  four breaths and number nineteen said william firmly  give it him well the quire cant be insulted in this manner  a light now flashed into existence the window opened and the farmer stood revealed as one in a terrific passion  drown endrown en the tranter cried fiddling frantically  play fortissimy and drown his spaking  fortissimy said michael mail and the music and singing waxed so loud that it was impossible to know what mr shiner had said was saying or was about to say but wildly flinging his arms and body about in the forms of capital xs and ys he appeared to utter enough invectives to consign the whole parish to perdition  very onseemlyvery said old william as they retired  never such a dreadful scene in the whole round o my carrel practicenever  and he a churchwarden  only a drap o drink got into his head said the tranter  mans well enough when hes in his religious frame  hes in his worldly frame now must ask en to our bit of a party tomorrow night i suppose and so put en in humour again  we bear no mortal man illwill  they now crossed mellstock bridge and went along an embowered path beside the froom towards the church and vicarage meeting voss with the hot mead and breadandcheese as they were approaching the churchyard this determined them to eat and drink before proceeding further and they entered the church and ascended to the gallery  the lanterns were opened and the whole body sat round against the walls on benches and whatever else was available and made a hearty meal  in the pauses of conversation there could be heard through the floor overhead a little world of undertones and creaks from the halting clockwork which never spread further than the tower they were born in and raised in the more meditative minds a fancy that here lay the direct pathway of time  having done eating and drinking they again tuned the instruments and once more the party emerged into the night air  wheres dick said old dewy  every man looked round upon every other man as if dick might have been transmuted into one or the other and then they said they didnt know  well now thats what i call very nasty of master dicky that i do said michael mail  heve clinked off homealong depend upont another suggested though not quite believing that he had  dick exclaimed the tranter and his voice rolled sonorously forth among the yews  he suspended his muscles rigid as stone whilst listening for an answer and finding he listened in vain turned to the assemblage  the treble man too  now if hed been a tenor or counter chap we might ha contrived the rest ot without en you see  but for a quire to lose the treble why my sonnies you may so well lose your      the tranter paused unable to mention an image vast enough for the occasion  your head at once suggested mr penny  the tranter moved a pace as if it were puerile of people to complete sentences when there were more pressing things to be done  was ever heard such a thing as a young man leaving his work half done and turning tail like this  never replied bowman in a tone signifying that he was the last man in the world to wish to withhold the formal finish required of him  i hope no fatal tragedy has overtook the lad said his grandfather  o no replied tranter dewy placidly  wonder where hes put that there fiddle of his  why that fiddle cost thirty shillings and good words besides  somewhere in the damp without doubt that instrument will be unglued and spoilt in ten minutesten ay two  what in the name o righteousness can have happened said old william more uneasily  perhaps hes drownded  leaving their lanterns and instruments in the belfry they retraced their steps along the waterside track  a strapping lad like dick dknow better than let anything happen onawares reuben remarked  theres sure to be some poor little scram reason fort staring us in the face all the while  he lowered his voice to a mysterious tone neighbours have ye noticed any sign of a scornful woman in his head or suchlike  not a glimmer of such a body  hes as clear as water yet  and dicky said he should never marry cried jimmy but live at home always along wi mother and we  ay ay my sonny every lad has said that in his time  they had now again reached the precincts of mr shiners but hearing nobody in that direction one or two went across to the schoolhouse  a light was still burning in the bedroom and though the blind was down the window had been slightly opened as if to admit the distant notes of the carollers to the ears of the occupant of the room  opposite the window leaning motionless against a beech tree was the lost man his arms folded his head thrown back his eyes fixed upon the illuminated lattice  why dick is that thee  what bst doing here  dicks body instantly flew into a more rational attitude and his head was seen to turn east and west in the gloom as if endeavouring to discern some proper answer to that question and at last he said in rather feeble accentsnothing father  thst take long enough time about it then upon my body said the tranter as they all turned anew towards the vicarage  i thought you hadnt done having snap in the gallery said dick  why weve been traypsing and rambling about looking everywhere and thinking youd done fifty deathly things and here have you been at nothing at all  the stupidness lies in that point of it being nothing at all murmured mr spinks  the vicarage front was their next field of operation and mr maybold the latelyarrived incumbent duly received his share of the nights harmonies  it was hoped that by reason of his profession he would have been led to open the window and an extra carol in quick time was added to draw him forth  but mr maybold made no stir  a bad sign said old william shaking his head  however at that same instant a musical voice was heard exclaiming from inner depths of bedclothesthanks villagers  what did he say asked bowman who was rather dull of hearing  bowmans voice being therefore loud had been heard by the vicar within  i said thanks villagers cried the vicar again  oh we didnt hear ee the first time cried bowman  now dont for heavens sake spoil the young mans temper by answering like that said the tranter  you wont do that my friends the vicar shouted  well to be sure what ears said mr penny in a whisper  beats any horse or dog in the parish and depend upont thats a sign hes a proper clever chap  we shall see that in time said the tranter  old william in his gratitude for such thanks from a comparatively new inhabitant was anxious to play all the tunes over again but renounced his desire on being reminded by reuben that it would be best to leave well alone  now putting two and two together the tranter continued as they went their way over the hill and across to the last remaining houses that is in the form of that young female vision we zeed just now and this young tenorvoiced parson my belief is shell wind en round her finger and twist the pore young feller about like the figure of 8that she will so my sonnies    chapter vi christmas morning   the choir at last reached their beds and slept like the rest of the parish  dicks slumbers through the three or four hours remaining for rest were disturbed and slight an exhaustive variation upon the incidents that had passed that night in connection with the schoolwindow going on in his brain every moment of the time  in the morning do what he wouldgo upstairs downstairs out of doors speak of the wind and weather or what nothe could not refrain from an unceasing renewal in imagination of that interesting enactment  tilted on the edge of one foot he stood beside the fireplace watching his mother grilling rashers but there was nothing in grilling he thought unless the vision grilled  the limp rasher hung down between the bars of the gridiron like a cat in a childs arms but there was nothing in similes unless she uttered them  he looked at the daylight shadows of a yellow hue dancing with the firelight shadows in blue on the whitewashed chimney corner but there was nothing in shadows  perhaps the new young womschmiss fancy day will sing in church with us this morning he said  the tranter looked a long time before he replied i fancy she will and yet i fancy she wont  dick implied that such a remark was rather to be tolerated than admired though deliberateness in speech was known to have as a rule more to do with the machinery of the tranters throat than with the matter enunciated  they made preparations for going to church as usual dick with extreme alacrity though he would not definitely consider why he was so religious  his wonderful nicety in brushing and cleaning his best light boots had features which elevated it to the rank of an art  every particle and speck of last weeks mud was scraped and brushed from toe and heel new blacking from the packet was carefully mixed and made use of regardless of expense  a coat was laid on and polished then another coat for increased blackness and lastly a third to give the perfect and mirrorlike jet which the hopedfor rencounter demanded  it being christmasday the tranter prepared himself with sunday particularity  loud sousing and snorting noises were heard to proceed from a tub in the back quarters of the dwelling proclaiming that he was there performing his great sunday wash lasting halfanhour to which his washings on workingday mornings were mere flashes in the pan vanishing into the outhouse with a large brown towel and the abovenamed bubblings and snortings being carried on for about twenty minutes the tranter would appear round the edge of the door smelling like a summer fog and looking as if he had just narrowly escaped a watery grave with the loss of much of his clothes having since been weeping bitterly till his eyes were red a crystal drop of water hanging ornamentally at the bottom of each ear one at the tip of his nose and others in the form of spangles about his hair  after a great deal of crunching upon the sanded stone floor by the feet of father son and grandson as they moved to and fro in these preparations the bassviol and fiddles were taken from their nook and the strings examined and screwed a little above concertpitch that they might keep their tone when the service began to obviate the awkward contingency of having to retune them at the back of the gallery during a cough sneeze or amenan inconvenience which had been known to arise in damp wintry weather  the three left the door and paced down mellstocklane and across the ewe lease bearing under their arms the instruments in faded greenbaize bags and old brown musicbooks in their hands dick continually finding himself in advance of the other two and the tranter moving on with toes turned outwards to an enormous angle  at the foot of an incline the church became visible through the north gate or church hatch as it was called here  seven agile figures in a clump were observable beyond which proved to be the choristers waiting sitting on an altartomb to pass the time and letting their heels dangle against it  the musicians being now in sight the youthful party scampered off and rattled up the old wooden stairs of the gallery like a regiment of cavalry the other boys of the parish waiting outside and observing birds cats and other creatures till the vicar entered when they suddenly subsided into sober churchgoers and passed down the aisle with echoing heels  the gallery of mellstock church had a status and sentiment of its own  a stranger there was regarded with a feeling altogether differing from that of the congregation below towards him  banished from the nave as an intruder whom no originality could make interesting he was received above as a curiosity that no unfitness could render dull  the gallery too looked down upon and knew the habits of the nave to its remotest peculiarity and had an extensive stock of exclusive information about it whilst the nave knew nothing of the gallery folk as gallery folk beyond their loudsounding minims and chest notes  such topics as that the clerk was always chewing tobacco except at the moment of crying amen that he had a dusthole in his pew that during the sermon certain young daughters of the village had left off caring to read anything so mild as the marriage service for some years and now regularly studied the one which chronologically follows it that a pair of lovers touched fingers through a knothole between their pews in the manner ordained by their great exemplars pyramus and thisbe that mrs ledlow the farmers wife counted her money and reckoned her weeks marketing expenses during the first lessonall news to those belowwere stale subjects here  old william sat in the centre of the front row his violoncello between his knees and two singers on each hand  behind him on the left came the treble singers and dick and on the right the tranter and the tenors farther back was old mail with the altos and supernumeraries  but before they had taken their places and whilst they were standing in a circle at the back of the gallery practising a psalm or two dick cast his eyes over his grandfathers shoulder and saw the vision of the past night enter the porchdoor as methodically as if she had never been a vision at all  a new atmosphere seemed suddenly to be puffed into the ancient edifice by her movement which made dicks body and soul tingle with novel sensations  directed by shiner the churchwarden she proceeded to the small aisle on the north side of the chancel a spot now allotted to a throng of sundayschool girls and distinctly visible from the galleryfront by looking under the curve of the furthermost arch on that side  before this moment the church had seemed comparatively emptynow it was thronged and as miss fancy rose from her knees and looked around her for a permanent place in which to deposit herselffinally choosing the remotest cornerdick began to breathe more freely the warm new air she had brought with her to feel rushings of blood and to have impressions that there was a tie between her and himself visible to all the congregation  ever afterwards the young man could recollect individually each part of the service of that bright christmas morning and the trifling occurrences which took place as its minutes slowly drew along the duties of that day dividing themselves by a complete line from the services of other times  the tunes they that morning essayed remained with him for years apart from all others also the text also the appearance of the layer of dust upon the capitals of the piers that the hollybough in the chancel archway was hung a little out of the centreall the ideas in short that creep into the mind when reason is only exercising its lowest activity through the eye  by chance or by fate another young man who attended mellstock church on that christmas morning had towards the end of the service the same instinctive perception of an interesting presence in the shape of the same bright maiden though his emotion reached a far less developed stage  and there was this difference too that the person in question was surprised at his condition and sedulously endeavoured to reduce himself to his normal state of mind  he was the young vicar mr maybold  the music on christmas mornings was frequently below the standard of churchperformances at other times  the boys were sleepy from the heavy exertions of the night the men were slightly wearied and now in addition to these constant reasons there was a dampness in the atmosphere that still further aggravated the evil  their strings from the recent long exposure to the night air rose whole semitones and snapped with a loud twang at the most silent moment which necessitated more retiring than ever to the back of the gallery and made the gallery throats quite husky with the quantity of coughing and hemming required for tuning in  the vicar looked cross  when the singing was in progress there was suddenly discovered to be a strong and shrill reinforcement from some point ultimately found to be the schoolgirls aisle  at every attempt it grew bolder and more distinct  at the third time of singing these intrusive feminine voices were as mighty as those of the regular singers in fact the flood of sound from this quarter assumed such an individuality that it had a time a key almost a tune of its own surging upwards when the gallery plunged downwards and the reverse  now this had never happened before within the memory of man  the girls like the rest of the congregation had always been humble and respectful followers of the gallery singing at sixes and sevens if without gallery leaders never interfering with the ordinances of these practised artistshaving no will union power or proclivity except it was given them from the established choir enthroned above them  a good deal of desperation became noticeable in the gallery throats and strings which continued throughout the musical portion of the service directly the fiddles were laid down mr pennys spectacles put in their sheath and the text had been given out an indignant whispering began  did ye hear that souls mr penny said in a groaning breath  brazenfaced hussies said bowman  true why they were every note as loud as we fiddles and all if not louder  fiddles and all echoed bowman bitterly  shall anything saucier be found than united ooman mr spinks murmured  what i want to know is said the tranter as if he knew already but that civilization required the form of words what business people have to tell maidens to sing like that when they dont sit in a gallery and never have entered one in their lives  thats the question my sonnies  tis the gallery have got to sing all the world knows said mr penny why souls whats the use o the ancients spending scores of pounds to build galleries if people down in the lowest depths of the church sing like that at a moments notice  really i think we useless ones had better march out of church fiddles and all said mr spinks with a laugh which to a stranger would have sounded mild and real  only the initiated body of men he addressed could understand the horrible bitterness of irony that lurked under the quiet words useless ones and the ghastliness of the laughter apparently so natural  never mind  let em sing tootwill make it all the louderhee hee said leaf  thomas leaf thomas leaf  where have you lived all your life said grandfather william sternly  the quailing leaf tried to look as if he had lived nowhere at all  when alls said and done my sonnies reuben said thered have been no real harm in their singing if they had let nobody hear em and only jined in now and then  none at all said mr penny  but though i dont wish to accuse people wrongfully id say before my lord judge that i could hear every note o that last psalm come from em as much as from usevery note as if twas their own  know it ah i should think i did know it mr spinks was heard to observe at this moment without reference to his fellow playersshaking his head at some idea he seemed to see floating before him and smiling as if he were attending a funeral at the time  ah do i or dont i know it  no one said know what because all were aware from experience that what he knew would declare itself in process of time  i could fancy last night that we should have some trouble wi that young man said the tranter pending the continuance of spinkss speech and looking towards the unconscious mr maybold in the pulpit  i fancy said old william rather severely i fancy theres too much whispering going on to be of any spiritual use to gentle or simple  then folding his lips and concentrating his glance on the vicar he implied that none but the ignorant would speak again and accordingly there was silence in the gallery mr spinkss telling speech remaining for ever unspoken  dick had said nothing and the tranter little on this episode of the morning for mrs dewy at breakfast expressed it as her intention to invite the youthful leader of the culprits to the small party it was customary with them to have on christmas nighta piece of knowledge which had given a particular brightness to dicks reflections since he had received it  and in the tranters slightlycynical nature party feeling was weaker than in the other members of the choir though friendliness and faithful partnership still sustained in him a hearty earnestness on their account    chapter vii the tranters party   during the afternoon unusual activity was seen to prevail about the precincts of tranter dewys house  the flagstone floor was swept of dust and a sprinkling of the finest yellow sand from the innermost stratum of the adjoining sandpit lightly scattered thereupon  then were produced large knives and forks which had been shrouded in darkness and grease since the last occasion of the kind and bearing upon their sides shearsteel warranted in such emphatic letters of assurance that the warranters name was not required as further proof and not given  the key was left in the tap of the ciderbarrel instead of being carried in a pocket  and finally the tranter had to stand up in the room and let his wife wheel him round like a turnstile to see if anything discreditable was visible in his appearance  stand still till ive been for the scissors said mrs dewy  the tranter stood as still as a sentinel at the challenge  the only repairs necessary were a trimming of one or two whiskers that had extended beyond the general contour of the mass a like trimming of a slightlyfrayed edge visible on his shirtcollar and a final tug at a grey hairto all of which operations he submitted in resigned silence except the last which produced a mild come come ann by way of expostulation  really reuben tis quite a disgrace to see such a man said mrs dewy with the severity justifiable in a longtried companion giving him another turn round and picking several of smilers hairs from the shoulder of his coat  reubens thoughts seemed engaged elsewhere and he yawned  and the collar of your coat is a shame to beholdso plastered with dirt or dust or grease or something  why wherever could you have got it  tis my warm nater in summertime i suppose  i always did get in such a heat when i bustle about  ay the dewys always were such a coarseskinned family  theres your brother bob just as badas fat as a porpoisewi his low mean howst do ann whenever he meets me  id howst do him indeed  if the sun only shines out a minute there be you all streaming in the facei never see  if i be hot weekdays i must be hot sundays  if any of the girls should turn after their father twill be a bad look out for em poor things  none of my family were sich vulgar sweaters not one of em  but lordamercy the dewys  i dont know how ever i cam into such a family  your womans weakness when i asked ye to jine us  thats how it was i suppose  but the tranter appeared to have heard some such words from his wife before and hence his answer had not the energy it might have shown if the inquiry had possessed the charm of novelty  you never did look so well in a pair o trousers as in them she continued in the same unimpassioned voice so that the unfriendly criticism of the dewy family seemed to have been more normal than spontaneous  such a cheap pair as twas too  as big as any man could wish to have and lined inside and doublelined in the lower parts and an extra piece of stiffening at the bottom  and tis a nice high cut that comes up right under your armpits and theres enough turned down inside the seams to make half a pair more besides a piece of cloth left that will make an honest waistcoatall by my contriving in buying the stuff at a bargain and having it made up under my eye  it only shows what may be done by taking a little trouble and not going straight to the rascally tailors  the discourse was cut short by the sudden appearance of charley on the scene with a face and hands of hideous blackness and a nose like a guttering candle  why on that particularly cleanly afternoon he should have discovered that the chimneycrook and chain from which the hams were suspended should have possessed more merits and general interest as playthings than any other articles in the house is a question for nursing mothers to decide  however the humour seemed to lie in the result being as has been seen that any given player with these articles was in the longrun daubed with soot  the last that was seen of charley by daylight after this piece of ingenuity was when in the act of vanishing from his fathers presence round the corner of the houselooking back over his shoulder with an expression of great sin on his face like cain as the outcast in bible pictures        the guests had all assembled and the tranters party had reached that degree of development which accords with ten oclock pm in rural assemblies  at that hour the sound of a fiddle in process of tuning was heard from the inner pantry  thats dick said the tranter  that lads crazy for a jig  dick  now i cannotreally i cannot have any dancing at all till christmasday is out said old william emphatically  when the clock ha done striking twelve dance as much as ye like  well i must say theres reason in that william said mrs penny  if you do have a party on christmasnight tis only fair and honourable to the skyfolk to have it a sitstill party  jigging parties be all very well on the devils holidays but a jigging party looks suspicious now  o yes stop till the clock strikes young folkso say i  it happened that some warm mead accidentally got into mr spinkss head about this time  dancing he said is a most strengthening livening and courting movement specially with a little beverage added  and dancing is good but why disturb what is ordained richard and reuben and the company zhinerally  why i ask as far as that do go  then nothing till after twelve said william  though reuben and his wife ruled on social points religious questions were mostly disposed of by the old man whose firmness on this head quite counterbalanced a certain weakness in his handling of domestic matters the hopes of the younger members of the household were therefore relegated to a distance of one hour and threequartersa result that took visible shape in them by a remote and listless look about the eyesthe singing of songs being permitted in the interim  at five minutes to twelve the soft tuning was again heard in the back quarters and when at length the clock had whizzed forth the last stroke dick appeared ready primed and the instruments were boldly handled old william very readily taking the bassviol from its accustomed nail and touching the strings as irreligiously as could be desired  the countrydance called the triumph or follow my lover was the figure with which they opened  the tranter took for his partner mrs penny and mrs dewy was chosen by mr penny who made so much of his limited height by a judicious carriage of the head straightening of the back and important flashes of his spectacleglasses that he seemed almost as tall as the tranter  mr shiner age about thirtyfive farmer and churchwarden a character principally composed of a crimson stare vigorous breath and a watchchain with a mouth hanging on a dark smile but never smiling had come quite willingly to the party and showed a wondrous obliviousness of all his antics on the previous night  but the comely slender prettilydressed prize fancy day fell to dicks lot in spite of some private machinations of the farmer for the reason that mr shiner as a richer man had shown too much assurance in asking the favour whilst dick had been duly courteous  we gain a good view of our heroine as she advances to her place in the ladies line  she belonged to the taller division of middle height flexibility was her first characteristic by which she appeared to enjoy the most easeful rest when she was in gliding motion  her dark eyesarched by brows of so keen slender and soft a curve that they resembled nothing so much as two slurs in musicshowed primarily a bright sparkle each  this was softened by a frequent thoughtfulness yet not so frequent as to do away for more than a few minutes at a time with a certain coquettishness which in its turn was never so decided as to banish honesty  her lips imitated her brows in their clearlycut outline and softness of bend and her nose was well shapedwhich is saying a great deal when it is remembered that there are a hundred pretty mouths and eyes for one pretty nose  add to this plentiful knots of darkbrown hair a gauzy dress of white with blue facings and the slightest idea may be gained of the young maiden who showed amidst the rest of the dancingladies like a flower among vegetables  and so the dance proceeded  mr shiner according to the interesting rule laid down deserted his own partner and made off down the middle with this fair one of dicksthe pair appearing from the top of the room like two persons tripping down a lane to be married  dick trotted behind with what was intended to be a look of composure but which was in fact a rather silly expression of featureimplying with too much earnestness that such an elopement could not be tolerated  then they turned and came back when dick grew more rigid around his mouth and blushed with ingenuous ardour as he joined hands with the rival and formed the arch over his ladys head which presumably gave the figure its name relinquishing her again at setting to partners when mr shiners new chain quivered in every link and all the loose flesh upon the tranterwho here came into action againshook like jelly  mrs penny being always rather concerned for her personal safety when she danced with the tranter fixed her face to a chronic smile of timidity the whole time it lasteda peculiarity which filled her features with wrinkles and reduced her eyes to little straight lines like hyphens as she jigged up and down opposite him repeating in her own person not only his proper movements but also the minor flourishes which the richness of the tranters imagination led him to introduce from time to timean imitation which had about it something of slavish obedience not unmixed with fear  the earrings of the ladies now flung themselves wildly about turning violent summersaults banging this way and that and then swinging quietly against the ears sustaining them  mrs crumplera heavy woman who for some reason which nobody ever thought worth inquiry danced in a clean apronmoved so smoothly through the figure that her feet were never seen conveying to imaginative minds the idea that she rolled on castors  minute after minute glided by and the party reached the period when ladies backhair begins to look forgotten and dissipated when a perceptible dampness makes itself apparent upon the faces even of delicate girlsa ghastly dew having for some time rained from the features of their masculine partners when skirts begin to be torn out of their gathers when elderly people who have stood up to please their juniors begin to feel sundry small tremblings in the region of the knees and to wish the interminable dance was at jericho when at country parties of the thorough sort waistcoats begin to be unbuttoned and when the fiddlers chairs have been wriggled by the frantic bowing of their occupiers to a distance of about two feet from where they originally stood  fancy was dancing with mr shiner  dick knew that fancy by the law of good manners was bound to dance as pleasantly with one partner as with another yet he could not help suggesting to himself that she need not have put quite so much spirit into her steps nor smiled quite so frequently whilst in the farmers hands  im afraid you didnt cast off said dick mildly to mr shiner before the latter mans watchchain had done vibrating from a recent whirl  fancy made a motion of accepting the correction but her partner took no notice and proceeded with the next movement with an affectionate bend towards her  that shiners too fond of her the young man said to himself as he watched them  they came to the top again fancy smiling warmly towards her partner and went to their places  mr shiner you didnt cast off said dick for want of something else to demolish him with casting off himself and being put out at the farmers irregularity  perhaps i shant cast off for any man said mr shiner  i think you ought to sir  dicks partner a young lady of the name of lizzycalled lizz for shorttried to mollify  i cant say that i myself have much feeling for casting off she said  nor i said mrs penny following up the argument especially if a friend and neighbour is set against it  not but that tis a terrible tasty thing in good hands and well done yes indeed so say i  all i meant was said dick rather sorry that he had spoken correctingly to a guest that tis in the dance and a man has hardly any right to hack and mangle what was ordained by the regular dancemaker who i daresay got his living by making em and thought of nothing else all his life  i dont like casting off then very well i cast off for no dancemaker that ever lived  dick now appeared to be doing mental arithmetic the act being really an effort to present to himself in an abstract form how far an argument with a formidable rival ought to be carried when that rival was his mothers guest  the deadlock was put an end to by the stamping arrival up the middle of the tranter who despising minutiae on principle started a theme of his own  i assure you neighbours he said the heat of my frame no tongue can tell  he looked around and endeavoured to give by a forcible gaze of selfsympathy some faint idea of the truth  mrs dewy formed one of the next couple  yes she said in an auxiliary tone reuben always was such a hot man  mrs penny implied the species of sympathy that such a class of affliction required by trying to smile and to look grieved at the same time  if he only walk round the garden of a sunday morning his shirtcollar is as limp as no starch at all continued mrs dewy her countenance lapsing parenthetically into a housewifely expression of concern at the reminiscence  come come you womenfolk tis hands acrosscome come said the tranter and the conversation ceased for the present    chapter viii they dance more wildly   dick had at length secured fancy for that most delightful of countrydances opening with sixhandsround  before we begin said the tranter my proposal is that twould be a right and proper plan for every mortal man in the dance to pull off his jacket considering the heat  such low notions as you have reuben  nothing but strip will go down with you when you are adancing  such a hot man as he is  well now look here my sonnies he argued to his wife whom he often addressed in the plural masculine for economy of epithet merely i dont see that  you dance and get hot as fire therefore you lighten your clothes  isnt that nature and reason for gentle and simple  if i strip by myself and not necessary tis rather pothousey i own but if we stout chaps strip one and all why tis the native manners of the country which no man can gainsay  heywhat did you say my sonnies  strip we will said the three other heavy men who were in the dance and their coats were accordingly taken off and hung in the passage whence the four sufferers from heat soon reappeared marching in close column with flapping shirtsleeves and having as common to them all a general glance of being now a match for any man or dancer in england or ireland  dick fearing to lose ground in fancys good opinion retained his coat like the rest of the thinner men and mr shiner did the same from superior knowledge  and now a further phase of revelry had disclosed itself  it was the time of night when a guest may write his name in the dust upon the tables and chairs and a bluish mist pervades the atmosphere becoming a distinct halo round the candles when peoples nostrils wrinkles and crevices in general seem to be getting gradually plastered up when the very fiddlers as well as the dancers get red in the face the dancers having advanced further still towards incandescence and entered the cadaverous phase the fiddlers no longer sit down but kick back their chairs and saw madly at the strings with legs firmly spread and eyes closed regardless of the visible world  again and again did dick share his loves hand with another man and wheel round then more delightfully promenade in a circle with her all to himself his arm holding her waist more firmly each time and his elbow getting further and further behind her back till the distance reached was rather noticeable and most blissful swinging to places shoulder to shoulder her breath curling round his neck like a summer zephyr that had strayed from its proper date  threading the couples one by one they reached the bottom when there arose in dicks mind a minor misery lest the tune should end before they could work their way to the top again and have anew the same exciting run down through  dicks feelings on actually reaching the top in spite of his doubts were supplemented by a mortal fear that the fiddling might even stop at this supreme moment which prompted him to convey a stealthy whisper to the fargone musicians to the effect that they were not to leave off till he and his partner had reached the bottom of the dance once more which remark was replied to by the nearest of those convulsed and quivering men by a private nod to the anxious young man between two semiquavers of the tune and a simultaneous all right ay ay without opening the eyes  fancy was now held so closely that dick and she were practically one person  the room became to dick like a picture in a dream all that he could remember of it afterwards being the look of the fiddlers going to sleep as hummingtops sleep by increasing their motion and hum together with the figures of grandfather james and old simon crumpler sitting by the chimneycorner talking and nodding in dumbshow and beating the air to their emphatic sentences like people near a threshing machine  the dance ended  piphhhh said tranter dewy blowing out his breath in the very finest stream of vapour that a mans lips could form  a regular tightener that one sonnies  he wiped his forehead and went to the cider and ale mugs on the table  well said mrs penny flopping into a chair my heart havent been in such a thumping state of uproar since i used to sit up on old midsummer eves to see who my husband was going to be  and thats getting on for a good few years ago now from what ive heard you tell said the tranter without lifting his eyes from the cup he was filling  being now engaged in the business of handing round refreshments he was warranted in keeping his coat off still though the other heavy men had resumed theirs  and a thing i never expected would come to pass if youll believe me came to pass then continued mrs penny  ah the first spirit ever i see on a midsummereve was a puzzle to me when he appeared a hard puzzle so say i  so i should have fancied said elias spinks  yes said mrs penny throwing her glance into past times and talking on in a running tone of complacent abstraction as if a listener were not a necessity  yes never was i in such a taking as on that midsummer eve  i sat up quite determined to see if john wildway was going to marry me or no  i put the breadandcheese and beer quite ready as the witchs book ordered and i opened the door and i waited till the clock struck twelve my nerves all alive and so strained that i could feel every one of em twitching like bellwires  yes sure and when the clock had struck lo and behold i could see through the door a little small man in the lane wi a shoemakers apron on  here mr penny stealthily enlarged himself half an inch  now john wildway mrs penny continued who courted me at that time was a shoemaker you see but he was a very fairsized man and i couldnt believe that any such a little small man had anything to do wi me as anybody might  but on he came and crossed the thresholdnot john but actually the same little small man in the shoemakers apron  you neednt be so mighty particular about little and small said her husband  in he walks and down he sits and o my goodness me didnt i flee upstairs body and soul hardly hanging together  well to cut a long story short bylong and bylate john wildway and i had a miff and parted and lo and behold the coming man came  penny asked me if id go snacks with him and afore i knew what i was about amost the thing was done  ive fancied you never knew better in your life but i mid be mistaken said mr penny in a murmur  after mrs penny had spoken there being no new occupation for her eyes she still let them stay idling on the past scenes just related which were apparently visible to her in the centre of the room  mr pennys remark received no reply  during this discourse the tranter and his wife might have been observed standing in an unobtrusive corner in mysterious closeness to each other a just perceptible current of intelligence passing from each to each which had apparently no relation whatever to the conversation of their guests but much to their sustenance  a conclusion of some kind having at length been drawn the palpable confederacy of man and wife was once more obliterated the tranter marching off into the pantry humming a tune that he couldnt quite recollect and then breaking into the words of a song of which he could remember about one line and a quarter  mrs dewy spoke a few words about preparations for a bit of supper  that elder portion of the company which loved eating and drinking put on a look to signify that till this moment they had quite forgotten that it was customary to expect suppers on these occasions going even further than this politeness of feature and starting irrelevant subjects the exceeding flatness and forced tone of which rather betrayed their object the younger members said they were quite hungry and that supper would be delightful though it was so late  good luck attended dicks lovepasses during the meal  he sat next fancy and had the thrilling pleasure of using permanently a glass which had been taken by fancy in mistake of letting the outer edge of the sole of his boot touch the lower verge of her skirt and to add to these delights the cat which had lain unobserved in her lap for several minutes crept across into his own touching him with fur that had touched her hand a moment before  there were besides some little pleasures in the shape of helping her to vegetable she didnt want and when it had nearly alighted on her plate taking it across for his own use on the plea of waste not want not  he also from time to time sipped sweet sly glances at her profile noticing the set of her head the curve of her throat and other artistic properties of the lively goddess who the while kept up a rather free not to say too free conversation with mr shiner sitting opposite which after some uneasy criticism and much shifting of argument backwards and forwards in dicks mind he decided not to consider of alarming significance  a new music greets our ears now said miss fancy alluding with the sharpness that her position as village sharpener demanded to the contrast between the rattle of knives and forks and the late notes of the fiddlers  ay and i dont know but what tis sweeter in tone when you get above forty said the tranter except in faith as regards father there never such a mortal man as he for tunes  they do move his soul dont em father  the eldest dewy smiled across from his distant chair an assent to reubens remark  spaking of being moved in soul said mr penny i shall never forget the first time i heard the dead march  twas at poor corpl ninemans funeral at casterbridge  it fairly made my hair creep and fidget about like a vlock of sheepah it did souls  and when they had done and the last trump had sounded and the guns was fired over the dead heros grave a icycold drop o moist sweat hung upon my forehead and another upon my jawbone  ah tis a very solemn thing  well as to father in the corner there the tranter said pointing to old william who was in the act of filling his mouth hed starve to death for musics sake now as much as when he was a boychap of fifteen  truly now said michael mail clearing the corner of his throat in the manner of a man who meant to be convincing theres a friendly tie of some sort between music and eating  he lifted the cup to his mouth and drank himself gradually backwards from a perpendicular position to a slanting one during which time his looks performed a circuit from the wall opposite him to the ceiling overhead  then clearing the other corner of his throat once i was asetting in the little kitchen of the dree mariners at casterbridge having a bit of dinner and a brass band struck up in the street  such a beautiful band as that were  i was setting eating fried liver and lights i well can mindah i was and to save my life i couldnt help chawing to the tune  band played sixeight time sixeight chaws i willynilly  band plays common common time went my teeth among the liver and lights as true as a hair  beautiful twere ah i shall never forget that there band  thats as tuneful a thing as ever i heard of said grandfather james with the absent gaze which accompanies profound criticism  i dont like michaels tuneful stories then said mrs dewy  they are quite coarse to a person o decent taste  old michaels mouth twitched here and there as if he wanted to smile but didnt know where to begin which gradually settled to an expression that it was not displeasing for a nice woman like the tranters wife to correct him  well now said reuben with decisive earnestness that sort o coarse touch thats so upsetting to anns feelings is to my mind a recommendation for it do always prove a story to be true  and for the same reason i like a story with a bad moral  my sonnies all true stories have a coarse touch or a bad moral depend upont  if the story tellers could ha got decency and good morals from true stories whod ha troubled to invent parables  saying this the tranter arose to fetch a new stock of cider ale mead and homemade wines  mrs dewy sighed and appended a remark ostensibly behind her husbands back though that the words should reach his ears distinctly was understood by both such a man as dewy is  nobody do know the trouble i have to keep that man barely respectable  and did you ever hear toojust now at suppertimetalking about taties with michael in such a workfolk way  well tis what i was never brought up to  with our family twas never less than taters and very often pertatoes outright mother was so particular and nice with us girls there was no family in the parish that kept them selves up more than we  the hour of parting came  fancy could not remain for the night because she had engaged a woman to wait up for her  she disappeared temporarily from the flagging party of dancers and then came downstairs wrapped up and looking altogether a different person from whom she had been hitherto in fact to dicks sadness and disappointment a woman somewhat reserved and of a phlegmatic temperamentnothing left in her of the romping girl that she had seemed but a short quarterhour before who had not minded the weight of dicks hand upon her waist nor shirked the purlieus of the mistletoe  what a difference thought the young manhoary cynic pro tem  what a miserable deceiving difference between the manners of a maids life at dancing times and at others  look at this lovely fancy  through the whole past evening touchable squeezeableeven kissable  for whole half hours i held her so chose to me that not a sheet of paper could have been shipped between us and i could feel her heart only just outside my own her life beating on so close to mine that i was aware of every breath in it  a flit is made upstairsa hat and a cloak put onand i no more dare to touch her than  thought failed him and he returned to realities  but this was an endurable misery in comparison with what followed  mr shiner and his watchchain taking the intrusive advantage that ardent bachelors who are going homeward along the same road as a pretty young woman always do take of that circumstance came forward to assure fancywith a total disregard of dicks emotions and in tones which were certainly not frigidthat he shiner was not the man to go to bed before seeing his lady fair safe within her own doornot he nobody should say he was thatand that he would not leave her side an inch till the thing was donedrown him if he would  the proposal was assented to by miss day in dicks foreboding judgment with one degreeor at any rate an appreciable fraction of a degreeof warmth beyond that required by a disinterested desire for protection from the dangers of the night  all was over and dick surveyed the chair she had last occupied looking now like a setting from which the gem has been torn  there stood her glass and the romantic teaspoonful of elder wine at the bottom that she couldnt drink by trying ever so hard in obedience to the mighty arguments of the tranter his hand coming down upon her shoulder the while like a nasmyth hammer but the drinker was there no longer  there were the nine or ten pretty little crumbs she had left on her plate but the eater was no more seen  there seemed a disagreeable closeness of relationship between himself and the members of his family now that they were left alone again face to face  his father seemed quite offensive for appearing to be in just as high spirits as when the guests were there and as for grandfather james who had not yet left he was quite fiendish in being rather glad they were gone  really said the tranter in a tone of placid satisfaction ive had so little time to attend to myself all the evenen that i mean to enjoy a quiet meal now  a slice of this here hamneither too fat nor too leanso and then a drop of this vinegar and picklesthere thats itand i shall be as fresh as a lark again  and to tell the truth my sonny my inside has been as dry as a limebasket all night  i like a party very well once in a while said mrs dewy leaving off the adorned tones she had been bound to use throughout the evening and returning to the natural marriage voice but lord tis such a sight of heavy work next day  what with the dirty plates and knives and forks and dust and smother and bits kicked off your furniture and i dont know what all why a body could amost wish there were no such things as christmases    ahh dear she yawned till the clock in the corner had ticked several beats  she cast her eyes round upon the displaced dustladen furniture and sank down overpowered at the sight  well i be getting all right by degrees thank the lord fort said the tranter cheerfully through a mangled mass of ham and bread without lifting his eyes from his plate and chopping away with his knife and fork as if he were felling trees  ann you may as well go on to bed at once and not bide there making such sleepy faces you look as longfavoured as a fiddle upon my life ann  there you must be wearied out tis true  ill do the doors and draw up the clock and you go on or youll be as white as a sheet tomorrow  ay i dont know whether i shant or no  the matron passed her hand across her eyes to brush away the film of sleep till she got upstairs  dick wondered how it was that when people were married they could be so blind to romance and was quite certain that if he ever took to wife that dear impossible fancy he and she would never be so dreadfully practical and undemonstrative of the passion as his father and mother were  the most extraordinary thing was that all the fathers and mothers he knew were just as undemonstrative as his own    chapter ix dick calls at the school   the early days of the year drew on and fancy having spent the holiday weeks at home returned again to mellstock  every spare minute of the week following her return was used by dick in accidentally passing the schoolhouse in his journeys about the neighbourhood but not once did she make herself visible  a handkerchief belonging to her had been providentially found by his mother in clearing the rooms the day after that of the dance and by much contrivance dick got it handed over to him to leave with her at any time he should be near the school after her return  but he delayed taking the extreme measure of calling with it lest had she really no sentiment of interest in him it might be regarded as a slightly absurd errand the reason guessed and the sense of the ludicrous which was rather keen in her do his dignity considerable injury in her eyes and what she thought of him even apart from the question of her loving was all the world to him now  but the hour came when the patience of love at twentyone could endure no longer  one saturday he approached the school with a mild air of indifference and had the satisfaction of seeing the object of his quest at the further end of her garden trying by the aid of a spade and gloves to root a bramble that had intruded itself there  he disguised his feelings from some suspiciouslooking cottagewindows opposite by endeavouring to appear like a man in a great hurry of business who wished to leave the handkerchief and have done with such trifling errands  this endeavour signally failed for on approaching the gate he found it locked to keep the children who were playing crossdadder in the front from running into her private grounds  she did not see him and he could only think of one thing to be done which was to shout her name  miss day  the words were uttered with a jerk and a look meant to imply to the cottages opposite that he was now simply one who liked shouting as a pleasant way of passing his time without any reference to persons in gardens  the name died away and the unconscious miss day continued digging and pulling as before  he screwed himself up to enduring the cottagewindows yet more stoically and shouted again  fancy took no notice whatever  he shouted the third time with desperate vehemence turning suddenly about and retiring a little distance as if it were by no means for his own pleasure that he had come  this time she heard him came down the garden and entered the school at the back  footsteps echoed across the interior the door opened and threequarters of the blooming young schoolmistresss face and figure stood revealed before him a slice on her lefthand side being cut off by the edge of the door  having surveyed and recognized him she came to the gate  at sight of him had the pink of her cheeks increased lessened or did it continue to cover its normal area of ground  it was a question meditated several hundreds of times by her visitor in afterhoursthe meditation after wearying involutions always ending in one way that it was impossible to say  your handkerchief miss day i called with  he held it out spasmodically and awkwardly  mother found it under a chair  o thank you very much for bringing it mr dewy  i couldnt think where i had dropped it  now dick not being an experienced loverindeed never before having been engaged in the practice of lovemaking at all except in a small schoolboy waycould not take advantage of the situation and out came the blunder which afterwards cost him so many bitter moments and a sleepless night  good morning miss day  good morning mr dewy  the gate was closed she was gone and dick was standing outside unchanged in his condition from what he had been before he called  of course the angel was not to blamea young woman living alone in a house could not ask him indoors unless she had known him betterhe should have kept her outside before floundering into that fatal farewell  he wished that before he called he had realized more fully than he did the pleasure of being about to call and turned away     part the secondspring   chapter i passing by the school   it followed that as the spring advanced dick walked abroad much more frequently than had hitherto been usual with him and was continually finding that his nearest way to or from home lay by the road which skirted the garden of the school  the firstfruits of his perseverance were that on turning the angle on the nineteenth journey by that track he saw miss fancys figure clothed in a darkgray dress looking from a high open window upon the crown of his hat  the friendly greeting resulting from this rencounter was considered so valuable an elixir that dick passed still oftener and by the time he had almost trodden a little path under the fence where never a path was before he was rewarded with an actual meeting face to face on the open road before her gate  this brought another meeting and another fancy faintly showing by her bearing that it was a pleasure to her of some kind to see him there but the sort of pleasure she derived whether exultation at the hope her exceeding fairness inspired or the true feeling which was alone dicks concern he could not anyhow decide although he meditated on her every little movement for hours after it was made    chapter ii a meeting of the quire   it was the evening of a fine spring day  the descending sun appeared as a nebulous blaze of amber light its outline being lost in cloudy masses hanging round it like wild locks of hair  the chief members of mellstock parish choir were standing in a group in front of mr pennys workshop in the lower village  they were all brightly illuminated and each was backed up by a shadow as long as a steeple the lowness of the source of light rendering the brims of their hats of no use at all as a protection to the eyes  mr pennys was the last house in that part of the parish and stood in a hollow by the roadside so that cartwheels and horses legs were about level with the sill of his shopwindow  this was low and wide and was open from morning till evening mr penny himself being invariably seen working inside like a framed portrait of a shoemaker by some modern moroni  he sat facing the road with a boot on his knees and the awl in his hand only looking up for a moment as he stretched out his arms and bent forward at the pull when his spectacles flashed in the passers face with a shine of flat whiteness and then returned again to the boot as usual  rows of lasts small and large stout and slender covered the wall which formed the background in the extreme shadow of which a kind of dummy was seen sitting in the shape of an apprentice with a string tied round his hair probably to keep it out of his eyes  he smiled at remarks that floated in from without but was never known to answer them in mr pennys presence  outside the window the upperleather of a wellingtonboot was usually hung pegged to a board as if to dry  no sign was over his door in factas with old banks and mercantile housesadvertising in any shape was scorned and it would have been felt as beneath his dignity to paint up for the benefit of strangers the name of an establishment whose trade came solely by connection based on personal respect  his visitors now came and stood on the outside of his window sometimes leaning against the sill sometimes moving a pace or two backwards and forwards in front of it  they talked with deliberate gesticulations to mr penny enthroned in the shadow of the interior  i do like a man to stick to men who be in the same line o lifeo sundays anywaythat i do so  tis like all the doings of folk who dont know what a days work is thats what i say  my belief is the mans not to blame tis sheshes the bitter weed  no not altogether  hes a poor gawkhammer  look at his sermon yesterday  his sermon was well enough a very good guessable sermon only he couldnt put it into words and speak it  thats all was the matter wi the sermon  he hadnt been able to get it past his pen  wellay the sermon might have been good for tis true the sermon of old eccliastes himself lay in eccliastess inkbottle afore he got it out  mr penny being in the act of drawing the last stitch tight could afford time to look up and throw in a word at this point  hes no spouterthat must be said a blieve  tis a terrible muddle sometimes with the man as far as spout do go said spinks  well well say nothing about that the tranter answered for i dont believe twill make a penneth o difference to we poor martels here or hereafter whether his sermons be good or bad my sonnies  mr penny made another hole with his awl pushed in the thread and looked up and spoke again at the extension of arms  tis his goingson souls thats what it is  he clenched his features for an herculean addition to the ordinary pull and continued the first thing he done when he came here was to be hot and strong about church business  true said spinks that was the very first thing he done  mr penny having now been offered the ear of the assembly accepted it ceased stitching swallowed an unimportant quantity of air as if it were a pill and continued  the next thing he do do is to think about altering the church until he found twould be a matter o cost and what not and then not to think no more about it  true that was the next thing he done  and the next thing was to tell the young chaps that they were not on no account to put their hats in the christening font during service  true  and then twas this and then twas that and now tis  words were not forcible enough to conclude the sentence and mr penny gave a huge pull to signify the concluding word  now tis to turn us out of the quire neck and crop said the tranter after an interval of half a minute not by way of explaining the pause and pull which had been quite understood but as a means of keeping the subject well before the meeting  mrs penny came to the door at this point in the discussion  like all good wives however much she was inclined to play the tory to her husbands whiggism and vice versa in times of peace she coalesced with him heartily enough in time of war  it must be owned hes not all there she replied in a general way to the fragments of talk she had heard from indoors  far below poor mr grinham the late vicar  ay there was this to be said for he that you were quite sure hed never come mumbudgeting to see ye just as you were in the middle of your work and put you out with his fuss and trouble about ye  never  but as for this new mr maybold though he mid be a very well intending party in that respect hes unbearable for as to sifting your cinders scrubbing your floors or emptying your slops why you cant do it  i assure you ive not been able to empt them for several days unless i throw em up the chimley or out of winder for as sure as the sun you meet him at the door coming to ask how you are and tis such a confusing thing to meet a gentleman at the door when ye are in the mess o washing  tis only for want of knowing better poor gentleman said the tranter his meanings good enough  ay your pason comes by fate tis heads or tails like pitchhalfpenny and no choosing so we must take en as he is my sonnies and thank god hes no worse i suppose  i fancy ive seen him look across at miss day in a warmer way than christianity asked for said mrs penny musingly but i dont quite like to say it  o no theres nothing in that said grandfather william  if theres nothing we shall see nothing mrs penny replied in the tone of a woman who might possibly have private opinions still  ah mr grinham was the man said bowman  why he never troubled us wi a visit from years end to years end  you might go anywhere do anything youd be sure never to see him  yes he was a right sensible pason said michael  he never entered our door but once in his life and that was to tell my poor wifeay poor soul dead and gone now as we all shallthat as she was such a old aged person and lived so far from the church he didnt at all expect her to come any more to the service  and a was a very jinerous gentleman about choosing the psalms and hymns o sundays  confound ye says he blare and scrape what ye will but dont bother me  and he was a very honourable man in not wanting any of us to come and hear him if we were all onend for a jaunt or spree or to bring the babies to be christened if they were inclined to squalling  theres good in a mans not putting a parish to unnecessary trouble  and theres this here man never letting us have a bit o peace but keeping on about being good and upright till tis carried to such a pitch as i never see the like afore nor since  no sooner had he got here than he found the font wouldnt hold water as it hadnt for years off and on and when i told him that mr grinham never minded it but used to spet upon his vinger and christen em just as well a said good heavens  send for a workman immediate  what place have i come to  which was no compliment to us come to that  still for my part said old william though hes arrayed against us i like the hearty borussnorus ways of the new pason  you ready to die for the quire said bowman reproachfully to stick up for the quires enemy william  nobody will feel the loss of our churchwork so much as i said the old man firmly that you dall know  ive abeen in the quire man and boy ever since i was a chiel of eleven  but for all that tisnt in me to call the man a bad man because i truly and sincerely believe en to be a good young feller  some of the youthful sparkle that used to reside there animated williams eye as he uttered the words and a certain nobility of aspect was also imparted to him by the setting sun which gave him a titanic shadow at least thirty feet in length stretching away to the east in outlines of imposing magnitude his head finally terminating upon the trunk of a grand old oaktree  maybles a hearty feller enough the tranter replied and will spak to you be you dirty or be you clane  the first time i met en was in a drong and though a didnt know me no more than the dead a passed the time of day  dye do he said says he nodding his head  a fine day  then the second time i met en was fullbuff in town street when my breeches were tore into a long strent by getting through a copse of thorns and brimbles for a short cut homealong and not wanting to disgrace the man by spaking in that state i fixed my eye on the weathercock to let en pass me as a stranger  but no how dye do reuben says he right hearty and shook my hand  if id been dressed in silver spangles from top to toe the man couldnt have been civiller  at this moment dick was seen coming up the villagestreet and they turned and watched him    chapter iii a turn in the discussion   im afraid dicks a lost man said the tranter  whatno said mail implying by his manner that it was a far commoner thing for his ears to report what was not said than that his judgment should be at fault  ay said the tranter still gazing at dicks unconscious advance  i dont at all like what i see  theres too many o them looks out of the winder without noticing anything too much shining of boots too much peeping round corners too much looking at the clock telling about clever things she did till you be sick of it and then upon a hint to that effect a horrible silence about her  ive walked the path once in my life and know the country neighbours and dicks a lost man  the tranter turned a quarter round and smiled a smile of miserable satire at the setting new moon which happened to catch his eye  the others became far too serious at this announcement to allow them to speak and they still regarded dick in the distance  twas his mothers fault the tranter continued in asking the young woman to our party last christmas  when i eyed the blue frock and light heels o the maid i had my thoughts directly  god bless thee dicky my sonny i said to myself theres a delusion for thee  they seemed to be rather distant in manner last sunday i thought mail tentatively observed as became one who was not a member of the family  ay thats a part of the zickness  distance belongs to it slyness belongs to it queerest things on earth belongs to it  there tmay as well come early as late sfar as i know  the sooner begun the sooner over for come it will  the question i ask is said mr spinks connecting into one thread the two subjects of discourse as became a man learned in rhetoric and beating with his hand in a way which signified that the manner rather than the matter of his speech was to be observed how did mr maybold know she could play the organ  you know we had it from her own lips as far as lips go that she has never first or last breathed such a thing to him much less that she ever would play  in the midst of this puzzle dick joined the party and the news which had caused such a convulsion among the ancient musicians was unfolded to him well he said blushing at the allusion to miss day i know by some words of hers that she has a particular wish not to play because she is a friend of ours and how the alteration comes i dont know  now this is my plan said the tranter reviving the spirit of the discussion by the infusion of new ideas as was his customthis is my plan if you dont like it no harms done  we all know one another very well dont we neighbours  that they knew one another very well was received as a statement which though familiar should not be omitted in introductory speeches  then i say thisand the tranter in his emphasis slapped down his hand on mr spinkss shoulder with a momentum of several pounds upon which mr spinks tried to look not in the least startledi say that we all move downalong straight as a line to pason maybles when the clock has gone six tomorrow night  there we one and all stand in the passage then one or two of us go in and spak to en man and man and say pason mayble every tradesman dlike to have his own way in his workshop and mellstock church is yours  instead of turning us out neck and crop let us stay on till christmas and well gie way to the young woman mr mayble and make no more ado about it  and we shall always be quite willing to touch our hats when we meet ye mr mayble just as before that sounds very well  hey  proper well in faith reuben dewy  and we wont sit down in his house twould be looking too familiar when only just reconciled  no need at all to sit down  just do our duty man and man turn round and march outhell think all the more of us for it  i hardly think leaf had better go wi us said michael turning to leaf and taking his measure from top to bottom by the eye  hes so terrible silly that he might ruin the concern  he dont want to go much do ye thomas leaf said william  heehee no i dont want to  only a teeny bit  i be mortal afeard leaf that youll never be able to tell how many cuts dtake to sharpen a spar said mail  i never had no head never thats how it happened to happen heehee  they all assented to this not with any sense of humiliating leaf by disparaging him after an open confession but because it was an accepted thing that leaf didnt in the least mind having no head that deficiency of his being an unimpassioned matter of parish history  but i can sing my treble continued thomas leaf quite delighted at being called a fool in such a friendly way i can sing my treble as well as any maid or married woman either and better  and if jim had lived i should have had a clever brother  tomorrow is poor jims birthday hed ha been twentysix if hed lived till tomorrow  you always seem very sorry for jim said old william musingly  ah  i do  such a stay to mother as hed always ha been  shed never have had to work in her old age if he had continued strong poor jim  what was his age when a died  four hours and twenty minutes poor jim  a was born as might be at night and a didnt last as might be till the morning  no a didnt last  mother called en jim on the day that would ha been his christening day if he had lived and shes always thinking about en  you see he died so very young  well twas rather youthful said michael  now to my mind that woman is very romantical on the matter o children said the tranter his eye sweeping his audience  ah well she mid be said leaf  she had twelve regular one after another and they all except myself died very young either before they was born or just afterwards  pore feller too  i suppose thst want to come wi us the tranter murmured  well leaf you shall come wi us as yours is such a melancholy family said old william rather sadly  i never see such a melancholy family as that afore in my life said reuben  theres leafs mother poor woman  every morning i see her eyes mooning out through the panes of glass like a potsick winderflower and as leaf sings a very high treble and we dont know what we should do without en for upper g well let en come as a trate poor feller  ay well let en come a blieve said mr penny looking up as the pull happened to be at that moment  now continued the tranter dispersing by a new tone of voice these digressions about leaf as to going to see the pason one of us might call and ask en his meaning and twould be just as well done but it will add a bit of flourish to the cause if the quire waits on him as a body  then the great thing to mind is not for any of our fellers to be nervous so before starting well one and all come to my house and have a rasher of bacon then every manjack het a pint of cider into his inside then well warm up an extra drop wi some mead and a bit of ginger every one take a thimblefuljust a glimmer of a drop mind ye no more to finish off his inner manand march off to pason mayble  why sonnies a mans not himself till he is fortified wi a bit and a drop  we shall be able to look any gentleman in the face then without shrink or shame  mail recovered from a deep meditation and downward glance into the earth in time to give a cordial approval to this line of action and the meeting adjourned    chapter iv the interview with the vicar   at six oclock the next day the whole body of men in the choir emerged from the tranters door and advanced with a firm step down the lane this dignity of march gradually became obliterated as they went on and by the time they reached the hill behind the vicarage a faint resemblance to a flock of sheep might have been discerned in the venerable party  a word from the tranter however set them right again and as they descended the hill the regular tramp tramp tramp of the united feet was clearly audible from the vicarage garden  at the opening of the gate there was another short interval of irregular shuffling caused by a rather peculiar habit the gate had when swung open quickly of striking against the bank and slamming back into the openers face  now keep step again will ye said the tranter  it looks better and more becomes the high class of arrant which has brought us here  thus they advanced to the door  at reubens ring the more modest of the group turned aside adjusted their hats and looked critically at any shrub that happened to lie in the line of vision endeavouring thus to give a person who chanced to look out of the windows the impression that their request whatever it was going to be was rather a casual thought occurring whilst they were inspecting the vicars shrubbery and grassplot than a predetermined thing  the tranter who coming frequently to the vicarage with luggage coals firewood etc had none of the awe for its precincts that filled the breasts of most of the others fixed his eyes firmly on the knocker during this interval of waiting  the knocker having no characteristic worthy of notice he relinquished it for a knot in one of the doorpanels and studied the winding lines of the grain  o sir please heres tranter dewy and old william dewy and young richard dewy o and all the quire too sir except the boys acome to see you said mr maybolds maidservant to mr maybold the pupils of her eyes dilating like circles in a pond  all the choir said the astonished vicar who may be shortly described as a goodlooking young man with courageous eyes timid mouth and neutral nose abandoning his writing and looking at his parlourmaid after speaking like a man who fancied he had seen her face before but couldnt recollect where  and they looks very firm and tranter dewy do turn neither to the right hand nor to the left but stares quite straight and solemn with his mind made up  o all the choir repeated the vicar to himself trying by that simple device to trot out his thoughts on what the choir could come for  yes every manjack of em as i be alive  the parlourmaid was rather local in manner having in fact been raised in the same village really sir tis thoughted by many in town and country that  town and countryheavens i had no idea that i was public property in this way said the vicar his face acquiring a hue somewhere between that of the rose and the peony  well it is thought in town and country that  it is thought that you be going to get it hot and strongexcusen my incivility sir  the vicar suddenly recalled to his recollection that he had long ago settled it to be decidedly a mistake to encourage his servant jane in giving personal opinions  the servant jane saw by the vicars face that he recalled this fact to his mind and removing her forehead from the edge of the door and rubbing away the indent that edge had made vanished into the passage as mr maybold remarked show them in jane  a few minutes later a shuffling and jostling reduced to as refined a form as was compatible with the nature of shuffles and jostles was heard in the passage then an earnest and prolonged wiping of shoes conveying the notion that volumes of mud had to be removed but the roads being so clean that not a particle of dirt appeared on the choirs boots those of all the elder members being newly oiled and dicks brightly polished this wiping might have been set down simply as a desire to show that respectable men had no wish to take a mean advantage of clean roads for curtailing proper ceremonies  next there came a powerful whisper from the same quarter  now stand stockstill there my sonnies one and all  and dont make no noise and keep your backs close to the wall that company may pass in and out easy if they want to without squeezing through ye and we two are enough to go in    the voice was the tranters  i wish i could go in too and see the sight said a reedy voicethat of leaf  tis a pity leaf is so terrible silly or else he might said another  i never in my life seed a quire go into a study to have it out about the playing and singing pleaded leaf and i should like to see it just once  very well well let en come in said the tranter  youll be like chips in porridge 1 leafneither good nor hurt  all right my sonny come along and immediately himself old william and leaf appeared in the room  we took the liberty to come and see ee sir said reuben letting his hat hang in his left hand and touching with his right the brim of an imaginary one on his head  weve come to see ee sir man and man and no offence i hope  none at all said mr maybold  this old aged man standing by my side is father william dewy by name sir  yes i see it is said the vicar nodding aside to old william who smiled  i thought you mightnt know en without his bassviol the tranter apologized  you see he always wears his best clothes and his bassviol asundays and it do make such a difference in a old mans look  and whos that young man the vicar said  tell the pason yer name said the tranter turning to leaf who stood with his elbows nailed back to a bookcase  please thomas leaf your holiness said leaf trembling  i hope youll excuse his looks being so very thin continued the tranter deprecatingly turning to the vicar again  but tisnt his fault poor feller  hes rather silly by nature and could never get fat though hes a excellent treble and so we keep him on  i never had no head sir said leaf eagerly grasping at this opportunity for being forgiven his existence  ah poor young man said mr maybold  bless you he dont mind it a bit if you dont sir said the tranter assuringly  do ye leaf  not inot a morselhee hee  i was afeard it mightnt please your holiness sir thats all  the tranter finding leaf get on so very well through his negative qualities was tempted in a fit of generosity to advance him still higher by giving him credit for positive ones  hes very clever for a silly chap goodnow sir  you never knowed a young feller keep his smockfrocks so clane very honest too  his ghastly looks is all there is against en poor feller but we cant help our looks you know sir  true we cannot  you live with your mother i think leaf  the tranter looked at leaf to express that the most friendly assistant to his tongue could do no more for him now and that he must be left to his own resources  yes sir a widder sir  ah if brother jim had lived shed have had a clever son to keep her without work  indeed poor woman  give her this halfcrown  ill call and see your mother  say thank you sir the tranter whispered imperatively towards leaf  thank you sir said leaf  thats it then sit down leaf said mr maybold  yyes sir  the tranter cleared his throat after this accidental parenthesis about leaf rectified his bodily position and began his speech  mr mayble he said i hope youll excuse my common way but i always like to look things in the face  reuben made a point of fixing this sentence in the vicars mind by gazing hard at him at the conclusion of it and then out of the window  mr maybold and old william looked in the same direction apparently under the impression that the things faces alluded to were there visible  what i have been thinkingthe tranter implied by this use of the past tense that he was hardly so discourteous as to be positively thinking it thenis that the quire ought to be gied a little time and not done away wi till christmas as a fair thing between man and man  and mr mayble i hope youll excuse my common way  i will i will  till christmas the vicar murmured stretching the two words to a great length as if the distance to christmas might be measured in that way  well i want you all to understand that i have no personal fault to find and that i dont wish to change the church music by forcible means or in a way which should hurt the feelings of any parishioners  why i have at last spoken definitely on the subject is that a player has been brought underi may say pressed uponmy notice several times by one of the churchwardens  and as the organ i brought with me is here waiting pointing to a cabinetorgan standing in the study there is no reason for longer delay  we made a mistake i suppose then sir  but we understood the young woman didnt want to play particularly  the tranter arranged his countenance to signify that he did not want to be inquisitive in the least  no nor did she  nor did i definitely wish her to just yet for your playing is very good  but as i said one of the churchwardens has been so anxious for a change that as matters stand i couldnt consistently refuse my consent  now for some reason or other the vicar at this point seemed to have an idea that he had prevaricated and as an honest vicar it was a thing he determined not to do  he corrected himself blushing as he did so though why he should blush was not known to reuben  understand me rightly he said the churchwarden proposed it to me but i had thought myself of gettingmiss day to play  which churchwarden might that be who proposed her sirexcusing my common way  the tranter intimated by his tone that so far from being inquisitive he did not even wish to ask a single question  mr shiner i believe  clk my sonnybeg your pardon sir thats only a form of words of mine and slipped out accidentalhe nourishes enmity against us for some reason or another perhaps because we played rather hard upon en christmas night  anyhow tis certain sure that mr shiners real love for music of a particular kind isnt his reason  heve no more ear than that chair  but let that be  i dont think you should conclude that because mr shiner wants a different music he has any illfeeling for you  i myself i must own prefer organmusic to any other  i consider it most proper and feel justified in endeavouring to introduce it but then although other music is better i dont say yours is not good  well then mr mayble since deaths to be well die like men any day you name excusing my common way  mr maybold bowed his head  all we thought was that for us old ancient singers to be choked off quiet at no time in particular as now in the sundays after easter would seem rather mean in the eyes of other parishes sir  but if we fell glorious with a bit of a flourish at christmas we should have a respectable end and not dwindle away at some nameless paltry secondsundayafter or sundaynextbefore something thats got no name of his own  yes yes thats reasonable i own its reasonable  you see mr mayble weve gotdo i keep you inconvenient long sir  no no  weve got our feelingsfather there especially  the tranter in his earnestness had advanced his person to within six inches of the vicars  certainly certainly said mr maybold retreating a little for convenience of seeing  you are all enthusiastic on the subject and i am all the more gratified to find you so  a laodicean lukewarmness is worse than wrongheadedness itself  exactly sir  in fact now mr mayble reuben continued more impressively and advancing a little closer still to the vicar father there is a perfect figure o wonder in the way of being fond of music  the vicar drew back a little further the tranter suddenly also standing back a foot or two to throw open the view of his father and pointing to him at the same time  old william moved uneasily in the large chair and with a minute smile on the mere edge of his lips for goodmanners said he was indeed very fond of tunes  now you see exactly how it is reuben continued appealing to mr maybolds sense of justice by looking sideways into his eyes  the vicar seemed to see how it was so well that the gratified tranter walked up to him again with even vehement eagerness so that his waistcoatbuttons almost rubbed against the vicars as he continued as to father if you or i or any man or woman of the present generation at the time music is aplaying was to shake your fist in fathers face as may be this way and say dont you be delighted with that musicthe tranter went back to where leaf was sitting and held his fist so close to leafs face that the latter pressed his head back against the wall all right leaf my sonny i wont hurt you tis just to show my meaning to mr maybleas i was saying if you or i or any man was to shake your fist in fathers face this way and say william your life or your music hed say my life  now thats fathers nature all over and you see sir it must hurt the feelings of a man of that kind for him and his bass viol to be done away wi neck and crop  the tranter went back to the vicars front and again looked earnestly at his face  true true dewy mr maybold answered trying to withdraw his head and shoulders without moving his feet but finding this impracticable edging back another inch  these frequent retreats had at last jammed mr maybold between his easychair and the edge of the table  and at the moment of the announcement of the choir mr maybold had just redipped the pen he was using at their entry instead of wiping it he had laid it on the table with the nib overhanging  at the last retreat his coattails came in contact with the pen and down it rolled first against the back of the chair thence turning a summersault into the seat thence falling to the floor with a rattle  the vicar stooped for his pen and the tranter wishing to show that however great their ecclesiastical differences his mind was not so small as to let this affect his social feelings stooped also  and have you anything else you want to explain to me dewy said mr maybold from under the table  nothing sir  and mr mayble you be not offended  i hope you see our desire is reason said the tranter from under the chair  quite quite and i shouldnt think of refusing to listen to such a reasonable request the vicar replied  seeing that reuben had secured the pen he resumed his vertical position and added you know dewy it is often said how difficult a matter it is to act up to our convictions and please all parties  it may be said with equal truth that it is difficult for a man of any appreciativeness to have convictions at all now in my case i see right in you and right in shiner  i see that violins are good and that an organ is good and when we introduce the organ it will not be that fiddles were bad but that an organ was better  that youll clearly understand dewy  i will and thank you very much for such feelings sir  piphhhh  how the blood do get into my head to be sure whenever i quat down like that said reuben who having also risen to his feet stuck the pen vertically in the inkstand and almost through the bottom that it might not roll down again under any circumstances whatever  now the ancient body of minstrels in the passage felt their curiosity surging higher and higher as the minutes passed  dick not having much affection for this errand soon grew tired and went away in the direction of the school  yet their sense of propriety would probably have restrained them from any attempt to discover what was going on in the study had not the vicars pen fallen to the floor  the conviction that the movement of chairs etc necessitated by the search could only have been caused by the catastrophe of a bloody fight beginning overpowered all other considerations and they advanced to the door which had only just fallen to  thus when mr maybold raised his eyes after the stooping he beheld glaring through the door mr penny in full length portraiture mails face and shoulders above mr pennys head spinkss forehead and eyes over mails crown and a fractional part of bowmans countenance under spinkss armcrescentshaped portions of other heads and faces being visible behind thesethe whole dozen and odd eyes bristling with eager inquiry  mr penny as is the case with excitable bootmakers and men seeing the vicar look at him and hearing no word spoken thought it incumbent upon himself to say something of any kind  nothing suggested itself till he had looked for about half a minute at the vicar  youll excuse my naming of it sir he said regarding with much commiseration the mere surface of the vicars face but perhaps you dont know that your chin have bust out ableeding where you cut yourself ashaving this morning sir  now that was the stooping depend upont the tranter suggested also looking with much interest at the vicars chin  blood always will bust out again if you hang down the member thats been bleeding  old william raised his eyes and watched the vicars bleeding chin likewise and leaf advanced two or three paces from the bookcase absorbed in the contemplation of the same phenomenon with parted lips and delighted eyes  dear me dear me said mr maybold hastily looking very red and brushing his chin with his hand then taking out his handkerchief and wiping the place  thats it sir all right again now a blievea mere nothing said mr penny  a little bit of fur off your hat will stop it in a minute if it should bust out again  ill let ee have a bit off mine said reuben to show his good feeling my hat isnt so new as yours sir and twont hurt mine a bit  no no thank you thank you mr maybold again nervously replied  twas rather a deep cut seemingly said reuben feeling these to be the kindest and best remarks he could make  o no not particularly  well sir your hand will shake sometimes ashaving and just when it comes into your head that you may cut yourself theres the blood  i have been revolving in my mind that question of the time at which we make the change said mr maybold and i know youll meet me halfway i think christmasday as much too late for me as the present time is too early for you  i suggest michaelmas or thereabout as a convenient time for both parties for i think your objection to a sunday which has no name is not one of any real weight  very good sir  i suppose mortal men mustnt expect their own way entirely and i express in all our names that well make shift and be satisfied with what you say  the tranter touched the brim of his imaginary hat again and all the choir did the same  about michaelmas then as far as you are concerned sir and then we make room for the next generation  about michaelmas said the vicar    chapter v returning home ward   a took it very well then said mail as they all walked up the hill  he behaved like a man a did so said the tranter  and im glad weve let en know our minds  and though beyond that we hant got much by going twas worth while  he wont forget it  yes he took it very well  supposing this tree here was pason mayble and i standing here and thik grt stone is father sitting in the easychair  dewy says he i dont wish to change the church music in a forcible way  that was very nice o the man even though words be wind  proper niceout and out nice  the fact is said reuben confidentially tis how you take a man  everybody must be managed queens must be managed kings must be managed for men want managing almost as much as women and thats saying a good deal  tis truly murmured the husbands  pason mayble and i were as good friends all through it as if wed been sworn brothers  ay the mans well enough tis whats put in his head that spoils him and thats why weve got to go  theres really no believing half you hear about people nowadays  bless ye my sonnies tisnt the pasons move at all  that gentleman over there the tranter nodded in the direction of shiners farm is at the root of the mischty  what  shiner  ay and i see what the pason dont see  why shiner is for putting forward that young woman that only last night i was saying was our dicks sweetheart but i suppose cant be and making much of her in the sight of the congregation and thinking hell win her by showing her off  well perhaps a woll  then the music is second to the woman the other churchwarden is second to shiner the pason is second to the churchwardens and god amighty is nowhere at all  thats true and you see continued reuben at the very beginning it put me in a stud as to how to quarrel wi en  in short to save my soul i couldnt quarrel wi such a civil man without belying my conscience says he to father there in a voice as quiet as a lambs william you are a old aged man as all shall be so sit down in my easychair and rest yourself  and down father zot  i could fain ha laughed at thee father for thoust take it so unconcerned at first and then looked so frightened when the chairbottom sunk in  you see said old william hastening to explain i was scared to find the bottom gie waywhat should i know o spring bottomsand thought i had broke it down and of course as to breaking down a mans chair i didnt wish any such thing  and neighbours when a feller ever so much up for a miff dsee his own father sitting in his enemys easychair and a poor chap like leaf made the best of as if he almost had brainswhy it knocks all the wind out of his sail at once it did out of mine  if that young figure of funfance day i mean said bowman hadnt been so mighty forward wi showing herself off to shiner and dick and the rest tis my belief we should never ha left the gallery  tis my belief that though shiner fired the bullets the parson made em said mr penny  my wife sticks to it that hes in love wi her  thats a thing we shall never know  i cant onriddle her nohow  thoust ought to be able to onriddle such a little chiel as she the tranter observed  the littler the maid the bigger the riddle to my mind  and coming of such a stock too she may well be a twister  yes geoffrey day is a clever man if ever there was one  never says anything not he  never  you might live wi that man my sonnies a hundred years and never know there was anything in him  ay one o these upcountry london inkbottle chaps would call geoffrey a fool  ye never find out whats in that man never said spinks  close ah he is close  he can hold his tongue well  that mans dumbness is wonderful to listen to  theres so much sense in it  every moment of it is brimmen over wi sound understanding  a can hold his tongue very cleververy clever truly echoed leaf  a do look at me as if a could see my thoughts running round like the works of a clock  well all will agree that the man can halt well in his talk be it a long time or be it a short time  and though we cant expect his daughter to inherit his closeness she may have a few dribblets from his sense  and his pocket perhaps  yes the nine hundred pound that everybody says hes worth but i call it four hundred and fifty for i never believe more than half i hear  well heve made a pound or two and i suppose the maid will have it since theres nobody else  but tis rather sharp upon her if shes been born to fortune to bring her up as if not born for it and letting her work so hard  tis all upon his principle  a longheaded feller  ah murmured spinks twould be sharper upon her if she were born for fortune and not to it  i suffer from that affliction    chapter vi yalbury wood and the keepers house   a mood of blitheness rarely experienced even by young men was dicks on the following monday morning  it was the week after the easter holidays and he was journeying along with smart the mare and the light springcart watching the damp slopes of the hillsides as they streamed in the warmth of the sun which at this unsettled season shone on the grass with the freshness of an occasional inspector rather than as an accustomed proprietor  his errand was to fetch fancy and some additional household goods from her fathers house in the neighbouring parish to her dwelling at mellstock  the distant view was darkly shaded with clouds but the nearer parts of the landscape were whitely illumined by the visible rays of the sun streaming down across the heavy gray shade behind  the tranter had not yet told his son of the state of shiners heart that had been suggested to him by shiners movements  he preferred to let such delicate affairs right themselves experience having taught him that the uncertain phenomenon of love as it existed in other people was not a groundwork upon which a single action of his own life could be founded  geoffrey day lived in the depths of yalbury wood which formed portion of one of the outlying estates of the earl of wessex to whom day was head gamekeeper timbersteward and general overlooker for this district the wood was intersected by the highway from casterbridge to london at a place not far from the house and some trees had of late years been felled between its windows and the ascent of yalbury hill to give the solitary cottager a glimpse of the passersby  it was a satisfaction to walk into the keepers house even as a stranger on a fine spring morning like the present  a curl of woodsmoke came from the chimney and drooped over the roof like a blue feather in a ladys hat and the sun shone obliquely upon the patch of grass in front which reflected its brightness through the open doorway and up the staircase opposite lighting up each riser with a shiny green radiance and leaving the top of each step in shade  the windowsill of the front room was between four and five feet from the floor dropping inwardly to a broad low bench over which as well as over the whole surface of the wall beneath there always hung a deep shade which was considered objectionable on every ground save one namely that the perpetual sprinkling of seeds and water by the caged canary above was not noticed as an eyesore by visitors  the window was set with thicklyleaded diamond glazing formed especially in the lower panes of knotty glass of various shades of green  nothing was better known to fancy than the extravagant manner in which these circular knots or eyes distorted everything seen through them from the outsidelifting hats from heads shoulders from bodies scattering the spokes of cart wheels and bending the straight firtrunks into semicircles  the ceiling was carried by a beam traversing its midst from the side of which projected a large nail used solely and constantly as a peg for geoffreys hat the nail was arched by a rainbowshaped stain imprinted by the brim of the said hat when it was hung there dripping wet  the most striking point about the room was the furniture  this was a repetition upon inanimate objects of the old principle introduced by noah consisting for the most part of two articles of every sort  the duplicate system of furnishing owed its existence to the forethought of fancys mother exercised from the date of fancys birthday onwards  the arrangement spoke for itself nobody who knew the tone of the household could look at the goods without being aware that the second set was a provision for fancy when she should marry and have a house of her own the most noticeable instance was a pair of greenfaced eightday clocks ticking alternately which were severally two and half minutes and three minutes striking the hour of twelve one proclaiming in italian flourishes thomas wood as the name of its maker and the otherarched at the top and altogether of more cynical appearancethat of ezekiel saunders  they were two departed clockmakers of casterbridge whose desperate rivalry throughout their lives was nowhere more emphatically perpetuated than here at geoffreys  these chief specimens of the marriage provision were supported on the right by a couple of kitchen dressers each fitted complete with their cups dishes and plates in their turn followed by two dumbwaiters two family bibles two warming pans and two intermixed sets of chairs  but the position last reachedthe chimneycornerwas after all the most attractive side of the parallelogram  it was large enough to admit in addition to geoffrey himself geoffreys wife her chair and her work table entirely within the line of the mantel without danger or even inconvenience from the heat of the fire and was spacious enough overhead to allow of the insertion of wood poles for the hanging of bacon which were cloaked with long shreds of soot floating on the draught like the tattered banners on the walls of ancient aisles  these points were common to most chimney corners of the neighbourhood but one feature there was which made geoffreys fireside not only an object of interest to casual aristocratic visitorsto whom every cottage fireside was more or less a curiositybut the admiration of friends who were accustomed to fireplaces of the ordinary hamlet model  this peculiarity was a little window in the chimneyback almost over the fire around which the smoke crept caressingly when it left the perpendicular course  the windowboard was curiously stamped with black circles burnt thereon by the heated bottoms of drinkingcups which had rested there after previously standing on the hot ashes of the hearth for the purpose of warming their contents the result giving to the ledge the look of an envelope which has passed through innumerable postoffices  fancy was gliding about the room preparing dinner her head inclining now to the right now to the left and singing the tips and ends of tunes that sprang up in her mind like mushrooms  the footsteps of mrs day could be heard in the room overhead  fancy went finally to the door  father  dinner  a tall spare figure was seen advancing by the window with periodical steps and the keeper entered from the garden  he appeared to be a man who was always looking down as if trying to recollect something he said yesterday  the surface of his face was fissured rather than wrinkled and over and under his eyes were folds which seemed as a kind of exterior eyelids  his nose had been thrown backwards by a blow in a poaching fray so that when the sun was low and shining in his face people could see far into his head  there was in him a quiet grimness which would in his moments of displeasure have become surliness had it not been tempered by honesty of soul and which was often wrongheadedness because not allied with subtlety  although not an extraordinarily taciturn man among friends slightly richer than himself he never wasted words upon outsiders and to his trapper enoch his ideas were seldom conveyed by any other means than nods and shakes of the head  their long acquaintance with each others ways and the nature of their labours rendered words between them almost superfluous as vehicles of thought whilst the coincidence of their horizons and the astonishing equality of their social views by startling the keeper from time to time as very damaging to the theory of master and man strictly forbade any indulgence in words as courtesies  behind the keeper came enoch who had been assisting in the garden at the wellconsidered chronological distance of three minutesan interval of nonappearance on the trappers part not arrived at without some reflection  four minutes had been found to express indifference to indoor arrangements and simultaneousness had implied too great an anxiety about meals  a little earlier than usual fancy the keeper said as he sat down and looked at the clocks  that ezekiel saunders o thine is tearing on afore thomas wood again  i kept in the middle between them said fancy also looking at the two clocks  better stick to thomas said her father  theres a healthy beat in thomas that would lead a man to swear by en offhand  he is as true as the town time  how is it your stapmother isnt here  as fancy was about to reply the rattle of wheels was heard and weh hey smart in mr richard dewys voice rolled into the cottage from round the corner of the house  hullo theres dewys cart come for thee fancydick drivingafore time too  well ask the lad to have potluck with us  dick on entering made a point of implying by his general bearing that he took an interest in fancy simply as in one of the same race and country as himself and they all sat down  dick could have wished her manner had not been so entirely free from all apparent consciousness of those accidental meetings of theirs but he let the thought pass  enoch sat diagonally at a table afar off under the corner cupboard and drank his cider from a long perpendicular pint cup having tall firtrees done in brown on its sides  he threw occasional remarks into the general tide of conversation and with this advantage to himself that he participated in the pleasures of a talk slight as it was at mealtimes without saddling himself with the responsibility of sustaining it  why dont your stapmother come down fancy said geoffrey  youll excuse her mister dick shes a little queer sometimes  o yesquite said richard as if he were in the habit of excusing people every day  she dbelong to that class of womankind that become second wives a rum class rather  indeed said dick with sympathy for an indefinite something  yes and tis trying to a female especially if youve been a first wife as she hev  very trying it must be  yes you see her first husband was a young man who let her go too far in fact she used to kick up bobsadying at the least thing in the world  and when id married her and found it out i thought thinks i tis too late now to begin to cure e and so i let her bide  but shes queervery queer at times  im sorry to hear that  yes there wives be such a provoking class o society because though they be never right they be never more than half wrong  fancy seemed uneasy under the infliction of this household moralizing which might tend to damage the airyfairy nature that dick as maiden shrewdness told her had accredited her with  her dead silence impressed geoffrey with the notion that something in his words did not agree with her educated ideas and he changed the conversation  did fred shiner send the cask o drink fancy  i think he did o yes he did  nice solid feller fred shiner said geoffrey to dick as he helped himself to gravy bringing the spoon round to his plate by way of the potatodish to obviate a stain on the cloth in the event of a spill  now geoffreys eyes had been fixed upon his plate for the previous four or five minutes and in removing them he had only carried them to the spoon which from its fulness and the distance of its transit necessitated a steady watching through the whole of the route  just as intently as the keepers eyes had been fixed on the spoon fancys had been fixed on her fathers without premeditation or the slightest phase of furtiveness but there they were fastened  this was the reason why  dick was sitting next to her on the right side and on the side of the table opposite to her father  fancy had laid her right hand lightly down upon the tablecloth for an instant and to her alarm dick after dropping his fork and brushing his forehead as a reason flung down his own left hand overlapping a third of fancys with it and keeping it there  so the innocent fancy instead of pulling her hand from the trap settled her eyes on her fathers to guard against his discovery of this perilous game of dicks  dick finished his mouthful fancy finished her crumb and nothing was done beyond watching geoffreys eyes  then the hands slid apart fancys going over six inches of cloth dicks over one  geoffreys eye had risen  i said fred shiner is a nice solid feller he repeated more emphatically  he is yes he is stammered dick but to me he is little more than a stranger  o sure  now i know en as well as any man can be known  and you know en very well too dont ye fancy  geoffrey put on a tone expressing that these words signified at present about one hundred times the amount of meaning they conveyed literally  dick looked anxious  will you pass me some bread said fancy in a flurry the red of her face becoming slightly disordered and looking as solicitous as a human being could look about a piece of bread  ay that i will replied the unconscious geoffrey  ay he continued returning to the displaced idea we are likely to remain friendly wi mr shiner if the wheels drun smooth  an excellent thinga very capital thing as i should say the youth answered with exceeding relevance considering that his thoughts instead of following geoffreys remark were nestling at a distance of about two feet on his left the whole time  a young womans face will turn the north wind master richard my heart if twont  dick looked more anxious and was attentive in earnest at these words  yes turn the north wind added geoffrey after an impressive pause  and though shes one of my own flesh and blood      will you fetch down a bit of rawmil cheese from pantryshelf fancy interrupted as if she were famishing  ay that i will chiel chiel says i and mr shiner only asking last saturday night    cheese you said fancy  dick controlled his emotion at these mysterious allusions to mr shinerthe better enabled to do so by perceiving that fancys heart went not with her fathersand spoke like a stranger to the affairs of the neighbourhood  yes theres a great deal to be said upon the power of maiden faces in settling your courses he ventured as the keeper retreated for the cheese  the conversation is taking a very strange turn nothing that i have ever done warrants such things being said murmured fancy with emphasis just loud enough to reach dicks ears  you think to yourself twas to be cried enoch from his distant corner by way of filling up the vacancy caused by geoffreys momentary absence  and so you marry her master dewy and theres an end ot  pray dont say such things enoch came from fancy severely upon which enoch relapsed into servitude  if we be doomed to marry we marry if we be doomed to remain single we do replied dick  geoffrey had by this time sat down again and he now made his lips thin by severely straining them across his gums and looked out of the window along the vista to the distant highway up yalbury hill  thats not the case with some folk he said at length as if he read the words on a board at the further end of the vista  fancy looked interested and dick said no  theres that wife o mine  it was her doom to be nobodys wife at all in the wide universe  but she made up her mind that she would and did it twice over  doom  doom is nothing beside a elderly womanquite a chiel in her hands  a movement was now heard along the upstairs passage and footsteps descending  the door at the foot of the stairs opened and the second mrs day appeared in view looking fixedly at the table as she advanced towards it with apparent obliviousness of the presence of any other human being than herself  in short if the table had been the personages and the persons the table her glance would have been the most natural imaginable  she showed herself to possess an ordinary womans face irongrey hair hardly any hips and a great deal of cleanliness in a broad white apron string as it appeared upon the waist of her dark stuff dress  people will run away with a story now i suppose she began saying that jane days tablecloths are as poor and ragged as any union beggars  dick now perceived that the tablecloth was a little the worse for wear and reflecting for a moment concluded that people in stepmother language probably meant himself  on lifting his eyes he found that mrs day had vanished again upstairs and presently returned with an armful of new damasklinen tablecloths folded square and hard as boards by long compression  these she flounced down into a chair then took one shook it out from its folds and spread it on the table by instalments transferring the plates and dishes one by one from the old to the new cloth  and i suppose theyll say too that she hant a decent knife and fork in her house  i shouldnt say any such illnatured thing i am sure began dick  but mrs day had vanished into the next room  fancy appeared distressed  very strange woman isnt she said geoffrey quietly going on with his dinner  but tis too late to attempt curing  my heart tis so growed into her that twould kill her to take it out  ay shes very queer youd be amazed to see what valuable goods weve got stowed away upstairs  back again came mrs day with a box of bright steel hornhandled knives silverplated forks carver and all complete  these were wiped of the preservative oil which coated them and then a knife and fork were laid down to each individual with a bang the carving knife and fork thrust into the meat dish and the old ones they had hitherto used tossed away  geoffrey placidly cut a slice with the new knife and fork and asked dick if he wanted any more  the table had been spread for the mixed midday meal of dinner and tea which was common among frugal countryfolk  the parishioners about here continued mrs day not looking at any living being but snatching up the brown delf teathings are the laziest gossipest poachest jailest set of any ever i came among  and theyll talk about my teapot and teathings next i suppose  she vanished with the teapot cups and saucers and reappeared with a teaservice in white china and a packet wrapped in brown paper  this was removed together with folds of tissue paper underneath and a brilliant silver teapot appeared  ill help to put the things right said fancy soothingly and rising from her seat  i ought to have laid out better things i suppose  but here she enlarged her looks so as to include dick i have been away from home a good deal and i make shocking blunders in my housekeeping smiles and suavity were then dispensed all around by this bright little bird  after a little more preparation and modification mrs day took her seat at the head of the table and during the latter or tea division of the meal presided with much composure  it may cause some surprise to learn that now her vagary was over she showed herself to be an excellent person with much common sense and even a religious seriousness of tone on matters pertaining to her afflictions    chapter vii dick makes himself useful   the effect of geoffreys incidental allusions to mr shiner was to restrain a considerable flow of spontaneous chat that would otherwise have burst from young dewy along the drive homeward  and a certain remark he had hazarded to her in rather too blunt and eager a manner kept the young lady herself even more silent than dick  on both sides there was an unwillingness to talk on any but the most trivial subjects and their sentences rarely took a larger form than could be expressed in two or three words  owing to fancy being later in the day than she had promised the charwoman had given up expecting her whereupon dick could do no less than stay and see her comfortably tided over the disagreeable time of entering and establishing herself in an empty house after an absence of a week  the additional furniture and utensils that had been brought a canary and cage among the rest were taken out of the vehicle and the horse was unharnessed and put in the plot opposite where there was some tender grass  dick lighted the fire already laid and activity began to loosen their tongues a little  there said fancy we forgot to bring the fireirons  she had originally found in her sittingroom to bear out the expression nearly furnished which the schoolmanager had used in his letter to her a table three chairs a fender and a piece of carpet  this nearly had been supplemented hitherto by a kind friend who had lent her fireirons and crockery until she should fetch some from home  dick attended to the young ladys fire using his whiphandle for a poker till it was spoilt and then flourishing a hurdle stick for the remainder of the time  the kettle boils now you shall have a cup of tea said fancy diving into the hamper she had brought  thank you said dick whose drive had made him ready for some especially in her company  well heres only one cupandsaucer as i breathe  whatever could mother be thinking about  do you mind making shift mr dewy  not at all miss day said that civil person  and only having a cup by itself or a saucer by itself  dont mind in the least  which do you mean by that  i mean the cup if you like the saucer  and the saucer if i like the cup  exactly miss day  thank you mr dewy for i like the cup decidedly  stop a minute there are no spoons now  she dived into the hamper again and at the end of two or three minutes looked up and said i suppose you dont mind if i cant find a spoon  not at all said the agreeable richard  the fact is the spoons have slipped down somewhere right under the other things  o yes heres one and only one  you would rather have one than not i suppose mr dewy  rather not  i never did care much about spoons  then ill have it  i do care about them  you must stir up your tea with a knife  would you mind lifting the kettle off that it may not boil dry  dick leapt to the fireplace and earnestly removed the kettle  there you did it so wildly that you have made your hand black  we always use kettleholders didnt you learn housewifery as far as that mr dewy  well never mind the soot on your hand  come here  i am going to rinse mine too  they went to a basin she had placed in the back room  this is the only basin i have she said  turn up your sleeves and by that time my hands will be washed and you can come  her hands were in the water now  o how vexing she exclaimed theres not a drop of water left for you unless you draw it and the well is i dont know how many furlongs deep all that was in the pitcher i used for the kettle and this basin  do you mind dipping the tips of your fingers in the same  not at all  and to save time i wont wait till you have done if you have no objection  thereupon he plunged in his hands and they paddled together  it being the first time in his life that he had touched female fingers under water dick duly registered the sensation as rather a nice one  really i hardly know which are my own hands and which are yours they have got so mixed up together she said withdrawing her own very suddenly  it doesnt matter at all said dick at least as far as i am concerned  there no towel  whoever thinks of a towel till the hands are wet  nobody  nobody  how very dull it is when people are so friendly  come here mr dewy  now do you think you could lift the lid of that box with your elbow and then with something or other take out a towel you will find under the clean clothes  be sure dont touch any of them with your wet hands for the things at the top are all starched and ironed  dick managed by the aid of a knife and fork to extract a towel from under a muslin dress without wetting the latter and for a moment he ventured to assume a tone of criticism  i fear for that dress he said as they wiped their hands together  what said miss day looking into the box at the dress alluded to  o i know what you meanthat the vicar will never let me wear muslin  yes  well i know it is condemned by all orders in the church as flaunting and unfit for common wear for girls whove their living to get but well see  in the interest of the church i hope you dont speak seriously  yes i do but well see  there was a comely determination on her lip very pleasant to a beholder who was neither bishop priest nor deacon i think i can manage any vicars views about me if hes under forty  dick rather wished she had never thought of managing vicars  i certainly shall be glad to get some of your delicious tea he said in rather a free way yet modestly as became one in a position between that of visitor and inmate and looking wistfully at his lonely saucer  so shall i  now is there anything else we want mr dewy  i really think theres nothing else miss day  she prepared to sit down looking musingly out of the window at smarts enjoyment of the rich grass  nobody seems to care about me she murmured with large lost eyes fixed upon the sky beyond smart  perhaps mr shiner does said dick in the tone of a slightly injured man  yes i forgothe does i know  dick precipitately regretted that he had suggested shiner since it had produced such a miserable result as this  ill warrant youll care for somebody very much indeed another day wont you mr dewy she continued looking very feelingly into the mathematical centre of his eyes  ah ill warrant i shall said dick feelingly too and looking back into her dark pupils whereupon they were turned aside  i meant she went on preventing him from speaking just as he was going to narrate a forcible story about his feelings i meant that nobody comes to see if i have returnednot even the vicar  if you want to see him ill call at the vicarage directly we have had some tea  no no  dont let him come down here whatever you do whilst i am in such a state of disarrangement  parsons look so miserable and awkward when ones house is in a muddle walking about and making impossible suggestions in quaint academic phrases till your flesh creeps and you wish them dead  do you take sugar  mr maybold was at this instant seen coming up the path  there  thats he coming  how i wish you were not herethat is how awkwarddear dear she exclaimed with a quick ascent of blood to her face and irritated with dick rather than the vicar as it seemed  pray dont be alarmed on my account miss daygoodafternoon said dick in a huff putting on his hat and leaving the room hastily by the backdoor  the horse was caught and put in and on mounting the shafts to start he saw through the window the vicar standing upon some books piled in a chair and driving a nail into the wall fancy with a demure glance holding the canarycage up to him as if she had never in her life thought of anything but vicars and canaries    chapter viii dick meets his father   for several minutes dick drove along homeward with the inner eye of reflection so anxiously set on his passages at arms with fancy that the road and scenery were as a thin mist over the real pictures of his mind was she a coquette  the balance between the evidence that she did love him and that she did not was so nicely struck that his opinion had no stability  she had let him put his hand upon hers she had allowed her gaze to drop plumb into the depths of hishis into hersthree or four times her manner had been very free with regard to the basin and towel she had appeared vexed at the mention of shiner  on the other hand she had driven him about the house like a quiet dog or cat said shiner cared for her and seemed anxious that mr maybold should do the same  thinking thus as he neared the handpost at mellstock cross sitting on the front board of the spring carthis legs on the outside and his whole frame jigging up and down like a candleflame to the time of smarts trottingwho should he see coming down the hill but his father in the light wagon quivering up and down on a smaller scale of shakes those merely caused by the stones in the road  they were soon crossing each others front  wehhey said the tranter to smiler  wehhey said dick to smart in an echo of the same voice  thst hauled her back i suppose reuben inquired peaceably  yes said dick with such a clinching period at the end that it seemed he was never going to add another word  smiler thinking this the close of the conversation prepared to move on  wehhey said the tranter  i tell thee what it is dick  that there maid is taking up thy thoughts more thans good for thee my sonny thourt never happy now unless thrt making thyself miserable about her in one way or another  i dont know about that father said dick rather stupidly  but i dowey smilerod rot the women tis nothing else wi em nowadays but getting young men and leading em astray  pooh father you just repeat what all the common world says thats all you do  the worlds a very sensible feller on things in jineral dick very sensible indeed  dick looked into the distance at a vast expanse of mortgaged estate  i wish i was as rich as a squire when hes as poor as a crow he murmured id soon ask fancy something  i wish so too wi all my heart sonny that i do  well mind what beest about thats all  smart moved on a step or two  supposing now fatherwehey smarti did think a little about her and i had a chance which i hant dont you think shes a very good sort ofofone  ay good shes good enough  when youve made up your mind to marry take the first respectable body that comes to handshes as good as any other they be all alike in the groundwork tis only in the flourishes theres a difference  shes good enough but i cant see what the nation a young feller like youwi a comfortable house and home and father and mother to take care o thee and who sent ee to a school so good that twas hardly fair to the other childrenshould want to go hollering after a young woman for when shes quietly making a husband in her pocket and not troubled by chick nor chiel to make a povertystric wife and family of her and neither hat cap wig nor waistcoat to set em up with be drowned if i can see it and thats the long and the short ot my sonny  dick looked at smarts ears then up the hill but no reason was suggested by any object that met his gaze  for about the same reason that you did father i suppose  dang it my sonny thoust got me there  and the tranter gave vent to a grim admiration with the mien of a man who was too magnanimous not to appreciate artistically a slight rap on the knuckles even if they were his own  whether or no said dick i asked her a thing going along the road  come to that is it  turk wont thy mother be in a taking  well shes ready i dont doubt  i didnt ask her anything about having me and if youll let me speak ill tell ee what i want to know  i just said did she care about me  piphphph  and then she said nothing for a quarter of a mile and then she said she didnt know  now what i want to know is what was the meaning of that speech  the latter words were spoken resolutely as if he didnt care for the ridicule of all the fathers in creation  the meaning of that speech is the tranter replied deliberately that the meaning is meant to be rather hid at present  well dick as an honest father to thee i dont pretend to deny what you dknow well enough that is that her father being rather better in the pocket than we i should welcome her ready enough if it must be somebody  but what dye think she really did mean said the unsatisfied dick  im afeard i am not o much account in guessing especially as i was not there when she said it and seeing that your mother was the only ooman i ever cam into such close quarters as that with  and what did mother say to you when you asked her said dick musingly  i dont see that that will help ee  the principle is the same  wellay what did she say  lets see  i was oiling my workingday boots without taking em off and wi my head hanging down when she just brushed on by the garden hatch like a flittering leaf  ann i said says i and thenbut dick im afeard twill be no help to thee for we were such a rum couple your mother and i leastways one half was that is myselfand your mothers charms was more in the manner than the material  never mind  ann said you  ann said i as i was saying    ann i said to her when i was oiling my workingday boots wi my head hanging down woot hae me    what came next i cant quite call up at this distance o time  perhaps your mother would knowshes got a better memory for her little triumphs than i  however the long and the short o the story is that we were married somehow as i found afterwards  twas on white tuesdaymellstock club walked the same day every man two and two and a fine day twashot as firehow the sun did strike down upon my back going to church  i well can mind what a bath o sweating i was in body and soul  but fance will ha thee dickshe wont walk with another chapno such good luck  i dont know about that said dick whipping at smarts flank in a fanciful way which as smart knew meant nothing in connection with going on  theres pason maybold toothats all against me  what about he  shes never been stuffing into thy innocent heart that hes in hove with her  lord the vanity o maidens  no no  but he called and she looked at him in such a way and at me in such a wayquite different the ways wereand as i was coming off there was he hanging up her birdcage  well why shouldnt the man hang up her birdcage  turk seize it all whats that got to do wi it  dick that thou beest a whitelyvered chap i dont say but if thou beestnt as mad as a cappelfaced bull let me smile no more  o ay  and whats think now dick  i dont know  heres another pretty kettle o fish for thee  who dye thinks the bitter weed in our being turned out  did our party tell ee  no  why pason maybold i suppose  shinerbecause hes in love with thy young woman and dwant to see her young figure sitting up at that queer instrument and her young fingers rumstrumming upon the keys  a sharp ado of sweet and bitter was going on in dick during this communication from his father  shiners a foolno thats not it i dont believe any such thing father  why shiner would never take a bold step like that unless shed been a little made up to and had taken it kindly  pooh  whos to say she didnt  i do  the more fool you  why father of me  has she ever done more to thee  no  then she has done as much to herot em  now dick this is how a maid is  shell swear shes dying for thee and she is dying for thee and she will die for thee but shell fling a look over tother shoulder at another young feller though never leaving off dying for thee just the same  shes not dying for me and so she didnt fling a look at him  but she may be dying for him for she looked at thee  i dont know what to make of it at all said dick gloomily  all i can make of it is the tranter said raising his whip arranging his different joints and muscles and motioning to the horse to move on that if you cant read a maids mind by her motions nature dseem to say thoust ought to be a bachelor  clk clk  smiler  and the tranter moved on  dick held smarts rein firmly and the whole concern of horse cart and man remained rooted in the lane  how long this condition would have lasted is unknown had not dicks thoughts after adding up numerous items of misery gradually wandered round to the fact that as something must be done it could not be done by staying there all night  reaching home he went up to his bedroom shut the door as if he were going to be seen no more in this life and taking a sheet of paper and uncorking the inkbottle he began a letter  the dignity of the writers mind was so powerfully apparent in every line of this effusion that it obscured the logical sequence of facts and intentions to an appreciable degree and it was not at all clear to a reader whether he there and then left off loving miss fancy day whether he had never loved her seriously and never meant to whether he had been dying up to the present moment and now intended to get well again or whether he had hitherto been in good health and intended to die for her forthwith  he put this letter in an envelope sealed it up directed it in a stern handwriting of straight dasheseasy flourishes being rigorously excluded  he walked with it in his pocket down the lane in strides not an inch less than three feet long  reaching her gate he put on a resolute expressionthen put it off again turned back homeward tore up his letter and sat down  that letter was altogether in a wrong tonethat he must own  a heartless manoftheworld tone was what the juncture required  that he rather wanted her and rather did not want herthe latter for choice but that as a member of society he didnt mind making a query in jaunty terms which could only be answered in the same way did she mean anything by her bearing towards him or did she not  this letter was considered so satisfactory in every way that being put into the hands of a little boy and the order given that he was to run with it to the school he was told in addition not to look behind him if dick called after him to bring it back but to run along with it just the same  having taken this precaution against vacillation dick watched his messenger down the road and turned into the house whistling an air in such ghastly jerks and starts that whistling seemed to be the act the very furthest removed from that which was instinctive in such a youth  the letter was left as ordered the next morning came and passedand no answer  the next  the next  friday night came  dick resolved that if no answer or sign were given by her the next day on sunday he would meet her face to face and have it all out by word of mouth  dick said his father coming in from the garden at that momentin each hand a hive of bees tied in a cloth to prevent their egressi think youd better take these two swarms of bees to mrs maybolds to morrow instead o me and ill go wi smiler and the wagon  it was a relief for mrs maybold the vicars mother who had just taken into her head a fancy for keeping bees pleasantly disguised under the pretence of its being an economical wish to produce her own honey lived near the wateringplace of budmouthregis ten miles off and the business of transporting the hives thither would occupy the whole day and to some extent annihilate the vacant time between this evening and the coming sunday  the best springcart was washed throughout the axles oiled and the bees placed therein for the journey     part the thirdsummer   chapter i driving out of budmouth   an easy bend of neck and graceful set of head full and wavy bundles of darkbrown hair light fall of little feet pretty devices on the skirt of the dress clear deep eyes in short a bunch of sweets it was fancy dicks heart went round to her with a rush  the scene was the corner of mary street in budmouthregis near the kings statue at which point the white angle of the last house in the row cut perpendicularly an embayed and nearly motionless expanse of salt water projected from the outer oceantoday lit in bright tones of green and opal  dick and smart had just emerged from the street and there on the right against the brilliant sheet of liquid colour stood fancy day and she turned and recognized him  dick suspended his thoughts of the letter and wonder at how she came there by driving close to the chains of the esplanadeincontinently displacing two chairmen who had just come to life for the summer in new clean shirts and revivified clothes and being almost displaced in turn by a rigid boy rattling along with a bakers cart and looking neither to the right nor the left  he asked if she were going to mellstock that night  yes im waiting for the carrier she replied seeming too to suspend thoughts of the letter  now i can drive you home nicely and you save half an hour  will ye come with me  as fancys power to will anything seemed to have departed in some mysterious manner at that moment dick settled the matter by getting out and assisting her into the vehicle without another word  the temporary flush upon her cheek changed to a lesser hue which was permanent and at length their eyes met there was present between them a certain feeling of embarrassment which arises at such moments when all the instinctive acts dictated by the position have been performed  dick being engaged with the reins thought less of this awkwardness than did fancy who had nothing to do but to feel his presence and to be more and more conscious of the fact that by accepting a seat beside him in this way she succumbed to the tone of his note  smart jogged along and dick jogged and the helpless fancy necessarily jogged too and she felt that she was in a measure captured and made a prisoner  i am so much obliged to you for your company miss day he observed as they drove past the two semicircular bays of the old royal hotel where his majesty king george the third had many a time attended the balls of the burgesses  to miss day crediting him with the same consciousness of masterya consciousness of which he was perfectly innocentthis remark sounded like a magnanimous intention to soothe her the captive  i didnt come for the pleasure of obliging you with my company she said  the answer had an unexpected manner of incivility in it that must have been rather surprising to young dewy  at the same time it may be observed that when a young woman returns a rude answer to a young mans civil remark her heart is in a state which argues rather hopefully for his case than otherwise  there was silence between them till they had left the seafront and passed about twenty of the trees that ornamented the road leading up out of the town towards casterbridge and mellstock  though i didnt come for that purpose either i would have done it said dick at the twentyfirst tree  now mr dewy no flirtation because its wrong and i dont wish it  dick seated himself afresh just as he had been sitting before arranged his looks very emphatically and cleared his throat  really anybody would think you had met me on business and were just going to commence said the lady intractably  yes they would  why you never have to be sure  this was a shaky beginning  he chopped round and said cheerily as a man who had resolved never to spoil his jollity by loving one of womankind  well how are you getting on miss day at the present time  gaily i dont doubt for a moment  i am not gay dick you know that  gaily doesnt mean decked in gay dresses  i didnt suppose gaily was gaily dressed  mighty me what a scholar youve grown  lots of things have happened to you this spring i see  what have you seen  o nothing ive heard i mean  what have you heard  the name of a pretty man with brass studs and a copper ring and a tin watchchain a little mixed up with your own  thats all  thats a very unkind picture of mr shiner for thats who you mean  the studs are gold as you know and its a real silver chain the ring i cant conscientiously defend and he only wore it once  he might have worn it a hundred times without showing it half so much  well hes nothing to me she serenely observed  not any more than i am  now mr dewy said fancy severely certainly he isnt any more to me than you are  not so much  she looked aside to consider the precise compass of that question  that i cant exactly answer she replied with soft archness  as they were going rather slowly another springcart containing a farmer farmers wife and farmers man jogged past them and the farmers wife and farmers man eyed the couple very curiously  the farmer never looked up from the horses tail  why cant you exactly answer said dick quickening smart a little and jogging on just behind the farmer and farmers wife and man  as no answer came and as their eyes had nothing else to do they both contemplated the picture presented in front and noticed how the farmers wife sat flattened between the two men who bulged over each end of the seat to give her room till they almost sat upon their respective wheels and they looked too at the farmers wifes silk mantle inflating itself between her shoulders like a balloon and sinking flat again at each jog of the horse  the farmers wife feeling their eyes sticking into her back looked over her shoulder  dick dropped ten yards further behind  fancy why cant you answer he repeated  because how much you are to me depends upon how much i am to you said she in low tones  everything said dick putting his hand towards hers and casting emphatic eyes upon the upper curve of her cheek  now richard dewy no touching me  i didnt say in what way your thinking of me affected the questionperhaps inversely dont you see no touching sir  look goodness me dont dick  the cause of her sudden start was the unpleasant appearance over dicks right shoulder of an empty timberwagon and four journeymencarpenters reclining in lazy postures inside it their eyes directed upwards at various oblique angles into the surrounding world the chief object of their existence being apparently to criticize to the very backbone and marrow every animate object that came within the compass of their vision this difficulty of dicks was overcome by trotting on till the wagon and carpenters were beginning to look rather misty by reason of a film of dust that accompanied their wagonwheels and rose around their heads like a fog  say you love me fancy  no dick certainly not tisnt time to do that yet  why fancy  miss day is better at presentdont mind my saying so and i ought not to have called you dick  nonsense when you know that i would do anything on earth for your love why you make any one think that loving is a thing that can be done and undone and put on and put off at a mere whim  no no i dont she said gently but there are things which tell me i ought not to give way to much thinking about you even if  but you want to dont you  yes say you do it is best to be truthful whatever they may say about a womans right to conceal where her love lies and pretend it doesnt exist and things like that it is not best i do know it fancy  and an honest woman in that as well as in all her daily concerns shines most brightly and is thought most of in the long run  well then perhaps dick i do love you a little she whispered tenderly but i wish you wouldnt say any more now  i wont say any more now then if you dont like it dear  but you do love me a little dont you  now you ought not to want me to keep saying things twice i cant say any more now and you must be content with what you have  i may at any rate call you fancy  theres no harm in that  yes you may  and youll not call me mr dewy any more  very well    chapter ii further along the road   dicks spirits having risen in the course of these admissions of his sweetheart he now touched smart with the whip and on smarts neck not far behind his ears  smart who had been lost in thought for some time never dreaming that dick could reach so far with a whip which on this particular journey had never been extended further than his flank tossed his head and scampered along with exceeding briskness which was very pleasant to the young couple behind him till turning a bend in the road they came instantly upon the farmer farmers man and farmers wife with the flapping mantle all jogging on just the same as ever  bother those people  here we are upon them again  well of course  they have as much right to the road as we  yes but it is provoking to be overlooked so  i like a road all to myself  look what a lumbering affair theirs is  the wheels of the farmers cart just at that moment jogged into a depression running across the road giving the cart a twist whereupon all three nodded to the left and on coming out of it all three nodded to the right and went on jerking their backs in and out as usual  well pass them when the road gets wider  when an opportunity seemed to offer itself for carrying this intention into effect they heard light flying wheels behind and on their quartering there whizzed along past them a brandnew gig so brightly polished that the spokes of the wheels sent forth a continual quivering light at one point in their circle and all the panels glared like mirrors in dick and fancys eyes  the driver and owner as it appeared was really a handsome man his companion was shiner  both turned round as they passed dick and fancy and stared with bold admiration in her face till they were obliged to attend to the operation of passing the farmer  dick glanced for an instant at fancy while she was undergoing their scrutiny then returned to his driving with rather a sad countenance  why are you so silent she said after a while with real concern  nothing  yes it is dick  i couldnt help those people passing  i know that  you look offended with me  what have i done  i cant tell without offending you  better out  well said dick who seemed longing to tell even at the risk of offending her i was thinking how different you in love are from me in love  whilst those men were staring you dismissed me from your thoughts altogether and  you cant offend me further now tell all  and showed upon your face a pleased sense of being attractive to em  dont be silly dick  you know very well i didnt  dick shook his head sceptically and smiled  dick i always believe flattery if possibleand it was possible then now theres an open confession of weakness  but i showed no consciousness of it  dick perceiving by her look that she would adhere to her statement charitably forbore saying anything that could make her prevaricate  the sight of shiner too had recalled another branch of the subject to his mind that which had been his greatest trouble till her company and words had obscured its probability  by the way fancy do you know why our quire is to be dismissed  no except that it is mr maybolds wish for me to play the organ  do you know how it came to be his wish  that i dont  mr shiner being churchwarden has persuaded the vicar who however was willing enough before  shiner i know is crazy to see you playing every sunday i suppose hell turn over your music for the organ will be close to his pew  buti know you have never encouraged him  never once said fancy emphatically and with eyes full of earnest truth  i dont like him indeed and i never heard of his doing this before  i have always felt that i should like to play in a church but i never wished to turn you and your choir out and i never even said that i could play till i was asked  you dont think for a moment that i did surely do you  i know you didnt dear  or that i care the least morsel of a bit for him  i know you dont  the distance between budmouth and mellstock was ten or eleven miles and there being a good inn the ship four miles out of budmouth with a mast and crosstrees in front dicks custom in driving thither was to divide the journey into three stages by resting at this inn going and coming and not troubling the budmouth stables at all whenever his visit to the town was a mere call and deposit as today  fancy was ushered into a little tearoom and dick went to the stables to see to the feeding of smart  in face of the significant twitches of feature that were visible in the ostler and labouring men idling around dick endeavoured to look unconscious of the fact that there was any sentiment between him and fancy beyond a tranters desire to carry a passenger home  he presently entered the inn and opened the door of fancys room  dick do you know it has struck me that it is rather awkward my being here alone with you like this  i dont think you had better come in with me  thats rather unpleasant dear  yes it is and i wanted you to have some tea as well as myself too because you must be tired  well let me have some with you then  i was denied once before if you recollect fancy  yes yes never mind  and it seems unfriendly of me now but i dont know what to do  it shall be as you say then  dick began to retreat with a dissatisfied wrinkling of face and a farewell glance at the cosy tea tray  but you dont see how it is dick when you speak like that she said with more earnestness than she had ever shown before  you do know that even if i care very much for you i must remember that i have a difficult position to maintain  the vicar would not like me as his schoolmistress to indulge in a teteatete anywhere with anybody  but i am not any body exclaimed dick  no no i mean with a young man and she added softly unless i were really engaged to be married to him  is that all  then dearest dearest why well be engaged at once to be sure we will and down i sit  there it is as easy as a glove  ah but suppose i wont  and goodness me what have i done she faltered getting very red  positively it seems as if i meant you to say that  lets do it  i mean get engaged said dick  now fancy will you be my wife  do you know dick it was rather unkind of you to say what you did coming along the road she remarked as if she had not heard the latter part of his speech though an acute observer might have noticed about her breast as the word wife fell from dicks lips a soft silent escape of breaths with very short rests between each  what did i say  about my trying to look attractive to those men in the gig  you couldnt help looking so whether you tried or no  and fancy you do care for me  yes  very much  yes  and youll be my own wife  her heart quickened adding to and withdrawing from her cheek varying tones of red to match each varying thought  dick looked expectantly at the ripe tint of her delicate mouth waiting for what was coming forth  yesif father will let me  dick drew himself close to her compressing his lips and pouting them out as if he were about to whistle the softest melody known  o no said fancy solemnly  the modest dick drew back a little  dick dick kiss me and let me go instantlyheres somebody coming she whisperingly exclaimed      half an hour afterwards dick emerged from the inn and if fancys lips had been real cherries probably dicks would have appeared deeply stained  the landlord was standing in the yard  heuheu hayhay master dewy  hoho he laughed letting the laugh slip out gently and by degrees that it might make little noise in its exit and smiting dick under the fifth rib at the same time  this will never do upon my life master dewy calling for tay for a feymel passenger and then going in and sitting down and having some too and biding such a fine long time  but surely you know said dick with great apparent surprise  yes yes  haha smiting the landlord under the ribs in return  why what  yes yes haha  you know of course  yes of course  butthat isi dont  why aboutbetween that young lady and me nodding to the window of the room that fancy occupied  no not i said the innkeeper bringing his eyes into circles  and you dont  not a word ill take my oath  but you laughed when i laughed  ay that was me sympathy so did you when i laughed  really you dont know  goodnessnot knowing that  ill take my oath i dont  o yes said dick with frigid rhetoric of pitying astonishment were engaged to be married you see and i naturally look after her  of course of course  i didnt know that and i hope yell excuse any little freedom of mine mr dewy  but it is a very odd thing i was talking to your father very intimate about family matters only last friday in the world and who should come in but keeper day and we all then fell atalking o family matters but neither one o them said a mortal word about it knowen me too so many years and i at your fathers own wedding  tisnt what i should have expected from an old neighbour  well to say the truth we hadnt told father of the engagement at that time in fact twasnt settled  ah the business was done sunday  yes yes sundays the courting day heuheu  no twasnt done sunday in particular  after schoolhours this week  well a very good time a very proper good time  o no twasnt done then  coming along the road today then i suppose  not at all i wouldnt think of getting engaged in a dogcart  dammymight as well have said at once the when be blowed  anyhow tis a fine day and i hope next time youll come as one  fancy was duly brought out and assisted into the vehicle and the newly affianced youth and maiden passed up the steep hill to the ridgeway and vanished in the direction of mellstock    chapter iii a confession   it was a morning of the latter summertime a morning of lingering dews when the grass is never dry in the shade  fuchsias and dahlias were laden till eleven oclock with small drops and dashes of water changing the colour of their sparkle at every movement of the air and elsewhere hanging on twigs like small silver fruit  the threads of garden spiders appeared thick and polished  in the dry and sunny places dozens of long legged craneflies whizzed off the grass at every step the passer took  fancy day and her friend susan dewy the tranters daughter were in such a spot as this pulling down a bough laden with early apples  three months had elapsed since dick and fancy had journeyed together from budmouth and the course of their love had run on vigorously during the whole time  there had been just enough difficulty attending its development and just enough finesse required in keeping it private to lend the passion an everincreasing freshness on fancys part whilst whether from these accessories or not dicks heart had been at all times as fond as could be desired  but there was a cloud on fancys horizon now  she is so well offbetter than any of us susan dewy was saying  her father farms five hundred acres and she might marry a doctor or curate or anything of that kind if she contrived a little  i dont think dick ought to have gone to that gipsyparty at all when he knew i couldnt go replied fancy uneasily  he didnt know that you would not be there till it was too late to refuse the invitation said susan  and what was she like  tell me  well she was rather pretty i must own  tell straight on about her cant you  come do susan  how many times did you say he danced with her  once  twice i think you said  indeed im sure i didnt  well and he wanted to again i expect  no i dont think he did  she wanted to dance with him again bad enough i know  everybody does with dick because hes so handsome and such a clever courter  o i wishhow did you say she wore her hair  in long curlsand her hair is light and it curls without being put in paper thats how it is shes so attractive  shes trying to get him away yes yes she is  and through keeping this miserable school i mustnt wear my hair in curls  but i will i dont care if i leave the school and go home i will wear my curls  look susan do is her hair as soft and long as this  fancy pulled from its coil under her hat a twine of her own hair and stretched it down her shoulder to show its length looking at susan to catch her opinion from her eyes  it is about the same length as that i think said miss dewy  fancy paused hopelessly  i wish mine was lighter like hers she continued mournfully  but hers isnt so soft is it  tell me now  i dont know  fancy abstractedly extended her vision to survey a yellow butterfly and a redandblack butterfly that were flitting along in company and then became aware that dick was advancing up the garden  susan heres dick coming i suppose thats because weve been talking about him  well then i shall go indoors nowyou wont want me and susan turned practically and walked off  enter the singleminded dick whose only fault at the gipsying or picnic had been that of loving fancy too exclusively and depriving himself of the innocent pleasure the gathering might have afforded him by sighing regretfully at her absencewho had danced with the rival in sheer despair of ever being able to get through that stale flat and unprofitable afternoon in any other way but this she would not believe  fancy had settled her plan of emotion  to reproach dick  o no no  i am in great trouble said she taking what was intended to be a hopelessly melancholy survey of a few small apples lying under the tree yet a critical ear might have noticed in her voice a tentative tone as to the effect of the words upon dick when she uttered them  what are you in trouble about  tell me of it said dick earnestly darling i will share it with ee and help ee  no no you cant  nobody can  why not  you dont deserve it whatever it is  tell me dear  o it isnt what you think  it is dreadful my own sin  sin fancy as if you could sin  i know it cant be  tis tis said the young lady in a pretty little frenzy of sorrow i have done wrong and i dont like to tell it  nobody will forgive me nobody and you above all will not    i have allowed myself totofl  whatnot flirt he said controlling his emotion as it were by a sudden pressure inward from his surface  and you said only the day before yesterday that you hadnt flirted in your life  yes i did and that was a wicked story  i have let another love me and  good g  well ill forgive youyes if you couldnt help ityes i will said the now dismal dick  did you encourage him  oi dont knowyesno  o i think so  who was it  a pause  tell me  mr shiner  after a silence that was only disturbed by the fall of an apple a long checked sigh from dick and a sob from fancy he said with real austerity  tell it allevery word  he looked at me and i looked at him and he said will you let me show you how to catch bullfinches down here by the stream  and iwanted to know very muchi did so long to have a bullfinch  i couldnt help that and i said yes and then he said come here  and i went with him down to the lovely river and then he said to me look and see how i do it and then youll know i put this birdlime round this twig and then i go here he said and hide away under a bush and presently clever mister bird comes and perches upon the twig and flaps his wings and youve got him before you can say jacksomething o o o i forget what  jack sprat mournfully suggested dick through the cloud of his misery  no not jack sprat she sobbed  then twas jack robinson he said with the emphasis of a man who had resolved to discover every iota of the truth or die  yes that was it  and then i put my hand upon the rail of the bridge to get across andthats all  well that isnt much either said dick critically and more cheerfully  not that i see what business shiner has to take upon himself to teach you anything  but it seemsit do seem there must have been more than that to set you up in such a dreadful taking  he looked into fancys eyes  misery of miseriesguilt was written there still  now fancy youve not told me all said dick rather sternly for a quiet young man  o dont speak so cruelly  i am afraid to tell now  if you hadnt been harsh i was going on to tell all now i cant  come dear fancy tell come  ill forgive i mustby heaven and earth i must whether i will or no i love you so  well when i put my hand on the bridge he touched it  a scamp said dick grinding an imaginary human frame to powder  and then he looked at me and at last he said are you in love with dick dewy  and i said perhaps i am and then he said i wish you werent then for i want to marry you with all my soul  theres a villain now  want to marry you  and dick quivered with the bitterness of satirical laughter  then suddenly remembering that he might be reckoning without his host unless to be sure you are willing to have himperhaps you are he said with the wretched indifference of a castaway  no indeed i am not she said her sobs just beginning to take a favourable turn towards cure  well then said dick coming a little to his senses youve been stretching it very much in giving such a dreadful beginning to such a mere nothing  and i know what youve done it forjust because of that gipsyparty  he turned away from her and took five paces decisively as if he were tired of an ungrateful country including herself  you did it to make me jealous and i wont stand it  he flung the words to her over his shoulder and then stalked on apparently very anxious to walk to the remotest of the colonies that very minute  o o o dickdick she cried trotting after him like a pet lamb and really seriously alarmed at last youll kill me  my impulses are badmiserably wickedand i cant help it forgive me dick  and i love you always and those times when you look silly and dont seem quite good enough for mejust the same i do dick  and there is something more serious though not concerning that walk with him  well what is it said dick altering his mind about walking to the colonies in fact passing to the other extreme and standing so rooted to the road that he was apparently not even going home  why this she said drying the beginning of a new flood of tears she had been going to shed this is the serious part  father has told mr shiner that he would like him for a soninlaw if he could get methat he has his right hearty consent to come courting me    chapter iv an arrangement   that is serious said dick more intellectually than he had spoken for a long time  the truth was that geoffrey knew nothing about his daughters continued walks and meetings with dick  when a hint that there were symptoms of an attachment between them had first reached geoffreys ears he stated so emphatically that he must think the matter over before any such thing could be allowed that rather unwisely on dicks part whatever it might have been on the ladys the lovers were careful to be seen together no more in public and geoffrey forgetting the report did not think over the matter at all  so mr shiner resumed his old position in geoffreys brain by mere flux of time  even shiner began to believe that dick existed for fancy no morethough that remarkably easygoing man had taken no active steps on his own account as yet  and father has not only told mr shiner that continued fancy but he has written me a letter to say he should wish me to encourage mr shiner if twas convenient  i must start off and see your father at once said dick taking two or three vehement steps to the south recollecting that mr day lived to the north and coming back again  i think we had better see him together  not tell him what you come for or anything of the kind until he likes you and so win his brain through his heart which is always the way to manage people  i mean in this way i am going home on saturday week to help them in the honeytaking  you might come there to me have something to eat and drink and let him guess what your coming signifies without saying it in so many words  well do it dearest  but i shall ask him for you flat and plain not wait for his guessing  and the lover then stepped close to her and attempted to give her one little kiss on the cheek his lips alighting however on an outlying tract of her back hair by reason of an impulse that had caused her to turn her head with a jerk  yes and ill put on my secondbest suit and a clean shirt and collar and black my boots as if twas a sunday  twill have a good appearance you see and thats a great deal to start with  you wont wear that old waistcoat will you dick  bless you no  why i  i didnt mean to be personal dear dick she said fearing she had hurt his feelings  tis a very nice waistcoat but what i meant was that though it is an excellent waistcoat for a settleddown man it is not quite one for she waited and a blush expanded over her face and then she went on againfor going courting in  no ill wear my best winter one with the leather lining that mother made  it is a beautiful handsome waistcoat inside yes as ever anybody saw  in fact only the other day i unbuttoned it to show a chap that very lining and he said it was the strongest handsomest lining you could wish to see on the kings waistcoat himself  i dont quite know what to wear she said as if her habitual indifference alone to dress had kept back so important a subject till now  why that blue frock you wore last week  doesnt set well round the neck  i couldnt wear that  but i shant care  no you wont mind  well then its all right  because you only care how you look to me do you dear  i only dress for you thats certain  yes but you see i couldnt appear in it again very well  any strange gentleman you mid meet in your journey might notice the set of it i suppose  fancy men in love dont think so much about how they look to other women  it is difficult to say whether a tone of playful banter or of gentle reproach prevailed in the speech  well then dick she said with goodhumoured frankness ill own it i shouldnt like a stranger to see me dressed badly even though i am in love  tis our nature i suppose  you perfect woman  yes if you lay the stress on woman she murmured looking at a group of hollyhocks in flower round which a crowd of butterflies had gathered like female idlers round a bonnetshop  but about the dress  why not wear the one you wore at our party  that sets well but a girl of the name of bet tallor who lives near our house has had one made almost like it only in pattern though of miserably cheap stuff and i couldnt wear it on that account  dear me i am afraid i cant go now  o yes you must i know you will said dick with dismay  why not wear what youve got on  what this old one  after all i think that by wearing my gray one saturday i can make the blue one do for sunday  yes i will  a hat or a bonnet which shall it be  which do i look best in  well i think the bonnet is nicest more quiet and matronly  whats the objection to the hat  does it make me look old  o no the hat is well enough but it makes you look rather tooyou wont mind me saying it dear  not at all for i shall wear the bonnet  rather too coquettish and flirty for an engaged young woman  she reflected a minute  yes yes  still after all the hat would do best hats are best you see  yes i must wear the hat dear dicky because i ought to wear a hat you know     part the fourthautumn   chapter i going nutting   dick dressed in his secondbest suit burst into fancys sittingroom with a glow of pleasure on his face  it was two oclock on friday the day before her contemplated visit to her father and for some reason connected with cleaning the school the children had been given this friday afternoon for pastime in addition to the usual saturday  fancy it happens just right that it is a leisure half day with you smart is lame in his nearfootafore and so as i cant do anything ive made a holiday afternoon of it and am come for you to go nutting with me  she was sitting by the parlour window with a blue frock lying across her lap and scissors in her hand  go nutting  yes  but im afraid i cant go for an hour or so  why not  tis the only spare afternoon we may both have together for weeks  this dress of mine that i am going to wear on sunday at yalburyi find it fits so badly that i must alter it a little after all  i told the dressmaker to make it by a pattern i gave her at the time instead of that she did it her own way and made me look a perfect fright  how long will you be he inquired looking rather disappointed  not long  do wait and talk to me come do dear  dick sat down  the talking progressed very favourably amid the snipping and sewing till about halfpast two at which time his conversation began to be varied by a slight tapping upon his toe with a walkingstick he had cut from the hedge as he came along  fancy talked and answered him but sometimes the answers were so negligently given that it was evident her thoughts lay for the greater part in her lap with the blue dress  the clock struck three  dick arose from his seat walked round the room with his hands behind him examined all the furniture then sounded a few notes on the harmonium then looked inside all the books he could find then smoothed fancys head with his hand  still the snipping and sewing went on  the clock struck four  dick fidgeted about yawned privately counted the knots in the table yawned publicly counted the flies on the ceiling yawned horribly went into the kitchen and scullery and so thoroughly studied the principle upon which the pump was constructed that he could have delivered a lecture on the subject  stepping back to fancy and finding still that she had not done he went into her garden and looked at her cabbages and potatoes and reminded himself that they seemed to him to wear a decidedly feminine aspect then pulled up several weeds and came in again  the clock struck five and still the snipping and sewing went on  dick attempted to kill a fly peeled all the rind off his walkingstick then threw the stick into the scullery because it was spoilt produced hideous discords from the harmonium and accidentally overturned a vase of flowers the water from which ran in a rill across the table and dribbled to the floor where it formed a lake the shape of which after the lapse of a few minutes he began to modify considerably with his foot till it was like a map of england and wales  well dick you neednt have made quite such a mess  well i neednt i suppose  he walked up to the blue dress and looked at it with a rigid gaze  then an idea seemed to cross his brain  fancy  yes  i thought you said you were going to wear your gray gown all day tomorrow on your trip to yalbury and in the evening too when i shall be with you and ask your father for you  so i am  and the blue one only on sunday  and the blue one sunday  well dear i shant be at yalbury sunday to see it  no but i shall walk to longpuddle church in the afternoon with father and such lots of people will be looking at me there you know and it did set so badly round the neck  i never noticed it and tis like nobody else would  they might  then why not wear the gray one on sunday as well  tis as pretty as the blue one  i might make the gray one do certainly  but it isnt so good it didnt cost half so much as this one and besides it would be the same i wore saturday  then wear the striped one dear  i might  or the dark one  yes i might but i want to wear a fresh one they havent seen  i see i see said dick in a voice in which the tones of love were decidedly inconvenienced by a considerable emphasis his thoughts meanwhile running as follows i the man she loves best in the world as she says am to understand that my poor halfholiday is to be lost because she wants to wear on sunday a gown there is not the slightest necessity for wearing simply in fact to appear more striking than usual in the eyes of longpuddle young men and i not there either  then there are three dresses good enough for my eyes but neither is good enough for the youths of longpuddle he said  no not that exactly dick  still you see i do wantto look pretty to themthere thats honest  but i shant be much longer  how much  a quarter of an hour  very well ill come in in a quarter of an hour  why go away  i mid as well  he went out walked down the road and sat upon a gate  here he meditated and meditated and the more he meditated the more decidedly did he begin to fume and the more positive was he that his time had been scandalously trifled with by miss fancy daythat so far from being the simple girl who had never had a sweetheart before as she had solemnly assured him time after time she was if not a flirt a woman who had had no end of admirers a girl most certainly too anxious about her frocks a girl whose feelings though warm were not deep a girl who cared a great deal too much how she appeared in the eyes of other men  what she loves best in the world he thought with an incipient spice of his fathers grimness is her hair and complexion  what she loves next best her gowns and hats what she loves next best myself perhaps  suffering great anguish at this disloyalty in himself and harshness to his darling yet disposed to persevere in it a horribly cruel thought crossed his mind  he would not call for her as he had promised at the end of a quarter of an hour  yes it would be a punishment she well deserved  although the best part of the afternoon had been wasted he would go nutting as he had intended and go by himself  he leaped over the gate and pushed up the lane for nearly two miles till a winding path called snailcreep sloped up a hill and entered a hazel copse by a hole like a rabbits burrow  in he plunged vanished among the bushes and in a short time there was no sign of his existence upon earth save an occasional rustling of boughs and snapping of twigs in divers points of greys wood  never man nutted as dick nutted that afternoon  he worked like a galley slave  halfhour after halfhour passed away and still he gathered without ceasing  at last when the sun had set and bunches of nuts could not be distinguished from the leaves which nourished them he shouldered his bag containing quite two pecks of the finest produce of the wood about as much use to him as two pecks of stones from the road strolled down the woodland track crossed the highway and entered the homeward lane whistling as he went  probably miss fancy day never before or after stood so low in mr dewys opinion as on that afternoon  in fact it is just possible that a few more blue dresses on the longpuddle young mens account would have clarified dicks brain entirely and made him once more a free man  but venus had planned other developments at any rate for the present cuckoolane the way he pursued passed over a ridge which rose keenly against the sky about fifty yards in his van  here upon the bright afterglow about the horizon was now visible an irregular shape which at first he conceived to be a bough standing a little beyond the line of its neighbours  then it seemed to move and as he advanced still further there was no doubt that it was a living being sitting in the bank head bowed on hand  the grassy margin entirely prevented his footsteps from being heard and it was not till he was close that the figure recognized him  up it sprang and he was face to face with fancy  dick dick  o is it you dick  yes fancy said dick in a rather repentant tone and lowering his nuts  she ran up to him flung her parasol on the grass put her little head against his breast and then there began a narrative disjointed by such a hysterical weeping as was never surpassed for intensity in the whole history of love  o dick she sobbed out where have you been away from me  o i have suffered agony and thought you would never come any more  tis cruel dick no tisnt it is justice  ive been walking miles and miles up and down greys wood trying to find you till i was wearied and worn out and i could walk no further and had come back this far  o dick directly you were gone i thought i had offended you and i put down the dress tisnt finished now and i never will finish it and ill wear an old one sunday  yes dick i will because i dont care what i wear when you are not by my sideha you think i do but i dontand i ran after you and i saw you go up snailcreep and not look back once and then you plunged in and i after you but i was too far behind  o i did wish the horrid bushes had been cut down so that i could see your dear shape again  and then i called out to you and nobody answered and i was afraid to call very loud lest anybody else should hear me  then i kept wandering and wandering about and it was dreadful misery dick  and then i shut my eyes and fell to picturing you looking at some other woman very pretty and nice but with no affection or truth in her at all and then imagined you saying to yourself ah shes as good as fancy for fancy told me a story and was a flirt and cared for herself more than me so now ill have this one for my sweetheart  o you wont will you dick for i do love you so  it is scarcely necessary to add that dick renounced his freedom there and then and kissed her ten times over and promised that no pretty woman of the kind alluded to should ever engross his thoughts in short that though he had been vexed with her all such vexation was past and that henceforth and for ever it was simply fancy or death for him  and then they set about proceeding homewards very slowly on account of fancys weariness she leaning upon his shoulder and in addition receiving support from his arm round her waist though she had sufficiently recovered from her desperate condition to sing to him why are you wandering here i pray during the latter part of their walk  nor is it necessary to describe in detail how the bag of nuts was quite forgotten until three days later when it was found among the brambles and restored empty to mrs dewy her initials being marked thereon in red cotton and how she puzzled herself till her head ached upon the question of how on earth her mealbag could have got into cuckoolane    chapter ii honeytaking and afterwards   saturday evening saw dick dewy journeying on foot to yalbury wood according to the arrangement with fancy  the landscape being concave at the going down of the sun everything suddenly assumed a uniform robe of shade  the evening advanced from sunset to dusk long before dicks arrival and his progress during the latter portion of his walk through the trees was indicated by the flutter of terrified birds that had been roosting over the path  and in crossing the glades masses of hot dry air that had been formed on the hills during the day greeted his cheeks alternately with clouds of damp night air from the valleys  he reached the keeperstewards house where the grassplot and the garden in front appeared light and pale against the unbroken darkness of the grove from which he had emerged and paused at the garden gate  he had scarcely been there a minute when he beheld a sort of procession advancing from the door in his front  it consisted first of enoch the trapper carrying a spade on his shoulder and a lantern dangling in his hand then came mrs day the light of the lantern revealing that she bore in her arms curious objects about a foot long in the form of latin crosses made of lath and brown paper dipped in brimstonecalled matches by beemasters next came miss day with a shawl thrown over her head and behind all in the gloom mr frederic shiner  dick in his consternation at finding shiner present was at a loss how to proceed and retired under a tree to collect his thoughts  here i be enoch said a voice and the procession advancing farther the lanterns rays illuminated the figure of geoffrey awaiting their arrival beside a row of beehives in front of the path  taking the spade from enoch he proceeded to dig two holes in the earth beside the hives the others standing round in a circle except mrs day who deposited her matches in the fork of an appletree and returned to the house  the party remaining were now lit up in front by the lantern in their midst their shadows radiating each way upon the gardenplot like the spokes of a wheel  an apparent embarrassment of fancy at the presence of shiner caused a silence in the assembly during which the preliminaries of execution were arranged the matches fixed the stake kindled the two hives placed over the two holes and the earth stopped round the edges  geoffrey then stood erect and rather more to straighten his backbone after the digging  they were a peculiar family said mr shiner regarding the hives reflectively  geoffrey nodded  those holes will be the grave of thousands said fancy  i think tis rather a cruel thing to do  her father shook his head  no he said tapping the hives to shake the dead bees from their cells if you suffocate em this way they only die once if you fumigate em in the new way they come to life again and die o starvation so the pangs o death be twice upon em  i incline to fancys notion said mr shiner laughing lightly  the proper way to take honey so that the bees be neither starved nor murdered is a puzzling matter said the keeper steadily  i should like never to take it from them said fancy  but tis the money said enoch musingly  for without money man is a shadder  the lanternlight had disturbed many bees that had escaped from hives destroyed some days earlier and demoralized by affliction were now getting a living as marauders about the doors of other hives  several flew round the head and neck of geoffrey then darted upon him with an irritated bizz  enoch threw down the lantern and ran off and pushed his head into a currant bush fancy scudded up the path and mr shiner floundered away helterskelter among the cabbages  geoffrey stood his ground unmoved and firm as a rock  fancy was the first to return followed by enoch picking up the lantern  mr shiner still remained invisible  have the craters stung ye said enoch to geoffrey  no not muchony a little here and there he said with leisurely solemnity shaking one bee out of his shirt sleeve pulling another from among his hair and two or three more from his neck  the rest looked on during this proceeding with a complacent sense of being out of itmuch as a european nation in a state of internal commotion is watched by its neighbours  are those all of them father said fancy when geoffrey had pulled away five  almost allthough i feel one or two more sticking into my shoulder and side  ah theres another just begun again upon my backbone  you lively young mortals how did you get inside there  however they cant sting me many times more poor things for they must be getting weak  they mid as well stay in me till bedtime now i suppose  as he himself was the only person affected by this arrangement it seemed satisfactory enough and after a noise of feet kicking against cabbages in a blundering progress among them the voice of mr shiner was heard from the darkness in that direction  is all quite safe again  no answer being returned to this query he apparently assumed that he might venture forth and gradually drew near the lantern again  the hives were now removed from their position over the holes one being handed to enoch to carry indoors and one being taken by geoffrey himself  bring hither the lantern fancy the spade can bide  geoffrey and enoch then went towards the house leaving shiner and fancy standing side by side on the gardenplot  allow me said shiner stooping for the lantern and seizing it at the same time with fancy  i can carry it said fancy religiously repressing all inclination to trifle  she had thoroughly considered that subject after the tearful explanation of the birdcatching adventure to dick and had decided that it would be dishonest in her as an engaged young woman to trifle with mens eyes and hands any more  finding that shiner still retained his hold of the lantern she relinquished it and he having found her retaining it also let go  the lantern fell and was extinguished  fancy moved on  where is the path said mr shiner  here said fancy  your eyes will get used to the dark in a minute or two  till that time will ye lend me your hand  fancy gave him the extreme tips of her fingers and they stepped from the plot into the path  you dont accept attentions very freely  it depends upon who offers them  a fellow like me for instance  a dead silence  well what do you say missie  it then depends upon how they are offered  not wildly and yet not carelesslike not purposely and yet not by chance not too quick nor yet too slow  how then said fancy  coolly and practically he said  how would that kind of love be taken  not anxiously and yet not indifferently neither blushing nor pale nor religiously nor yet quite wickedly  well how  not at all        geoffrey days storehouse at the back of his dwelling was hung with bunches of dried horehound mint and sage brownpaper bags of thyme and lavender and long ropes of clean onions  on shelves were spread large red and yellow apples and choice selections of early potatoes for seed next yearvulgar crowds of commoner kind lying beneath in heaps  a few empty beehives were clustered around a nail in one corner under which stood two or three barrels of new cider of the first crop each bubbling and squirting forth from the yet open bunghole  fancy was now kneeling beside the two inverted hives one of which rested against her lap for convenience in operating upon the contents  she thrust her sleeves above her elbows and inserted her small pink hand edgewise between each white lobe of honeycomb performing the act so adroitly and gently as not to unseal a single cell  then cracking the piece off at the crown of the hive by a slight backward and forward movement she lifted each portion as it was loosened into a large blue platter placed on a bench at her side  bother these little mortals said geoffrey who was holding the light to her and giving his back an uneasy twist  i really think i may as well go indoors and take em out poor things for they wont let me alone  theres two a stinging wi all their might now  im sure i wonder their strength can last so long  all right friend ill hold the candle whilst you are gone said mr shiner leisurely taking the light and allowing geoffrey to depart which he did with his usual long paces  he could hardly have gone round to the housedoor when other footsteps were heard approaching the outbuilding the tip of a finger appeared in the hole through which the wood latch was lifted and dick dewy came in having been all this time walking up and down the wood vainly waiting for shiners departure  fancy looked up and welcomed him rather confusedly  shiner grasped the candlestick more firmly and lest doing this in silence should not imply to dick with sufficient force that he was quite at home and cool he sang invincibly     king arthur he had three sons  father here said dick  indoors i think said fancy looking pleasantly at him  dick surveyed the scene and did not seem inclined to hurry off just at that moment  shiner went on singing     the miller was drownd in his pond       the weaver was hung in his yarn    and the d ran away with the little tailor       with the broadcloth under his arm  thats a terrible crippled rhyme if thats your rhyme said dick with a grain of superciliousness in his tone  its no use your complaining to me about the rhyme said mr shiner you must go to the man that made it  fancy by this time had acquired confidence  taste a bit mr dewy she said holding up to him a small circular piece of honeycomb that had been the last in the row of layers remaining still on her knees and flinging back her head to look in his face and then ill taste a bit too  and i if you please said mr shiner  nevertheless the farmer looked superior as if he could even now hardly join the trifling from very importance of station and after receiving the honeycomb from fancy he turned it over in his hand till the cells began to be crushed and the liquid honey ran down from his fingers in a thin string  suddenly a faint cry from fancy caused them to gaze at her  whats the matter dear said dick  it is nothing but oo a bee has stung the inside of my lip  he was in one of the cells i was eating  we must keep down the swelling or it may be serious said shiner stepping up and kneeling beside her  let me see it  no no  just let me see it said dick kneeling on the other side and after some hesitation she pressed down her lip with one finger to show the place  o i hope twill soon be better  i dont mind a sting in ordinary places but it is so bad upon your lip she added with tears in her eyes and writhing a little from the pain  shiner held the light above his head and pushed his face close to fancys as if the lip had been shown exclusively to himself upon which dick pushed closer as if shiner were not there at all  it is swelling said dick to her right aspect  it isnt swelling said shiner to her left aspect  is it dangerous on the lip cried fancy  i know it is dangerous on the tongue  o no not dangerous answered dick  rather dangerous had answered shiner simultaneously  i must try to bear it said fancy turning again to the hives  hartshornandoil is a good thing to put to it miss day said shiner with great concern  sweetoilandhartshorn ive found to be a good thing to cure stings miss day said dick with greater concern  we have some mixed indoors would you kindly run and get it for me she said  now whether by inadvertence or whether by mischievous intention the individuality of the you was so carelessly denoted that both dick and shiner sprang to their feet like twin acrobats and marched abreast to the door both seized the latch and lifted it and continued marching on shoulder to shoulder in the same manner to the dwellinghouse  not only so but entering the room they marched as before straight up to mrs days chair letting the door in the oak partition slam so forcibly that the rows of pewter on the dresser rang like a bell  mrs day fancy has stung her lip and wants you to give me the hartshorn please said mr shiner very close to mrs days face  o mrs day fancy has asked me to bring out the hartshorn please because she has stung her lip said dick a little closer to mrs days face  well men alive thats no reason why you should eat me i suppose said mrs day drawing back  she searched in the cornercupboard produced the bottle and began to dust the cork the rim and every other part very carefully dicks hand and shiners hand waiting side by side  which is head man said mrs day  now dont come mumbudgeting so close again  which is head man  neither spoke and the bottle was inclined towards shiner  shiner as a highclass man would not look in the least triumphant and turned to go off with it as geoffrey came downstairs after the search in his linen for concealed bees  othat you master dewy  dick assured the keeper that it was and the young man then determined upon a bold stroke for the attainment of his end forgetting that the worst of bold strokes is the disastrous consequences they involve if they fail  ive come on purpose to speak to you very particular mr day he said with a crushing emphasis intended for the ears of mr shiner who was vanishing round the doorpost at that moment  well ive been forced to go upstairs and unrind myself and shake some bees out o me said geoffrey walking slowly towards the open door and standing on the threshold  the young rascals got into my shirt and wouldnt be quiet nohow  dick followed him to the door  ive come to speak a word to you he repeated looking out at the pale mist creeping up from the gloom of the valley  you may perhaps guess what it is about  the keeper lowered his hands into the depths of his pockets twirled his eyes balanced himself on his toes looked as perpendicularly downward as if his glance were a plumbline then horizontally collecting together the cracks that lay about his face till they were all in the neighbourhood of his eyes  maybe i dont know he replied  dick said nothing and the stillness was disturbed only by some small bird that was being killed by an owl in the adjoining wood whose cry passed into the silence without mingling with it  ive left my hat up in chammer said geoffrey wait while i step up and get en  ill be in the garden said dick  he went round by a side wicket into the garden and geoffrey went upstairs  it was the custom in mellstock and its vicinity to discuss matters of pleasure and ordinary business inside the house and to reserve the garden for very important affairs a custom which as is supposed originated in the desirability of getting away at such times from the other members of the family when there was only one room for living in though it was now quite as frequently practised by those who suffered from no such limitation to the size of their domiciles  the headkeepers form appeared in the dusky garden and dick walked towards him  the elder paused and leant over the rail of a piggery that stood on the left of the path upon which dick did the same and they both contemplated a whitish shadowy shape that was moving about and grunting among the straw of the interior  ive come to ask for fancy said dick  id as lief you hadnt  why should that be mr day  because it makes me say that youve come to ask what ye bent likely to have  have ye come for anything else  nothing  then ill just tell ee youve come on a very foolish errand  dye know what her mother was  no  a teacher in a landed familys nursery who was foolish enough to marry the keeper of the same establishment for i was only a keeper then though now ive a dozen other irons in the fire as steward here for my lord what with the timber sales and the yearly fellings and the gravel and sand sales and one thing and tother  however dye think fancy picked up her good manners the smooth turn of her tongue her musical notes and her knowledge of books in a homely hole like this  no  dye know where  no  well when i went awandering after her mothers death she lived with her aunt who kept a boardingschool till her aunt married lawyer greena man as sharp as a needleand the school was broke up  did ye know that then she went to the trainingschool and that her name stood first among the queens scholars of her year  ive heard so  and that when she sat for her certificate as government teacher she had the highest of the first class  yes  well and do ye know what i live in such a miserly way for when ive got enough to do without it and why i make her work as a schoolmistress instead of living here  no  that if any gentleman who sees her to be his equal in polish should want to marry her and she want to marry him he shant be superior to her in pocket  now do ye think after this that you be good enough for her  no  then goodnight tee master dewy  goodnight mr day  modest dicks reply had faltered upon his tongue and he turned away wondering at his presumption in asking for a woman whom he had seen from the beginning to be so superior to him    chapter iii fancy in the rain   the next scene is a tempestuous afternoon in the following month and fancy day is discovered walking from her fathers home towards mellstock  a single vast gray cloud covered the country from which the small rain and mist had just begun to blow down in wavy sheets alternately thick and thin  the trees of the fields and plantations writhed like miserable men as the air wound its way swiftly among them the lowest portions of their trunks that had hardly ever been known to move were visibly rocked by the fiercer gusts distressing the mind by its painful unwontedness as when a strong man is seen to shed tears  lowhanging boughs went up and down high and erect boughs went to and fro the blasts being so irregular and divided into so many crosscurrents that neighbouring branches of the same tree swept the skies in independent motions crossed each other or became entangled  across the open spaces flew flocks of green and yellowish leaves which after travelling a long distance from their parent trees reached the ground and lay there with their undersides upward  as the rain and wind increased and fancys bonnetribbons leapt more and more snappishly against her chin she paused on entering mellstock lane to consider her latitude and the distance to a place of shelter  the nearest house was elizabeth endorfields in higher mellstock whose cottage and garden stood not far from the junction of that hamlet with the road she followed  fancy hastened onward and in five minutes entered a gate which shed upon her toes a flood of waterdrops as she opened it  come in chiel a voice exclaimed before fancy had knocked a promptness that would have surprised her had she not known that mrs endorfield was an exceedingly and exceptionally sharp woman in the use of her eyes and ears  fancy went in and sat down  elizabeth was paring potatoes for her husbands supper  scrape scrape scrape then a toss and splash went a potato into a bucket of water  now as fancy listlessly noted these proceedings of the dame she began to reconsider an old subject that lay uppermost in her heart  since the interview between her father and dick the days had been melancholy days for her  geoffreys firm opposition to the notion of dick as a sonin law was more than she had expected  she had frequently seen her lover since that time it is true and had loved him more for the opposition than she would have otherwise dreamt of doingwhich was a happiness of a certain kind  yet though love is thus an end in itself it must be believed to be the means to another end if it is to assume the rosy hues of an unalloyed pleasure  and such a belief fancy and dick were emphatically denied just now  elizabeth endorfield had a repute among women which was in its nature something between distinction and notoriety  it was founded on the following items of character  she was shrewd and penetrating her house stood in a lonely place she never went to church she wore a red cloak she always retained her bonnet indoors and she had a pointed chin  thus far her attributes were distinctly satanic and those who looked no further called her in plain terms a witch  but she was not gaunt nor ugly in the upper part of her face nor particularly strange in manner so that when her more intimate acquaintances spoke of her the term was softened and she became simply a deep body who was as longheaded as she was high  it may be stated that elizabeth belonged to a class of suspects who were gradually losing their mysterious characteristics under the administration of the young vicar though during the long reign of mr grinham the parish of mellstock had proved extremely favourable to the growth of witches  while fancy was revolving all this in her mind and putting it to herself whether it was worth while to tell her troubles to elizabeth and ask her advice in getting out of them the witch spoke  you be downproper down she said suddenly dropping another potato into the bucket  fancy took no notice  about your young man  fancy reddened  elizabeth seemed to be watching her thoughts  really one would almost think she must have the powers people ascribed to her  father not in the humour fort hey  another potato was finished and flung in  ah i know about it  little birds tell me things that people dont dream of my knowing  fancy was desperate about dick and here was a chanceo such a wicked chanceof getting help and what was goodness beside love  i wish youd tell me how to put him in the humour for it she said  that i could soon do said the witch quietly  really  o do anyhowi dont careso that it is done  how could i do it mrs endorfield  nothing so mighty wonderful in it  well but how  by witchery of course said elizabeth  no said fancy  tis i assure ye  didnt you ever hear i was a witch  well hesitated fancy i have heard you called so  and you believed it  i cant say that i did exactly believe it for tis very horrible and wicked but o how i do wish it was possible for you to be one  so i am  and ill tell you how to bewitch your father to let you marry dick dewy  will it hurt him poor thing  hurt who  father  no the charm is worked by common sense and the spell can only be broke by your acting stupidly  fancy looked rather perplexed and elizabeth went on     this fear of lizzwhatever tis    by great and small    she makes pretence to common sense    and thats all  you must do it like this  the witch laid down her knife and potato and then poured into fancys ear a long and detailed list of directions glancing up from the corner of her eye into fancys face with an expression of sinister humour  fancys face brightened clouded rose and sank as the narrative proceeded  there said elizabeth at length stooping for the knife and another potato do that and youll have him bylong and bylate my dear  and do it i will said fancy  she then turned her attention to the external world once more  the rain continued as usual but the wind had abated considerably during the discourse  judging that it was now possible to keep an umbrella erect she pulled her hood again over her bonnet bade the witch goodbye and went her way    chapter iv the spell   mrs endorfields advice was duly followed  i be proper sorry that your daughter isnt so well as she might be said a mellstock man to geoffrey one morning  but is there anything in it said geoffrey uneasily as he shifted his hat to the right  i cant understand the report  she didnt complain to me a bit when i saw her  no appetite at all they say  geoffrey crossed to mellstock and called at the school that afternoon fancy welcomed him as usual and asked him to stay and take tea with her  i bent much for tea this time o day he said but stayed  during the meal he watched her narrowly  and to his great consternation discovered the following unprecedented change in the healthy girlthat she cut herself only a diaphanous slice of breadandbutter and laying it on her plate passed the mealtime in breaking it into pieces but eating no more than about onetenth of the slice  geoffrey hoped she would say something about dick and finish up by weeping as she had done after the decision against him a few days subsequent to the interview in the garden  but nothing was said and in due time geoffrey departed again for yalbury wood  tis to be hoped poor miss fancy will be able to keep on her school said geoffreys man enoch to geoffrey the following week as they were shovelling up anthills in the wood  geoffrey stuck in the shovel swept seven or eight ants from his sleeve and killed another that was prowling round his ear then looked perpendicularly into the earth as usual waiting for enoch to say more well why shouldnt she said the keeper at last  the baker told me yesterday continued enoch shaking out another emmet that had run merrily up his thigh that the bread heve left at that there schoolhouse this last month would starve any mouse in the three creations that twould so  and afterwards i had a pint o small down at morrss and there i heard more  what might that ha been  that she used to have a pound o the best rolled butter a week regular as clockwork from dairyman vineys for herself as well as just so much salted for the helping girl and the ooman she calls in but now the same quantity dlast her three weeks and then tis thoughted she throws it away sour  finish doing the emmets and carry the bag homealong  the keeper resumed his gun tucked it under his arm and went on without whistling to the dogs who however followed with a bearing meant to imply that they did not expect any such attentions when their master was reflecting  on saturday morning a note came from fancy  he was not to trouble about sending her the couple of rabbits as was intended because she feared she should not want them  later in the day geoffrey went to casterbridge and called upon the butcher who served fancy with fresh meat which was put down to her fathers account  ive called to pay up our little bill neighbour haylock and you can gie me the chiels account at the same time  mr haylock turned round three quarters of a circle in the midst of a heap of joints altered the expression of his face from meat to money went into a little office consisting only of a door and a window looked very vigorously into a book which possessed length but no breadth and then seizing a piece of paper and scribbling thereupon handed the bill  probably it was the first time in the history of commercial transactions that the quality of shortness in a butchers bill was a cause of tribulation to the debtor  why this isnt all sheve had in a whole month said geoffrey  every mossel said the butchernow dan take that leg and shoulder to mrs whites and this eleven pound here to mr martinsyouve been treating her to smaller joints lately to my thinking mr day  only two or three little scram rabbits this last week as i am alivei wish i had  well my wife said to medan not too much not too much on that tray at a time better go twicemy wife said to me as she posted up the books she says miss day must have been affronted this summer during that hot muggy weather that spolit so much for us for depend upont she says sheve been trying john grimmett unknown to us see her account else  tis little of course at the best of times being only for one but now tis next kin to nothing  ill inquire said geoffrey despondingly  he returned by way of mellstock and called upon fancy in fulfilment of a promise  it being saturday the children were enjoying a holiday and on entering the residence fancy was nowhere to be seen  nan the charwoman was sweeping the kitchen  wheres my dater said the keeper  well you see she was tired with the weeks teaching and this morning she said nan i shant get up till the evening  you see mr day if people dont eat they cant work and as sheve gied up eating she must gie up working  have ye carried up any dinner to her  no she dont want any  there we all know that such things dont come without good reasonnot that i wish to say anything about a broken heart or anything of the kind  geoffreys own heart felt inconveniently large just then  he went to the staircase and ascended to his daughters door  fancy  come in father  to see a person in bed from any cause whatever on a fine afternoon is depressing enough and here was his only child fancy not only in bed but looking very pale  geoffrey was visibly disturbed  fancy i didnt expect to see thee here chiel he said  whats the matter  im not well father  hows that  because i think of things  what things can you have to think o so mortal much  you know father  you think ive been cruel to thee in saying that that penniless dick o thine shant marry thee i suppose  no answer  well you know fancy i do it for the best and he isnt good enough for thee  you know that well enough  here he again looked at her as she lay  well fancy i cant let my only chiel die and if you cant live without en you must ha en i suppose  o i dont want him like that all against your will and everything so disobedient sighed the invalid  no no tisnt against my will  my wish is now i dsee how tis hurten thee to live without en that he shall marry thee as soon as weve considered a little  thats my wish flat and plain fancy  there never cry my little maid  you ought to ha cried afore no need o crying now tis all over  well howsoever try to step over and see me and mother law tomorrow and ha a bit of dinner wi us  anddick too  ay dick too fars i know  and when do you think youll have considered father and he may marry me she coaxed  well there say next midsummer thats not a day too long to wait  on leaving the school geoffrey went to the tranters  old william opened the door  is your grandson dick in ithin william  no not just now mr day  though heve been at home a good deal lately  o hows that  what wi one thing and what wi tother hes all in a mope as might be said  dont seem the feller he used to  ay a will sit studding and thinking as if a were going to turn chapelmember and then do nothing but traypse and

hell do me the kindness to step over to yalbury tomorrow with my dater fancy if shes well enough  i dont like her to come by herself now shes not so terrible topping in health  so ive heard  ay sure ill tell him without fail    chapter v after gaining her point   the visit to geoffrey passed off as delightfully as a visit might have been expected to pass off when it was the first day of smooth experience in a hitherto obstructed lovecourse  and then came a series of several happy days of the same undisturbed serenity  dick could court her when he chose stay away when he chosewhich was never walk with her by winding streams and waterfalls and autumn scenery till dews and twilight sent them home  and thus they drew near the day of the harvest thanksgiving which was also the time chosen for opening the organ in mellstock church  it chanced that dick on that very day was called away from mellstock  a young acquaintance had died of consumption at charmley a neighbouring village on the previous monday and dick in fulfilment of a longstanding promise was to assist in carrying him to the grave  when on tuesday dick went towards the school to acquaint fancy with the fact it is difficult to say whether his own disappointment at being denied the sight of her triumphant debut as organist was greater than his vexation that his pet should on this great occasion be deprived of the pleasure of his presence  however the intelligence was communicated  she bore it as she best could not without many expressions of regret and convictions that her performance would be nothing to her now  just before eleven oclock on sunday he set out upon his sad errand  the funeral was to be immediately after the morning service and as there were four good miles to walk driving being inconvenient it became necessary to start comparatively early  half an hour later would certainly have answered his purpose quite as well yet at the last moment nothing would content his ardent mind but that he must go a mile out of his way in the direction of the school in the hope of getting a glimpse of his love as she started for church  striking therefore into the lane towards the school instead of across the ewelease direct to charmley he arrived opposite her door as his goddess emerged  if ever a woman looked a divinity fancy day appeared one that morning as she floated down those school steps in the form of a nebulous collection of colours inclining to blue  with an audacity unparalleled in the whole history of villageschoolmistresses at this datepartly owing no doubt to papas respectable accumulation of cash which rendered her profession not altogether one of necessityshe had actually donned a hat and feather and lowered her hitherto plainly loopedup hair which now fell about her shoulders in a profusion of curls  poor dick was astonished he had never seen her look so distractingly beautiful before save on christmaseve when her hair was in the same luxuriant condition of freedom  but his first burst of delighted surprise was followed by less comfortable feelings as soon as his brain recovered its power to think  fancy had blushedwas it with confusion  she had also involuntarily pressed back her curls  she had not expected him  fancy you didnt know me for a moment in my funeral clothes did you  goodmorning dickno really i didnt know you for an instant in such a sad suit  he looked again at the gay tresses and hat  youve never dressed so charming before dearest  i like to hear you praise me in that way dick she said smiling archly  it is meat and drink to a woman  do i look nice really  fie you know it  did you rememberi mean didnt you remember about my going away today  well yes i did dick but you know i wanted to look wellforgive me  yes darling yes of coursetheres nothing to forgive  no i was only thinking that when we talked on tuesday and wednesday and thursday and friday about my absence today and i was so sorry for it you said fancy so were you sorry and almost cried and said it would be no pleasure to you to be the attraction of the church today since i could not be there  my dear one neither will it be so much pleasure to me    but i do take a little delight in my life i suppose she pouted  apart from mine  she looked at him with perplexed eyes  i know you are vexed with me dick and it is because the first sunday i have curls and a hat and feather since i have been here happens to be the very day you are away and wont be with me  yes say it is for that is it  and you think that all this week i ought to have remembered you wouldnt be here to day and not have cared to be better dressed than usual  yes you do dick and it is rather unkind  no no said dick earnestly and simply i didnt think so badly of you as that  i only thought thatif you had been going away i shouldnt have tried new attractions for the eyes of other people  but then of course you and i are different naturally  well perhaps we are  whatever will the vicar say fancy  i dont fear what he says in the least she answered proudly  but he wont say anything of the sort you think  no no  he can hardly have conscience to indeed  now come you say dick that you quite forgive me for i must go she said with sudden gaiety and skipped backwards into the porch  come here sirsay you forgive me and then you shall kiss meyou never have yet when i have worn curls you know  yes just where you want to so muchyes you may  dick followed her into the inner corner where he was probably not slow in availing himself of the privilege offered  now thats a treat for you isnt it she continued  goodbye or i shall be late  come and see me tomorrow youll be tired tonight  thus they parted and fancy proceeded to the church  the organ stood on one side of the chancel close to and under the immediate eye of the vicar when he was in the pulpit and also in full view of the congregation  here she sat down for the first time in such a conspicuous position her seat having previously been in a remote spot in the aisle  good heavensdisgraceful  curls and a hat and feather said the daughters of the small gentry who had either only curly hair without a hat and feather or a hat and feather without curly hair  a bonnet for church always said sober matrons  that mr maybold was conscious of her presence close beside him during the sermon that he was not at all angry at her development of costume that he admired her she perceived  but she did not see that he loved her during that sermontime as he had never loved a woman before that her proximity was a strange delight to him and that he gloried in her musical success that morning in a spirit quite beyond a mere clerics glory at the inauguration of a new order of things  the old choir with humbled hearts no longer took their seats in the gallery as heretofore which was now given up to the schoolchildren who were not singers and a pupilteacher but were scattered about with their wives in different parts of the church  having nothing to do with conducting the service for almost the first time in their lives they all felt awkward out of place abashed and inconvenienced by their hands the tranter had proposed that they should stay away today and go nutting but grandfather william would not hear of such a thing for a moment  no he replied reproachfully and quoted a verse though this has come upon us let not our hearts be turned back or our steps go out of the way  so they stood and watched the curls of hair trailing down the back of the successful rival and the waving of her feather as she swayed her head after a few timid notes and uncertain touches her playing became markedly correct and towards the end full and free  but whether from prejudice or unbiassed judgment the venerable body of musicians could not help thinking that the simpler notes they had been wont to bring forth were more in keeping with the simplicity of their old church than the crowded chords and interludes it was her pleasure to produce    chapter vi into temptation   the day was done and fancy was again in the schoolhouse  about five oclock it began to rain and in rather a dull frame of mind she wandered into the schoolroom for want of something better to do  she was thinkingof her lover dick dewy  not precisely  of how weary she was of living alone how unbearable it would be to return to yalbury under the rule of her strangetempered stepmother that it was far better to be married to anybody than do that that eight or nine long months had yet to be lived through ere the wedding could take place  at the side of the room were high windows of hamhill stone upon either sill of which she could sit by first mounting a desk and using it as a footstool  as the evening advanced here she perched herself as was her custom on such wet and gloomy occasions put on a light shawl and bonnet opened the window and looked out at the rain  the window overlooked a field called the grove and it was the position from which she used to survey the crown of dicks passing hat in the early days of their acquaintance and meetings  not a living soul was now visible anywhere the rain kept all people indoors who were not forced abroad by necessity and necessity was less importunate on sundays than during the week  sitting here and thinking againof her lover or of the sensation she had created at church that daywell it is unknownthinking and thinking she saw a dark masculine figure arising into distinctness at the further end of the grovea man without an umbrella  nearer and nearer he came and she perceived that he was in deep mourning and then that it was dick  yes in the fondness and foolishness of his young heart after walking four miles in a drizzling rain without overcoat or umbrella and in face of a remark from his love that he was not to come because he would be tired he had made it his business to wander this mile out of his way again from sheer wish of spending ten minutes in her presence  o dick how wet you are she said as he drew up under the window why your coat shines as if it had been varnished and your hatmy goodness theres a streaming hat  o i dont mind darling said dick cheerfully  wet never hurts me though i am rather sorry for my best clothes  however it couldnt be helped we lent all the umbrellas to the women  i dont know when i shall get mine back  and look theres a nasty patch of something just on your shoulder  ah thats japanning it rubbed off the clamps of poor jacks coffin when we lowered him from our shoulders upon the bier  i dont care about that for twas the last deed i could do for him and tis hard if you cant afford a coat for an old friend  fancy put her hand to her mouth for half a minute  underneath the palm of that little hand there existed for that halfminute a little yawn  dick i dont like you to stand there in the wet  and you mustnt sit down  go home and change your things  dont stay another minute  one kiss after coming so far he pleaded  if i can reach then  he looked rather disappointed at not being invited round to the door  she twisted from her seated position and bent herself downwards but not even by standing on the plinth was it possible for dick to get his lips into contact with hers as she held them  by great exertion she might have reached a little lower but then she would have exposed her head to the rain  never mind dick kiss my hand she said flinging it down to him now goodbye  goodbye  he walked slowly away turning and turning again to look at her till he was out of sight  during the retreat she said to herself almost involuntarily and still conscious of that mornings triumphi like dick and i love him but how plain and sorry a man looks in the rain with no umbrella and wet through  as he vanished she made as if to descend from her seat but glancing in the other direction she saw another form coming along the same track  it was also that of a man  he too was in black from top to toe but he carried an umbrella  he drew nearer and the direction of the rain caused him so to slant his umbrella that from her height above the ground his head was invisible as she was also to him  he passed in due time directly beneath her and in looking down upon the exterior of his umbrella her feminine eyes perceived it to be of superior silkless common at that date than sinceand of elegant make  he reached the entrance to the building and fancy suddenly lost sight of him  instead of pursuing the roadway as dick had done he had turned sharply round into her own porch  she jumped to the floor hastily flung off her shawl and bonnet smoothed and patted her hair till the curls hung in passable condition and listened  no knock  nearly a minute passed and still there was no knock  then there arose a soft series of raps no louder than the tapping of a distant woodpecker and barely distinct enough to reach her ears  she composed herself and flung open the door  in the porch stood mr maybold  there was a warm flush upon his face and a bright flash in his eyes which made him look handsomer than she had ever seen him before  goodevening miss day  goodevening mr maybold she said in a strange state of mind  she had noticed beyond the ardent hue of his face that his voice had a singular tremor in it and that his hand shook like an aspen leaf when he laid his umbrella in the corner of the porch  without another word being spoken by either he came into the schoolroom shut the door and moved close to her  once inside the expression of his face was no more discernible by reason of the increasing dusk of evening  i want to speak to you he then said seriouslyon a perhaps unexpected subject but one which is all the world to mei dont know what it may be to you miss day  no reply  fancy i have come to ask you if you will be my wife  as a person who has been idly amusing himself with rolling a snowball might start at finding he had set in motion an avalanche so did fancy start at these words from the vicar  and in the dead silence which followed them the breathings of the man and of the woman could be distinctly and separately heard and there was this difference between themhis respirations gradually grew quieter and less rapid after the enunciation hers from having been low and regular increased in quickness and force till she almost panted  i cannot i cannot mr mayboldi cannot  dont ask me she said  dont answer in a hurry he entreated  and do listen to me  this is no sudden feeling on my part  i have loved you for more than six months perhaps my late interest in teaching the children here has not been so singleminded as it seemed  you will understand my motivelike me better perhaps for honestly telling you that i have struggled against my emotion continually because i have thought that it was not well for me to love you  but i resolved to struggle no longer i have examined the feeling and the love i bear you is as genuine as that i could bear any woman  i see your great charm i respect your natural talents and the refinement they have brought into your naturethey are quite enough and more than enough for me  they are equal to anything ever required of the mistress of a quiet parsonagehousethe place in which i shall pass my days wherever it may be situated  o fancy i have watched you criticized you even severely brought my feelings to the light of judgment and still have found them rational and such as any man might have expected to be inspired with by a woman like you  so there is nothing hurried secret or untoward in my desire to do this  fancy will you marry me  no answer was returned  dont refuse dont he implored  it would be foolish of youi mean cruel  of course we would not live here fancy  i have had for a long time the offer of an exchange of livings with a friend in yorkshire but i have hitherto refused on account of my mother  there we would go  your musical powers shall be still further developed you shall have whatever pianoforte you like you shall have anything fancy anything to make you happyponycarriage flowers birds pleasant society yes you have enough in you for any society after a few months of travel with me  will you fancy marry me  another pause ensued varied only by the surging of the rain against the windowpanes and then fancy spoke in a faint and broken voice  yes i will she said  god bless you my own  he advanced quickly and put his arm out to embrace her  she drew back hastily  no no not now she said in an agitated whisper  there are thingsbut the temptation is o too strong and i cant resist it i cant tell you now but i must tell you dont please dont come near me now  i want to think i can scarcely get myself used to the idea of what i have promised yet  the next minute she turned to a desk buried her face in her hands and burst into a hysterical fit of weeping  o leave me to myself she sobbed leave me  o leave me  dont be distressed dont dearest  it was with visible difficulty that he restrained himself from approaching her  you shall tell me at your leisure what it is that grieves you so i am happybeyond all measure happyat having your simple promise  and do go and leave me now  but i must not in justice to you leave for a minute until you are yourself again  there then she said controlling her emotion and standing up i am not disturbed now  he reluctantly moved towards the door  goodbye he murmured tenderly ill come tomorrow about this time    chapter vii second thoughts   the next morning the vicar rose early  the first thing he did was to write a long and careful letter to his friend in yorkshire  then eating a little breakfast he crossed the meadows in the direction of casterbridge bearing his letter in his pocket that he might post it at the town office and obviate the loss of one day in its transmission that would have resulted had he left it for the footpost through the village  it was a foggy morning and the trees shed in noisy waterdrops the moisture they had collected from the thick air an acorn occasionally falling from its cup to the ground in company with the drippings  in the meads sheets of spidersweb almost opaque with wet hung in folds over the fences and the falling leaves appeared in every variety of brown green and yellow hue  a low and merry whistling was heard on the highway he was approaching then the light footsteps of a man going in the same direction as himself on reaching the junction of his path with the road the vicar beheld dick dewys open and cheerful face  dick lifted his hat and the vicar came out into the highway that dick was pursuing  goodmorning dewy  how well you are looking said mr maybold  yes sir i am wellquite well  i am going to casterbridge now to get smarts collar we left it there saturday to be repaired  i am going to casterbridge so well walk together the vicar said dick gave a hop with one foot to put himself in step with mr maybold who proceeded i fancy i didnt see you at church yesterday dewy  or were you behind the pier  no i went to charmley  poor john dunford chose me to be one of his bearers a long time before he died and yesterday was the funeral  of course i couldnt refuse though i should have liked particularly to have been at home as twas the day of the new music  yes you should have been  the musical portion of the service was successfulvery successful indeed and what is more to the purpose no illfeeling whatever was evinced by any of the members of the old choir they joined in the singing with the greatest goodwill  twas natural enough that i should want to be there i suppose said dick smiling a private smile considering who the organplayer was  at this the vicar reddened a little and said yes yes though not at all comprehending dicks true meaning who as he received no further reply continued hesitatingly and with another smile denoting his pride as a lover  i suppose you know what i mean sir  youve heard about me andmiss day  the red in maybolds countenance went away he turned and looked dick in the face  no he said constrainedly ive heard nothing whatever about you and miss day  why shes my sweetheart and we are going to be married next midsummer we are keeping it rather close just at present because tis a good many months to wait but it is her fathers wish that we dont marry before and of course we must submit  but the time ill soon slip along  yes the time will soon slip alongtime glides away every dayyes  maybold said these words but he had no idea of what they were  he was conscious of a cold and sickly thrill throughout him and all he reasoned was this that the young creature whose graces had intoxicated him into making the most imprudent resolution of his life was less an angel than a woman  you see sir continued the ingenuous dick twill be better in one sense  i shall by that time be the regular manager of a branch o fathers business which has very much increased lately and business which we think of starting elsewhere  it has very much increased lately and we expect next year to keep a extra couple of horses  weve already our eye on onebrown as a berry neck like a rainbow fifteen hands and not a gray hair in heroffered us at twentyfive want a crown  and to kip pace with the times i have had some cards prented and i beg leave to hand you one sir  certainly said the vicar mechanically taking the card that dick offered him  i turn in here by greys bridge said dick  i suppose you go straight on and up town  yes  goodmorning sir  goodmorning dewy  maybold stood still upon the bridge holding the card as it had been put into his hand and dicks footsteps died away towards durnover mill  the vicars first voluntary action was to read the card     dewy and son    tranters and hauliers    mellstock    nbfurniture coals potatoes live and dead stock removed to any    distance on the shortest notice  mr maybold leant over the parapet of the bridge and looked into the river  he sawwithout heedinghow the water came rapidly from beneath the arches glided down a little steep then spread itself over a pool in which dace trout and minnows sported at ease among the long green locks of weed that lay heaving and sinking with their roots towards the current  at the end of ten minutes spent leaning thus he drew from his pocket the letter to his friend tore it deliberately into such minute fragments that scarcely two syllables remained in juxtaposition and sent the whole handful of shreds fluttering into the water  here he watched them eddy dart and turn as they were carried downwards towards the ocean and gradually disappeared from his view  finally he moved off and pursued his way at a rapid pace back again to mellstock vicarage  nerving himself by a long and intense effort he sat down in his study and wrote as follows     dear miss daythe meaning of your words the temptation is too    strong of your sadness and your tears has been brought home to me    by an accident  i know today what i did not know yesterdaythat you    are not a free woman     why did you not tell mewhy didnt you  did you suppose i knew  no    had i known my conduct in coming to you as i did would have been    reprehensible     but i dont chide you  perhaps no blame attaches to youi cant    tell  fancy though my opinion of you is assailed and disturbed in a    way which cannot be expressed i love you still and my word to you    holds good yet  but will you in justice to an honest man who relies    upon your word to him consider whether under the circumstances you    can honourably forsake himyours ever sincerely     arthur maybold  he rang the bell  tell charles to take these copybooks and this note to the school at once  the maid took the parcel and the letter and in a few minutes a boy was seen to leave the vicarage gate with the one under his arm and the other in his hand  the vicar sat with his hand to his brow watching the lad as he descended church lane and entered the waterside path which intervened between that spot and the school  here he was met by another boy and after a free salutation and pugilistic frisk had passed between the two the second boy came on his way to the vicarage and the other vanished out of sight  the boy came to the door and a note for mr maybold was brought in  he knew the writing  opening the envelope with an unsteady hand he read the subjoined words     dear mr mayboldi have been thinking seriously and sadly through    the whole of the night of the question you put to me last evening and    of my answer  that answer as an honest woman i had no right to    give     it is my natureperhaps all womensto love refinement of mind and    manners but even more than this to be ever fascinated with the idea    of surroundings more elegant and pleasing than those which have been    customary  and you praised me and praise is life to me  it was    alone my sensations at these things which prompted my reply  ambition    and vanity they would be called perhaps they are so     after this explanation i hope you will generously allow me to    withdraw the answer i too hastily gave     and one more request  to keep the meeting of last night and all    that passed between us there for ever a secret  were it to become    known it would utterly blight the happiness of a trusting and    generous man whom i love still and shall love alwaysyours    sincerely     fancy day  the last written communication that ever passed from the vicar to fancy was a note containing these words only     tell him everything it is best  he will forgive you     part the fifth conclusion   chapter i the knot theres no untying   the last day of the story is dated just subsequent to that point in the development of the seasons when country people go to bed among nearly naked trees are lulled to sleep by a fall of rain and awake next morning among green ones when the landscape appears embarrassed with the sudden weight and brilliancy of its leaves when the nightjar comes and strikes up for the summer his tune of one note when the appletrees have bloomed and the roads and orchardgrass become spotted with fallen petals when the faces of the delicate flowers are darkened and their heads weighed down by the throng of honeybees which increase their humming till humming is too mild a term for the allpervading sound and when cuckoos blackbirds and sparrows that have hitherto been merry and respectful neighbours become noisy and persistent intimates  the exterior of geoffrey days house in yalbury wood appeared exactly as was usual at that season but a frantic barking of the dogs at the back told of unwonted movements somewhere within  inside the door the eyes beheld a gathering which was a rarity indeed for the dwelling of the solitary woodsteward and keeper  about the room were sitting and standing in various gnarled attitudes our old acquaintance grandfathers james and william the tranter mr penny two or three children including jimmy and charley besides three or four country ladies and gentlemen from a greater distance who do not require any distinction by name  geoffrey was seen and heard stamping about the outhouse and among the bushes of the garden attending to details of daily routine before the proper time arrived for their performance in order that they might be off his hands for the day  he appeared with his shirtsleeves rolled up his best new nether garments in which he had arrayed himself that morning being temporarily disguised under a weekday apron whilst these proceedings were in operation  he occasionally glanced at the hives in passing to see if his wifes bees were swarming ultimately rolling down his shirtsleeves and going indoors talking to tranter dewy whilst buttoning the wristbands to save time next going upstairs for his best waistcoat and coming down again to make another remark whilst buttoning that during the time looking fixedly in the tranters face as if he were a lookingglass  the furniture had undergone attenuation to an alarming extent every duplicate piece having been removed including the clock by thomas wood ezekiel saunders being at last left sole referee in matters of time  fancy was stationary upstairs receiving her layers of clothes and adornments and answering by short fragments of laughter which had more fidgetiness than mirth in them remarks that were made from time to time by mrs dewy and mrs penny who were assisting her at the toilet mrs day having pleaded a queerness in her head as a reason for shutting herself up in an inner bedroom for the whole morning  mrs penny appeared with nine corkscrew curls on each side of her temples and a back comb stuck upon her crown like a castle on a steep  the conversation just now going on was concerning the banns the last publication of which had been on the sunday previous  and how did they sound fancy subtly inquired  very beautiful indeed said mrs penny  i never heard any sound better  but how  o so natural and elegant didnt they reuben she cried through the chinks of the unceiled floor to the tranter downstairs  whats that said the tranter looking up inquiringly at the floor above him for an answer  didnt dick and fancy sound well when they were called home in church last sunday came downwards again in mrs pennys voice  ay that they did my sonniesespecially the first time  there was a terrible whispering piece of work in the congregation wasnt there neighbour penny said the tranter taking up the thread of conversation on his own account and in order to be heard in the room above speaking very loud to mr penny who sat at the distance of three feet from him or rather less  i never can mind seeing such a whispering as there was said mr penny also loudly to the room above  and such sorrowful envy on the maidens faces really i never did see such envy as there was  fancys lineaments varied in innumerable little flushes and her heart palpitated innumerable little tremors of pleasure  but perhaps she said with assumed indifference it was only because no religion was going on just then  o no nothing to do with that  twas because of your high standing in the parish  it was just as if they had one and all caught dick kissing and coling ye to death wasnt it mrs dewy  ay that twas  how people will talk about ones doings fancy exclaimed  well if you make songs about yourself my dear you cant blame other people for singing em  mercy me how shall i go through it said the young lady again but merely to those in the bedroom with a breathing of a kind between a sigh and a pant round shining eyes and warm face  o youll get through it well enough child said mrs dewy placidly the edge of the performance is took off at the calling home and when once you get up to the chancel end o the church you feel as saucy as you please  im sure i felt as brave as a sodger all through the deedthough of course i dropped my face and looked modest as was becoming to a maid  mind you do that fancy  and i walked into the church as quiet as a lamb im sure subjoined mrs penny  there you see penny is such a little small man  but certainly i was flurried in the inside o me  well thinks i tis to be and here goes  and do you do the same say tis to be and here goes  is there such wonderful virtue in tis to be and here goes inquired fancy  wonderful  twill carry a body through it all from wedding to churching if you only let it out with spirit enough  very well then said fancy blushing  tis to be and here goes  thats a girl for a husband said mrs dewy  i do hope hell come in time continued the brideelect inventing a new cause of affright now that the other was demolished  twould be a thousand pities if he didnt come now you be so brave said mrs penny  grandfather james having overheard some of these remarks said downstairs with mischievous loudness  ive known some wouldbe weddings when the men didnt come  theyve happened not to come before now certainly said mr penny cleaning one of the glasses of his spectacles  o do hear what they are saying downstairs whispered fancy  hush hush  she listened  they have havent they geoffrey continued grandfather james as geoffrey entered  have what said geoffrey  the men have been known not to come  that they have said the keeper  ay ive knowed times when the wedding had to be put off through his not appearing being tired of the woman  and another case i knowed was when the man was catched in a mantrap crossing oakers wood and the three months had run out before he got well and the banns had to be published over again  how horrible said fancy  they only say it on purpose to tease ee my dear said mrs dewy  tis quite sad to think what wretched shifts poor maids have been put to came again from downstairs  ye should hear clerk wilkins my brotherlaw tell his experiences in marrying couples these last thirty year sometimes one thing sometimes anothertis quite heartrendingenough to make your hair stand on end  those things dont happen very often i know said fancy with smouldering uneasiness  well really tis time dick was here said the tranter  dont keep on at me so grandfather james and mr dewy and all you down there fancy broke out unable to endure any longer  i am sure i shall die or do something if you do  never you hearken to these old chaps miss day cried nat callcome the best man who had just entered and threw his voice upward through the chinks of the floor as the others had done  tis all right dicks coming on like a wild feller hell be here in a minute  the hive o bees his mother gied en for his new garden swarmed jist as he was starting and he said i cant afford to lose a stock o bees no that i cant though i fain would and fancy wouldnt wish it on any account so he jist stopped to ting to em and shake em  a genuine wise man said geoffrey  to be sure what a days work we had yesterday mr callcome continued lowering his voice as if it were not necessary any longer to include those in the room above among his audience and selecting a remote corner of his best clean handkerchief for wiping his face  to be sure  things so heavy i suppose said geoffrey as if reading through the chimneywindow from the far end of the vista  ay said nat looking round the room at points from which furniture had been removed  and so awkward to carry too  twas athart and across dicks garden in and out dicks door up and down dicks stairs round and round dicks chammers till legs were worn to stumps and dick is so particular too  and the stores of victuals and drink that lad has laid in why tis enough for noahs ark  im sure i never wish to see a choicer halfdozen of hams than hes got there in his chimley and the cider i tasted was a very pretty drop indeednone could desire a prettier cider  they be for the love and the stalled ox both  ah the greedy martels said grandfather james  well maybe they be  surely says i that couple between em have heaped up so much furniture and victuals that anybody would think they were going to take hold the big end of married life first and begin wi a grownup family  ah what a bath of heat we two chaps were in to be sure agetting that furniture in order  i do so wish the room below was ceiled said fancy as the dressing went on we can hear all they say and do down there  hark  whos that exclaimed a small pupilteacher who also assisted this morning to her great delight  she ran halfway down the stairs and peeped round the banister  o you should you should you should she exclaimed scrambling up to the room again  what said fancy  see the bridesmaids  theyve just a come  tis wonderful really tis wonderful how muslin can be brought to it  there they dont look a bit like themselves but like some very rich sisters o theirs that nobody knew they had  make em come up to me make em come up cried fancy ecstatically and the four damsels appointed namely miss susan dewy miss bessie dewy miss vashti sniff and miss mercy onmey surged upstairs and floated along the passage  i wish dick would come was again the burden of fancy  the same instant a small twig and flower from the creeper outside the door flew in at the open window and a masculine voice said ready fancy dearest  there he is he is cried fancy tittering spasmodically and breathing as it were for the first time that morning  the bridesmaids crowded to the window and turned their heads in the direction pointed out at which motion eight earrings all swung as onenot looking at dick because they particularly wanted to see him but with an important sense of their duty as obedient ministers of the will of that apotheosised beingthe bride  he looks very taking said miss vashti sniff a young lady who blushed creamcolour and wore yellow bonnet ribbons  dick was advancing to the door in a painfully new coat of shining cloth primrosecoloured waistcoat hat of the same painful style of newness and with an extra quantity of whiskers shaved off his face and hair cut to an unwonted shortness in honour of the occasion  now ill run down said fancy looking at herself over her shoulder in the glass and flitting off  o dick she exclaimed i am so glad you are come  i knew you would of course but i thought oh if you shouldnt  not come fancy  het or wet blow or snow here come i today  why whats possessing your little soul  you never used to mind such things a bit  ah mr dick i hadnt hoisted my colours and committed myself then said fancy  tis a pity i cant marry the whole five of ye said dick surveying them all round  hehhehheh laughed the four bridesmaids and fancy privately touched dick and smoothed him down behind his shoulder as if to assure herself that he was there in flesh and blood as her own property  well whoever would have thought such a thing said dick taking off his hat sinking into a chair and turning to the elder members of the company  the latter arranged their eyes and lips to signify that in their opinion nobody could have thought such a thing whatever it was  that my bees should ha swarmed just then of all times and seasons continued dick throwing a comprehensive glance like a net over the whole auditory  and tis a fine swarm too i havent seen such a fine swarm for these ten years  a excellent sign said mrs penny from the depths of experience  a excellent sign  i am glad everything seems so right said fancy with a breath of relief  and so am i said the four bridesmaids with much sympathy  well bees cant be put off observed the inharmonious grandfather james  marrying a woman is a thing you can do at any moment but a swarm o bees wont come for the asking  dick fanned himself with his hat  i cant think he said thoughtfully whatever twas i did to offend mr maybold a man i like so much too  he rather took to me when he came first and used to say he should like to see me married and that hed marry me whether the young woman i chose lived in his parish or no  i just hinted to him of it when i put in the banns but he didnt seem to take kindly to the notion now and so i said no more  i wonder how it was  i wonder said fancy looking into vacancy with those beautiful eyes of herstoo refined and beautiful for a tranters wife but perhaps not too good  altered his mind as folks will i suppose said the tranter  well my sonnies therell be a good strong party looking at us today as we go along  and the body of the church said geoffrey will be lined with females and a row of young fellers heads as far down as the eyes will be noticed just above the sills of the chancelwinders  ay youve been through it twice said reuben and well mid know  i can put up with it for once said dick or twice either or a dozen times  o dick said fancy reproachfully  why dear thats nothingonly just a bit of a flourish  you be as nervous as a cat today  and then of course when tis all over continued the tranter we shall march two and two round the parish  yes sure said mr penny two and two every man hitched up to his woman a blieve  i never can make a show of myself in that way said fancy looking at dick to ascertain if he could  im agreed to anything you and the company like my dear said mr richard dewy heartily  why we did when we were married didnt we ann said the tranter and so do

behind em  everybody used to wear something white at whitsuntide in them days  my sonnies ive got the very white trousers that i wore at home in box now  hant i ann  you had till i cut em up for jimmy said mrs dewy  and we ought by rights after doing this parish to go round higher and lower mellstock and call at vineys and so work our way hither again across heth said mr penny recovering scent of the matter in hand dairyman viney is a very respectable man and so is farmer kex and we ought to show ourselves to them  true said the tranter we ought to go round mellstock to do the thing well  we shall form a very striking object walking along in rotation goodnow neighbours  that we shall a proper pretty sight for the nation said mrs penny  hullo said the tranter suddenly catching sight of a singular human figure standing in the doorway and wearing a long smockfrock of pillow case cut and of snowy whiteness  why leaf whatever dost thou do here  ive come to know if so be i can come to the weddingheehee said leaf in a voice of timidity  now leaf said the tranter reproachfully you know we dont want ee here today weve got no room for ye leaf  thomas leaf thomas leaf fie upon ye for prying said old william  i know ive got no head but i thought if i washed and put on a clane shirt and smockfrock i might just call said leaf turning away disappointed and trembling  poor feller said the tranter turning to geoffrey  suppose we must let en come  his looks are rather against en and he is terrible silly but a have never been in jail and a wont do no harm  leaf looked with gratitude at the tranter for these praises and then anxiously at geoffrey to see what effect they would have in helping his cause  ay let en come said geoffrey decisively  leaf thrt welcome st know and leaf accordingly remained  they were now all ready for leaving the house and began to form a procession in the following order fancy and her father dick and susan dewy nat callcome and vashti sniff ted waywood and mercy onmey and jimmy and bessie dewy  these formed the executive and all appeared in strict wedding attire  then came the tranter and mrs dewy and last of all mr and mrs pennythe tranter conspicuous by his enormous gloves size eleven and threequarters which appeared at a distance like boxing gloves bleached and sat rather awkwardly upon his brown hands this hall mark of respectability having been set upon himself today by fancys special request for the first time in his life  the proper way is for the bridesmaids to walk together suggested fancy  what  twas always young man and young woman arm in crook in my time said geoffrey astounded  and in mine said the tranter  and in ours said mr and mrs penny  never heard o such a thing as woman and woman said old william who with grandfather james and mrs day was to stay at home  whichever way you and the company like my dear said dick who being on the point of securing his right to fancy seemed willing to renounce all other rights in the world with the greatest pleasure  the decision was left to fancy  well i think id rather have it the way mother had it she said and the couples moved along under the trees every man to his maid  ah said grandfather james to grandfather william as they retired i wonder which she thinks most about dick or her wedding raiment  well tis their nature said grandfather william  remember the words of the prophet jeremiah can a maid forget her ornaments or a bride her attire  now among dark perpendicular firs like the shafted columns of a cathedral now through a hazel copse matted with primroses and wild hyacinths now under broad beeches in bright young leaves they threaded their way into the high road over yalbury hill which dipped at that point directly into the village of geoffrey days parish and in the space of a quarter of an hour fancy found herself to be mrs richard dewy though much to her surprise feeling no other than fancy day still  on the circuitous return walk through the lanes and fields amid much chattering and laughter especially when they came to stiles dick discerned a brown spot far up a turnip field  why tis enoch he said to fancy  i thought i missed him at the house this morning  how is it hes left you  he drank too much cider and it got into his head and they put him in weatherbury stocks for it  father was obliged to get somebody else for a day or two and enoch hasnt had anything to do with the woods since  we might ask him to call down tonight  stocks are nothing for once considering tis our wedding day  the bridal party was ordered to halt  enooooch cried dick at the top of his voice  yaaaaaas said enoch from the distance  dye know who i beeeeee  nooooooo  dick dewwwwwy  ohhhhh  just amaaaaaarried  ohhhhh  this is my wife faaaaaancy holding her up to enochs view as if she had been a nosegay  ohhhhh  will ye come across to the party toniiiiiiight  caaaaaant  why nooooot  dont work for the family nooooow  not nice of master enoch said dick as they resumed their walk  you mustnt blame en said geoffrey the mans not hisself now hes in his morning frame of mind  when hes had a gallon o cider or ale or a pint or two of mead the mans well enough and his manners be as good as anybodys in the kingdom    chapter ii under the greenwood tree   the point in yalbury wood which abutted on the end of geoffrey days premises was closed with an ancient tree horizontally of enormous extent though having no great pretensions to height  many hundreds of birds had been born amidst the boughs of this single tree tribes of rabbits and hares had nibbled at its bark from year to year quaint tufts of fungi had sprung from the cavities of its forks and countless families of moles and earthworms had crept about its roots  beneath and beyond its shade spread a carefullytended grassplot its purpose being to supply a healthy exerciseground for young chickens and pheasants the hens their mothers being enclosed in coops placed upon the same green flooring  all these encumbrances were now removed and as the afternoon advanced the guests gathered on the spot where music dancing and the singing of songs went forward with great spirit throughout the evening  the propriety of every one was intense by reason of the influence of fancy who as an additional precaution in this direction had strictly charged her father and the tranter to carefully avoid saying thee and thou in their conversation on the plea that those ancient words sounded so very humiliating to persons of newer taste also that they were never to be seen drawing the back of the hand across the mouth after drinkinga local english custom of extraordinary antiquity but stated by fancy to be decidedly dying out among the better classes of society  in addition to the local musicians present a man who had a thorough knowledge of the tambourine was invited from the village of tantrum clangleya place long celebrated for the skill of its inhabitants as performers on instruments of percussion  these important members of the assembly were relegated to a height of two or three feet from the ground upon a temporary erection of planks supported by barrels  whilst the dancing progressed the older persons sat in a group under the trunk of the treethe space being allotted to them somewhat grudgingly by the young ones who were greedy of pirouetting roomand fortified by a table against the heels of the dancers  here the gaffers and gammers whose dancing days were over told stories of great impressiveness and at intervals surveyed the advancing and retiring couples from the same retreat as people on shore might be supposed to survey a naval engagement in the bay beyond returning again to their tales when the pause was over  those of the whirling throng who during the rests between each figure turned their eyes in the direction of these seated ones were only able to discover on account of the music and bustle that a very striking circumstance was in course of narrationdenoted by an emphatic sweep of the hand snapping of the fingers close of the lips and fixed look into the centre of the listeners eye for the space of a quarter of a minute which raised in that listener such a reciprocating working of face as to sometimes make the distant dancers half wish to know what such an interesting tale could refer to  fancy caused her looks to wear as much matronly expression as was obtainable out of six hours experience as a wife in order that the contrast between her own state of life and that of the unmarried young women present might be duly impressed upon the company occasionally stealing glances of admiration at her left hand but this quite privately for her ostensible bearing concerning the matter was intended to show that though she undoubtedly occupied the most wondrous position in the eyes of the world that had ever been attained she was almost unconscious of the circumstance and that the somewhat prominent position in which that wonderfullyemblazoned left hand was continually found to be placed when handing cups and saucers knives forks and glasses was quite the result of accident  as to wishing to excite envy in the bosoms of her maiden companions by the exhibition of the shining ring every one was to know it was quite foreign to the dignity of such an experienced married woman  dicks imagination in the meantime was far less capable of drawing so much wontedness from his new condition  he had been for two or three hours trying to feel himself merely a newly married man but had been able to get no further in the attempt than to realize that he was dick dewy the tranters son at a party given by lord wessexs head manincharge on the outlying yalbury estate dancing and chatting with fancy day  five country dances including haste to the wedding two reels and three fragments of hornpipes brought them to the time for supper which on account of the dampness of the grass from the immaturity of the summer season was spread indoors  at the conclusion of the meal dick went out to put the horse in and fancy with the elder half of the four bridesmaids retired upstairs to dress for the journey to dicks new cottage near mellstock  how long will you be putting on your bonnet fancy dick inquired at the foot of the staircase  being now a man of business and married he was strong on the importance of time and doubled the emphasis of his words in conversing and added vigour to his nods  only a minute  how long is that  well dear five  ah sonnies said the tranter as dick retired tis a talent of the female race that low numbers should stand for high more especially in matters of waiting matters of age and matters of money  true true upon my body said geoffrey  ye spak with feeling geoffrey seemingly  anybody that dknow my experience might guess that  whats she doing now geoffrey  claning out all the upstairs drawers and cupboards and dusting the secondbest chaineya thing thats only done once a year  if theres work to be done i must do it says she wedding or no  tis my belief shes a very good woman at bottom  shes terrible deep then  mrs penny turned round  well tis humps and hollers with the best of us but still and for all that dick and fancy stand as fair a chance of having a bit of sunsheen as any married pair in the land  ay theres no gainsaying it  mrs dewy came up talking to one person and looking at another  happy yes she said  tis always so when a couple is so exactly in tune with one another as dick and she  when they bent too poor to have time to sing said grandfather james  i tell ye neighbours when the pinch comes said the tranter when the oldest daughters boots be only a size less than her mothers and the rest o the flock close behind her  a sharp time for a man that my sonnies a very sharp time  chanticleers comb is acut then a believe  thats about the form ot said mr penny  thatll put the stuns upon a man when you must measure mother and daughters lasts to tell em apart  youve no cause to complain reuben of such a closecoming flock said mrs dewy for ours was a straggling lot enough god knows  i dknow it i dknow it said the tranter  you be a wellenough woman ann  mrs dewy put her mouth in the form of a smile and put it back again without smiling  and if they come together they go together said mrs penny whose family had been the reverse of the tranters and a little money will make either fate tolerable  and money can be made by our young couple i know  yes that it can said the impulsive voice of leaf who had hitherto humbly admired the proceedings from a corner  it can be doneall thats wanted is a few pounds to begin with  thats all  i know a story about it  lets hear thy story leaf said the tranter  i never knew you were clever enough to tell a story  silence all of ye  mr leaf will tell a story  tell your story thomas leaf said grandfather william in the tone of a schoolmaster  once said the delighted leaf in an uncertain voice there was a man who lived in a house  well this man went thinking and thinking night and day  at last he said to himself as i might if i had only ten pound id make a fortune  at last by hook or by crook behold he got the ten pounds  only think of that said nat callcome satirically  silence said the tranter  well now comes the interesting part of the story  in a little time he made that ten pounds twenty  then a little time after that he doubled it and made it forty  well he went on and a good while after that he made it eighty and on to a hundred  well byandby he made it two hundred  well youd never believe it buthe went on and made it four hundred  he went on and what did he do  why he made it eight hundred yes he did continued leaf in the highest pitch of excitement bringing down his fist upon his knee with such force that he quivered with the pain yes and he went on and made it a thousand  hear hear said the tranter  better than the history of england my sonnies  thank you for your story thomas leaf said grandfather william and then leaf gradually sank into nothingness again  amid a medley of laughter old shoes and elderwine dick and his bride took their departure side by side in the excellent new springcart which the young tranter now possessed  the moon was just over the full rendering any light from lamps or their own beauties quite unnecessary to the pair  they drove slowly along yalbury bottom where the road passed between two copses  dick was talking to his companion  fancy he said why we are so happy is because there is such full confidence between us  ever since that time you confessed to that little flirtation with shiner by the river which was really no flirtation at all i have thought how artless and good you must be to tell me o such a trifling thing and to be so frightened about it as you were  it has won me to tell you my every deed and word since then  well have no secrets from each other darling will we everno secret at all  none from today said fancy  hark whats that  from a neighbouring thicket was suddenly heard to issue in a loud musical and liquid voice  tippiwit sweeet kikiki  come hither come hither come hither  o tis the nightingale murmured she and thought of a secret she would never tell     footnotes   1 this a local expression must be a corruption of something less questionable
