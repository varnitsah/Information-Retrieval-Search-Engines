with two disadvantages the meanness of the author and of the subject yet in both i am incouraged by the greatness of your mercy and your knowledge by the one i am taught that you can forgive the most presumptuous offendors and by the other that you will not esteem the least work of nature or art unworthy your observation amidst the many felicities that have accompanid your majesties happy restauration and government it is none of the least considerable that philosophy and experimental learning have prosperd under your royal patronage and as the calm prosperity of your reign has given us the leisure to follow these studies of quiet and retirement so it is just that the fruits of them should by way of acknowledgement be returnd to your majesty there are sir several other of your subjects of your royal society now busie about nobler matters the improvement of manufactures and agriculture the increase of commerce the advantage of navigation in all which they are assisted by your majesties incouragement and example amidst all those greater designs i here presume to bring in that which is more proportionable to the smalness of my abilities and to offer some of the least of all visible things to that mighty king that has establisht an empire over the best of all invisible things of this world the minds of men  your majesties most humble and most obedient subject and servant  robert hooke                                       to the  royal society  after my address to our great founder and patron i could not but think my self obligd in consideration of those many ingagements you have laid upon me to offer these my poor labours to this most illustrious assembly you have been pleasd formerly to accept of these rude draughts i have since added to them some descriptions and some conjectures of my own and therefore together with your acceptance i must also beg your pardon the rules you have prescribd your selves in your philosophical progress do seem the best that have ever yet been practisd and particularly that of avoiding dogmatizing and the espousal of any hypothesis not sufficiently grounded and confirmd by experiments this way seems the most excellent and may preserve both philosophy and natural history from its former corruptions in saying which i may seem to condemn my own course in this treatise in which there may perhaps be some expressions which may seem more positive then your prescriptions will permit and though i desire to have them understood only as conjectures and qu√¶ries which your method does not altogether disallow yet if even in those i have exceeded tis fit that i should declare that it was not done by your directions for it is most unreasonable that you should undergo the imputation of the faults of my conjectures seeing you can receive so small advantage of reputation by the sleight observations of  your most humble and most faithful servant  robert hooke                                        the  preface  it is the great prerogative of mankind above other creatures that we are not only able to behold the works of nature or barely to sustein our lives by them but we have also the power of considering comparing altering assisting and improving them to various uses and as this is the peculiar priviledge of humane nature in general so is it capable of being so far advanced by the helps of art and experience as to make some men excel others in their observations and deductions almost as much as they do beasts by the addition of such artificial instruments and methods there may be in some manner a reparation made for the mischiefs and imperfection mankind has drawn upon it self by negligence and intemperance and a wilful and superstitious deserting the prescripts and rules of nature whereby every man both from a derivd corruption innate and born with him and from his breeding and converse with men is very subject to slip into all sorts of errors  the only way which now remains for us to recover some degree of those former perfections seems to be by rectifying the operations of the sense the memory and reason since upon the evidence the strength the integrity and the right correspondence of all these all the light by which our actions are to be guided is to be renewed and all our command over things it to be establisht  it is therefore most worthy of our consideration to recollect their several defects that so we may the better understand how to supply them and by what assistances we may inlarge their power and secure them in performing their particular duties  as for the actions of our senses we cannot but observe them to be in many particulars much outdone by those of other creatures and when at best to be far short of the perfection they seem capable of and these infirmities of the senses arise from a double cause either from the disproportion of the object to the organ whereby an infinite number of things can never enter into them or else from error in the perception that many things which come within their reach are not received in a right manner  the like frailties are to be found in the memory we often let many things slip away from us which deserve to be retaind and of those which we treasure up a great part is either frivolous or false and if good and substantial either in tract of time obliterated or at best so overwhelmed and buried under more frothy notions that when there is need of them they are in vain sought for  the two main foundations being so deceivable it is no wonder that all the succeeding works which we build upon them of arguing concluding defining judging and all the other degrees of reason are lyable to the same imperfection being at best either vain or uncertain so that the errors of the understanding are answerable to the two other being defective both in the quantity and goodness of its knowledge for the limits to which our thoughts are confind are small in respect of the vast extent of nature it self some parts of it are too large to be comprehended and some too little to be perceived and from thence it must follow that not having a full sensation of the object we must be very lame and imperfect in our conceptions about it and in all the proportions which we build upon it hence we often take the shadow of things for the substance small appearances for good similitudes similitudes for definitions and even many of those which we think to be the most solid definitions are rather expressions of our own misguided apprehensions then of the true nature of the things themselves  the effects of these imperfections are manifested in different ways according to the temper and disposition of the several minds of men some they incline to gross ignorance and stupidity and others to a presumptuous imposing on other mens opinions and a confident dogmatizing on matters whereof there it no assurance to be given  thus all the uncertainty and mistakes of humane actions proceed either from the narrowness and wandring of our senses from the slipperiness or delusion of our memory from the confinement or rashness of our understanding so that tis no wonder that our power over natural causes and effects is so slowly improvd seeing we are not only to contend with the obscurity and difficulty of the things whereon we work and think but even the forces of our own minds conspire to betray us  these being the dangers in the process of humane reason the remedies of them all can only proceed from the real the mechanical the experimental philosophy which has this advantage over the philosophy of discourse and disputation that whereas that chiefly aims at the subtilty of its deductions and conclusions without much regard to the first groundwork which ought to be well laid on the sense and memory so this intends the right ordering of them all and the making them serviceable to each other  the first thing to be undertaken in this weighty work is a watchfulness over the failings and an inlargement of the dominion of the senses  to which end it is requisite first that there should be a scrupulous choice and a strict examination of the reality constancy and certainty of the particulars that we admit this is the first rise whereon truth is to begin and here the most severe and most impartial diligence must be imployed the storing up of all without any regard to evidence or use will only tend to darkness and confusion we must not therefore esteem the riches of our philosophical treasure by the number only but chiefly by the weight the most vulgar instances are not to be neglected but above all the most instructive are to be entertaind the footsteps of nature are to be tracd not only in her ordinary course but when she seems to be put to her shifts to make many doublings and turnings and to use some kind of art in indeavouring to avoid our discovery  the next care to be taken in respect of the senses is a supplying of their infirmities with instruments and as it were the adding of artificial organs to the natural this in one of them has been of late years accomplisht with prodigious benefit to all sorts of useful knowledge by the invention of optical glasses by the means of telescopes there is nothing so far distant but may be represented to our view and by the help of microscopes there is nothing so small as to escape our inquiry hence there is a new visible world discovered to the understanding by this means the heavens are opend and a vast number of new stars and new motions and new productions appear in them to which all the ancient astronomers were utterly strangers by this the earth it self which lyes so neer us under our feet shews quite a new thing to us and in every little particle of its matter we now behold almost as great a variety of creatures as we were able before to reckon up in the whole universe it self  it seems not improbable but that by these helps the subtilty of the composition of bodies the structure of their parts the various texture of their matter the instruments and manner of their inward motions and all the other possible appearances of things may come to be more fully discovered all which the ancient peripateticks were content to comprehend in two general and unless further explaind useless words of matter and form from whence there may arise many admirable advantages towards the increase of the operative and the mechanick knowledge to which this age seems so much inclined because we may perhaps be inabled to discern all the secret workings of nature almost in the same manner as we do those that are the productions of art and are managd by wheels and engines and springs that were devised by humane wit  in this kind i here present to the world my imperfect indeavours which though they shall prove no other way considerable yet i hope they may be in some measure useful to the main design of a reformation in philosophy if it be only by shewing that there it not so much requird towards it any strength of imagination or exactness of method or depth of contemplation though the addition of these where they can be had must needs produce a much more perfect composure as a sincere hand and a faithful eye to examine and to record the things themselves as they appear  and i beg my reader to let me take the boldness to assure him that in this present condition of knowledge a man so qualified as i have indeavoured to be only with resolution and integrity and plain intentions of imploying his senses aright may venture to compare the reality and the usefulness of his services towards the true philosophy with those of other men that are of much stronger and more acute speculations that shall not make use of the same method by the senses  the truth is the science of nature has been already too long made only a work of the brain and the fancy it is now high time that it should return to the plainness and soundness of observations on material and obvious things it is said of great empires that the best way to preserve them from decay is to bring them back to the first principles and arts on which they did begin the same is undoubtedly true in philosophy that by wandring far away into invisible notions has almost quite destroyd it self and it can never be recovered or continued but by returning into the same sensible paths in which it did at first proceed  if therefore the reader expects from me any infallible deductions or certainty of axioms i am to say for my self that those stronger works of wit and imagination are above my weak abilities or if they had not been so i would not have made use of them in this present subject before me whenever he finds that i have venturd at any small conjectures at the causes of the things that i have observed i beseech him to look upon them only as doubtful problems and uncertain ghesses and not as unquestionable conclusions or matters of unconfutable science i have produced nothing here with intent to bind his understanding to an implicit consent i am so far from that that i desire him not absolutely to rely upon these observations of my eyes if he finds them contradicted by the future ocular experiments of other and impartial discoverers  as for my part i have obtained my end if these my small labours shall be thought fit to take up some place in the large stock of natural observations which so many hands are busie in providing if i have contributed the meanest foundations whereon others may raise nobler superstructures i am abundantly satisfied and all my ambition is that i may serve to the great philosophers of this age as the makers and the grinders of my glasses did to me that i may prepare and furnish them with some materials which they may afterwards order and manage with better skill and to far greater advantage  the next remedies in this universal cure of the mind are to be applyed to the memory and they are to consist of such directions as may inform us what things are best to be stord up for our purpose and which is the best way of so disposing them that they may not only be kept in safety but ready and convenient to be at any time producd for use as occasion shall require but i will not here prevent my self in what i may say in another discourse wherein i shall make an attempt to propose some considerations of the manner of compiling a natural and artificial history and of so ranging and registring its particulars into philosophical tables as may make them most useful for the raising of axioms and theories  the last indeed is the most hazardous enterprize and yet the most necessary and that is to take such care that the judgment and the reason of man which is the third faculty to be repaird and improvd should receive such assistance as to avoid the dangers to which it it by nature most subject the imperfections which i have already mentiond to which it is lyable do either belong to the extent or the goodness of its knowledge and here the difficulty is the greater least that which may be thought a remedy for the one should prove destructive to the other least by seeking to inlarge our knowledge we should render it weak and uncertain and least by being too scrupulous and exact about every circumstance of it we should confine and streighten it too much  in both these the middle wayes are to be taken nothing it to be omitted and yet every thing to pass a mature deliberation no intelligence from men of all professions and quarters of the world to be slighted and yet all to be so severely examind that there remain no room for doubt or instability much rigour in admitting much strictness in comparing and above all much slowness in debating and shyness in determining is to be practised the understanding is to order all the inferiour services of the lower faculties but yet it is to do this only as a lawful master and not at a tyrant it must not incroach upon their offices nor take upon it self the employments which belong to either of them it must watch the irregularities of the senses but it must not go before them or prevent their information it must examine range and dispose of the bank which it laid up in the memory but it must be sure to make distinction between the sober and well collected heap and the extravagant ideas and mistaken images which there it may sometimes light upon so many are the links upon which the true philosophy depends of which if any one be loose or weak the whole chain is in danger of being dissolvd it is to begin with the hands and eyes and to proceed on through the memory to be continued by the reason nor is it to stop there but to come about to the hands and eyes again and so by a continual passage round from one faculty to another it is to be maintained in life and strength as much as the body of man it by the circulation of the blood through the several parts of the body the arms the feet the lungs the heart and the head  if once this method were followed with diligence and attention there is nothing that lyes within the power of human wit or which is far more effectual of human industry which we might not compass we might not only hope for inventions to equalize those of copernicus galileo gilbert harvy and of others whose names are almost lost that were the inventors of gunpowder the seamans compass printing etching graving microscopes c but multitudes that may far exceed them for even those discoveries seem to have been the products of some such method though but imperfect what may not be therefore expected from it if thoroughly prosecuted talking and contention of arguments would soon be turnd into labours all the fine dreams of opinions and universal metaphysical natures which the luxury of subtil brains has devisd would quickly vanish and give place to solid histories experiments and works and as at first mankind fell by tasting of the forbidden tree of knowledge so we their posterity may be in part restord by the same way not only by beholding and contemplating but by tasting too those fruits of natural knowledge that were never yet forbidden  from hence the world may be assisted with variety of inventions new matter for sciences may be collected the old improvd and their rust rubbd away and as it is by the benefit of senses that we receive all our skill in the works of nature so they also may be wonderfully benefited by it and may be guided to an easier and more exact performance of their offices tis not unlikely but that we may find out wherein our senses are deficient and as easily find wayes of repairing them  the indeavours of skilful men have been most conversant about the assistance of the eye and many noble productions have followed upon it and from hence we may conclude that there it a way opend for advancing the operations not only of all the other senses but even of the eye it self that which has been already done ought not to content us but rather to incourage us to proceed further and to attempt greater things in the same and different wayes  tis not unlikely but that there may be yet invented several other helps for the eye at much exceeding those already found as those do the bare eye such as by which we may perhaps be able to discover living creatures in the moon or other planets the figures of the compounding particles of matter and the particular schematisms and textures of bodies  and as glasses have highly promoted our seeing so tis not improbable but that there may be found many mechanical inventions to improve our other senses of hearing smelling tasting touching tis not impossible to hear a whisper a furlongs distance it having been already done and perhaps the nature of the thing would not make it more impossible though that furlong should be ten times multiplyd and though some famous authors have affirmd it impossible to hear through the thinnest plate of muscovyglass yet i know a way by which tis easie enough to hear one speak through a wall a yard thick it has not been yet thoroughly examind how far otocousticons may be improvd nor what other wayes there may be of quickning our hearing or conveying sound through other bodies then the air for that that it not the only medium i can assure the reader that i have by the help of a distended wire propagated the sound to a very considerable distance in an instant or with as seemingly quick a motion as that of light at least incomparably swifter then that which at the same time was propagated through the air and this not only in a straight line or direct but in one bended in many angles  nor are the other three so perfect but that diligence attention and many mechanical contrivances may also highly improve them for since the sense of smelling seems to be made by the swift passage of the air impregnated with the steams and effluvia of several odorous bodies through the grisly meanders of the nose whose surfaces are coverd with a very sensible nerve and moistned by a transudation from the processus mamillares of the brain and some adjoyning glandules and by the moist steam of the lungs with a liquor convenient for the reception of those effluvia and by the adhesion and mixing of those steams with that liquor and thereby affecting the nerve or perhaps by insinuating themselves into the juices of the brain after the same manner as i have in the following observations intimated the parts of salt to pass through the skins of effs and frogs since i say smelling seems to be made by some such way tis not improbable but that some contrivance for making a great quantity of air pass quick through the nose might at much promote the sense of smelling as the any wayes hindring that passage does dull and destroy it several tryals i have made both of hindring and promoting this sense and have succeeded in some according to expectation and indeed to me it seems capable of being improvd for the judging of the constitutions of many bodies perhaps we may thereby also judge as other creatures seem to do what is wholsome what poyson and in a word what are the specifick properties of bodies  there may be also some other mechanical wayes found out of sensibly perceiving the effluvia of bodies several instances of which were it here proper i could give of mineral steams and exhalations and it seems not impossible but that by some such wayes improved may be discovered what minerals lye buried under the earth without the trouble to dig for them some things to confirm this conjecture may be found in agricola and other writers of minerals speaking of the vegetables that are apt to thrive or pine in those steams  whether also those steams which seem to issue out of the earth and mix with the air and so to precipitate some aqueous exhalations wherewith tis impregnated may not be by some way detected before they produce the effect seems hard to determine yet something of this kind i am able to discover by an instrument i contrivd to shew all the minute variations in the pressure of the air by which i constantly find that before and during the time of rainy weather the pressure of the air is less and in dry weather but especially when an eastern wind which having past over vast tracts of land is heavy with earthy particles blows it is much more though these changes are varied according to very odd laws      the instrument is this i prepare a pretty capaceous bolthead ab with     a small stem about two foot and a half long dc upon the end of this d     i put on a small bended glass or brazen syphon def open at d e and     f but to be closed with cement at f and e as occasion serves whose     stem f should be about six or eight inches long but the bore of it not     above half an inch diameter and very even these i fix very strongly     together by the help of very hard cement and then fit the whole glass     abcdef into a long board or frame in such manner that almost half     the head ab may lye buried in a concave hemisphere cut into the board     rs then i place it so on the board rs as is exprest in the first     figure of the first scheme and fix it very firm and steady in that     posture so as that the weight of the mercury that is afterwards to     be put into it may not in the least shake or stir it then drawing a     line xy on the frame rt so that it may divide the ball into two equal     parts or that it may pass as twere through the center of the ball     i begin from that and divide all the rest of the board towards ut into     inches and the inches between the 25 and the end e which need not be     above two or three and thirty inches distant from the line xy i     subdivide into decimals then stopping the end f with soft cement or     soft wax i invert the frame placing the head downwards and the     orifice e upwards and by it with a small funnel i fill the whole     glass with quicksilver then by stopping the small orifice e with my     finger i oftentimes erect and invert the whole glass and frame and     thereby free the quicksilver and glass from all the bubbles or parcels     of lurking air then inverting it as before i fill it top full with     clear and well straind quicksilver and having made ready a small ball     of pretty hard cement by heat made very soft i press it into the hole     e and thereby stop it very fast and to secure this cement from flying     out afterward i bind over it a piece of leather that is spread over     in the inside with cement and wound about it while the cement is hot     having thus softned it i gently erect again the glass after this     manner i first let the frame down edgewayes till the edge rv touch     the floor or ly horizontal and then in that edging posture raise the     end rs this i do that if there chance to be any air hidden in the     small pipe e it may ascend into the pipe f and not into the pipe dc     having thus erected it and hung it by the hole q or fixt it     perpendicularly by any other means i open the end f and by a small     syphon i draw out the mercury so long till i find the surface of     it ab in the head to touch exactly the line xy at which time i     immediately take away the syphon and if by chance it be run somewhat     below the line xy by pouring in gently a little mercury at f i     raise it again to its desired height by this contrivance i make all     the sensible rising and falling of the mercury to be visible in the     surface of the mercury in the pipe f and scarce any in the head ab     but because there really is some small change of the upper surface     also i find by several observations how much it rises in the ball and     falls in the pipe f to make the distance between the two surfaces an     inch greater then it was before and the measure that it falls in the     pipe is the length of the inch by which i am to mark the parts of the     tube f or the board on which it lyes into inches and decimals having     thus justned and divided it i have a large wheel mnop whose outmost     limb is divided into two hundred equal parts this by certain small     pillars is fixt on the frame rt in the manner exprest in the figure     in the middle of this on the back side in a convenient frame is     placed a small cylinder whose circumference is equal to twice the     length of one of those divisions which i find answer to an inch of     ascent or descent of mercury this cylinder i is movable on a very     small needle on the end of which is fixt a very light index kl all     which are so poisd on the axis or needle that no part is heavier     then another then about this cylinder is wound a small clew of silk     with two small steel bullets at each end of it gh one of these which     is somewhat the heavier ought to be so big as freely to move to and     fro in the pipe f by means of which contrivance every the least     variation of the height of the mercury will be made exceeding visible     by the motion to and fro of the small index kl  but this is but one way of discovering the effluvia of the earth mixt with the air there may be perhaps many others witness the hygroscope an instrument whereby the watery steams volatile in the air are discerned which the nose it self is not able to find this i have describd in the following tract in the description of the beard of a wild oat others there are may be discovered both by the nose and by other wayes also thus the smoak of burning wood is smelt seen and sufficiently felt by the eyes the fumes of burning brimstone are smelt and discovered also by the destroying the colours of bodies as by the whitening of a red rose and who knows but that the industry of man following this method may find out wayes of improving this sense to as great a degree of perfection at it is in any animal and perhaps yet higher  tis not improbable also but that our taste may be very much improvd either by preparing our taste for the body as after eating bitter things wine or other vinous liquors are more sensibly tasted or else by preparing bodies for our tast as the dissolving of metals with acid liquors make them tastable which were before altogether insipid thus lead becomes sweeter then sugar and silver more bitter then gall copper and iron of most loathsome tasts and indeed the business of this sense being to discover the presence of dissolved bodies in liquors put on the tongue or in general to discover that a fluid body has some solid body dissolvd in it and what they are whatever contrivance makes this discovery improves this sense in this kind the mixtures of chymical liquors afford many instances as the sweet vinegar that is impregnated with lead may be discovered to be so by the affusion of a little of an alcalizate solution the bitter liquor of aqua fortis and silver may be discoverd to be chargd with that metal by laying in it some plates of copper tis not improbable also but there may be multitudes of other wayes of discovering the parts dissolvd or dissoluble in liquors and what is this discovery but a kind of secundary tasting  tis not improbable also but that the sense of feeling may be highly improvd for that being a sense that judges of the more gross and robust motions of the particles of bodies seems capable of being improvd and assisted very many wayes thus for the distinguishing of heat and cold the weatherglass and thermometer which i have describd in this following treatise do exceedingly perfect it by each of which the least variations of heat or cold which the most acute sense is not able to distinguish are manifested this is oftentimes further promoted also by the help of burningglasses and the like which collect and unite the radiating heat thus the roughness and smoothness of a body is made much more sensible by the help of a microscope then by the most tender and delicate hand perhaps a physitian might by several other tangible proprieties discover the constitution of a body as well as by the pulse i do but instance in these to shew what possibility there may be of many others and what probability and hopes there were of finding them if this method were followed for the offices of the five senses being to detect either the subtil and curious motions propagated through all pellucid or perfectly homogeneous bodies or the more gross and vibrative pulse communicated through the air and all other convenient mediums whether fluid or solid or the effluvia of bodies dissolvd in the air or the particles of bodies dissolvd or dissoluble in liquors or the more quick and violent shaking motion of heat in all or any of these whatsoever does any wayes promote any of these kinds of criteria does afford a way of improving some one sense and what a multitude of these would a diligent man meet with in his inquiries and this for the helping and promoting the sensitive faculty only  next as for the memory or retentive faculty we may be sufficiently instructed from the written histories of civil actions what great assistance may be afforded the memory in the committing to writing things observable in natural operations if a physitian be therefore accounted the more able in his faculty because he has had long experience and practice the remembrance of which though perhaps very imperfect does regulate all his after actions what ought to be thought of that man that has not only a perfect register of his own experience but it grown old with the experience of many hundreds of years and many thousands of men  and though of late men beginning to be sensible of this convenience have here and there registred and printed some few centuries yet for the most part they are set down very lamely and imperfectly and i fear many times not so truly they seeming several of them to be designd more for ostentation then publique use for not to instance that they do for the most part omit those experiences they have made wherein their patients have miscarried it is very easie to be perceivd that they do all along hyperbolically extol their own prescriptions and vilifie those of others notwithstanding all which these kinds of histories are generally esteemd useful even to the ablest physitian  what may not be expected from the rational or deductive faculty that is furnisht with such materials and those so readily adapted and rangd for use that in a moment at twere thousands of instances serving for the illustration determination or invention of almost any inquiry may be represented even to the sight how neer the nature of axioms must all those propositions be which are examind before so many witnesses and how difficult will it be for any though never so subtil an error in philosophy to scape from being discoverd after it has indurd the touch and so many other tryals  what kind of mechanical way and physical invention also is there requird that might not this may be found out the invention of a way to find the longitude of places is easily performd and that to as great perfection as is desird or to at great an accurateness as the latitude of places can be found at sea and perhaps yet also to a greater certainty then that has been hitherto found as i shall very speedily freely manifest to the world the way of flying in the air seems principally unpracticable by reason of the want of strength in humane muscles if therefore that could be supplid it were i think easie to make twenty contrivances to perform the office of wings what attempts also i have made for the supplying that defect and my successes therein which i think are wholly new and not inconsiderable i shall in another place relate  tis not unlikely also but that chymists if they followed this method might find out their so much sought for alkahest what an universal menstruum which dissolves all sorts of sulphureous bodies i have discoverd which hat not been before taken notice of as such i have shewn in the sixteenth observation  what a prodigious variety of inventions in anatomy has this latter age afforded even in our own bodies in the very heart by which we live and the brain which is the seat of our knowledge of other things witness all the excellent works of pecquet bartholinus billius and many others and at home of doctor harvy doctor ent doctor willis doctor glisson in celestial observations we have far exceeded all the antients even the chaldeans and egyptians themselves whose vast plains high towers and clear air did not give them so great advantages over us as have over them by our glasses by the help of which they have been very much outdone by the famous galileo hevelius zulichem and our own countrymen mr rook doctor wren and the great ornament of our church and nation the lord bishop of exeter and to say no more in aerial discoveries there has been a wonderful progress made by the noble engine of the most illustrious mr boyle whom it becomes me to mention with all honour not only as my particular patron but as the patron of philosophy it self which he every day increases by his labours and adorns by his example  the good success of all these great men and many others and the now seemingly great obviousness of most of their and divers other inventions which from the beginning of the world have been as twere trod on and yet not minded till these last inquisitive ages an argument that there may be yet behind multitudes of the like puts me in mind to recommend such studies and the prosecution of them by such methods to the gentlemen of our nation whose leisure makes them fit to undertake and the plenty of their fortunes to accomplish extraordinary things in this way and i do not only propose this kind of experimental philosophy as matter of high rapture and delight of the mind but even as a material and sensible pleasure so vast it the variety of objects which will come under their inflections so many different wayes there are of handling them so great is the satisfaction of finding out new things that i dare compare the contentment which they will injoy not only to that of contemplation but even to that which most men prefer of the very senses themselves  and if they will please to take any incouragement from so mean and so imperfect endeavours as mine upon my own experience i can assure them without arrogance that there has not been any inquiry or problem in mechanicks that i have hitherto propounded to my self but by a certain method which i may on some other opportunity explain i have been able presently to examine the possibility of it and if so as easily to excogitate divers wayes of performing it and indeed it is possible to do as much by this method in mechanicks as by algebra can be performd in geometry nor can i at all doubt but that the same method is as applicable to physical enquiries and as likely to find and reap thence at plentiful a crop of inventions and indeed there seems to be no subject so barren but may with this good husbandry be highly improvd  toward the prosecution of this method in physical inquiries i have here and there gleaned up an handful of observations in the collection of most of which i made use of microscopes and some other glasses and instruments that improve the sense which way i have herein taken not that there are not multitudes of useful and pleasant observables yet uncollected obvious enough without the helps of art but only to promote the use of mechanical helps for the senses both in the surveying the already visible world and for the discovery of many others hitherto unknown and to make us with the great conqueror to be affected that we have not yet overcome one world when there are so many others to be discovered every considerable improvement of telescopes or microscopes producing new worlds and terraincognitas to our view  the glasses i used were of our english make but though very good of the kind yet far short of what might be expected could we once find a way of making glasses elliptical or of some more true shape for though both microscopes and telescopes as they now are will magnifie an object about a thousand thousand times bigger then it appears to the naked eye yet the apertures of the objectglasses are so very small that very few rays are admitted and even of those few there are so many false that the object appears dark and indistinct and indeed these inconveniences are such as seem inseparable from spherical glasses even when most exactly made but the way we have hitherto made use of for that purpose is so imperfect that there may be perhaps ten wrought before one be made tolerably good and most of those ten perhaps every one differing in goodness one from another which is an argument that the way hitherto used is at least very uncertain so that these glasses have a double defect the one that very few of them are exactly true wrought the other that even of those that are best among them none will admit a sufficient number of rayes to magnifie the object beyond a determinate bigness against which inconveniences the only remedies i have hitherto met with are these      first for microscopes where the object we view is near and within     our power the best way of making it appear bright in the glass is to     cast a great quantity of light on it by means of convex glasses for     thereby though the aperture be very small yet there will throng in     through it such multitudes that an object will by this means indure to     be magnifid as much again as it would be without it the way for doing     which is this i make choice of some room that has only one window open     to the south and at about three or four foot distance from this     window on a table i place my microscope and then so place either a     round globe of water or a very deep clear plano convex glass whose     convex side is turnd towards the window that there is a great     quantity of rayes collected and thrown upon the object or if the sun     shine i place a small piece of oyly paper very near the object     between that and the light then with a good large burningglass i so     collect and throw the rayes on the paper that there may be a very     great quantity of light pass through it to the object yet i so     proportion that light that it may not singe or burn the paper instead     of which paper there may be made use of a small piece of lookingglass     plate one of whose sides is made rough by being rubbd on a flat tool     with very find sand this will if the heat be leisurely cast on it     indure a much greater degree of heat and consequently very much     augment a convenient light by all which means the light of the sun or     of a window may be so cast on an object as to make it twice as light     as it would otherwise be without it and that without any inconvenience     of glaring which the immediate light of the sun is very apt to create     in most objects for by this means the light is so equally diffused     that all parts are alike inlightned but when the immediate light of     the sun falls on it the reflexions from some few parts are so vivid     that they drown the appearance of all the other and are themselves     also by reason of the inequality of light indistinct and appear only     radiant spots      but because the light of the sun and also that of a window is in a     continual variation and so many objects cannot be viewd long enough     by them to be throughly examind besides that oftentimes the weather     is so dark and cloudy that for many dayes together nothing can be     viewd and because also there are many objects to be met with in the     night which cannot so conveniently be kept perhaps till the day     therefore to procure and cast a sufficient quantity of light on an     object in the night i thought of and often used this expedient      i procurd me a small pedestal such as is describd in the fifth     figure of the first scheme on the small pillar ab of which were two     movable armes cd which by means of the screws ef i could fix in any     part of the pillar on the undermost of these i placd a pretty large     globe of glass g filld with exceeding clear brine stopt inverted     and fixt in the manner visible in the figure out of the side of which     arm proceeded another arm h with many joynts to the end of which was     fastned a deep plain convex glass i which by means of this arm could     be moved too and fro and fixt in any posture on the upper arm was     placed a small lamp k which could be to movd upon the end of the arm     as to be set in a fit posture to give light through the ball by means     of this instrument duly placd as is exprest in the figure with the     small flame of a lamp may be cast as great and convenient a light on     the object as it will well indure and being always constant and to be     had at any time i found most proper for drawing the representations of     those small objects i had occasion to observe      none of all which ways though much beyond any other hitherto made use     of by any i know do afford a sufficient help but after a certain     degree of magnifying they leave us again in the lurch hence it were     very desirable that some way were thought of for making the     objectglass of such a figure as would conveniently bear a large     aperture  as for telescopes the only improvement they seem capable of is the increasing of their length for the object being remote there is no thought of giving it a greater light then it has and therefore to augment the aperture the glass must be ground of a very large sphere for by that means the longer the glass be the bigger aperture will it bear if the glasses be of an equal goodness in their kind therefore a six will indure a much larger aperture then a three foot glass and a sixty foot glass will proportionably bear a greater aperture then a thirty and will as much excel it also as a six foot does a three foot as i have experimentally observd in one of that length made by mr richard reives here at london which will bear an aperture above three inches over and yet make the object proportionably big and distinct whereas there are very few thirty foot glasses that will indure an aperture of more then two inches over so that for telescopes supposing we had a very ready way of making their object glasses of exactly spherical surfaces we might by increasing the length of the glass magnifie the object to any assignable bigness and for performing both these i cannot imagine any way more easie and more exact then by this following engine by means of which any glasses of what length soever may be speedily made it seems the most easie because with one and the same tool may be with care ground an object glass of any length or breadth requisite and that with very little or no trouble in fitting the engine and without much skill in the grinder it seems to be the most exact for to the very last stroke the glass does regulate and rectifie the tool to its exact figure and the longer or more the tool and glass are wrought together the more exact will both of them be of the desird figure further the motions of the glass and tool do so cross each other that there is not one point of eithers surface but has thousands of cross motions thwarting it so that there can be no kind of rings or gutters made either in the tool or glass      the contrivance of the engine is only to make the ends of two large     mandrils so to move that the centers of them may be at any     convenient distance asunder and that the axis of the mandrils     lying both in the same plain producd may meet each other in any     assignable angle both which requisites may be very well performd by     the engine describd in the third figure of the first scheme where     ab signifies the beam of a lath fixt perpendicularly or horizontally     cd the two poppet heads fixt at about two foot distance ef an iron     mandril whose tapering neck f runs in an adapted tapering brass     collar the other end e runs on the point of a screw g in a convenient     place of this is fastned h a pully wheel and into the end of it that     comes through the poppet head c is screwed a ring of a hollow     cylinder k or some other conveniently shapd tool of what wideness     shall be thought most proper for the cize of glasses about which it is     to be imployd as for object glasses between twelve foot and an     hundred foot long the ring may be about six inches over or indeed     somewhat more for those longer glasses it would be convenient also and     not very chargeable to have four or five several tools as one for all     glasses between an inch and a foot one for all glasses between a foot     and ten foot long another for all between ten and an hundred a fourth     for all between a hundred and a thousand foot long and if curiosity     shall ever proceed so far one for all lengths between a thousand and     ten thousand foot long for indeed the principle is such that     supposing the mandrils well made and of a good length and supposing     great care be used in working and polishing them i see no reason but     that a glass of a thousand nay of ten thousand foot long may be as     well made as one of ten for the reason is the same supposing the     mandrils and tools be made sufficiently strong so that they cannot     bend and supposing the glass out of which they are wrought be     capable of so great a regularity in its parts as to refraction this     hollow cylinder k is to contain the sand and by being drove round     very quick to and fro by means of a small wheel which may be movd     with ones foot serves to grind the glass the other mandril is     shapd like this but it has an even neck instead of a taper one and     runs in a collar that by the help of a screw and a joynt made like m     in the figure it can be still adjustned to the wearing or wasting     neck into the end of this mandril is screwed a chock n on which with     cement or glew is fastned the piece of glass q that is to be formd     the middle of which glass is to be placd just on the edge of the ring     and the lath op is to be set and fixt by means of certain pieces and     screws the manner whereof will be sufficiently evidencd by the figure     in such an angle as is requisite to the forming of such a sphere as the     glass is designd to be of the geometrical ground of which being     sufficiently plain though not heeded before i shall for brevities     sake pass over this last mandril to be made by means of the     former or some other wheel to run round very swift also by which two     cross motions the glass cannot chuse if care be usd but be wrought     into a most exactly spherical surface  but because we are certain from the laws of refraction which i i have experimentally found to be so by an instrument i shall presently describe that the lines of the angles of incidence are proportionate to the lines of the angles of refraction therefore if glasses could be made of those kind of figures or some other such as the most incomparable des cartes has invented and demonstrated in his philosophical and mathematical works we might hope for a much greater perfection of opticks then can be rationally expected from spherical ones for though c√¶teris paribus we find that the larger the telescope object glasses are and the shorter those of the microscope the better they magnify yet both of them beside such determinate dimensions are by certain inconveniences rendred unuseful for it will be exceeding difficult to make and manage a tube above an hundred foot long and it will be as difficult to inlighten an object less then an hundred part of an inch distant from the object glass  i have not as yet made any attempts of that kind though i know two or three wayes which as far as i have yet considered seem very probable and may invite me to make a tryal as soon as i have an opportunity of which i may hereafter perhaps acquaint the world in the interim i shall describe the instrument i even now mentiond by which the refraction of all kinds of liquors may be most exactly measurd thereby to give the curious an opportunity of making what further tryals of that kind they shall think requisite to any of their intended tryals and to let them see that the laws of refraction are not only notional      the instrument consisted of five rulers or long pieces placed     together after the manner exprest in the second figure of the first     scheme where ab denotes a straight piece of wood about six foot and     two inches long about three inches over and an inch and half thick     on the back side of which was hung a small plummet by a line stretcht     from top to bottom by which this piece was set exactly upright and so     very firmly fixt in the middle of this was made a hole or center into     which one end of a hollow cylindrical brass box cc fashiond as i     shall by and by describe was placd and could very easily and truly     be movd to and fro the other end of this box being put into and     moving in a hole made in a small arm dd into this box was fastned the     long ruler ef about three foot and three or four inches long and at     three foot from the above mentiond centers pp was a hole e cut     through and crossd with two small threads and at the end of it was     fixt a small sight g and on the back side of it was fixt a small arm     h with a screw to fix it in any place on the ruler lm this ruler lm     was movd on the center b which was exactly three foot distance from     the middle center p and a line drawn through the middle of it lm was     divided by a line of cords into some sixty degrees and each degree was     subdivided into minutes so that putting the cross of the threads in e     upon any part of this divided line i presently knew what angle the two     rules ab and ef made with each other and by turning the screw in h i     could fix them in any position the other ruler also rs was made much     after the same manner only it was not fixt to the hollow cylindrical     box but by means of two small brass armes or ears it movd on the     centers of it this also by means of the cross threads in the hole s     and by a screw in k could be fastned on any division of another line     of cords of the same radius drawn on no and so by that means the     angle made by the two rulers ab and rs was also known the brass box     cc in the middle was shapd very much like the figure x that is it     was a cylindrical box stoppd close at either end off of which a part     both of the sides and bottomes was cut out so that the box when the     pipe and that was joyned to it would contain the water when filld     half full and would likewise without running over indure to be     inclind to an angle equal to that of the greatest refraction of     water and no more without running over the ruler ef was fixt very     fast to the pipe v so that the pipe v directed the length of the ruler     ef and the box and ruler were movd on the pin tt so as to make any     desirable angle with the ruler ab the bottom of this pipe v was stopd     with a small piece of exactly plain glass which was placd exactly     perpendicular to the line of direction or axis of the ruler ef the     pins also tt were drilld with small holes through the axis and     through those holes was stretcht and fastned a small wire there was     likewise a small pipe of tin loosly put on upon the end of v and     reaching down to the sight g the use of which was only to keep any     false rayes of light from passing through the bottom of v and only     admitting such to pass as pierced through the sight g all things being     placed together in the manner describd in the figure that is the     ruler ab being fixt perpendicular i filld the box cc with water or     any other liquor whose refraction i intended to try till the wire     passing through the middle of it were just covered then i moved and     fixt the ruler fe at any assignable angle and placed the flame of a     candle just against the sight g and looking through the sight i i     moved the ruler rs to and fro till i perceived the light passing     through g to be covered as twere or divided by the dark wire passing     through pp then turning the screw in k i fixt it in that posture and     through the hole s i observed what degree and part of it was cut by     the cross threads in s and this gave me the angle of inclination aps     answering to the angle of refraction bpe for the surface of the liquor     in the box will be alwayes horizontal and consequently ab will be a     perpendicular to it the angle therefore aps will measure or be the     angle of inclination in the liquor next epb must be the angle of     refraction for the ray that passes through the sight g passes also     perpendicularly through the glass diaphragme at f and consequently     also perpendicularly through the lower surface of the liquor contiguous     to the glass and therefore suffers no refraction till it meet with the     horizontal surface of the liquor in cc which is determined by the two     angles  by means of this instrument i can with little trouble and a very small quantity of any liquor examine most accurately the refraction of it not only for one inclination but for all and thereby am inabled to make very accurate tables several of which i have also experimentally made and find that oyl of turpentine has a much greater refraction then spirit of wine though it be lighter and that spirit of wine has a greater refraction then water though it be lighter also but that salt water also has a greater refraction then fresh though it be heavier but allum water has a less refraction then common water though heavier also so that it seems as to the refraction made in a liquor the specifick gravity is of no efficacy by this i have also found that look what proportion the sine of the angle of one inclination has to the sine of the angle of refraction correspondent to it the same proportion have all the sines of other inclinations to the sines of their appropriate refractions      my way for measuring how much a glass magnifies an object placd at a     convenient distance from my eye is this having rectifid the     microscope to see the desird object through it very distinctly at     the same time that i look upon the object through the glass with one     eye i look upon other objects at the same distance with my other bare     eye by which means i am able by the help of a ruler divided into     inches and small parts and laid on the pedestal of the microscope     to cast as it were the magnifid appearance of the object upon the     ruler and thereby exactly to measure the diameter it appears of     through the glass which being compard with the diameter it appears of     to the naked eye will easily afford the quantity of its magnifying      the microscope which for the most part i made use of was shapd     much like that in the sixth figure of the first scheme the tube     being for the most part not above six or seven inches long though by     reason it had four drawers it could very much be lengthened as     occasion required this was contrivd with three glasses a small     object glass at a a thinner eye glass about b and a very deep one     about c this i made use of only when i had occasion to see much of an     object at once the middle glass conveying a very great company of     radiating pencils which would go another way and throwing them upon     the deep eye glass but when ever i had occasion to examine the small     parts of a body more accurately i took out the middle glass and only     made use of one eye glass with the object glass for always the fewer     the refractions are the more bright and clear the object appears and     therefore tis not to be doubted but could we make a microscope to     have one only refraction it would c√¶teris paribus far excel any     other that had a greater number and hence it is that if you take a     very clear piece of a broken venice glass and in a lamp draw it out     into very small hairs or threads then holding the ends of these     threads in the flame till they melt and run into a small round globul     or drop which will hang at the end of the thread and if further you     stick several of these upon the end of a stick with a little sealing     wax so as that the threads stand upwards and then on a whetstone     first grind off a good part of them and afterward on a smooth metal     plate with a little tripoly rub them till they come to be very     smooth if one of these be fixt with a little soft wax against a small     needle hole prickd through a thin plate of brass lead pewter or     any other metal and an object placd very near be lookd at through     it it will both magnifie and make some objects more distinct then any     of the great microscopes but because these though exceeding easily     made are yet very troublesome to be usd because of their smallness     and the nearness of the object therefore to prevent both these and     yet have only two refractions i provided me a tube of brass shapd     much like that in the fourth figure of the first scheme into the     smaller end of this i fixt with wax a good plano convex object glass     with the convex side towards the object and into the bigger end i fixt     also with wax a pretty large plano convex glass with the convex     side towards my eye then by means of the small hole by the side i     filld the intermediate space between these two glasses with very clear     water and with a screw stoppd it in then putting on a cell for the     eye i could perceive an object more bright then i could when the     intermediate space was only filld with air but this for other     inconveniences i made but little use of      my way for fixing both the glass and object to the pedestal most     conveniently was thus upon one side of a round pedestal ab in the     sixth figure of the first scheme was fixt a small pillar cc on this     was fitted a small iron arm d which could be movd up and down and     fixt in any part of the pillar by means of a small screw e on the end     of this arm was a small ball fitted into a kind of socket f made in     the side of the brass ring g through which the small end of the tube     was screwd by means of which contrivance i could place and fix the     tube in what posture i desird which for many observations was     exceeding necessary and adjusten it most exactly to any object      for placing the object i made this contrivance upon the end of a     small brass link or staple hh i so fastned a round plate ii that it     might be turnd round upon its center k and going pretty stiff would     stand fixt in any posture it was set on the side of this was fixt a     small pillar p about three quarters of an inch high and through the     top of this was thrust a small iron pin m whose top just stood over     the center of the plate on this top i fixt a small object and by     means of these contrivances i was able to turn it into all kind of     positions both to my eye and the light for by moving round the small     plate on its center could move it one way and by turning the pin m i     could move it another way and this without stirring the glass at all     or at least but very little the plate likewise i could move to and fro     to any part of the pedestal which in many cases was very convenient     and fix it also in any position by means of a nut n which was screwd     on upon the lower part of the pillar cc all the other contrivances are     obvious enough from the draught and will need no description  now though this were the instrument i made most use of yet i have made several other tryals with other kinds of microscopes which both for matter and form were very different from common spherical glasses i have made a microscope with one piece of glass both whose surfaces were plains i have made another only with a plano concave without any kind of reflection divers also by means of reflection i have made others of waters gums resins salts arsenick oyls and with divers other mixtures of watery and oyly liquors and indeed the subject is capable of a great variety but i find generally none more useful then that which is made with two glasses such as i have already describd  what the things are i observd the following descriptions will manifest in brief they were either exceeding small bodies or exceeding small pores or exceeding small motions some of each of which the reader will find in the following notes and such as i presume many of them at least will be new and perhaps not less strange some specimen of each of which heads the reader will find in the subsequent delineations and indeed of some more then i was willing there should be which was occasioned by my first intentions to print a much greater number then i have since found time to compleat of such therefore as i had i selected only some few of every head which for some particulars seemd most observable rejecting the rest as superfluous to the present design  what each of the delineated subjects are the following descriptions annext to each will inform of which i shall here only once for all add that in divers of them the gravers have pretty well followd my directions and draughts and that in making of them i indeavoured as far as i was able first to discover the true appearance and next to make a plain representation of it this i mention the rather because of these kind of objects there is much more difficulty to discover the true shape then of those visible to the naked eye the same object seeming quite differing in one position to the light from what it really is and may be discoverd in another and therefore i never began to make any draught before by many examinations in several lights and in several positions to those lights i had discoverd the true form for it is exceeding difficult in some objects to distinguish between a prominency and a depression between a shadow and a black stain or a reflection and a whiteness in the colour besides the transparency of most objects renders them yet much more difficult then if they were opacous the eyes of a fly in one kind of light appear almost like a lattice drilld through with abundance of small holes which probably may be the reason why the ingenious dr power seems to suppose them such in the sunshine they look like a surface coverd with golden nails in another posture like a surface coverd with pyramids in another with cones and in other postures of quite other shapes but that which exhibits the best is the light collected on the object by those means i have already describd  and this was undertaken in prosecution of the design which the royal society has proposd to it self for the members of the assembly having before their eys so many fatal instances of the errors and falshoods in which the greatest part of mankind has so long wandred because they relyd upon the strength of humane reason alone have begun anew to correct all hypotheses by sense as seamen do their dead reckonings by coelestial observations and to this purpose it has been their principal indeavour to enlarge  strengthen the senses by medicine and by such outward instruments as are proper for their particular works by this means they find some reason to suspect that those effects of bodies which have been commonly attributed to qualities and those confessd to be occult are performd by the small machines of nature which are not to be discernd without these helps seeming the meer products of motion figure and magnitude and that the natural textures which some call the plastick faculty may be made in looms which a greater perfection of opticks may make discernable by these glasses so as now they are no more puzzled about them then the vulgar are to conceive how tapestry or flowred stuffs are woven and the ends of all these inquiries they intend to be the pleasure of contemplative minds but above all the ease and dispatch of the labours of mens hands they do indeed neglect no opportunity to bring all the rare things of remote countries within the compass of their knowledge and practice but they still acknowledg their most useful informations to arise from common things and from diversifying their most ordinary operations upon them they do not wholly reject experiments of meer light and theory but they principally aim at such whose applications will improve and facilitate the present way of manual arts and though some men who are perhaps taken up about less honourable employments are pleasd to censure their proceedings yet they can shew more fruits of their first three years wherein they have assembled then any other society in europe can for a much larger space of time tis true such undertakings as theirs do commonly meet with small incouragement because men are generally rather taken with the plausible and discursive then the real and the solid part of philosophy yet by the good fortune of their institution in an age of all others the most inquisitive they have been assisted by the contribution and presence of very many of the chief nobility and gentry and others who are some of the most considerable in their several professions but that that yet farther convinces me of the real esteem that the more serious part of men have of this society is that several merchants men who act in earnest whose object is meum  tuum that great rudder of humane affairs have adventurd considerable sums of money to put in practice what some of our members have contrived and have continued stedfast in their good opinions of such indeavours when not one of a hundred of the vulgar have believed their undertakings feasable and it it also fit to be added that they have one advantage peculiar to themselves that very many of their number are men of converse and traffick which is a good omen that their attempts will bring philosophy from words to action seeing the men of business have had so great a share in their first foundation  and of this kind i ought not to conceal one particular generosity which more nearly concerns my self it is the munificence of sir john cutler in endowing a lecture for the promotion of mechanick arts to be governed and directed by this societythis bounty i mention for the honourableness of the thing it self and for the expectation which i have of the efficacy of the example for it cannot now be objected to them that their designs will be esteemed frivolous and vain when they have such a real testimony of the approbation of a man that is such an eminent ornament of this renowned city and one who by the variety and the happy success of his negotiations has given evident proofs that he is not easie to be deceivd this gentleman has well observd that the arts of life have been too long imprisond in the dark shops of mechanicks themselves  there hindred from growth either by ignorance or selfinterest and he has bravely freed them from these inconveniences he hath not only obliged tradesmen but trade it self he has done a work that is worthy of london and has taught the chief city of commerce in the world the right way how commerce is to be improvd we have already seen many other great signs of liberality and a large mind from the same hand for by his diligence about the corporation for the poor by his honorable subscriptions for the rebuilding of st pauls by his chearful disbursment for the replanting of ireland and by many other such publick works he has shewn by what means he indeavours to establish his memory and now by this last gift he has done that which became one of the wisest citizens of our nation to accomplish seeing one of the wisest of our statesmen the lord verulam first propounded it  but to return to my subject from a digression which i hope my reader will pardon me seeing the example is so rare that i can make no more such digressions if these my first labours shall be any wayes useful to inquiring men i must attribute the incouragement and promotion of them to a very reverend and learned person of whom this ought in justice to be said that there is scarce any one invention which this nation has producd in our age but it has some way or other been set forward by his assistance my reader i believe will quickly ghess that it is dr wilkins that i mean he is indeed a man born for the good of mankind and for the honour of his country in the sweetness of whose behaviour in the calmness of his mind in the unbounded goodness of his heart we have an evident instance what the true and the primitive unpassionate religion was before it was sowred by particular factions in a word his zeal has been so constant and effectual in advancing all good and profitable arts that as one of the antient romans said of scipio that he thanked god that he was a roman because whereever scipio had been born there had been the seat of the empire of the world so may i thank god that dr wilkins was an englishman for whereever he had lived there had been the chief seat of generous knowledge and true philosophy to the truth of this there are so many worthy men living that will subscribe that i am confident what i have here said will not be looked upon by any ingenious reader as a panegyrick but only as a real testimony  by the advice of this excellent man i first set upon this enterprise yet still came to it with much reluctancy because i was to follow the footsteps of so eminent a person as dr wren who was the first that attempted any thing of this nature whose original draughts do now make one of the ornaments of that great collection of rarities in the kings closet this honor which his first beginnings of this kind have receivd to be admitted into the most famous place of the world did not so much incourage as the hazard of coming after dr wren did affright me for of him i must affirm that since the time of archimedes there scarce ever met in one man in so great a perfection such a mechanical hand and so philosophical a mind  but at last being assured both by dr wilkins and dr wren himself that he had given over his intentions of prosecuting it and not finding that there was any else designd the pursuing of it i set upon this undertaking and was not a little incouragd to proceed in it by the honour the royal society was pleasd to favour me with in approving of those draughts which from time to time as i had an opportunity of describing i presented to them and particularly by the incitements of divers of those noble and excellent persons of it which were my more especial friends who were not less urgent with me for the publishing then for the prosecution of them  after i had almost compleated these pictures and observations having had divers of them ingraven and was ready to send them to the press i was informd that the ingenious physitian dr henry power had made several microscopical observations which had i not afterwards upon our interchangably viewing each others papers found that they were for the most part differing from mine either in the subject it self or in the particulars taken notice of and that his design was only to print observations without pictures i had even then suppressed what i had so far proceeded in but being further excited by several of my friends in complyance with their opinions that it would not be unacceptable to several inquisitive men and hoping also that i should thereby discover something new to the world i have at length cast in my mite into the vast treasury of a philosophical history and it is my hope as well as belief that these my labours will be no more comparable to the productions of many other natural philosophers who are now every where busie about greater things then my little objects are to be compard to the greater and more beautiful works of nature a flea a mite a gnat to an horse an elephant or a lyon                                         micrographia  or some  physiological descriptions  of  minute bodies  made by  magnifying glasses  with  observations and inquiries thereupon                                        observ i of the point of a sharp small needle  as in geometry the most natural way of beginning is from a mathematical point so is the same method in observations and natural history the most genuine simple and instructive we must first endevour to make letters and draw single strokes true before we venture to write whole sentences or to draw large pictures and in physical enquiries we must endevour to follow nature in the more plain and easie ways she treads in the most simple and uncompounded bodies to trace her steps and be acquainted with her manner of walking there before we venture our selves into the multitude of meanders she has in bodies of a more complicated nature lest being unable to distinguish and judge of our way we quickly lose both nature our guide and our selves too and are left to wander in the labyrinth of groundless opinions wanting both judgment that light and experience that clew which should direct our proceedings  we will begin these our inquiries therefore with the observations of bodies of the most simple nature first and so gradually proceed to those of a more compounded one in prosecution of which method we shall begin with a physical point of which kind the point of a needle is commonly reckond for one and is indeed for the most part made so sharp that the naked eye cannot distinguish any parts of it it very easily pierces and makes its way through all kind of bodies softer then it self but if viewd with a very good microscope we may find that the top of a needle though as to the sense very sharp appears a broad blunt and very irregular end not resembling a cone as is imagind but onely a piece of a tapering body with a great part of the top removd or deficient the points of pins are yet more blunt and the points of the most curious mathematical instruments do very seldome arrive at so great a sharpness how much therefore can be built upon demonstrations made onely by the productions of the ruler and compasses he will be better able to consider that shall but view those points and lines with a microscope  now though this point be commonly accounted the sharpest whence when we would express the sharpness of a point the most superlatively we say as sharp as a needle yet the microscope can afford us hundreds of instances of points many thousand times sharper such as those of the hairs and bristles and claws of multitudes of insects the thorns or crooks or hairs of leaves and other small vegetables nay the ends of the stiri√¶ or small parallelipipeds of amianthus and alumen plumosum of many of which though the points are so sharp as not to be visible though viewd with a microscope which magnifies the object in bulk above a million of times yet i doubt not but were we able practically to make microscopes according to the theory of them we might find hills and dales and pores and a sufficient bredth or expansion to give all those parts elbowroom even in the blunt top of the very point of any of these so very sharp bodies for certainly the quantity or extension of any body may be divisible in infinitum though perhaps not the matter  but to proceed the image we have here exhibited in the first figure1 was the top of a small and very sharp needle whose point aa nevertheless appeard through the microscope above a quarter of an inch broad not round nor flat but irregular and uneven so that it seemd to have been big enough to have afforded a hundred armed mites room enough to be rangd by each other without endangering the breaking one anothers necks by being thrust off on either side the surface of which though appearing to the naked eye very smooth could not nevertheless hide a multitude of holes and scratches and ruggednesses from being discoverd by the microscope to invest it several of which inequalities as a b c seemd holes made by some small specks of rust and d some adventitious body that stuck very close to it were casual all the rest that roughen the surface were onely so many marks of the rudeness and bungling of art so unaccurate is it in all its productions even in those which seem most neat that if examind with an organ more acute then that by which they were made the more we see of their shape the less appearance will there be of their beauty whereas in the works of nature the deepest discoveries shew us the greatest excellencies an evident argument that he that was the author of all these things was no other then omnipotent being able to include as great a variety of parts and contrivances in the yet smallest discernable point as in those vaster bodies which comparatively are called also points such as the earth sun or planets nor need it seem strange that the earth it self may be by analogie calld a physical point for as its body though now so near us as to fill our eys and fancies with a sense of the vastness of it may by a little distance and some convenient diminishing glasses be made vanish into a scarce visible speck or point as i have often tryd on the moon and when not too bright on the sun it self so could a mechanical contrivance succesfully answer our theory we might see the least spot as big as the earth it self and discover as des cartes2 also conjectures as great a variety of bodies in the moon or planets as in the earth  but leaving these discoveries to future industries we shall proceed to add one observation more of a point commonly so calld that is the mark of a full stop or period and for this purpose i observed many both printed ones and written and among multitudes i found few of them more round or regular then this which i have delineated in the third figure of the second scheme but very many abundantly more disfigurd and for the most part if they seemd equally round to the eye i found those points that had been made by a copperplate and rollpress to be as misshapen as those which had been made with types the most curious and smothly engraven strokes and points looking but as so many furrows and holes and their printed impressions but like smutty daubings on a matt or uneven floor with a blunt extinguisht brand or sticks end and as for points made with a pen they were much more ragged and deformed nay having viewd certain pieces of exceeding curious writing of the kind one of which in the bredth of a twopence comprisd the lords prayer the apostles creed the ten commandments and about half a dozen verses besides of the bible whose lines were so small and near together that i was unable to number them with my naked eye a very ordinary microscope i had then about me inabled me to see that what the writer of it had asserted was true but withall discoverd of what pitifull bungling scribbles and scrawls it was composd arabian and china characters being almost as well shapd yet thus much i must say for the man that it was for the most part legible enough though in some places there wanted a good fantsy well preposest to help one through if this manner of small writing were made easie and practicable and i think i know such a one but have never yet made tryal of it whereby one might be inabled to write a great deale with much ease and accurately enough in a very little roome it might be of very good use to convey secret intelligence without any danger of discovery or mistrusting but to come again to the point the irregularities of it are caused by three or four coadjutors one of which is the uneven surface of the paper which at best appears no smother then a very course piece of shagd cloth next the irregularity of the type or ingraving and a third is the rough daubing of the printingink that lies upon the instrument that makes the impression to all which add the variation made by the different lights and shadows and you may have sufficient reason to guess that a point may appear much more ugly then this which i have here presented which though it appeard through the microscope gray like a great splatch of london dirt about three inches over yet to the naked eye it was black and no bigger then that in the midst of the circle a and could i have found room in this plate to have inserted an o you should have seen that the letters were not more distinct then the points of distinction nor a drawn circle more exactly so then we have now shown a point to be a point                                        observ ii of the edge of a razor  the sharpest edge hath the same kind of affinity to the sharpest point in physicks as a line hath to a point in mathematicks and therefore the treaty concerning this may very properly be annexed to the former a razor doth appear to be a body of a very neat and curious aspect till more closely viewed by the microscope and there we may observe its very edge to be of all kind of shapes except what it should be for examining that of a very sharp one i could not find that any part of it had any thing of sharpness in it but it appeared a rough surface of a very considerable bredth from side to side the narrowest part not seeming thinner then the back of a pretty thick knife nor ist likely that it should appear any otherwise since as we just now shewd that a point appeard a circle tis rational a line should be a parallelogram  now for the drawing this second figure3 which represents a part of the edge about half a quarter of an inch long of a razor well set i so placd it between the objectglass  the light that there appeard a reflection from the very edge represented by the white line abcdef in which you may perceive it to be somewhat sharper then elsewhere about d to be indented or pitted about b to be broader and thicker about c and unequal and rugged about e and pretty even between ab and ef nor was that part of the edge ghik so smooth as one would imagine so smooth bodies as a hone and oyl should leave it for besides those multitudes of scratches which appear to have razd the surface ghik and to cross each other every way which are not half of them exprest in the figure there were several great and deep scratches or furrows such as gh and ik which made the surface yet more rugged causd perhaps by some small dust casually falling on the hone or some harder or more flinty part of the hone it self the other part of the razor ll which is polishd on a grindingstone appeard much rougher then the other looking almost like a plowd field with many parallels ridges and furrows and a cloddy as twere or an uneven surface nor shall we wonder at the roughnesses of those surfaces since even in the most curious wrought glasses for microscopes and other optical uses i have when the sun has shone well on them discoverd their surface to be variously razd or scratched and to consist of an infinite of small broken surfaces which reflect the light of very various and differing colours and indeed it seems impossible by art to cut the surface of any hard and brittle body smooth since putte or even the most curious powder that can be made use of to polish such a body must consist of little hard rough particles and each of them must cut its way and consequently leave some kind of gutter or furrow behind it and though nature does seem to do it very readily in all kinds of fluid bodies yet perhaps future observators may discover even these also rugged it being very probable as i elsewhere shew that fluid bodies are made up of small solid particles variously and strongly movd and may find reason to think there is scarce a surface in rerum natur√¢ perfectly smooth the black spot mn i ghess to be some small speck of rust for that i have oft observd to be the manner of the working of corrosive juyces to conclude this edge and piece of a razor if it had been really such as it appeard through the microscope would scarcely have servd to cleave wood much less to have cut off the hair of beards unless it were after the manner that lucian merrily relates charon to have made use of when with a carpenters axe he chopd off the beard of a sage philosopher whose gravity he very cautiously feard would indanger the oversetting of his wherry                                        observ iii of fine lawn or linnen cloth  this is another product of art a piece of the finest lawn i was able to get so curious that the threads were scarce discernable by the naked eye and yet through an ordinary microscope you may perceive4 what a goodly piece of coarse matting it is what proportionable cords each of its threads are being not unlike both in shape and size the bigger and coarser kind of single ropeyarn wherewith they usually make cables that which makes the lawn so transparent is by the microscope nay by the naked eye if attentively viewed plainly enough evidenced to be the multitude of square holes which are left between the threads appearing to have much more hole in respect of the intercurrent parts then is for the most part left in a latticewindow which it does a little resemble onely the crossing parts are round and not flat  these threads that compose this fine contexture though they are as small as those that constitute the finer sorts of silks have notwithstanding nothing of their glossie pleasant and lively reflection nay i have been informed both by the inventor himself and several other eyewitnesses that though the flax out of which it is made has been by a singular art of that excellent person and noble vertuoso m charls howard brother to the duke of norfolk so curiously dressd and prepard as to appear both to the eye and the touch full as fine and as glossie and to receive all kinds of colours as well as sleavesilk yet when this silken flax is twisted into threads it quite loseth its former luster and becomes as plain and base a thread to look on as one of the same bigness made of common flax  the reason of which odd phenomenon seems no other then this that though the curiously drest flax has its parts so exceedingly small as to equallize if not to be much smaller then the clew of the silkworm especially in thinness yet the differences between the figures of the constituting filaments are so great and their substances so various that whereas those of the silk are small round hard transparent and to their bigness proportionably stiff so as each filament preserves its proper figure and consequently its vivid reflection intire though twisted into a thread if not too hard those of flax are flat limber softer and less transparent and in twisting into a thread they joyn and lie so close together as to lose their own and destroy each others particular reflections there seems therefore three particulars very requisite to make the so drest flax appear silk also when spun into threads first that the substance of it should be made more clear and transparent flax retaining in it a kind of opacating brown or yellow and the parts of the whitest kind i have yet observd with the microscope appearing white like flawd horn or glass rather then clear like clear horn or glass next that the filaments should each of them be rounded if that could be done which yet is not so very necessary if the first be performd and this third which is that each of the small filaments be stifned for though they be square or flat provided they be transparent and stiff much the same appearances must necessarily follow now though i have not yet made trial yet i doubt not but that both these proprieties may be also inducd upon the flax and perhaps too by one and the same expedient which some trials may quickly inform any ingenious attempter of who from the use and profit of such an invention may find sufficient argument to be prompted to such inquiries as for the tenacity of the substance of flax out of which the thread is made it seems much inferiour to that of silk the one being a vegetable the other an animal substance and whether it proceed from the better concoction or the more homogeneous constitution of animal substances above those of vegetables i do not here determine yet since i generally find that vegetable substances do not equalize the tenacity of animal nor these the tenacity of some purified mineral substances i am very apt to think that the tenacity of bodies does not proceed from the hamous or hooked particles as the epicureans and some modern philosophers have imagind but from the more exact congruity of the constituent parts which are contiguous to each other and so bulky as not to be easily separated or shatterd by any small pulls or concussion of heat                                        observ iv of fine waled silk or taffety  this5 is the appearance of a piece of very fine taffetyriband in the bigger magnifying glass which you see exhibits it like a very convenient substance to make bedmatts or doormatts of or to serve for beehives cornscuttles chairs or corntubs it being not unlike that kind of work wherewith in many parts in england they make such utensils of straw a little wreathed and bound together with thongs of brambles for in this contexture each little filament fiber or clew of the silkworm seemd about the bigness of an ordinary straw as appears by the little irregular pieces ab cd and ef the warp or the thread that ran crossing the riband appeard like a single rope of an inch diameter but the woof or the thread that ran the length of the riband appeard not half so big each inch of sixpenybroad riband appearing no less then a piece of matting inch and half thick and twelve foot square a few yards of this would be enough to floor the long gallery of the loure at paris but to return to our piece of riband it affords us a not unpleasant object appearing like a bundle or wreath of very clear and transparent cylinders if the silk be white and curiously tingd if it be colourd each of those small horney cylinders affording in some place or other of them as vivid a reflection as if it had been sent from a cylinder of glass or horn insomuch that the reflexions of red appeard as if coming from so many granates or rubies the loveliness of the colours of silks above those of hairy stuffs or linnen consisting as i elsewhere intimate chiefly in the transparency and vivid reflections from the concave or inner surface of the transparent cylinder as are also the colours of precious stones for most of the reflections from each of these cylinders come from the concave surface of the air which is as twere the foil that incompasses the cylinder the colours with which each of these cylinders are tingd seem partly to be superficial and sticking to the outsides of them and partly to be imbibd or sunck into the substance of them for silk seeming to be little else then a dried thread of glew may be supposd to be very easily relaxt and softened by being steeped in warm nay in cold if penetrant juyces or liquors and thereby those tinctures though they tinge perhaps but a small part of the substance yet being so highly impregnated with the colour as to be almost black with it may leave an impression strong enough to exhibite the desird colour a pretty kinde of artificial stuff i have seen looking almost like transparent parchment horn or isingglass and perhaps some such thing it may be made of which being transparent and of a glutinous nature and easily mollified by keeping in water as i found upon trial had imbibd and did remain tingd with a great variety of very vivid colours and to the naked eye it lookd very like the substance of the silk and i have often thought that probably there might be a way found out to make an artificial glutinous composition much resembling if not full as good nay better then that excrement or whatever other substance it be out of which the silkworm wiredraws his clew if such a composition were found it were certainly an easie matter to find very quick ways of drawing it out into small wires for use i need not mention the use of such an invention nor the benefit that is likely to accrue to the finder they being sufficiently obvious this hint therefore may i hope give some ingenious inquisitive person an occasion of making some trials which if successfull i have my aim and i suppose he will have no occasion to be displeasd                                        observ v of watered silks or stuffs  there are but few artificial things that are worth observing with a microscope and therefore i shall speak but briefly concerning them for the productions of art are such rude misshapen things that when viewd with a microscope is little else observable but their deformity the most curious carvings appearing no better then those rude russian images we find mentiond in purchas where three notches at the end of a stick stood for a face and the most smooth and burnishd surfaces appear most rough and unpolisht so that my first reason why i shall add but a few observations of them is their misshapen form and the next is their uselessness for why should we trouble our selves in the examination of that form or shape which is all we are able to reach with a microscope which we know was designd for no higher a use then what we were able to view with our naked eye why should we endeavour to discover mysteries in that which has no such thing in it and like rabbins find out caballisms and √¶nigm√¢s in the figure and placing of letters where no such thing lies hid whereas in natural forms there are some so small and so curious and their designd business so far removd beyond the reach of our sight that the more we magnify the object the more excellencies and mysteries do appear and the more we discover the imperfections of our senses and the omnipotency and infinite perfections of the great creatour i shall therefore onely add one or two observations more artificial things and then come to the treaty concerning such matters as are the productions of a more curious workman one of these shall be that of a piece of waterd silk represented in the second figure of the third scheme6 as it appeard through the least magnifying glass ab signifying the long way of the stuff and cd the broad way this stuff if the right side of it be looked upon appears to the naked eye all over so waved undulated or graind with a curious though irregular variety of brighter and darker parts that it adds no small gracefulness to the gloss of it it is so known a propriety that it needs but little explication but it is observable which perhaps everyone has not considered that those parts which appear the darker part of the wave in one position to the light in another appears the lighter and the contrary and by this means the undulations become transient and in a continual change according as the position of the parts in respect of the incident beams of light is varied the reason of which odd ph√¶nomena to one that has but diligently examind it even with his naked eye will be obvious enough but he that observes it with a microscope may more easily perceive what this proteus is and how it comes to change its shape he may very easily perceive that it proceeds onely from the variety of the reflections of light which is causd by the various shape of the particles or little protuberant parts of the thread that compose the surface and that those parts of the waves that appear the brighter throw towards the eye a multitude of small reflections of light whereas the darker scarce afford any the reason of which reflection the microscope plainly discovers as appears by the figure in which you may perceive that the brighter parts of the surface consist of an abundance of large and strong reflections denoted by a a a a a c for the surfaces of those threads that run the long way are by the mechanical process of watering creasd or angled in another kind of posture then they were by the weaving for by the weaving they are onely bent round the warping threads but by the watering they are bent with an angle or elbow that is in stead of lying or being bent round the threads as in the third figure a a a a a are about b b b b b b representing the ends as twere of the cross threads they are bent about they are creasd on the top of those threads with an angle as in the fourth figure and that with all imaginable variety so that whereas before they reflected the light onely from one point of the round surface as about c c c they now when waterd reflect the beams from more then half the whole surface as de de de and in other postures they return no reflections at all from those surfaces hence in one posture they compose the brighter parts of the waves in another the darker and these reflections are also varied according as the particular parts are variously bent the reason of which creasing we shall next examine and here we must fetch our information from the mechanism or manner of proceeding in this operation which as i have been informd is no other then this  they double all the stuff that is to be waterd that is they crease it just through the middle of it the whole length of the piece leaving the right side of the stuff inward and placing the two edges or silvages just upon one another and as near as they can place the wale so in the doubling of it that the wale of the one side may lie very near parallel or even with the wale of the other for the nearer that posture they lie the greater will the watering appear and the more obliquely or across to each other they lie the smaller are the waves their way for folding it for a great wale is thus they take a pin and begin at one side of the piece in any wale and so moving it towards the other side thereby direct their hands to the opposite ends of the wale and then as near as they can place the two opposite ends of the same wale together and so double or fold the whole piece repeating this enquiry with a pin at every yard or twos distance through the whole length then they sprinkle it with water and fold it the longways placing between every fold a piece of pastboard by which means all the wrong side of the waterd stuff becomes flat and with little wales and the wales on the other side become the more protuberant whence the creasings or angular bendings of the wales become the more perspicuous having folded it in this manner they place it with an interjacent pastboard into an hot press where it is kept very violently prest till it be dry and stiff by which means the wales of either contiguous sides leave their own impressions upon each other as is very manifest by the second figure where tis obvious enough that the wale of the piece abcd runs parallel between the pricked lines ef ef ef and as manifest to discern the impressions upon these wales left by those that were prest upon them which lying not exactly parallel with them but a little athwart them as is denoted by the lines of oooo gh gh gh between which the other wales did lie parallel they are so variously and irregularly creasd that being put into that shape when wet and kept so till they be drie they so let each others threads that the moldings remain almost as long as the stuff lasts  hence it may appear to any one that attentively considers the figure why the parts of the wale a a a a a a should appear bright and why the parts b b b b b b b should appear shadowed or dark why some as d d d d d d should appear partly light and partly dark the varieties of which reflections and shadows are the only cause of the appearance of watering in silks or any other kind of stuffs  from the variety of reflection may also be deducd the cause why a small breez or gale of wind ruffling the surface of a smooth water makes it appear black as also on the other side why the smoothing or burnishing the surface of whitened silver makes it look black and multitudes of other ph√¶nomena might hereby be solvd which are too many to be here insisted on                                        observ vi of small glass canes  that i might be satisfied whether it were not possible to make an artificial pore as small as any natural i had yet found i made several attemps with small glass pipes melted in the flame of a lamp and then very suddenly drawn out into a great length and by that means without much difficulty i was able to draw some almost as small as a cobweb which yet with the microscope i could plainly perceive7 to be perforated both by looking on the ends of it and by looking on it against the light which was much the easier way to determine whether it were solid or perforated for taking a small pipe of glass and closing one end of it then filling it half full of water and holding it against the light i could by this means very easily find what was the differing aspect of a solid and a perforated piece of glass and so easily distingish without seeing either end whether any cylinder of glass i lookd on were a solid stick or a hollow cane and by this means i could also presently judge of any small filament of glass whether it were hollow or not which would have been exceeding tedious to examine by looking on the end and many such like ways i was fain to make use of in the examining of divers other particulars related in this book which would have been no easie task to have determined meerly by the more common way of looking on or viewing the object for if we consider first the very faint light wherewith the object is enlightened whence many particles appear opacous which when more enlightned appear very transparent so that i was fain to determine its transparency by one glass and its texture by another next the unmanageableness of most objects by reason of their smalness 3 the difficulty of finding the desired point and of placing it so as to reflect the light conveniently for the inquiry lastly ones being able to view it but with one eye at once they will appear no small obstructions nor are they easily removd without many contrivances but to proceed i could not find that water or some deeply tingd liquors would in small ones rise so high as one would expect and the highest i have found it yet rise in any of the pipes i have tryd was to 21 inches above the level of the water in the vessel for though i found that in the small pipes it would nimbly enter at first and run about 6 or 7 inches upwards yet i found it then to move upwards so slow that i have not yet had the patience to observe it above that height of 21 inches and that was in a pretty large pipe in comparison of those i formerly mentioned for i could observe the progress of a very deep tingd liquor in it with my naked eye without much trouble whereas many of the other pipes were so very small that unless in a convenient posture to the light i could not perceive them but tis very probable that a greater patience and assiduity may discover the liquors to rise at least to remain suspended at heights that i should be loath now even to ghess at if at least there be any proportion kept between the height of the ascending liquor and the bigness of the holes of the pipes  an attempt for the explication of this experiment  my conjecture that the unequal height of the surfaces of the water proceeded from the greater pressure made upon the water by the air without the pipes abc then by that within them8 i shall endeavour to confirm from the truth of the two following propositions  the first of which is that an unequal pressure of the incumbent air will cause an unequal height in the waters surfaces  and the second is that in this experiment there is such an unequal pressure  that the first is true the following experiment will evince for if you take any vessel so contrived as that you can at pleasure either increase or diminish the pressure of the air upon this or that part of the superficies of the water the equality of the height of those parts will presently be lost and that part of the superficies that sustains the greater pressure will be inferior to that which undergoes the less a fit vessel for this purpose will be an inverted glass syphon such an one as is described in the sixth figure for if into it you put water enough to fill it as high as ab and gently blow in at d you shall depress the superficies b and thereby raise the opposite superficies a to a considerable height and by gently sucking you may produce clean contrary effects  next that there is such an unequal pressure i shall prove from this that there is a much greater incongruity of air to glass and some other bodies then there is of water to the same  by congruity i mean a property of a fluid body whereby any part of it is readily united with any other part either of itself or of any other similar fluid or solid body and by incongruity a property of a fluid by which it is hindred from uniting with any dissimilar fluid or solid body  this last property any one that hath been observingly conversant about fluid bodies cannot be ignorant of for not now to mention several chymical spirits and oyls which will very hardly if at all be brought to mix with one another insomuch that there may be found some 8 or 9 or more several distinct liquors which swimming one upon another will not presently mix we need seek no further for examples of this kind in fluids then to observe the drops of rain falling through the air and the bubbles of air which are by any means conveyed under the surface of the water or a drop of common sallet oyl swimming upon water in all which and many more examples of this kind that might be enumerated the incongruity of two fluids is easily discernable and as for the congruity or incongruity of liquids with several kinds of firm bodies they have long since been taken notice of and called by the names of driness and moisture though these two names are not comprehensive enough being commonly used to signifie only the adhering or not adhering of water to some other solid bodies of this kind we may observe that water will more readily wet some woods then others and that water let fall upon a feather the whiter side of a colwort and some other leaves or upon almost any dusty unctuous or resinous superficies will not at all adhere to them but easily tumble off from them like a solid bowl whereas if dropt upon linnen paper clay green wood c it will not be taken off without leaving some part of it behind adhering to them so quicksilver which will very hardly be brought to stick to any vegetable body will readily adhere to and mingle with several clean metalline bodies  and that we may the better finde what the cause of congruity and incongruity in bodies is it will be requisite to consider first what is the cause of fluidness and this i conceive to be nothing else but a certain pulse or shake of heat for heat being nothing else but a very brisk and vehement agitation of the parts of a body as i have elswhere made probable the parts of a body are thereby made so loose from one another that they easily move any way and become fluid that i may explain this a little by a gross similitude let us suppose a dish of sand set upon some body that is very much agitated and shaken with some quick and strong vibrating motion as on a milstone turnd round upon the under stone very violently whilst it is empty or on a very stiff drumhead which is vehemently or very nimbly beaten with the drumsticks by this means the sand in the dish which before lay like a dull and unactive body becomes a perfect fluid and ye can no sooner make a hole in it with your finger but it is immediately filled up again and the upper surface of it levelld nor can you bury a light body as a piece of cork under it but it presently emerges or swims as twere on the top nor can you lay a heavier on the top of it as a piece of lead but it is immediately buried in sand and as twere sinks to the bottom nor can you make a hole in the side of the dish but the sand shall run out of it to a level not an obvious property of a fluid body as such but this dos imitate and all this meerly caused by the vehement agitation of the conteining vessel for by this means each sand becomes to have a vibrative or dancing motion so as no other heavier body can rest on it unless susteind by some other on either side nor will it suffer any body to be beneath it unless it be a heavier then it self another instance of the strange loosening nature of a violent jarring motion or a strong and nimble vibrative one we may have from a piece of iron grated on very strongly with a file for if into that a pin screwd so firm and hard that though it has a convenient head to it yet it can by no means be unscrewd by the fingers if i say you attempt to unscrew this whilst grated on by the file it will be found to undoe and turn very easily the first of these examples manifests how a body actually divided into small parts becomes a fluid and the latter manifests by what means the agitation of heat so easily loosens and unties the parts of solid and firm bodies nor need we suppose heat to be any thing else besides such a motion for supposing we could mechanically produce such a one quick and strong enough we need not spend fuel to melt a body now that i do not speak this altogether groundless i must refer the reader to the observations i have made upon the shining sparks of steel for there he shall find that the same effects are produced upon small chips or parcels of steel by the flame and by a quick and violent motion and if the body of steel may be thus melted as i there shew it may i think we have little reason to doubt that almost any other may not also every smith can inform one how quickly both his file and the iron grows hot with filing and if you rub almost any two hard bodies together they will do the same and we know that a sufficient degree of heat causes fluidity in some bodies much sooner and in others later that is the parts of the body of some are so loose from one another and so unapt to cohere and so minute and little that a very small degree of agitation keeps them always in the state of fluidity of this kind i suppose the √Üther that is the medium or fluid body in which all other bodies do as it were swim and move and particularly the air which seems nothing else but a kind of tincture or solution of terrestrial and aqueous particles dissolvd into it and agitated by it just as the tincture of cocheneel is nothing but some finer dissoluble parts of that concrete lickd up or dissolvd by the fluid water and from this notion of it we may easily give a more intelligible reason how the air becomes so capable of rarefaction and condensation for as in tinctures one grain of some strongly tinging substance may sensibly colour some hundred thousand grains of appropriated liquors so as every drop of it has its proportionate share and be sensibly tingd as i have tryd both with logwood and cocheneel and as some few grains of salt is able to infect as great a quantity as may be found by pr√¶cipitations though not so easily by the sight or taste so the air which seems to be but as twere a tincture or saline substance dissolvd and agitated by the fluid and agil √Üther may disperse and expand it self into a vast space if it have room enough and infect as it were every part of that space but as on the other side if there be but some few grains of the liquor it may extract all the colour of the tinging substance and may dissolve all the salt and thereby become much more impregnated with those substances so may all the air that sufficed in a rarfyd state to fill some hundred thousand spaces of √Üther be comprisd in only one but in a position proportionable dense and though we have not yet found out such strainers for tinctures and salts as we have for the air being yet unable to separate them from their dissolving liquors by any kind of filtre without pr√¶cipitation as we are able to separate the air from the √Üther by glass and several other bodies and though we are yet unable and ignorant of the ways of pr√¶cipitating air out of the √Üther as we can tinctures and salts out of several dissolvents yet neither of these seeming impossible from the nature of the things nor so improbable but that some happy future industry may find out ways to effect them nay further since we find that nature does really perform though by what means we are not certain both these actions namely by pr√¶cipitating the air in rain and dews and by supplying the streams and rivers of the world with fresh water straind through secret subterraneous caverns and since that in very many other proprieties they do so exactly seem of the same nature till further observations or tryals do inform us of the contrary we may safely enough conclude them of the same kind for it seldom happens that any two natures have so many properties coincident or the same as i have observd solutions and air to have and to be different in the rest and therefore i think it neither impossible irrational nay nor difficult to be able to predict what is likely to happen in other particulars also besides those which observation or experiment have declared thus or thus especially if the circumstances that do often very much conduce to the variation of the effects be duly weighd and considerd and indeed were there not a probability of this our inquiries would be endless our tryals vain and our greatest inventions would be nothing but the meer products of chance and not of reason and like mariners in an ocean destitute both of a compass and the sight of the celestial guids we might indeed by chance steer directly towards our desired port but tis a thousand to one but we miss our aim but to proceed we may hence also give a plain reason how the air comes to be darkned by clouds c which are nothing but a kind of precipitation and how those precipitations fall down in showrs hence also could i very easily and i think truly deduce the cause of the curious sixangular figures of snow and the appearances of haloes c and the sudden thickning of the sky with clouds and the vanishing and disappearing of those clouds again for all these things may be very easily imitated in a glass of liquor with some slight chymical preparations as i have often tryd and may somewhere else more largely relate but have not now time to set them down but to proceed there are other bodies that consist of particles more gross and of a more apt figure for cohesion and this requires somewhat greater agitation such i suppose mercury fermented vinous spirits several chymical oils which are much of kin to those spirits c others yet require a greater as water and so others much greater for almost infinite degrees for i suppose there are very few bodies in the world that may not be made aliquatenus fluid by some or other degree of agitation or heat  having therefore in short set down my notion of a fluid body i come in the next place to consider what congruity is and this as i said before being a relative property of a fluid whereby it may be said to be like or unlike to this or that other body whereby it does or does not mix with this or that body we will again have recourse to our former experiment though but a rude one and here if we mix in the dish several kinds of sands some of bigger others of less and finer bulks we shall find that by the agitation the fine sand will eject and throw out of it self all those bigger bulks of small stones and the like and those will be gathered together all into one place and if there be other bodies in it of other natures those also will be separated into a place by themselves and united or tumbled up together and though this do not come up to the highest property of congruity which is a coh√¶sion of the parts of the fluid together or a kind of attraction and tenacity yet this does as twere shadow it out and somewhat resemble it for just after the same manner i suppose the pulse of heat to agitate the small parcels of matter and those that are of a like bigness and figure and matter will hold or dance together and those which are of a differing kind will be thrust or shovd out from between them for particles that are similar will like so many equal musical strings equally stretcht vibrate together in a kind of harmony or unison whereas others that are dissimilar upon what account soever unless the disproportion be otherwise counterballancd will like so many strings out of tune to those unisons though they have the same agitating pulse yet make quite differing kinds of vibrations and repercussions so that though they may be both movd yet are their vibrations so different and so untund as twere to each other that they cross and jar against each other and consequently cannot agree together but fly back from each other to their similar particles now to give you an instance how the disproportion of some bodies in one respect may be counterballancd by a contrary disproportion of the same body in another respect whence we find that the subtil vinous spirit is congruous or does readily mix with water which in many properties is of a very differing nature we may consider that a unison may be made either by two strings of the same bigness length and tension or by two strings of the same bigness but of differing length and a contrary differing tension or 3ly by two strings of unequal length and bigness and of a differing tension or of equal length and differing bigness and tension and several other such varieties to which three properties in strings will correspond three proprieties also in sand or the particles of bodies their matter or substance their figure or shape and their body or bulk and from the varieties of these three may arise infinite varieties in fluid bodies though all agitated by the same pulse or vibrative motion and there may be as many ways of making harmonies and discords with these as there may be with musical strings having therefore seen what is the cause of congruity or incongruity those relative properties of fluids we may from what has been said very easily collect what is the reason of those relative proprieties also between fluid bodies and solid for since all bodies consist of particles of such a substance figure and bulk but in some they are united together more firmly then to be loosened from each other by every vibrative motion though i imagine that there is no body in the world but that some degree of agitation may as i hinted before agitate and loosen the particles so as to make them fluid those cohering particles may vibrate in the same manner almost as those that are loose and become unisons or discords as i may so speak to them now that the parts of all bodies though never so solid do yet vibrate i think we need go no further for proof then that all bodies have some degrees of heat in them and that there has not been yet found any thing perfectly cold nor can i believe indeed that there is any such thing in nature as a body whose particles are at rest or lazy and unactive in the great theatre of the world it being quite contrary to the grand oeconomy of the universe we see therefore what is the reason of the sympathy or uniting of some bodies together and of the antipathy or flight of others from each other for congruity seems nothing else but a sympathy and incongruity an antipathy of bodies hence similar bodies once united will not easily part and dissimilar bodies once disjoynd will not easily unite again from hence may be very easily deducd the reason of the suspension of water and quicksilver above their usual station as i shall more at large anon shew  these properties therefore alwayes the concomitants of fluid bodies produce these following visible effects  first they unite the parts of a fluid to its similar solid or keep them separate from its dissimilar hence quicksilver will as we noted before stick to gold silver tin lead c and unite with them but roul off from wood stone glass c if never so little scituated out of its horizontal level and water that will wet salt and dissolve it will slip off from tallow or the like without at all adhering as it may likewise be observed to do upon a dusty superficies and next they cause the parts of homogeneal fluid bodies readily to adhere together and mix and of heterogeneal to be exceeding averse thereunto hence we find that two small drops of water on any superficies they can roul on will if they chance to touch each other readily unite and mix into one 3d drop the like may be observed with two small bowls of quicksilver upon a table or glass provided their surfaces be not dusty and with two drops of oyl upon fair water c and further water put unto wine salt water vinegar spirit of wine or the like does immediately especially if they be shaken together disperse it self all over them hence on the contrary we also find that oyl of tartar poured upon quicksilver and spirit of wine on that oyl and oyl of turpentine on that spirit and air upon that oyl though they be stopt closely up into a bottle and shaken never so much they will by no means long suffer any of their bigger parts to be united or included within any of the other liquors by which recited liquors may be plainly enough represented the four peripatetical elements and the more subtil √Üther above all from this property tis that a drop of water does not mingle with or vanish into air but is driven by that fluid equally protruding it on every side and forct into as little a space as it can possibly be contained in namely into a round globule so likewise a little air blown under the water is united or thrust into a bubble by the ambient water and a parcel of quicksilver enclosed with air water or almost any other liquor is formed into a round ball  now the cause why all these included fluids newly mentioned or as many others as are wholly included within a heterogeneous fluid are not exactly of a spherical figure seeing that if caused by these principles only it could be of no other must proceed from some other kind of pressure against the two opposite flatted sides this adventitious or accidental pressure may proceed from divers causes and accordingly must diversifie the figure of the included heterogeneous fluid for seeing that a body may be included either with a fluid only or only with a solid or partly with a fluid and partly with a solid or partly with one fluid and partly with another there will be found a very great variety of the terminating surfaces much differing from a spherical according to the various resistance or pressure that belongs to each of these encompassing bodies  which properties may in general be deduced from two heads viz motion and rest for either this globular figure is altered by a natural motion such as is gravity or a violent such as is any accidental motion of the fluids as we see in the wind ruffling up the water and the purlings of streams and foaming of catarracts and the like or thirdly by the rest firmness and stability of the ambient solid for if the including solid be of an angular or any other irregular form the included fluid will be near of the like as a pintpot full of water or a bladder full of air and next if the including or included fluid have a greater gravity one than another then will the globular form be deprest into an ellipticospherical as if for example we suppose the circle abcd in the fourth figure to represent a drop of water quicksilver or the like included with the air or the like which supposing there were no gravity at all in either of the fluids or that the contained and containing were of the same weight would be equally comprest into an exactly spherical body the ambient fluid forcing equally against every side of it but supposing either a greater gravity in the included by reason whereof the parts of it being prest from a towards b and thereby the whole put into motion and that motion being hindred by the resistance of the subjacent parts of the ambient the globular figure adbc will be deprest into the ellipticospherical egfh for the side a is detruded to e by the gravity and b to f by the resistance of the subjacent medium and therefore c must necessarily be thrust to g and d to h or else supposing a greater gravity in the ambient by whose more then ordinary pressure against the under side of the included globule b will be forced to f and by its resistance of the motion upwards the side a will be deprest to e and therefore c being thrust to g and d to h the globular figure by this means also will be made an ellipticospherical next if a fluid be included partly with one and partly with another fluid it will be found to be shaped diversly according to the proportion of the gravity and incongruity of the 3 fluids one to another as in the second figure let the upper mmm be air the middle lmno be common oyl the lower ooo be water the oyl will be formd not into a spherical figure such as is represented by the pricked line but into such a figure as lmno whose side lmn will be of a flatter elliptical figure by reason of the great disproportion between the gravity of oyl and air and the side lom of a rounder because of the smaller difference between the weight of oyl and water lastly the globular figure will be changed if the ambient be partly fluid and partly solid and here the termination of the incompassed fluid towards the incompassing is shapd according to the proportion of the congruity or incongruity of the fluids to the solids and of the gravity and incongruity of the fluids one to another as suppose the subjacent medium that hinders an included fluids descent be a solid as let ki in the fourth figure represent the smooth superficies of a table egfh a parcel of running mercury the side gfh will be more flatted according to the proportion of the incongruity of the mercury and air to the wood and of the gravity of mercury and air one to another the side geh will likewise be a little more deprest by reason the subjacent parts are now at rest which were before in motion  or further in the third figure let aild represent an including solid medium of a cylindrical shape as suppose a small glass jar let fgemm represent a containd fluid as water this towards the bottom and sides is figured according to the concavity of the glass but its upper surface which by reason of its gravity not considering at all the air above it and so neither the congruity or incongruity of either of them to the glass should be terminated by part of a sphere whose diameter should be the same with that of the earth which to our sense would appear a straight line as fge or which by reason of its having a greater congruity to glass than air has not considering its gravity would be thrust into a concave sphere as chb whose diameter would be the same with that of the concavity of the vessel its upper surface i say by reason of its having a greater gravity then the air and having likewise a greater congruity to glass then the air has is terminated by a concave ellipticospherical figure as ckb for by its congruity it easily conforms it self and adheres to the glass and constitutes as it were one containing body with it and therefore should thrust the contained air on that side it touches it into a spherical figure as bhc but the motion of gravity depressing a little the corners b and c reduces it into the aforesaid figure ckb now that it is the greater congruity of one of the two contiguous fluids then of the other to the containing solid that causes the separating surfaces to be thus or thus figured and that it is not because this or that figurated surface is more proper natural or peculiar to one of these fluid bodies then to the other will appear from this that the same fluids will by being put into differing solids change their surfaces for the same water which in a glass or wooden vessel will have a concave surface upwards and will rise higher in a smaller then a greater pipe the same water i say in the same pipes greased over or oyled will produce quite contrary effects for it will have a protuberant and convex surface upwards and will not rise so high in small as in bigger pipes nay in the very same solid vessel you may make the very same two contiguous liquids to alter their surfaces for taking a small wineglass or such like vessel and pouring water gently into it you shall perceive the surface of the water all the way concave till it rise even with the top when you shall find it if you gently and carefully pour in more to grow very protuberant and convex the reason of which is plain for that the solid sides of the containing body are no longer extended to which the water does more readily adhere then the air but it is henceforth to be included with air which would reduce it into a hemisphere but by reason of its gravity it is flatted into an oval quicksilver also which to glass is more incongruous then air and thereby being put into a glasspipe will not adhere to it but by the more congruous air will be forced to have a very protuberant surface and to rise higher in a greater then a lesser pipe this quicksilver to clean metal especially to gold silver tin lead c iron excepted is more congruous then air and will not only stick to it but have a concave surface like water and rise higher in a less then in a greater pipe  in all these examples it is evident that there is an extraordinary and adventitious force by which the globular figure of the contained heterogeneous fluid is altered neither can it be imagined how it should otherwise be of any other figure then globular for being by the heterogeneous fluid equally protruded every way whatsoever part is protuberant will be thereby deprest from this cause it is that in its effects it does very much resemble a round spring such as a hoop for as in a round spring there is required an additional pressure against two opposite sides to reduce it into an oval form or to force it in between the sides of a hole whose diameter is less then that of the spring there must be a considerable force or protusion against the concave or inner side of the spring so to alter this spherical constitution of an included fluid body there is required more pressure against opposite sides to reduce it into an oval and to press it into an hole less in diameter then it self it requires a greater protrusion against all the other sides what degrees of force are requisite to reduce them into longer and longer ovals or to press them into less and less holes i have not yet experimentally calculated but thus much by experiment i find in general that there is alwayes required a greater pressure to close them into longer ovals or protude them into smaller holes the necessity and reason of this were it requisite i could easily explain but being not so necessary and requiring more room and time then i have for it at present i shall here omit it and proceed to shew that this may be presently found true if experiment be made with a round spring the way of making which trials is obvious enough and with the fluid bodies of mercury air c the way of trying which will be somewhat more difficult and therefore i shall in brief describe it he therefore that would try with air must first be provided of a glasspipe made of the shape of that in the fifth figure whereof the side ab represents a straight tube of about three foot long c represents another part of it which consists of a round bubble so ordered that there is left a passage or hole at the top into which may be fastened with cement several small pipes of determinate cylindrical cavities as let hollow of    f       14   g       16   h       18   i  be   112   of an inch   k       116   l       124   m       132   c there may be added as many more as the experimenter shall think fit with holes continually decreasing by known quantities so far as his senses are able to help him i say so far because there may be made pipes so small that it will be impossible to perceive the perforation with ones naked eye though by the help of a microscope it may easily enough be perceived nay i have made a pipe perforated from end to end so small that with my naked eye i could very hardly see the body of it insomuch that i have been able to knit it up into a knot without breaking and more accurately examining one with my microscope i found it not so big as a sixteenth part of one of the smaller hairs of my head which was of the smaller and finer sort of hair so that sixteen of these pipes bound faggotwise together would but have equalized one single hair how small therefore must its perforation be it appearing to me through the microscope to be a proportionably thicksided pipe  to proceed then for the trial of the experiment the experimenter must place the tube ab perpendicular and fill the pipe f cemented into the hole e with water but leave the bubble c full of air and then gently pouring in water into the pipe ab he must observe diligently how high the water will rise in it before it protrude the bubble of air c through the narrow passage of f and denote exactly the height of the cylinder of water then cementing in a second pipe as g and filling it with water he may proceed as with the former denoting likewise the height of the cylinder of water able to protrude the bubble c through the passage of g the like may he do with the next pipe and the next c as far as he is able then comparing the several heights of the cylinders with the several holes through which each cylinder did force the air having due regard to the cylinders of water in the small tubes it will be very easie to determine what force is requisite to press the air into such and such a hole or to apply it to our present experiment how much of the pressure of the air is taken off by its ingress into smaller and smaller holes from the application of which to the entring of the air into the bigger hole of the vessel and into the smaller hole of the pipe we shall clearly find that there is a greater pressure of the air upon the water in the vessel or greater pipe then there is upon that in the lesser pipe for since the pressure of the air every way is found to be equal that is as much as is able to press up and sustain a cylinder of quicksilver of two foot and a half high or thereabouts and since of this pressure so many more degrees are required to force the air into a smaller then into a greater hole that is full of a more congruous fluid and lastly since those degrees that are requisite to press it in are thereby taken off from the air within and the air within left with so many degrees of pressure less then the air without it will follow that the air in the less tube or pipe will have less pressure against the superficies of the water therein then the air in the bigger which was the minor proposition to be proved  the conclusion therefore will necessarily follow viz that this unequal pressure of the air caused by its ingress into unequal holes is a cause sufficient to produce this effect without the help of any other concurrent therefore is probably the principal if not the only cause of these ph√¶nomena  this therefore being thus explained there will be divers ph√¶nomena explicable thereby as the rising of liquors in a filtre the rising of spirit of wine oyl melted tallow c in the week of a lamp though made of small wire threeds of asbestus strings of glass or the like the rising of liquors in a spunge piece of bread sand c perhaps also the ascending of the sap in trees and plants through their small and some of them imperceptible pores of which i have said more on another occasion at least the passing of it out of the earth into their roots and indeed upon the consideration of this principle multitudes of other uses of it occurrd to me which i have not yet so well examined and digested as to propound for axioms but only as queries and conjectures which may serve as hints toward some further discoveries  as first upon the consideration of the congruity and incongruity of bodies as to touch i found also the like congruity and incongruity if i may so speak as to the transmitting of the rates of light for as in this regard water not now to mention other liquors seems nearer of affinity to glass then air and air then quicksilver whence an oblique ray out of glass will pass into water with very little refraction from the perpendicular but none out of glass into air excepting a direct will pass without a very great refraction from the perpendicular nay any oblique ray under thirty degrees will not be admitted into the air at all and quicksilver will neither admit oblique or direct but reflects all seeming as to the transmitting of the raies of light to be of a quite differing constitution from that of air water glass c and to resemble most those opacous and strong reflecting bodies of metals so also as to the property of cohesion or congruity water seems to keep the same order being more congruous to glass then air and air then quicksilver  a second thing which was hinted to me by the consideration of the included fluids globular form caused by the protrusion of the ambient heterogeneous fluid was whether the ph√¶nomena of gravity might not by this means be explained by supposing the globe of earth water and air to be included with a fluid heterogeneous to all and each of them so subtil as not only to be every where interspersed through the air or rather the air through it but to pervade the bodies of glass and even the closest metals by which means it may endeavour to detrude all earthly bodies as far from it as it can and partly thereby and partly by other of its properties may move them towards the center of the earth now that there is some such fluid i could produce many experiments and reasons that do seem to prove it but because it would ask some time and room to set them down and explain them and to consider and answer all the objections many whereof i foresee that may be alledged against it i shall at present proceed to other queries contenting my self to have here only given a hint of what i may say more elswhere  a third query then was whether the heterogeneity of the ambient fluid may not be accounted a secondary cause of the roundness or globular form of the greater bodies of the world such as are those of the sun stars and planets the substance of each of which seems altogether heterogeneous to the circumambient fluid √¶ther and of this i shall say more in the observation of the moon  a fourth was whether the globular form of the smaller parcels of matter here upon the earth as that of fruits pebbles or flints c which seem to have been a liquor at first may not be caused by the heterogeneous ambient fluid for thus we see that melted glass will be naturally formed into a round figure so likewise any small parcel of any fusible body if it be perfectly enclosed by the air will be driven into a globular form and when cold will be found a solid ball this is plainly enough manifested to us by their way of making shot with the drops of lead which being a very pretty curiosity and known but to a very few and having the liberty of publishing it granted me by that eminent virtuoso sir robert moray who brought in this account of it to the royal society i have here transcribed and inserted  to make small shot of different sizes communicated by his highness pr  take lead out of the pig what quantity you please melt it down stir and clear it with an iron ladle gathering together the blackish parts that swim at top like scum and when you see the colour of the clear lead to be greenish but no sooner strew upon it auripigmentum powdered according to the quantity of lead about as much as will lye upon a half crown piece will serve for eighteen or twenty pound weight of some sorts of lead others will require more or less after the auripigmentum is put in stir the lead well and the auripigmentum will flame when the flame is over take out some of the lead in a ladle having a lip or notch in the brim for convenient pouring out of the lead and being well warmed amongst the melted lead and with a stick make some single drops of lead trickle out of the ladle into water in a glass which if they fall to be round and without tails there is auripigmentum enough put in and the temper of the heat is right otherwise put in more then lay two bars of iron or some more proper irontool made on purpose upon a pail of water and place upon them a round plate of copper of the size and figure of an ordinary large pewter or silver trencher the hollow whereof is to be about three inches over the bottom lower then the brims about half an inch pierced with thirty forty or more small holes the smaller the holes are the smaller the shot will be and the brim is to be thicker then the bottom to conserve the heat the better  the bottom of the trencher being some four inches distant from the water in the pail lay upon it some burning coles to keep the lead melted upon it then with the hot ladle take lead off the pot where it stands melted and pour it softly upon the burning coles over the bottom of the trencher and it will immediately run through the holes into the water in small round drops thus pour on new lead still as fast as it runs through the trencher till all be done blowing now and then the coles with handbellows when the lead in the trencher cools so as to stop from running  while one pours on the lead another must with another ladle thrusted four or five inches under water in the pail catch from time to time some of the shot as it drops down to see the size of it and whether there be any faults in it the greatest care is to keep the lead upon the trencher in the right degree of heat if it be too cool it will not run through the trencher though it stand melted upon it and this is to be helped by blowing the coals a little or pouring on new lead that is hotter but the cooler the lead the larger the shot and the hotter the smaller when it it too hot the drops will crack and fly then you must stop pouring on new lead and let it cool and so long as you observe the right temper of the heat the lead will constantly drop into very round shot without so much as one with a tail in many pounds  when all is done take your shot out of the pail of water and put it in a fryingpan over the fire to dry them which must be done warily still shaking them that they melt not and when they are dry you may separate the small from the great in pearl sives made of copper or lattin let into one another into as many sizes at you please but if you would have your shot larger then the trencher makes them you may do it with a stick making them trickle out of the ladle as hath been said  if the trencher be but toucht a very little when the lead stops from going through it and be not too cool it will drop again but it it better not to touch it at all at the melting of the lead take care that there be no kind of oyl grease or the like upon the pots or ladles or trencher  the chief cause of this globular figure of the shot seems to be the auripigmentum for as soon as it is put in among the melted lead it loses its shining brightness contracting instantly a grayish film or skin upon it when you scum it to make it clean with the ladle so that when the air comes at the falling drop of the melted lead that skin constricts them every where equally but upon what account and whether this be the true cause is left to further disquisition  much after this same manner when the air is exceeding cold through which it passes do we find the drops of rain falling from the clouds congealed into round hailstones by the freezing ambient  to which may be added this other known experiment that if you gently let fall a drop of water upon small sand or dust you shall find as it were an artificial round stone quickly generated i cannot upon this occasion omit the mentioning of the strange kind of grain which i have observed in a stone brought from kettering in northamptonshire and therefore called by masons ketteringstone of which see the description which brings into my mind what i long since observed in the fiery sparks that are struck out of a steel for having a great desire to see what was left behind after the spark was gone out i purposely struck fire over a very white piece of paper and observing diligently where some conspicuous sparks went out i found a very little black spot no bigger then the point of a pin which through a microscope appeared to be a perfectly round ball looking much like a polisht ball of steel insomuch that i was able to see the image of the window reflected from it i cannot here stay having done it more fully in another place to examine the particular reasons of it but shall only hint that i imagine it to be some small parcel of the steel which by the violence of the motion of the stroke most of which seems to be imprest upon those small parcels is made so glowing hot that it is melted into a vitrum which by the ambient air is thrust into the form of a ball  a fifth thing which i thought worth examination was whether the motion of all kind of springs might not be reduced to the principle whereby the included heterogeneous fluid seems to be moved or to that whereby two solids as marbles or the like are thrust and kept together by the ambient fluid  a sixth thing was whether the rising and ebullition of the water out of springs and fountains which lie much higher from the center of the earth then the superficies of the sea from whence it seems to be derived may not be explicated by the rising of water in a smaller pipe for the seawater being strained through the pores or crannies of the earth is as it were included in little pipes where the pressure of the air has not so great a power to resist its rising but examining this way and finding in it several difficulties almost irremovable i thought upon a way that would much more naturally and conceivably explain it which was by this following experiment i took a glasstube of the form of that described in the sixth figure and chusing two heterogeneous fluids such as water and oyl i poured in as much water as filled up the pipes as high as ab then putting in some oyl into the tube ac i deprest the superficies a of the water to f and b i raised to g which was not so high perpendicularly as the superficies of the oyl f by the space fi wherefore the proportion of the gravity of these two liquors was as gh to fe  this experiment i tried with several other liquors and particularly with fresh water and salt which i made by dissolving salt in warm water which two though they are nothing heterogeneous yet before they would perfectly mix one with another i made trial of the experiment nay letting the tube wherein i tried the experiment remain for many dayes i observed them not to mix but the superficies of the fresh was rather more then less elevated above that of the salt now the proportion of the gravity of seawater to that of riverwater according to stevinus and varenius and as i have since found pretty true by making trial my self is as 46 to 45 that is 46 ounces of the salt water will take up no more room then 45 of the fresh or reciprocally 45 pints of saltwater weigh as much as 46 of fresh  but i found the proportion of brine to fresh water to be near 13 to 12 supposing therefore ghm to represent the sea and fi the height of the mountain above the superficies of the sea fm a cavern in the earth beginning at the bottom of the sea and terminated at the top of the mountain lm the sand at the bottom through which the water is as it were strained so as that the fresher parts are only permitted to transude and the saline kept back if therefore the proportion of g m to fm be as 45 to 46 then may the cylinder of saltwater gm make the cylinder of freshwater to rise as high as e and to run over at n i cannot here stand to examine or confute their opinion who make the depth of the sea below its superficies to be no more perpendicularly measured then the height of the mountains above it tis enough for me to say there is no one of those that have asserted it have experimentally known the perpendicular of either nor shall i here determine whether there may not be many other causes of the separation of the fresh water from the salt as perhaps some parts of the earth through which it is to pass may contain a salt that mixing and uniting with the seasalt may precipitate it much after the same manner as the alkalizate and acid salts mix and precipitate each other in the preparation of tartarum vitriolatum i know not also whether the exceeding cold that must necessarily be at the bottom of the water may not help towards this separation for we find that warm water is able to dissolve and contain more salt then the same cold insomuch that brines strongly impregnated by heat if let cool do suffer much of their salt to subside and crystallize about the bottom and sides i know not also whether the exceeding pressure of the parts of the water one against another may not keep the salt from descending to the very bottom as finding little or no room to insert it self between those parts protruded so violently together or else squeeze it upwads into the superiour parts of the sea where it may more easily obtain room for it self amongst the parts of the water by reason that there is more heat and less pressure to this opinion i was somewhat the more induced by the relations i have met with in geographical writers of drawing fresh water from the bottom of the sea which is salt above i cannot now stand to examine whether this natural perpetual motion may not artificially be imitated nor can i stand to answer the objections which may be made against this my supposition as first how it comes to pass that there are sometimes salt springs much higher then the superficies of the water and secondly why springs do not run faster and slower according to the varying height made of the cylinder of seawater by the ebbing and flowing of the sea  as to the first in short i say the fresh water may receive again a saline tincture near the superficies of the earth by passing through some salt mines or else many of the saline parts of the sea may be kept back though not all  and as to the second the same spring may be fed and supplyed by divers caverns coming from very far distant parts of the sea so as that it may in one place be high in another low water and so by that means the spring may be equally supplyd at all times or else the cavern may be so straight and narrow that the water not having so ready and free passage through it cannot upon so short and quick mutations of pressure be able to produce any sensible effect at such a distance besides that to confirm this hypothesis there are many examples found in natural historians of springs that do ebb and flow like the sea as particularly those recorded by the learned camden and after him by speed to be found in this island one of which they relate to be on the top of a mountain by the small village kilken in flintshire maris √¶mulus qui statis temporibus suos evomit  resorbet aquas which at certain times riseth and falleth after the manner of the sea a second in caermardenshire near caermarden at a place called cantred bichan qui ut scribit giraldus naturali die bis undis deficiens  toties exuberans marinas imitatur instabilitates that twice in four and twenty hours ebbing and flowing resembleth the unstable motions of the sea the ph√¶nomena of which two may be easily made out by supposing the cavern by which they are fed to arise from the bottom of the next sea a third is a well upon the river ogmore in glamorganshire and near unto newton of which camden relates himself to be certified by a letter from a learned friend of his that observed it fons abest hinc c the letter is a little too long to be inserted but the substance is this that this well ebbs and flows quite contrary to the flowing and ebbing of the sea in those parts for tis almost empty at full sea but full at low water this may happen from the channel by which it is supplied which may come from the bottom of a sea very remote from those parts and where the tides are much differing from those of the approximate shores a fourth lies in westmorland near the river leder qui instar euripi s√¶pius in die reciprocantibus undis fluit  refluit which ebbs and flows many times a day this may proceed from its being supplyed from many channels coming from several parts of the sea lying sufficiently distant asunder to have the times of highwater differing enough one from the other so as that whensoever it shall be high water over any of those places where these channels begin it shall likewise be so in the well but this is but a supposition  a seventh query was whether the dissolution or mixing of several bodies whether fluid or solid with saline or other liquors might not partly be attributed to this principle of the congruity of those bodies and their dissolvents as of salt in water metals in several menstruums unctuous gums in oyls the mixing of wine and water c and whether precipitation be not partly made from the same principle of incongruity i say partly because there are in some dissolutions some other causes concurrent  i shall lastly make a much more seemingly strange and unlikely query and that is whether this principle well examined and explained may not be found a coefficient in the most considerable operations of nature as in those of heat and light consequently of rarefaction and condensation hardness and fluidness perspicuity and opacousness refractions and colours c nay i know not whether there may be many things done in nature in which this may not be said to have a finger this i have in some other passages of this treatise further enquired into and shewn that as well light as heat may be caused by corrosion which is applicable to congruity and consequently all the rest will be but subsequents in the mean time i would not willingly be guilty of that error which the thrice noble and learned verulam justly takes notice of as such and calls philosophi√¶ genus empiricum quod in paucorum experimentorum angustiis  obscuritate fundatum est for i neither conclude from one single experiment nor are the experiments i make use of all made upon one subject nor wrest i any experiment to make it quadrare with any preconceivd notion but on the contrary i endeavour to be conversant in divers kinds of experiments and all and every one of those trials i make the standards or touchstones by which i try all my former notions whether they hold out in weight and measure and touch c for as that body is no other then a counterfeit gold which wants any one of the proprieties of gold such as are the malleableness weight colour fixtness in the fire indissolubleness in aqua fortis and the like though it has all the other so will all those notions be found to be false and deceitful that will not undergo all the trials and tests made of them by experiments and therefore such as will not come up to the desired apex of perfection i rather wholly reject and take new then by piecing and patching endeavour to retain the old as knowing such things at best to be but lame and imperfect and this course i learned from nature whom we find neglectful of the old body and suffering its decaies and infirmities to remain without repair and altogether sollicitous and careful of perpetuating the species by new individuals and it is certainly the most likely way to erect a glorious structure and temple to nature such as she will be found by any zealous votary to reside in to begin to build a new upon a sure foundation of experiments  but to digress no further from the consideration of the ph√¶nomena more immediately explicable by this experiment we shall proceed to shew that as to the rising of water in a filtre the reason of it will be manifest to him that does take notice that a filtre is constituted of a great number of small long solid bodies which lie so close together that the air in its getting in between them doth lose of its pressure that it has against the fluid without them by which means the water or liquor not finding so strong a resistance between them as is able to counterballance the pressure on its superficies without is raised upward till it meet with a pressure of the air which is able to hinder it and as to the rising of oyl melted tallow spirit of wine c in the week of a candle or lamp it is evident that it differs in nothing from the former save only in this that in a filtre the liquor descends and runs away by another part and in the week the liquor is dispersed and carried away by the flame something there is ascribable to the heat for that it may rarifie the more volatil and spirituous parts of those combustible liquors and so being made lighter then the air it maybe protruded upwards by that more ponderous fluid body in the form of vapours but this can be ascribed to the ascension of but a very little and most likely of that only which ascends without the week as for the rising of it in a spunge bread cotton c above the superficies of the subjacent liquor what has been said about the filtre if considered will easily suggest a reason considering that all these bodies abound with small holes or pores  from this same principle also viz the unequal pressure of the air against the unequal superficies of the water proceeds the cause of the accession or incursion of any floating body against the sides of the containing vessel or the appropinquation of two floating bodies as bubbles corks sticks straws c one towards another as for instance take a glassjar such as ab in the seventh figure and filling it pretty near the top with water throw into it a small round piece of cork as c and plunge it all over in water that it be wet so as that the water may rise up by the sides of it then placing it any where upon the superficies about an inch or one inch and a quarter from any side and you shall perceive it by degrees to make perpendicularly toward the nearest part of the side and the nearer it approaches the faster to be moved the reason of which ph√¶nomenon will be found no other then this that the air has a greater pressure against the middle of the superficies then it has against those parts that approach nearer and are contiguous to the sides now that the pressure is greater may as i shewed before in the explication of the third figure be evinced from the flatting of the water in the middle which arises from the gravity of the under fluid for since as i shewed before if there were no gravity in the under fluid or that it were equal to that of the upper the terminating surface would be spherical and since it is the additional pressure of the gravity of water that makes it so flat it follows that the pressure upon the middle must be greater then towards the sides hence the ball having a stronger pressure against that side of it which respects the middle of the superficies then against that which respects the approximate side must necessarily move towards that part from whence it finds least resistance and so be accelerated as the resistance decrease hence the more the water is raised under that part of its way it is passing above the middle the faster it is moved and therefore you will find it to move faster in e then in d and in d then in c neither could i find the floating substance to be moved at all until it were placed upon some part of the superficies that was sensibly elevated above the height of the middle part now that this may be the true cause you may try with a blown bladder and an exactly round ball upon a very smooth side of some pliable body as horn or quicksilver for if the ball be placed under a part of the bladder which is upon one side of the middle of its pressure and you press strongly against the bladder you shall find the ball moved from the middle towards the sides  having therefore shewn the reason of the motion of any float towards the sides the reason of the incursion of any two floating bodies will easily appear for the rising of the water against the sides of either of them is an argument sufficient to shew the pressure of the air to be there less then it is further from it where it is not so much elevated and therefore the reason of the motion of the other toward it will be the same as towards the side of the glass only here from the same reason they are mutually moved toward each other whereas the side of the glass in the former remains fixt if also you gently fill the jar so full with water that the water is protuberant above the sides the same piece of cork that before did hasten towards the sides does now fly from it as fast towards the middle of the superficies the reason of which will be found no other then this that the pressure of the air is stronger against the sides of the superficies g and h then against the middle i for since as i shewed before the principle of congruity would make the terminating surface spherical and that the flatting of the surface in the middle is from the abatement of the waters pressure outwards by the contrary indeavour of its gravity it follows that the pressure in the middle must be less then on the sides and therefore the consecution will be the same as in the former it is very odd to one that considers not the reason of it to see two floating bodies of wood to approach each other as though they were indued with some magnetical vigour which brings into my mind what i formerly tried with a piece of cork or such like body which i so ordered that by putting a little stick into the same water one part of the said cork would approach and make toward the stick whereas another would discede and fly away nay it would have a kind of verticity so as that if the √Üquator as i may so speak of the cork were placed towards the stick if let alone it would instantly turn its appropriate pole toward it and then run atilt at it and this was done only by taking a dry cork and wetting one side of it with one small stroak for by this means gently putting it upon the water it would depress the superficies on every side of it that was dry and therefore the greatest pressure of the air being near those sides caused it either to chase away or else to fly off from any other floating body whereas that side only against which the water ascended was thereby able to attract  it remains only that i should determine how high the water or other liquor may by this means be raised in a smaller pipe above the superficies of that without it and at what height it may be sustained but to determine this will be exceeding difficult unless i could certainly know how much of the airs pressure is taken off by the smalness of such and such a pipe and whether it may be wholly taken off that is whether there can be a hole or pore so small into which air could not at all enter though water might with its whole force for were there such tis manifest that the water might rise in it to some five or six and thirty english foot high i know not whether the capillary pipes in the bodies of small trees which we call their microscopical pores may not be such and whether the congruity of the sides of the pore may not yet draw the juyce even higher then the air was able by its bare pressure to raise it for congruity is a principle that not only unites and holds a body joyned to it but which is more attracts and draws a body that is very near it and holds it above its usual height  and this is obvious even in a drop of water suspended under any similar or congruous body for besides the ambient pressure that helps to keep it susteind there is the congruity of the bodies that are contiguous this is yet more evident in tenacious and glutinous bodies such as gummous liquors syrups pitch and rosin melted c tar turpentine balsom birdlime c for there it is evident that the parts of the tenacious body as i may so call it do stick and adhere so closely together that though drawn out into long and very slender cylinders yet they will not easily relinquish one another and this though the bodies be aliquatenus fluid and in motion by one another which to such as consider a fluid body only as its parts are in a confused irregular motion without taking in also the congruity of the parts one among another and incongruity to some other bodies does appear not a little strange so that besides the incongruity of the ambient fluid to it we are to consider also the congruity of the parts of the conteind fluid one with another  and this congruity that i may here a little further explain it is both a tenaceous and an attractive power for the congruity in the vibrative motions may be the cause of all kind of attraction not only electrical but magnetical also and therefore it may be also of tenacity and glutinousness for from a perfect congruity of the motions of two distant bodies the intermediate fluid particles are separated and droven away from between them and thereby those congruous bodies are by the incompassing mediums compelld and forced neerer together wherefore that attractiveness must needs be stronger when by an immediate contact they are forcd to be exactly the same as i shew more at large in my theory of the magnet and this hints to me the reason of the suspension of the mercury many inches nay many feet above the usual station of 30 inches for the parts of quicksilver being so very similar and congruous to each other if once united will not easily suffer a divulsion and the parts of water that were any wayes heterogeneous being by exantlation or rarefaction exhausted the remaining parts being also very similar will not easily part neither and the parts of the glass being solid are more difficultly disjoynd and the water being somewhat similar to both is as it were a medium to unite both the glass and the mercury together so that all three being united and not very dissimilar by means of this contact if care be taken that the tube in erecting be not shogged the quicksilver will remain suspended notwithstanding its contrary indeavour of gravity a great height above its ordinary station but if this immediate contact be removed either by a meer separation of them one from another by the force of a shog whereby the other becomes imbodied between them and licks up from the surface some agil parts and so hurling them makes them air or else by some small heterogeneous agil part of the water or air or quicksilver which appears like a bubble and by its jumbling to and fro there is made way for the heterogeneous √Üther to obtrude it self between the glass and either of the other fluids the gravity of mercury precipitates it downward with very great violence and if the vessel that holds the restagnating mercury be convenient the mercury will for a time vibrate to and fro with very large reciprocations and at last will remain kept up by the pressure of the external air at the height of neer thirty inches and whereas it may be objected that it cannot be that the meer imbodying of the √Üther between these bodies can be the cause since the √Üther having a free passage alwayes both through the pores of the glass and through those of the fluids there is no reason why it should not make a separation at all times whilst it remains suspended as when it is violently disjoyned by a shog to this i answer that though the √Üther passes between the particles that is through the pores of bodies so as that any chasme or separation being made it has infinite passages to admit its entry into it yet such is the tenacity or attractive virtue of congruity that till it be overcome by the meer strength of gravity or by a shog assisting that conatus of gravity or by an agil particle that is like a leaver agitated by the √Üther and thereby the parts of the congruous substances are separated so far asunder that the strength of congruity is so far weakened as not to be able to reunite them the parts to be taken hold of being removed out of the attractive sphere as i may so speak of the congruity such i say is the tenacity of congruity that it retains and holds the almost contiguous particles of the fluid and suffers them not to be separated till by meer force that attractive or retentive faculty be overcome but the separation being once made beyond the sphere of the attractive activity of congruity that virtue becomes of no effect at all but the mercury freely falls downwards till it meet with a resistance from the pressure of the ambient air able to resist its gravity and keep it forced up in the pipe to the height of about thirty inches  thus have i gently raised a steel pendulum by a loadstone to a great angle till by the shaking of my hand i have chanced to make a separation between them which is no sooner made but as if the loadstone had retained no attractive virtue the pendulum moves freely from it towards the other side so vast a difference is there between the attractive virtue of the magnet when it acts upon a contiguous and upon a disjoyned body and much more must there be between the attractive virtues of congruity upon a contiguous and disjoyned body and in truth the attractive virtue is so little upon a body disjoyned that though i have with a microscope observed very diligently whether there were any extraordinary protuberance on the side of a drop of water that was exceeding neer to the end of a green stick but did not touch it i could not perceive the least though i found that as soon as ever it toucht it the whole drop would presently unite it self with it so that it seems an absolute contact is requisite to the exercising of the tenacious faculty of congruity                                        observ vii of some ph√¶nomena of glass drops  these glass drops are small parcels of coarse green glass taken out of the pots that contain the metal as they call it in fusion upon the end of an iron pipe and being exceeding hot and thereby of a kind of sluggish fluid confidence are suffered to drop from thence into a bucket of cold water and in it to lye till they be grown sensibly cold  some of these i broke in the open air by snapping off a little of the small stem with my fingers others by crushing it with a small pair of plyers which i had no sooner done then the whole bulk of the drop flew violently with a very brisk noise into multitudes of small pieces some of which were as small as dust though in some there were remaining pieces pretty large without any flaw at all and others very much flawd which by rubbing between ones fingers was easily reduced to dust these dispersed every way so violently that some of them pierced my skin i could not find either with my naked eye or a microscope that any of the broken pieces were of a regular figure nor any one like another but for the most part those that flawd off in large pieces were prettily branched  the ends of others of these drops i nipt off whilst all the bodies and ends of them lay buried under the water which like the former flew all to pieces with as brisk a noise and as strong a motion  others of these i tried to break by grinding away the blunt end and though i took a seemingly good one and had ground away neer two thirds of the ball yet would it not fly to pieces but now and then some small rings of it would snap and fly off not without a brisk noise and quick motion leaving the surface of the drop whence it flew very prettily branched or creased which was easily discoverable by the microscope this drop after i had thus ground it without at all impairing the remnant that was not ground away i caused to fly immediately all into sand upon the nipping off the very tip of its slender end  another of these drops i began to grind away at the smaller end but had not worn away on the stone above a quarter of an inch before the whole drop flew with a brisk crack into sand or small dust nor would it have held so long had there not been a little flaw in the piece that i ground away as i afterwards found  several others of these drops i covered over with a thin but very tuff skin of icthyocolla which being very tough and very transparent was the most convenient substance for these tryals that i could imagine having dipt i say several of these drops in this transparent glue whilst hot and suffering them to hang by a string tied about the end of them till they were cold and the skin pretty tough then wrapping all the body of the drop leaving out only the very tip in fine supple kidsleather very closely i nipped off the small top and found as i expected that notwithstanding this skin of glue and the close wrapping up in leather upon the breaking of the top the drop gave a crack like the rest and gave my hand a pretty brisk impulse but yet the skin and leather was so strong as to keep the parts from flying out of their former posture and the skin being transparent i found that the drop retained exactly its former figure and polish but was grown perfectly opacous and all over flawd all those flaws lying in the manner of rings from the bottom or blunt end to the very top or small point and by several examinations with a microscope of several thus broken i found the flaws both within the body of the drop and on the outward surface to lye much in this order  let ab in the figure x of the fourth scheme represent the drop cased over with icthyocolla or isinglass by being ordered as is before prescribed crazed or flawed into pieces but by the skin or case kept in its former figure and each of its flawed parts preserved exactly in its due posture the outward appearance of it somewhat plainly to the naked eye but much more conspicuous if viewed with a small lens appeared much after this shape that is the blunt end b for a pretty breadth namely as far as the ring ccc seemed irregularly flawed with divers clefts which all seemed to tend towards the center of it being as i afterwards found and shall anon shew in the description of the figure y the basis as it were of a cone which was terminated a little above the middle of the drop all the rest of the surface from ccc to a was flawed with an infinite number of small and parallel rings which as they were for the most part very round so were they very thick and close together but were not so exactly flawd as to make a perfect ring but each circular part was by irregular cracks flawed likewise into multitudes of irregular flakes or tiles and this order was observed likewise the whole length of the neck  now though i could not so exactly cut this conical body through the axis as is represented by the figure y yet by anatomizing as it were of several and taking notice of divers particular circumstances i was informed that could i have artificially divided a flawd drop through the axis or center i should with a microscope have found it to appear much of this form where a signifies the apex and b the blunt end cc the cone of the basis which is terminated at t the top or end of it which seems to be the very middle of the blunt end in which not only the conical body of the basis cc is terminated but as many of the parts of the drop as reach as high as dd  and it seemed to be the head or beginning of a pith as it were or a part of the body which seemed more spungy then the rest and much more irregularly flawed which from t ascended by ee though less visible into the small neck towards a the grain as it were of all the flaws that proceeds from all the outward surface adccda was much the same as is represented by the black strokes that meet in the middle dt dt de de c  nor is this kind of grain as i may call it peculiar to glass drops thus quenched for not to mention coperasstones and divers other marchasites and minerals which i have often taken notice of to be in the very same manner flaked or grained with a kind of pith in the middle i have observed the same in all manner of cast iron especially the coarser sort such as stoves and furnaces and backs and pots are made of for upon the breaking of any of those substances it is obvious to observe how from the outsides towards the middle there is a kind of radiation or grain much resembling this of the glassdrop but this grain is most conspicuous in ironbullets if they be broken the same ph√¶nomena may be produced by casting regulus of antimony into a bulletmold as also with glass of antimony or with almost any such kind of vitrified substance either cast into a cold mold or poured into water  others of these drops i heat red hot in the fire and then suffered them to cool by degrees and these i found to have quite lost all their fulminating or flying quality as also their hard brittle and springy texture and to emerge of a much softer temper and much easier to be broken or snapt with ones finger but its strong and brittle quality was quite destroyed and it seemed much of the same consistence with other green glass well nealed in the oven  the figure and bigness of these for the most part was the same with that of the figure z that is all the surface of them was very smooth and polisht and for the most part round but very rugged or knobbed about d and all the length of the stem was here and there pitted or flatted about d which is at the upper part of the drop under that side of the stem which is concave there usually was made some one or more little hillocks or prominences the drop it self before it be broken appears very transparent and towards the middle of it to be very full of small bubbles of some kind of aerial substance which by the refraction of the outward surface appear much bigger then really they are and this may be in good part removed by putting the drop under the surface of clear water for by that means most part of the refraction of the convex surface of the drop is destroyed and the bubbles will appear much smaller and this by the by minds me of the appearing magnitude of the aperture of the iris or pupil of the eye which though it appear and be therefore judged very large is yet not above a quarter of the bigness it appears of by the lenticular refraction of the cornea  the cause of all which ph√¶nomena i imagine to be no other then this that the parts of the glass being by the excessive heat of the fire kept off and separated one from another and thereby put into a kind of sluggish fluid consistence are suffered to drop off with that heat or agitation remaining in them into cold water by which means the outsides of the drop are presently coold and crusted and are thereby made of a loose texture because the parts of it have not time to settle themselves leisurely together and so to lie very close together and the innermost parts of the drop retaining still much of their former heat and agitations remain of a loose texture also and according as the cold strikes inwards from the bottom and sides are quenched as it were and made rigid in that very posture wherein the cold finds them for the parts of the crust being already hardened will not suffer the parts to shrink any more from the outward surface inward and though it shrink a little by reason of the small parcels of some aerial substances dispersed through the matter of the glass yet that is not neer so much as it appears as i just now hinted nor if it were would it be sufficient for to consolidate and condense the body of glass into a tuff and close texture after it had been so excessively rarified by the heat of the glassfurnace  but that there may be such an expansion of the aerial substance contained in those little blebbs or bubbles in the body of the drop this following experiment will make more evident                                       take a small glasscane about a foot long seal up one end of it hermetically then put in a very small bubble of glass almost of the shape of an essenceviol with the open mouth towards the sealed end then draw out the other end of the pipe very small and fill the whole cylinder with water then set this tube by the fire till the water begin to boyl and the air in the bubble be in good part rarified and driven out then by sucking at the smalling pipe more of the air or vapours in the bubble may be suckd out so that it may sink to the bottom when it is sunk to the bottom in the flame of a candle or lamp nip up the slender pipe and let it cool whereupon it is obvious to observe first that the water by degrees will subside and shrink into much less room next that the air or vapours in the glass will expand themselves so as to buoy up the little glass thirdly that all about the inside of the glasspipe there will appear an infinite number of small bubbles which as the water grows colder and colder will swell bigger and bigger and many of them buoy themselves up and break at the top  from this disceding of the heat in glass drops that is by the quenching or cooling irradiations propagated from the surface upwards and inwards by the lines ct ct dt de c the bubbles in the drop have room to expand themselves a little and the parts of the glass contract themselves but this operation being too quick for the sluggish parts of the glass the contraction is performed very unequally and irregularly and thereby the particles of the glass are bent some one way and some another yet so as that most of them draw towards the pith or middle teee or rather from that outward so that they cannot extricate or unbend themselves till some part of teee be broken and loosened for all the parts about that are placed in the manner of an arch and so till their hold at teee be loosened they cannot fly asunder but uphold and shelter and fix each other much like the stones in a vault where each stone does concurre to the stability of the whole fabrick and no one stone can be taken away but the whole arch falls and wheresoever any of those radiating wedges dtd c are removed which are the component parts of this arch the whole fabrick presently falls to pieces for all the springs of the several parts are set at liberty which immediately extricate themselves and fly asunder every way each part by its spring contributing to the darting of it self and some other contiguous part but if this drop be heat so hot as that the parts by degrees can unbend themselves and be settled and annealed in that posture and be then suffered gently to subside and cool the parts by this nealing losing their springiness constitute a drop of a more soft but less brittle texture and the parts being not at all under a flexure though any part of the middle or pith teee be broken yet will not the drop at all fly to pieces as before  this conjecture of mine i shall indeavour to make out by explaining each particular assertion with analogous experiments the assertions are there      first that the parts of the glass whilst in a fluid consistence and     hot are more rarified or take up more room then when hard and cold      secondly that the parts of the drop do suffer a twofold contraction      thirdly that the dropping or quenching the glowing metal in the water     makes it of a hard springing and rarified texture      fourthly that there is a flexion or force remaining upon the parts of     the glass thus quenched from which they indeavour to extricate     themselves      fifthly that the fabrick of the drop that is able to hinder the parts     from extricating themselves is analogus to that of an arch      sixthly that the sudden flying asunder of the parts proceeds from     their springiness      seventhly that a gradual heating and cooling does anneal or reduce the     parts of glass to a texture that is more loose and easilier to be     broken but not so brittle  that the first of these is true may be gathered from this that heat is a property of a body arising from the motion or agitation of its parts and therefore whatever body is thereby toucht must necessarily receive some part of that motion whereby its parts will be shaken and agitated and so by degrees free and extricate themselves from one another and each part so moved does by that motion exert a conatus of protruding and displacing all the adjacent particles thus air included in a vessel by being heated will burst it to pieces thus have i broke a bladder held over the fire in my hand with such a violence and noise that it almost made me deaf for the present and much surpassed the noise of a musket the like have i done by throwing into the fire small glass bubbles hermetically sealed with a little drop of water included in them thus water also or any other liquor included in a convenient vessel by being warmed manifestly expands it self with a very great violence so as to break the strongest vessel if when heated it be narrowly imprisoned in it this is very manifest by the sealed thermometers which i have by several tryals at last brought to a great certainty and tenderness for i have made some with stems above four foot long in which the expanding liquor would so far vary as to be very neer the very top in the heat of summer and prety neer the bottom at the coldest time of the winter the stems i use for them are very thick straight and even pipes of glass with a very small perforation and both the head and body i have made on purpose at the glasshouse of the same metal whereof the pipes are drawn these i can easily in the flame of a lamp urged with the blast of a pair of bellows seal and close together so as to remain very firm close and even by this means i joyn on the body first and then fill both it and a part of the stem proportionate to the length of the stem and the warmth of the season i fill it in with the best rectified spirit of wine highly tingd with the lovely colour of cocheneel which i deepen the more by pouring some drops of common spirit of urine which must not be too well rectified because it will be apt to make the liquor to curdle and stick in the small perforation of the stem this liquor i have upon tryal found the most tender of any spirituous liquor and those are much more sensibly affected with the variations of heat and cold then other more flegmatick and ponderous liquors and as capable of receiving a deep tincture and keeping it as any liquor whatsoever and which makes it yet more acceptable is not subject to be frozen by any cold yet known when i have thus filled it i can very easily in the forementioned flame of a lamp seal and joyn on the head of it  then for graduating the stem i fix that for the beginning of my division where the surface of the liquor in the stem remains when the ball is placed in common distilled water that is so cold that it just begins to freeze and shoot into flakes and that mark i fix at a convenient place of the stem to make it capable of exhibiting very many degrees of cold below that which is requisite to freeze water the rest of my divisions both above and below this which i mark with a 0 or nought i place according to the degrees of expansion or contraction of the liquor in proportion to the bulk it had when it indurd the newly mentiond freezing cold and this may be very easily and accurately enough done by this following way prepare a cylindrical vessel of very thin plate brass or silver abcd of the figure z the diameter ab of whose cavity let be about two inches and the depth bc the same let each end be coverd with a flat and smooth plate of the same substance closely soderd on and in the midst of the upper cover make a pretty large hole ef about the bigness of a fifth part of the diameter of the other into this fasten very well with cement a straight and even cylindrical pipe of glass efgh the diameter of whose cavity let be exactly one tenth of the diameter of the greater cylinder let this pipe be markd at gh with a diamant so that g from e may be distant just two inches or the same height with that of the cavity of the greater cylinder then divide the length eg exactly into 10 parts so the capacity of the hollow of each of these divisions will be 11000 part of the capacity of the greater cylinder this vessel being thus prepared the way of marking and graduating the thermometers may be very easily thus performed  fill this cylindrical vessel with the same liquor wherewith the thermometers are filld then place both it and the thermometer you are to graduate in water that is ready to be frozen and bring the surface of the liquor in the thermometer to the first marke or 0 then so proportion the liquor in the cylindrical vessel that the surface of it may just be at the lower end of the small glasscylinder then very gently and gradually warm the water in which both the thermometer and this cylindrical vessel stand and as you perceive the tingd liquor to rise in both stems with the point of a diamond give several marks on the stem of the thermometer at those places which by comparing the expansion in both stems are found to correspond to the divisions of the cylindrical vessel and having by this means marked some few of these divisions on the stem it will be very easie by these to mark all the rest of the stem and accordingly to assign to every division a proper character  a thermometer thus marked and prepared will be the fittest instrument to make a standard of heat and cold that can be imagined for being sealed up it is not at all subject to variation or wasting nor is it liable to be changed by the varying pressure of the air which all other kind of thermometers that are open to the air are liable to but to proceed  this property of expansion with heat and contraction with cold is not peculiar to liquors only but to all kind of solid bodies also especially metals which will more manifestly appear by this experiment  take the barrel of a stopcock of brass and let the key which is well fitted to it be riveted into it so that it may slip and be easily turned round then heat this cock in the fire and you will find the key so swollen that you will not be able to turn it round in the barrel but if it be suffered to cool again as soon as it is cold it will be as movable and as easie to be turned as before  this quality is also very observable in lead tin silver antimony pitch rosin beeswax butter and the like all which if after they be melted you suffer gently to cool you shall find the parts of the upper surface to subside and fall inwards losing that plumpness and smoothness it had whilst in fusion the like i have also observed in the cooling of glass of antimony which does very neer approach the nature of glass  but because these are all examples taken from other materials then glass and argue only that possibly there may be the like property also in glass not that really there is we shall by three or four experiments indeavour to manifest that also  and the first is an observation that is very obvious even in these very drops to wit that they are all of them terminated with an unequal or irregular surface especially about the smaller part of the drop and the whole length of the stem as about d and from thence to a the whole surface which would have been round if the drop had coold leisurely is by being quenched hastily very irregularly flatted and pitted which i suppose proceeds partly from the waters unequally cooling and pressing the parts of the drop and partly from the selfcontracting or subsiding quality of the substance of the glass for the vehemency of the heat of the drop causes such hidden motions and bubbles in the cold water that some parts of the water bear more forcibly against one part then against another and consequently do more suddenly cool those parts to which they are contiguous  a second argument may be drawn from the experiment of cutting glasses with a hot iron for in that experiment the top of the iron heats and thereby rarifies the parts of the glass that lie just before the crack whence each of those agitated parts indeavouring to expand its self and get elbowroom thrusts off all the rest of the contiguous parts and consequently promotes the crack that was before begun  a third argument may be drawn from the way of producing a crack in a sound piece or plate of glass which is done two wayes either first by suddenly heating a piece of glass in one place more then in another and by this means chymists usually cut off the necks of glassbodies by two kinds of instruments either by a glowing hot round ironring which just incompasses the place that is to be cut or else by a sulphurd threed which is often wound about the place where the separation is to be made and then fired or secondly a glass may be cracked by cooling it suddenly in any place with water or the like after it has been all leisurely and gradually heated very hot both which ph√¶nomena seem manifestly to proceed from the expansion and contraction of the parts of the glass which is also made more probable by this circumstance which i have observed that a piece of common windowglass being heated in the middle very suddenly with a live coal or hot iron does usually at the first crack fall into pieces whereas if the plate has been gradually heated very hot and a drop of cold water and the like be put on the middle of it it only flaws it but does not break it asunder immediately  a fourth argument may be drawn from this experiment take a glasspipe and fit into a solid stick of glass so as it will but just be moved in it then by degrees heat them whilst they are one within another and they will grow stiffer but when they are again cold they will be as easie to be turned as before this expansion of glass is more manifest in this experiment  take a stick of glass of a considerable length and fit it so between the two ends or screws of a lath that it may but just easily turn and that the very ends of it may be just toucht and susteined thereby then applying the flame of the candle to the middle of it and heating it hot you will presently find the glass to stick very fast on those points and not without much difficulty to be convertible on them before that by removing the flame for a while from it it be suffered to cool and when you will find it as easie to be turned round as at the first  from all which experiments it is very evident that all those bodies and particularly glass suffers an expansion by heat and that a very considerable one whilst they are in a state of fusion for fluidity as i elsewhere mention being nothing but an effect of very strong and quick shaking motion whereby the parts are as it were loosened from each other and consequently leave an interjacent space or vacuity it follows that all those shaken particles must necessarily take up much more room then when they were at rest and lay quietly upon each other and this is further confirmed by a pot of boyling alabaster which will manifestly rise a sixth or eighth part higher in the pot whilst it is boyling then it will remain at both before and after it be boyled the reason of which odd ph√¶nomenon to hint it here only by the way is this that there is in the curious powder of alabaster and other calcining stones a certain watery substance which is so fixt and included with the solid particles that till the heat be very considerable they will not fly away but after the heat is increased to such a degree they break out every way in vapours and thereby so shake and loosen the small corpusles of the powder from each other that they become perfectly of the nature of a fluid body and one may move a stick to and fro through it and stir it as easily as water and the vapours burst and break out in bubbles just as in boyling water and the like whereas both before those watery parts are flying away and after they are quite gone that is before and after it have done boyling all those effects cease and a stick is as difficultly moved to and fro in it as in sand or the like which explication i could easily prove had i time but this is not a fit place for it  to proceed therefore i say that the dropping of this expanded body into cold water does make the parts of the glass suffer a double contraction the first is of those parts which are neer the surface of the drop for cold as i said before contracting bodies that is by the abatement of the agitating faculty the parts falling neerer together the parts next adjoyning to the water must needs lose much of their motion and impart it to the ambientwater which the ebullition and commotion of it manifests and thereby become a solid and hard crust whilst the innermost parts remain yet fluid and expanded whence as they grow cold also by degrees their parts must necessarily be left at liberty to be condensed but because of the hardness of the outward crust the contraction cannot be admitted that way but there being many very small and before inconspicuous bubbles in the substance of the glass upon the subsiding of the parts of the glass the agil substance contained in them has liberty of expanding it self a little and thereby those bubbles grow much bigger which is the second contraction and both these are confirmed from the appearance of the drop it self for as for the outward parts we see first that it is irregular and shrunk as it were which is caused by the yielding a little of the hardened skin to a contraction after the very outmost surface is settled and as for the internal parts one may with ones naked eye perceive abundance of very conspicuous bubbles and with the microscope many more  the consideration of which particulars will easily make the third position probable that is that the parts of the drop will be of a very hard though of a rarified texture for if the outward parts of the drop by reason of its hard crust will indure very little contraction and the agil particles included in those bubbles by the losing of their agitation by the decrease of the heat lose also most part of their spring and expansive power it follows the withdrawing of the heat being very sudden that the parts must be left in a very loose texture and by reason of the implication of the parts one about another which from their sluggishnes and glutinousness i suppose to be much after the manner of the sticks in a thornbush or a lock of wool it will follow i say that the parts will hold each other very strongly together and indeavour to draw each other neerer together and consequently their texture must be very hard and stiff but very much rarified  and this will make probable my next position that the parts of the glass are under a kind of tension or flexure out of which they indeavour to extricate and free themselves and thereby all the parts draw towards the center or middle and would if the outward parts would give way as they do when the outward parts cool leisurely as in baking of glasses contract the bulk of the drop into a much less compass for since as i proved before the internal parts of the drop when fluid were of a very rarified texture and as it were tosd open like a lock of wool and if they were suffered leisurely to cool would be again prest as it were close together and since that the heat which kept them bended and open is removed and yet the parts not suffered to get as neer together as they naturally would it follows that the particles remain under a kind of tension and flexure and consequently have an indeavour to free themselves from that bending and distension which they do as soon as either the tip be broken or as soon as by a leisurely heating and cooling the parts are nealed into another posture  and this will make my next position probable that the parts of the glass drops are contignated together in the form of an arch cannot any where yield or be drawn inwards till by the removing of some one part of it as it happens in the removing one of the stones of an arch the whole fabrick is shatterd and falls to pieces and each of the springs is left at liberty suddenly to extricate it self for since i have made it probable that the internal parts of the glass have a contractive power inwards and the external parts are incapable of such a contraction and the figure of it being spherical it follows that the superficial parts must bear against each other and keep one another from being condensd into a less room in the same manner as the stones of an arch conduce to the upholding each other in that figure and this is made more probable by another experiment which was communicated to me by an excellent person whose extraordinary abilities in all kind of knowledg especially in that of natural things and his generous disposition in communicating incouraged me to have recourse to him on many occasions the experiment was this small glassballs about the bigness of that represented in the figure  would upon rubbing or scratching the inward surface fly all insunder with a pretty brisk noise whereas neither before nor after the inner surface had been thus scratcht did there appear any flaw or crack and putting the pieces of one of those broken ones together again the flaws appeared much after the manner of the black lines on the figure  these balls were small but exceeding thick bubbles of glass which being crackd off from the puntilion whilst very hot and so suffered to cool without nealing them in the oven over the furnace do thereby being made of white glass which cools much quicker then green glass and is thereby made much brittler acquire a very porous and very brittle texture so that if with the point of a needle or bodkin the inside of any of them be rubbed prety hard and then laid on a table it will within a very little while break into many pieces with a brisk noise and throw the parts above a span asunder on the table now though the pieces are not so small as those of a fulminating drop yet they as plainly shew that the outward parts of the glass have a great conatus to fly asunder were they not held together by the tenacity of the parts of the inward surface for we see as soon as those parts are crazed by hard rubbing and thereby their tenacity spoiled the springiness of the more outward parts quickly makes a divulsion and the broken pieces will if the concave surface of them be further scratcht with a diamond fly again into smaller pieces  from which preceding considerations it will follow sixthly that the sudden flying asunder of the parts as soon as this arch is any where disordered or broken proceeds from the springing of the parts which indeavouring to extricate themselves as soon as they get the liberty they perform it with such a quickness that they throw one another away with very great violence for the particles that compose the crust have a conatus to lye further from one another and therefore as soon as the external parts are loosened they dart themselves outward with great violence just as so many springs would do if they were detained and fastened to the body as soon as they should be suddenly loosened and the internal parts drawing inward they contract so violently that they rebound back again and fly into multitude of small shivers or sands now though they appear not either to the naked eye or the microscope yet i am very apt to think there may be abundance of small flaws or cracks which by reason the strong reflecting air is not got between the contiguous parts appear not and that this may be so i argue from this that i have very often been able to make a crack or flaw in some convenient pieces of glass to appear and disappear at pleasure according as by pressing together or pulling asunder the contiguous parts i excluded or admitted the strong reflecting air between the parts and it is very probable that there may be some body that is either very rarified air or something analogous to it which fills the bubbles of these drops which i argue first from the roundness of them and next from the vivid reflection of light which they exhibite now though i doubt not but that the air in them is very much rarified yet that there is some in them to such as well consider this experiment of the disappearing of a crack upon the extruding of the air i suppose it will seem more then probable  the seventh and last therefore that i shall prove is that the gradual heating and cooling of these so extended bodies does reduce the parts of the glass to a looser and softer temper and this i found by heating them and keeping them for a prety while very red hot in a fire for thereby i found them to grow a little lighter and the small stems to be very easily broken and snapt any where without at all making the drop fly whereas before they were so exceeding hard that they could not be broken without much difficulty and upon their breaking the whole drop would fly in pieces with very great violence the reason of which last seems to be that the leisurely heating and cooling of the parts does not only wast some part of the glass it self but ranges all the parts into a better order and gives each particle an opportunity of relaxing its self and consequently neither will the parts hold so strongly together as before nor be so difficult to be broken the parts now more easily yielding nor will the other parts fly in pieces because the parts have no bended springs the relaxation also in the temper of hardned steel and hammered metals by nealing them in the fire seems to proceed from much the same cause for both by quenching suddenly such metals as have vitrifed parts interspersd as steel has and by hammering of other kinds that do not so much abound with them as silver brass c the parts are put into and detained in a bended posture which by the agitation of heat are shaken and loosened and suffered to unbend themselves                                        observ viii of the fiery sparks struck from a flint or steel  it is a very common experiment by striking with a flint against a steel to make certain fiery and shining sparks to fly out from between those two compressing bodies about eight years since upon casually reading the explication of this odd ph√¶nomenon by the most ingenious des cartes i had a great desire to be satisfied what that substance was that gave such a shining and bright light and to that end i spread a sheet of white paper and on it observing the place where several of these sparks seemed to vanish i found certain very small black but glittering spots of a movable substance each of which examining with my microscope i found to be a small round globule some of which as they looked prety small so did they from their surface yield a very bright and strong reflection on that side which was next the light and each lookd almost like a prety bright ironball whose surface was prety regular such as is represented by the figure a in this i could perceive the image of the window prety well or of a stick which i moved up and down between the light and it others i found which were as to the bulk of the ball prety regularly round but the surface of them as it was not very smooth but rough and more irregular so was the reflection from it more faint and confused such were the surfaces of b c d and e some of these i found cleft or cracked as c others quite broken in two and hollow as d which seemed to be half the hollow shell of a granado broken irregularly in pieces several others i found of other shapes but that which is represented by e i observed to be a very big spark of fire which went out upon one side of the flint that i struck fire withall to which it stuck by the root f at the end of which small stem was fastenedon a hemisphere or half a hollow ball with the mouth of it open from the stemwards so that it looked much like a funnel or an old fashioned bowl without a foot this night making many tryals and observations of this experiment i met among a multitude of the globular ones which i had observed a couple of instances which are very remarkable to the confirmation of my hypothesis  and the first was of a pretty big ball fastened on to the end of a small sliver of iron which compositum seemed to be nothing else but a long thin chip of iron one of whose ends was melted into a small round globul the other end remaining unmelted and irregular and perfectly iron  the second instance was not less remarkable then the first for i found when a spark went out nothing but a very small thin long sliver of iron or steel unmelted at either end so that it seems that some of these sparks are the slivers or chips of the iron vitrified others are only the slivers melted into balls without vitrification and the third kind are only small slivers of the iron made redhot with the violence of the stroke given on the steel by the flint  he that shall diligently examine the ph√¶nomena of this experiment will i doubt not find cause to believe that the reason i have heretofore given of it is the true and genuine cause of it namely that the spark appearing so bright in the falling is nothing else but a small piece of the steel or flint but most commonly of the steel which by the violence of the stroke is at the same time severd and heat redhot and that sometimes to such a degree as to make it melt together into a small globule of steel and sometimes also is that heat so very intense as further to melt it and vitrifie it but many times the heat is so gentle as to be able to make the sliver only red hot which notwithstanding falling upon the tinder that is only a very curious small coal made of the small threads of linnen burnt to coals and chard it easily sets it on fire nor will any part of this hypothesis seem strange to him that considers first that either hammering or filing or otherwise violently rubbing of steel will presently make it so hot as to be able to burn ones fingers next that the whole force of the stroke is exerted upon that small part where the flint and steel first touch for the bodies being each of them so very hard the puls cannot be far communicated that is the parts of each can yield but very little and therefore the violence of the concussion will be exerted on that piece of steel which is cut off by the flint thirdly that the filings or small parts of steel are very apt as it were to take fire and are presently red hot that is there seems to be a very combustible sulphureous body in iron or steel which the air very readily preys upon as soon as the body is a little violently heated  and this is obvious in the filings of steel or iron cast through the flame of a candle for even by that sudden transitus of the small chips of iron they are heat red hot and that combustible sulphureous body is presently preyd upon and devoured by the aereal incompassing menstruum whose office in this particular i have shewn in the explication of charcole  and in prosecution of this experiment having taken the filings of iron and steel and with the point of a knife cast them through the flame of a candle i observed where some conspicuous shining particles fell and looking on them with my microscope i found them to be nothing else but such round globules as i formerly found the sparks struck from the steel by a stroke to be only a little bigger and shaking together all the filings that had fallen upon the sheet of paper underneath and observing them with the microscope i found a great number of small globules such as the former though there were also many of the parts that had remained untoucht and rough filings or chips of iron so that it seems iron does contain a very combustible sulphureous body which is in all likelihood one of the causes of this ph√¶nomenon and which may be perhaps very much concerned in the business of its hardening and tempering of which somewhat it said in the description of muscovyglass  so that these things considered we need not trouble our selves to find out what kind of pores they are both in the flint and steel that contain the atoms of fire nor how those atoms come to be hindred from running all out when a dore or passage in their pores is made by the concussion nor need we trouble our selves to examine by what prometheus the element of fire comes to be fetcht down from above the regions of the air in what cells or boxes it is kept and what epimetheus lets it go nor to consider what it is that causes so great a conflux of the atomical particles of fire which are said to fly to a flaming body like vultures or eagles to a putrifying carcass and there to make a very great pudder since we have nothing more difficult in this hypothesis to conceive first as to the kindling of tinder then how a large ironbullet let fall red or glowing hot upon a heap of smallcoal should set fire to those that are next to it first nor secondly is this last more difficult to be explicated then that a body as silver for instance put into a weak menstruum as unrectified aqua fortis should when it is put in a great heat be there dissolved by it and not before which hypothesis is more largely explicated in the description of charcoal to conclude we see by this instance how much experiments may conduce to the regulating of philosophical notions for if the most acute des cartes had applied himself experimentally to have examined what substance it was that caused that shining of the falling sparks struck from a flint and a steel he would certainly have a little altered his hypothesis and we should have found that his ingenious principles would have admitted a very plausible explication of this ph√¶nomenon whereas by not examining so far as he might he has set down an explication which experiment dos contradict  but before i leave this description i must not forget to take notice of the globular form into which each of these is most curiously formed and this ph√¶nomenon as i have elsewhere more largely shewn proceeds from a propriety which belongs to all kinds of fluid bodies more or less and is caused by the incongruity of the ambient and included fluid which so acts and modulates each other that they acquire as neer as is possible a spherical or globular form which propriety and several of the ph√¶nomena that proceed from it i have more fully explicated in the sixth observation  one experiment which does very much illustrate my present explication and is in it self exceeding pretty i must not pass by and that is a way of making small globules or balls of lead or tin as small almost as these of iron or steel and that exceeding easily and quickly by turning the filings or chips of those metals also into perfectly round globules the way in short as i received it from the learned physitian doctor ig is this  reduce the metal you would thus shape into exceeding fine filings the finer the filings are the finer will the balls be stratifie these filings with the fine and well dryed powder of quick lime in a crucible proportioned to the quantity you intend to make when you have thus filled your crucible by continual stratifications of the filings and powder so that as neer as may be no one of the filings may touch another place the crucible in a gradual fire and by degrees let it be brought to a heat big enough to make all the filings that are mixt with the quick lime to melt and no more for if the fire be too hot many of these filings will joyn and run together whereas if the heat be proportioned upon washing the limedust in fair water all those small filings of the metal will subside to the bottom in a most curious powder consisting all of exactly round globules which if it be very fine is very excellent to make hourglasses of  now though quick lime be the powder that this direction makes choice of yet i doubt not but that there may be much more convenient ones found out one of which i have made tryal of and found very effectual and were it not for discovering by the mentioning of it another secret which i am not free to impart i should have here inserted it                                        observ ix of the colours observable in muscovy glass and other thin bodies  moscovyglass or lapis specularis is a body that seems to have as many curiosities in its fabrick as any common mineral i have met with for first it is transparent to a great thickness next it is compounded of an infinite number of thin flakes joyned or generated one upon another so close  smooth as with many hundreds of them to make one smooth and thin plate of a transparent flexible substance which with care and diligence may be flit into pieces so exceedingly thin as to be hardly perceivable by the eye and yet even those which i have thought the thinnest i have with a good microscope found to be made up of many other plates yet thinner and it is probable that were our microscopes much better we might much further discover its divisibility nor are these flakes only regular as to the smoothness of their surfaces but thirdly in many plates they may be perceived to be terminated naturally with edges of the figure of a rhomboeid this figure is much more conspicuous in our english talk much whereof is found in the lead mines and is commonly called spar and kauck which is of the same kind of substance with the selenitis but is seldom found in so large flakes as that is nor is it altogether so tuff but is much more clear and transparent and much more curiously shaped and yet may be cleft and flakd like the other selenitis but fourthly this stone has a property which in respect of the microscope is more notable and that is that it exhibits several appearances of colours both to the naked eye but much more conspicuously to the microscope for the exhibiting of which i took a piece of muscovyglass and splitting or cleaving it into thin plates i found that up and down in several parts of them i could plainly perceive several white specks or flaws and others diversly coloured with all the colours of the rainbow and with the microscope i could perceive that these colours were ranged in rings that incompassed the white speck or flaw and were round or irregular according to the shape of the spot which they terminated and the position of colours in respect of one another was the very same as in the rainbow the consecution of those colours from the middle of the spot outward being blew purple scarlet yellow green blew purple scarlet and so onwards sometimes half a score times repeated that is there appeared six seven eight nine or ten several coloured rings or lines each incircling the other in the same manner as i have often seen a very vivid rainbow to have four or five several rings of colours that is accounting all the gradations between red and blew for one but the order of the colours in these rings was quite contrary to the primary or innermost rainbow and the same with those of the secondary or outermost rainbow these coloured lines or irises as i may so call them were some of them much brighter then others and some of them also very much broader they being some of them ten twenty nay i believe neer a hundred times broader then others and those usually were broadest which were neerest the center or middle of the flaw and oftentimes i found that these colours reacht to the very middle of the flaw and then there appeared in the middle a very large spot for the most part all of one colour which was very vivid and all the other colours incompassing it gradually ascending and growing narrower towards the edges keeping the same order as in the secundary rainbow that is if the middle were blew the next incompassing it would be a purple the third a red the fourth a yellow c as above if the middle were a red the next without it would be a yellow the third a green the fourth a blew and so onward and this order it alwayes kept whatsoever were the middle colour  there was further observable in several other parts of this body many lines or threads each of them of some one peculiar colour and those so exceedingly bright and vivid that it afforded a very pleasant object through the microscope some of these threads i have observed also to be pieced or made up of several short lengths of differently coloured ends as i may so call them as a line appearing about two inches long through the microscope has been compounded of about half an inch of a peach colour 18 of a lovely grassgreen 34 of an inch more of a bright scarlet and the rest of the line of a watchet blew others of them were much otherwise coloured the variety being almost infinite another thing which is very observable is that if you find any place where the colours are very broad and conspicuous to the naked eye you may by pressing that place with your finger make the colours change places and go from one part to another  there is one ph√¶nomenon more which may if care be used exhibit to the beholder as it has divers times to me an exceeding pleasant and not less instructive spectacle and that is if curiosity and diligence be used you may so split this admirable substance that you may have pretty large plates in companion of those smaller ones which you may observe in the rings that are perhaps an 18 or a 16 part of an inch over each of them appearing through the microscope most curiously intirely and uniformly adorned with some one vivid colour this if examined with the microscope may be plainly perceived to be in all parts of it equally thick two three or more of these lying one upon another exhibit oftentimes curious compounded colours which produce such a compositum as one would scarce imagine should be the result of such ingredients as perhaps a faint yellow and a blew may produce a very deep purple but when anon we come to the more strict examination of these ph√¶nomena and to inquire into the causes and reasons of these productions we shall i hope make it more conceivable how they are produced and shew them to be no other then the natural and necessary effects arising from the peculiar union of concurrent causes  these ph√¶nomena being so various and so truly admirable it will certainly be very well worth our inquiry to examine the causes and reasons of them and to consider whether from these causes demonstratively evidenced may not be deduced the true causes of the production of all kind of colours and i the rather now do it instead of an appendix or digression to this history then upon the occasion of examining the colours in peacocks or other feathers because this subject as it does afford more variety of particular colours so does it afford much better wayes of examining each circumstance and this will be made manifest to him that considers first that this laminated body is more simple and regular then the parts of peacocks feathers this consisting only of an indefinite number of plain and smooth plates heaped up or incumbent on each other next that the parts of this body are much more manageable to be divided or joyned then the parts of a peacocks feather or any other substance that i know and thirdly because that in this we are able from a colourless body to produce several coloured bodies affording all the variety of colours imaginable and several others which the subsequent inquiry will make manifest  to begin therefore it is manifest from several circumstances that the material cause of the apparition of these several colours is some lamina or plate of a transparent or pellucid body of a thickness very determinate and proportioned according to the greater or less refractive power of the pellucid body and that this is so abundance of instances and particular circumstances will make manifest  as first if you take any small piece of the muscovyglass and with a needle or some other convenient instrument cleave it oftentimes into thinner and thinner lamin√¶ you shall find that till you come to a determinate thinness of them they shall all appear transparent and colourless but if you continue to split and divide them further you shall find at last that each plate after it comes to such a determinate thickness shall appear most lovely tingd or imbued with a determinate colour if further by any means you so flaw a pretty thick piece that one part does begin to cleave a little from the other and between those two there be by any means gotten some pellucid medium those laminated pellucid bodies that fill that space shall exhibit several rainbows or coloured lines the colours of which will be disposed and ranged according to the various thicknesses of the several parts of that plate that this is so is yet further confirmed by this experiment  take two small pieces of ground and polisht lookingglassplate each about the bigness of a shilling take these two dry and with your forefingers and thumbs press them very hard and close together and you shall find that when they approach each other very near there will appear several irises or coloured lines in the same manner almost as in the muscovyglass and you may very easily change any of the colours of any part of the interposed body by pressing the plates closer and harder together or leaving them more lax that is a part which appeared coloured with a red may be presently tingd with a yellow blew green purple or the like by altering the appropinquation of the terminating plates now that air is not necessary to be the interposed body but that any other transparent fluid will do much the same may be tryed by wetting those approximated surfaces with water or any other transparent liquor and proceeding with it in the same manner as you did with the air and you will find much the like effect only with this difference that those comprest bodies which differ most in their refractive quality from the compressing bodies exhibit the most strong and vivid tinctures nor is it necessary that this laminated and tingd body should be of a fluid substance any other substance provided it be thin enough and transparent doing the same thing this the lamin√¶ of our muscovyglass hint but it may be confirmd by multitudes of other instances  and first we shall find that even glass it self may by the help of a lamp be blown thin enough to produce these ph√¶nomena of colours which ph√¶nomena accidentally happening as i have been attempting to frame small glasses with a lamp did not a little surprize me at first having never heard or seen any thing of it before though afterwards comparing it with the ph√¶nomena i had often observed in those bubbles which children use to make with soapwater i did the less wonder especially when upon experiment i found i was able to produce the same ph√¶nomena in thin bubbles made with any other transparent substance thus have i produced them with bubbles of pitch rosin colophony turpentine solutions of several gums as gumarabick in water any glutinous liquor as wort wine spirit of wine oyl of turpentine glare of snails c  it would be needless to enumerate the several instances these being enough to shew the generality or universality of this propriety only i must not omit that we have instances also of this kind even in metalline bodies and animal for those several colours which are observed to follow each other upon the polisht surface of hardned steel when it is by a sufficient degree of heat gradually tempered or softened are produced from nothing else but a certain thin lamina of a vitrum or vitrified part of the metal which by that degree of heat and the concurring action of the ambient air is driven out and fixed on the surface of the steel  and this hints to me a very probable at least if not the true cause of the hardning and tempering of steel which has not i think been yet given nor that i know of been so much as thought of by any and that is this that the hardness of it arises from a greater proportion of a vitrified substance interspersed through the pores of the steel and that the tempering or softning of it arises from the proportionate or smaller parcels of it left within those pores this will seem the more probable if we consider these particulars  first that the pure parts of metals are of themselves very flexible and tuff that is will indure bending and hammering and yet retain their continuity  next that the parts of all vitrified substances as all kinds of glass the scoria of metals c are very hard and also very brittle being neither flexible nor malleable but may by hammering or beating be broken into small parts or powders  thirdly that all metals excepting gold and silver which do not so much with the bare fire unless assisted by other saline bodies do more or less vitrifie by the strength of fire that is are corroded by a saline substance which i elsewhere shew to be the true cause of fire and are thereby as by several other menstruums converted into scoria and this is called calcining of them by chimists thus iron and copper by heating and quenching do turn all of them by degrees into scoria which are evidently vitrified substances and unite with glass and are easily fusible and when cold very hard and very brittle  fourthly that most kind of vitrifications or calcinations are made by salts uniting and incorporating with the metalline particles nor do i know any one calcination wherein a saline body may not with very great probability be said to be an agent or coadjutor  fifthly that iron is converted into steel by means of the incorporation of certain salts with which it is kept a certain time in the fire  sixthly that any iron may in a very little time be case hardned as the tradesmen call it by casing the iron to be hardned with clay and putting between the clay and iron a good quantity of a mixture of urine soot seasalt and horses hoofs all which contein great quantities of saline bodies and then putting the case into a good strong fire and keeping it in a considerable degree of heat for a good while and afterwards heating and quenching or cooling it suddenly in cold water  seventhly that all kind of vitrifyd substances by being suddenly coold become very hard and brittle and thence arises the pretty ph√¶nomena of the glass drops which i have already further explained in its own place  eighthly that those metals which are not so apt to vitrifie do not acquire any hardness by quenching in water as silver gold c  these considerations premisd will i suppose make way for the more easie reception of this following explication of the ph√¶nomena of hardned and temperd steel that steel is a substance made out of iron by means of a certain proportionate vitrification of several parts which are so curiously and proportionately mixt with the more tough and unalterd parts of the iron that when by the great heat of the fire this vitrifyd substance is melted and consequently rarifyd and thereby the pores of the iron are more open if then by means of dipping it in cold water it be suddenly cold and the parts hardned that is stayd in that same degree of expansion they were in when hot the parts become very hard and brittle and that upon the same account almost as small parcels of glass quenched in water grow brittle which we have already explicated if after this the piece of steel be held in some convenient heat till by degrees certain colours appear upon the surface of the brightned metal the very hard and brittle tone of the metal by degrees relaxes and becomes much more tough and soft namely the action of the heat does by degrees loosen the parts of the steel that were before streached or set atilt as it were and stayed open by each other whereby they become relaxed and set at liberty whence some of the more brittle interjacent parts are thrust out and melted into a thin skin on the surface of the steel which from no colour increases to a deep purple and so onward by these gradations or consecutions white yellow orange minium scarlet purple blew watchet c and the parts within are more conveniently and proportionately mixt and so they gradually subside into a texture which is much better proportiond and closer joynd whence that rigidnesse of parts ceases and the parts begin to acquire their former ductilness  now that tis nothing but the vitrifyd metal that sticks upon the surface of the colourd body is evident from this that if by any means it be scraped and rubbd off the metal underneath it is white and clear and if it be kept longer in the fire so as to increase to a considerable thickness it may by blows be beaten off in flakes this is further confirmd by this observable that that iron or steel will keep longer from rusting which is covered with this vitrifyd case thus also lead will by degrees be all turnd into a litharge for that colour which covers the top being scumd or shovd aside appears to be nothing else but a litharge or vitrifyd lead  this is observable also in some sort on brass copper silver gold tin but is most conspicuous in lead all those colours that cover the surface of the metal being nothing else but a very thin vitrifid part of the heated metal  the other instance we have is in animal bodies as in pearls mother of pearlshels oystershels and almost all other kinds of stony shels whatsoever this have i also sometimes with pleasure observd even in muscles and tendons further if you take any glutinous substance and run it exceedingly thin upon the surface of a smooth glass or a polisht metaline body you shall find the like effects produced and in general wheresoever you meet with a transparent body thin enough that is terminated by reflecting bodies of differing refractions from it there will be a production of these pleasing and lovely colours  nor is it necessary that the two terminating bodies should be both of the same kind as may appear by the vitrified lamin√¶ on steel lead and other metals one surface of which lamin√¶ is contiguous to the surface of the metal the other to that of the air  nor is it necessary that these colourd lamin√¶ should be of an even thickness that is should have their edges and middles of equal thickness as in a lookingglassplate which circumstance is only requisite to make the plate appear all of the same colour but they may resemble a lens that is have their middles thicker then their edges or else a double concave that is be thinner in the middle then at the edges in both which cases there will be various coloured rings or lines with differing consecutions or orders of colours the order of the first from the middle outwards being red yellow green blew c and the latter quite contrary  but further it is altogether necessary that the plate in the places where the colours appear should be of a determinate thickness first it must not be more then such a thickness for when the plate is increased to such a thickness the colours cease and besides i have seen in a thin piece of muscovyglass where the two ends of two plates which appearing both single exhibited two distinct and differing colours but in that place where they were united and constituted one double plate as i may call it they appeared transparent and colourless nor secondly may the plates be thinner then such a determinate cize for we alwayes find that the very outmost rim of these flaws is terminated in a white and colourless ring  further in this production of colours there is no need of a determinate light of such a bigness and no more nor of a determinate position of that light that it should be on this side and not on that side nor of a terminating shadow as in the prisme and rainbow or waterball for we find that the light in the open air either in or out of the sunbeams and within a room either from one or many windows produces much the same effect only where the light is brightest there the colours are most vivid so does the light of a candle collected by a glassball and further it is all one whatever side of the coloured rings be towards the light for the whole ring keeps its proper colours from the middle outwards in the same order as i before related without varying at all upon changing the position of the light  but above all it is most observable that here are all kind of colours generated in a pellucid body where there is properly no such refraction as des cartes supposes his globules to acquire a vertuity by for in the plain and even plates it is manifest that the second refraction according to des cartes his principles in the fifth section of the eighth chapter of his meteors does regulate and restore the supposed turbinated globules unto their former uniform motion this experiment therefore will prove such a one as our thrice excellent verulam calls experimentum crucis serving as a guide or landmark by which to direct our course in the search after the true cause of colours affording us this particular negative information that for the production of colours there is not necessary either a great refraction as in the prisme nor secondly a determination of light and shadow such as is both in the prisme and glassball now that we may see likewise what affirmative and positive instruction it yields it will be necessary to examine it a little more particularly and strictly which that we may the better do it will be requisite to premise somewhat in general concerning the nature of light and refraction  and first for light it seems very manifest that there is no luminous body but has the parts of it in motion more or less  first that all kind of fiery burning bodies have their parts in motion i think will be very easily granted me that the spark struck from a flint and steel is in a rapid agitation i have elsewhere made probable and that the parts of rotten wood rotten fish and the like are also in motion i think will as easily be conceded by those who consider that those parts never begin to shine till the bodies be in a state of putrefaction and that is now generally granted by all to be caused by the motion of the parts of putrifying bodies that the bononian stone shines no longer then it is either warmed by the sunbeams or by the flame of a fire or of a candle is the general report of those that write of it and of others that have seen it and that heat argues a motion of the internal parts is as i said before generally granted  but there is one instance more which was first shewn to the royal society by mr clayton a worthy member thereof which does make this assertion more evident then all the rest and that is that a diamond being rubd struck or heated in the dark shines for a pretty while after so long as that motion which is imparted by any of those agents remains in the same manner as a glass rubbd struck or by a means which i shall elsewhere mention heated yields a sound which lasts as long as the vibrating motion of that sonorous body several experiments made on which stone are since published in a discourse of colours by the truly honourable mr boyle what may be said of those ignes fatui that appear in the night i cannot so well affirm having never had the opportunity to examine them my self nor to be informd by any others that had observd them and the relations of them in authors are so imperfect that nothing can be built on them but i hope i shall be able in another place to make it at least very probable that there is even in those also a motion which causes this effect that the shining of seawater proceeds from the same cause may be argued from this that it shines not till either it be beaten against a rock or be some other wayes broken or agitated by storms or oars or other percussing bodies and that the animal energyes or spirituous agil parts are very active in cats eyes when they shine seems evident enough because their eyes never shine but when they look very intensly either to find their prey or being hunted in a dark room when they seek after their adversary or to find a way to escape and the like may be said of the shining bellies of gloworms since tis evident they can at pleasure either increase or extinguish that radiation  it would be somewhat too long a work for this place zetetically to examine and positively to prove what particular kind of motion it is that must be the efficient of light for though it be a motion yet tis not every motion that produces it since we find there are many bodies very violently movd which yet afford not such an effect and there are other bodies which to our other senses seem not movd so much which yet shine thus water and quicksilver and most other liquors heated shine not and several hard bodies as iron silver brass copper wood c though very often struck with a hammer shine not presently though they will all of them grow exceeding hot whereas rotten wood rotten fish sea water gloworms c have nothing of tangible heat in them and yet where there is no stronger light to affect the sensory they shine some of them so vividly that one may make a shift to read by them  it would be too long i say here to insert the discursive progress by which i inquird after the proprieties of the motion of light and therefore i shall only add the result  and first i found it ought to be exceeding quick such as those motions of fermentation and putrefaction whereby certainly the parts are exceeding nimbly and violently movd and that because we find those motions are able more minutely to shatter and divide the body then the most violent heats menstruums we yet know and that fire is nothing else but such a dissolution of the burning body made by the most universal menstruum of all sulphureous bodies namely the air we shall in an other place of this tractate endeavour to make probable and that in all extreamly hot shining bodies there is a very quick motion that causes light as well as a more robust that causes heat may be argued from the celerity wherewith the bodyes are dissolvd  next it must be a vibrative motion and for this the newly mentiond diamond affords us a good argument since if the motion of the parts did not return the diamond must after many rubbings decay and be wasted but we have no reason to suspect the latter especially if we consider the exceeding difficulty that is found in cutting or wearing away a diamond and a circular motion of the parts is much more improbable since if that were granted and they be supposd irregular and angular parts i see not how the parts of the diamond should hold so firmly together or remain in the same sensible dimensions which yet they do next if they be globular and movd only with a turbinated motion i know not any cause that can impress that motion upon the pellucid medium which yet is done thirdly any other irregular motion of the parts one amongst another must necessarily make the body of a fluid consistence from which it is far enough it must therefore be a vibrating motion  and thirdly that it is a very shortvibrating motion i think the instances drawn from the shining of diamonds will also make probable for a diamond being the hardest body we yet know in the world and consequently the least apt to yield or bend must consequently also have its vibrations exceeding short  and these i think are the three principal proprieties of a motion requisite to produce the effect calld light in the object  the next thing we are to consider is the way or manner of the trajection of this motion through the interposd pellucid body to the eye and here it will be easily granted  first that it must be a body susceptible and impartible of this motion that will deserve the name of a transparent and next that the parts of such a body must be homogeneous or of the same kind thirdly that the constitution and motion of the parts must be such that the appulse of the luminous body may be communicated or propagated through it to the greatest imaginable distance in the least imaginable time though i see no reason to affirm that it must be in an instant for i know not any one experiment or observation that does prove it and whereas it may be objected that we see the sun risen at the very instant when it is above the sensible horizon and that we see a star hidden by the body of the moon at the same instant when the star the moon and our eye are all in the same line and the like observations or rather suppositions may be urgd i have this to answer that i can as easily deny as they affirm for i would fain know by what means any one can be assured any more of the affirmative then i of the negative if indeed the propagation were very slow tis possible something might be discovered by eclypses of the moon but though we should grant the progress of the light from the earth to the moon and from the moon back to the earth again to be full two minutes in performing i know not any possible means to discover it nay there may be some instances perhaps of horizontal eclypses that may seem very much to favour this supposition of the slower progression of light then most imagine and the like may be said of the eclypses of the sun c but of this only by the by fourthly that the motion is propagated every way through an homogeneous medium by direct or straight lines extended every way like rays from the center of a sphere fifthly in an homogeneous medium this motion is propagated every way with equal velocity whence necessarily every pulse or vitration of the luminous body will generate a sphere which will continually increase and grow bigger just after the same manner though indefinitely swifter as the waves or rings on the surface of the water do swell into bigger and bigger circles about a point of it where by the sinking of a stone the motion was begun whence it necessarily follows that all the parts of these spheres undulated through an homogeneous medium cut the rays at right angles  but because all transparent mediums are not homogeneous to one another therefore we will next examine how this pulse or motion will be propagated through differingly transparent mediums and here according to the most acute and excellent philosopher des cartes i suppose the sign of the angle of inclination in the first medium to be to the sign of refraction in the second as the density of the first to the density of the second by density i mean not the density in respect of gravity with which the refractions or transparency of mediums hold no proportion but in respect onely to the trajection of the rays of light in which respect they only differ in this that the one propagates the pulse more easily and weakly the other more slowly but more strongly but as for the pulses themselves they will by the refraction acquire another propriety which we shall now endeavour to explicate  we will suppose therefore in the first figure acfd to be a physical ray or abc and def to be two mathematical rays trajected from a very remote point of a luminous body through an homogeneous transparent medium lll and da eb fc to be small portions of the orbicular impulses which must therefore cut the rays at right angles these rays meeting with the plain surface no of a medium that yields an easier transitus to the propagation of light and falling obliquely on it they will in the medium mmm be refracted towards the perpendicular of the surface and because this medium is more easily trajected then the former by a third therefore the point c of the orbicular pulse fc will be movd to h four spaces in the same time that f the other end of it is movd to g three spaces therefore the whole refracted pulse gh shall be oblique to the refracted rays chk and gi and the angle ghc shall be an acute and so much the more acute by how much the greater the refraction be then which nothing is more evident for the sign of the inclination is to the sign of refraction as gf to tc the distance between the point c and the perpendicular from g on ck which being as four to three hc being longer then gf is longer also then tc therefore the angle ghc is less than gtc so that henceforth the parts of the pulses gh and ik are movd ascew or cut the rays at oblique angles  it is not my business in this place to set down the reasons why this or that body should impede the rays more others less as why water should transmit the rays more easily though more weakly than air onely thus much in general i shall hint that i suppose the medium mmm to have less of the transparent undulating subtile matter and that matter to be less implicated by it whereas lll i suppose to contain a greater quantity of the fluid undulating substance and this to be more implicated with the particles of that medium  but to proceed the same kind of obliquity of the pulses and rays will happen also when the refraction is made out of a more easie into a more difficult mediu as by the calculations of gq  csr which are refracted from the perpendicular in both which calculations tis obvious to observe that always that part of the ray towards which the refraction is made has the end of the orbicular pulse precedent to that of the other side and always the oftner the refraction is made the same way or the greater the single refraction is the more is this unequal progress so that having found this odd propriety to be an inseparable concomitant of a refracted ray not streightned by a contrary refraction we will next examine the refractions of the sunbeams as they are sufferd onely to pass through a small passage obliquely out of a more difficult into a more easie medium  let us suppose therefore abc in the second figure to represent a large chimical glassbody about two foot long filled with very fair water as high as ab and inclind in a convenient posture with b towards the sun let us further suppose the top of it to be coverd with an opacous body all but the hole ab through which the sunbeams are sufferd to pass into the water and are thereby refracted to cdef against which part if a paper be expanded on the outside there will appear all the colours of the rainbow that is there will be generated the two principal colours scarlet and blue and all the intermediate ones which arise from the composition and dilutings of these two that is cd shall exhibit a scarlet which toward d is diluted into a yellow this is the refraction of the ray ik which comes from the underside of the sun and the ray ef shall appear of a deep blue which is gradually towards e diluted into a pale watchetblue between d and e the two diluted colours blue and yellow are mixt and compounded into a green and this i imagine to be the reason why green is so acceptable a colour to the eye and that either of the two extremes are if intense rather a little offensive namely the being placd in the middle between the two extremes and compounded out of both those diluted also or somewhat qualifid for the composition arising from the mixture of the two extremes undiluted makes a purple which though it be a lovely colour and pretty acceptable to the eye yet is it nothing comparable to the ravishing pleasure with which a curious and well tempered green affects the eye if removing the paper the eye be placd against cd it will perceive the lower side of the sun or a candle at night which is much better because it offends not the eye and is more easily manageable to be of a deep red and if against ef it will perceive the upper part of the luminous body to be of a deep blue and these colours will appear deeper and deeper according as the rays from the luminous body fall more obliquely on the surface of the water and thereby suffer a greater refraction and the more distinct the further cdef is removed from the trajecting hole  so that upon the whole we shall find that the reason of the ph√¶nomena seems to depend upon the obliquity of the orbicular pulse to the lines of radiation and in particular that the ray cd which constitutes the scarlet has its inner parts namely those which are next to the middle of the luminous body precedent to the outermost which are contiguous to the dark and unradiating skie and that the ray ef which gives a blue has its outward part namely that which is contiguous to the dark side precedent to the pulse from the innermost which borders on the bright area of the luminous body  we may observe further that the cause of the diluting of the colours towards the middle proceeds partly from the wideness of the hole through which the rays pass whereby the rays from several parts of the luminous body fall upon many of the same parts between c and f as is more manifest by the figure and partly also from the nature of the refraction it self for the vividness or strength of the two terminating colours arising chiefly as we have seen from the very great difference that is betwixt the outsides of those oblique undulations  the dark rays circumambient and that disparity betwixt the approximate rays decaying gradually the further inward toward the middle of the luminous body they are removd the more must the colour approach to a white or an undisturbed light  upon the calculation of the refraction and reflection from a ball of water or glass we have much the same ph√¶nomena namely an obliquity of the undulation in the same manner as we have found it here which because it is very much to our present purpose and affords such an instancia crucis as no one that i know has hitherto taken notice of i shall further examine for it does very plainly and positively distinguish and shew which of the two hypotheses either the cartesian or this is to be followed by affording a generation of all the colors in the rainbow where according to the cartesian principles there should be none at all generated and secondly by affording an instance that does more closely confine the cause of these ph√¶nomena of colours to this present hypothesis  and first for the cartesian we have this to object against it that whereas he says meteorum cap 8 sect 5 sed judicabam unicam refractione scilicet ad minimum requiri  quidem talem ut ejus effectus ali√¢ contrari√¢ refractione non destruatur nam experientia docet si superficies nm  np nempe refringentes parallel√¶ forent radios tantundem per alteram iterum erectos quantum per unam frangerentur nullos colores depicturos this principle of his holds true indeed in a prisme where the refracting surfaces are plain but is contradicted by the ball or cylinder whether of water or glass where the refracting surfaces are orbicular or cylindrical for if we examine the passage of any globule or ray of the primary iris we shall find it to pass out of the ball or cylinder again with the same inclination and refraction that it enterd in withall and that that last refraction by means of the intermediate reflection shall be the same as if without any reflection at all the ray had been twice refracted by two parallel surfaces  and that this is true not onely in one but in every ray that goes to the constitution of the primary iris nay in every ray that suffers only two refractions and one reflection by the surface of the round body we shall presently see most evident if we repeat the cartesian scheme mentioned in the tenth section of the eighth chapter of his meteors where efknp in the third figure9 is one of the rays of the primary iris twice refracted at f and n and once reflected at k by the surface of the waterball for first it is evident that kf and kn are equal because kn being the reflected part of kf they have both the same inclination on the surface k that is the angles fkt and nkv made by the two rays and the tangent of k are equal which is evident by the laws of reflection whence it will follow also that kn has the same inclination on the surface n or the tangent of it xn that the ray kf has to the surface f or the tangent of it fy whence it must necessarily follow that the refractions at f and n are equal that is kfe and knp are equal now that the surface n is by the reflection at k made parallel to the surface at f is evident from the principles of reflection for reflection being nothing but an inverting of the rays if we reinvert the ray knp and make the same inclinations below the line tkv that it has above it will be most evident that kh the inverse of kn will be the continuation of the line fk and that lhi the inverse of ox is parallel to fy and hm the inverse of np is parallel to ef for the angle khi is equal to kno which is equal to kfy and the angle khm is equal to knp which is equal to kfe which was to be provd  so that according to the above mentioned cartesian principles there should be generated no colour at all in a ball of water or glass by two refractions and one reflection which does hold most true indeed if the surfaces be plain as may be experimented with any kind of prisme where the two refracting surfaces are equally inclind to the reflecting but in this the ph√¶nomena are quite otherwise  the cause therefore of the generation of colour must not be what des cartes assigns namely a certain rotation of the globuli √¶therei which are the particles which he supposes to constitute the pellucid medium but somewhat else perhaps what we have lately supposed and shall by and by further prosecute and explain  but first i shall crave leave to propound some other difficulties of his notwithstanding exceedingly ingenious hypothesis which i plainly confess to me seem such and those are  first if that light be as is affirmed diopt cap 1 ¬ß 8 not so properly a motion as an action or propension to motion i cannot conceive how the eye can come to be sensible of the verticity of a globule which is generated in a drop of rain perhaps a mile off from it for that globule is not carryd to the eye according to his formerly recited principle and if not so i cannot conceive how it can communicate its rotation or circular motion to the line of the globules between the drop and the eye it cannot be by means of every ones turning the next before him for if so then onely all the globules that are in the odd places must be turned the same way with the first namely the 3 5 7 9 11 c but all the globules interposited between them in the even places namely the 2 4 6 8 10 c must be the quite contrary whence according to the cartesian hypothesis there must be no distinct colour generated but a confusion next since the cartesian globuli are supposd principiorum philosoph part 3 ¬ß 86 to be each of them continually in motion about their centers i cannot conceive how the eye is able to distinguish this new generated motion from their former inherent one if i may so call that other wherewith they are movd or turbinated from some other cause than refraction and thirdly i cannot conceive how these motions should not happen sometimes to oppose each other and then in stead of a rotation there would be nothing but a direct motion generated and consequently no colour and fourthly i cannot conceive how by the cartesian hypothesis it is possible to give any plausible reason of the nature of the colours generated in the thin lamin√¶ of these our microscopical observations for in many of these the refracting and reflecting surfaces are parallel to each other and consequently no rotation can be generated nor is there any necessity of a shadow or termination of the bright rays such as is supposd chap 8 ¬ß 5 et pr√¶terea observavi umbram quoque aut limitationem luminis requiri and chap 8 ¬ß 9 to be necessary to the generation of any distinct colours besides that here is oftentimes one colour generated without any of the other appendant ones which cannot be by the cartesian hypothesis  there must be therefore some other propriety of refraction that causes colour and upon the examination of the thing i cannot conceive any one more general inseparable and sufficient than that which i have before assignd that we may therefore see how exactly our hypothesis agrees also with the ph√¶nomena of the refracting round body whether globe or cylinder we shall next subjoyn our calculation or examen of it  and to this end we will calculate any two rays as for instance10 let ef be a ray cutting the radius cd divided into 20 parts in g 16 parts distant from c and ef another ray which cuts the same radius in g 17 parts distant these will be refracted to k and k and from thence reflected to n and n and from thence refracted toward p and p therefore the arch ff will be 5d 5 the arch fk 106d 30 the arch fk 101d 2 the line fg 6000 and fg 5267 therefore hf 733 therefore fc 980 almost the line fk 16024 and fk 15436 therefore nd 196 and no 147 almost the line nn 1019 the arch nn 5d 51 therefore the angle nno is 34d 43 therefore the angle non is 139d 56 which is almost 50d more than a right angle  it is evident therefore by this hypothesis that at the same time that ef touches f ef is arrived at c and by that time efkn is got to n efkn is got to d and when it touches n the pulse of the other ray is got to o and no farther which is very short of the place it should have arrivd to to make the ray np to cut the orbicular pulse no at right angles therefore the angle nop is an acute angle but the quite contrary of this will happen if 17 and 18 be calculated in stead of 16 and 17 both which does most exactly agree with the ph√¶nomena for if the sun or a candle which is better be placed about ee and the eye about pp the rays efef at 16 and 17 will paint the side of the luminous object toward np blue and towards np red but the quite contrary will happen when ef is 17 and ef 18 for then towards np shall be a blue and towards np a red exactly according to the calculation and there appears the blue of the rainbow where the two blue sides of the two images unite and there the red where the two red sides unite that is where the two images are just disappearing which is when the rays ef and np producd till they meet make an angle of about 41 and an half the like union is there of the two images in the production of the secundary iris and the same causes as upon calculation may appear onely with this difference that it is somewhat more faint by reason of the duplicate reflection which does always weaken the impulse the oftner it is repeated  now though the second refraction made at nn be convenient that is do make the rays glance the more yet is it not altogether requisite for it is plain from the calculation that the pulse dn is sufficiently oblique to the rays kn and kn as wel as the pulse fc is oblique to the rays fk  fk and therefore if a piece of very fine paper be held close against nn and the eye look on it either through the ball as from d or from the other side as from b there shall appear a rainbow or colourd line painted on it with the part toward x appearing red towards o blue the same also shall happen if the paper be placed about kk for towards t shall appear a red and towards v a blue which does exactly agree with this my hypothesis as upon the calculation of the progress of the pulse will most easily appear  nor do these two observations of the colours appearing to the eye about p differing from what they appear on the paper at n contradict each other but rather confirm and exactly agree with one another as will be evident to him that examines the reasons set down by the ingenious des cartes in the 12 sect of the 8 chapter of his meteors where he gives the true reason why the colours appear of a quite contrary order to the eye to what they appeard on the paper if the eye be placd in steed of the paper and as in the prisme so also in the waterdrop or globe the ph√¶nomena and reason are much the same  having therefore shewn that there is such a propriety in the prisme and water globule whereby the pulse is made oblique to the progressive and that so much the more by how much greater the refraction is i shall in the next place consider how this conduces to the production of colours and what kind of impression it makes upon the bottom of the eye and to this end it will be requisite to examine this hypothesis a little more particularly  first therefore if we consider the manner of the progress of the pulse it will seem rational to conclude that that part or end of the pulse which precedes the other must necessarily be somwhat more obtunded or impeded by the resistance of the transparent medium than the other part or end of it which is subsequent whose way is as it were prepared by the other especially if the adjacent medium be not in the same manner enlightned or agitated and therefore in the fourth figure of the sixth iconism the ray aaahb will have its side hh more deadned by the resistance of the dark or quiet medium ppp whence there will be a kind of deadness superinducd on the side hhh which will continually increase from b and strike deeper and deeper into the ray by the line br whence all the parts of the triangle rbho will be of a dead blue colour and so much the deeper by how much the nearer they lie to the line bhh which is most deaded or impeded and so much the more dilute by how much the nearer it approaches the line br next on the other side of the ray aan the end a of the pulse ah will be promoted or made stronger having its passage already prepard as twere by the other parts preceding and so its impression wil be stronger and because of its obliquity to the ray there will be propagated a kind of faint motion into qq the adjacent dark or quiet medium which faint motion will spread further and further into qq as the ray is propagated further and further from a namely as far as the line ma whence all the triangle man will be tingd with a red and that red will be the deeper the nearer it approaches the line ma and the paler or yellower the nearer it is the line na and if the ray be continued so that the lines an and br which are the bounds of the red and blue diluted do meet and cross each other there will be beyond that intersection generated all kinds of greens  now these being the proprieties of every single refracted ray of light it will be easie enough to consider what must be the result of very many such rays collateral as if we suppose infinite such rays interjacent between aksb and anob which arc the terminating for in this case the ray aksb will have its red triangle intire as lying next to the dark or quiet medium but the other side of it bs will have no blue because the medium adjacent to it sbo is movd or enlightned and consequently that light does destroy the colour so likewise will the ray anob lose its red because the adjacent medium is movd or enlightned but the other side of the ray that is adjacent to the dark namely aho will preserve its blue entire and these rays must be so far producd as till an and br cut each other before there will be any green producd from these proprieties well considerd may be deducd the reasons of all the ph√¶nomena of the prisme and of the globules or drops of water which conduce to the production of the rainbow  next for the impression they make on the retina we will further examine this hypothesis suppose therefore abcdef in the fifth figure to represent the ball of the eye on the cornea of which abc two rays gach and kcai which are the terminating rays of a luminous body falling are by the refraction thereof collected or convergd into two points at the bottom of the eye now because these terminating rays and all the intermediate ones which come from any part of the luminous body are supposd by some sufficient refraction before they enter the eye to have their pulses made oblique to their progression and consequently each ray to have potentially superinducd two proprieties or colours viz a red on the one side and a blue on the other which notwithstanding are never actually manifest but when this or that ray has the one or the other side of it bordering on a dark or unmovd medium therefore as soon as these rays are entred into the eye and so have one side of each of them bordering on a dark part of the humours of the eye they will each of them actually exhibit some colour therefore adc the production of gach will exhibit a blue because the side cd is adjacent to the dark medium cqdc but nothing of a red because its side ad is adjacent to the enlightned medium adfa and all the rays that from the points of the luminous body are collected on the parts of the retina between d and f shall have their blue so much the more diluted by how much the farther these points of collection are distant from d towards f and the ray afc the production of kcai will exhibit a red because the side af is adjacent to the dark or quiet medium of the eye apfa but nothing of a blue because its side cf is adjacent to the enlightned medium cfdc and all the rays from the intermediate parts of the luminous body that are collected between f and d shall have their red so much the more diluted by how much the farther they are distant from f towards d  now because by the refraction in the cornea and some other parts of the eye the sides of each ray which before were almost parallel are made to converge and meet in a point at the bottom of the eye therefore that side of the pulse which preceded before these refractions shall first touch the retina and the other side last and therefore according as this or that side or end of the pulse shall be impeded accordingly will the impressions on the retina be varied therefore by the ray gach refracted by the cornea to d there shall be on that point a stroke or impression confusd whose weakest end namely that by the line cd shall precede and the stronger namely that by the line ad shall follow and by the ray kcai refracted to f there shall be on that part a confusd stroke or impression whose strongest part namely that by the line cf shal precede and whose weakest or impeded namely that by the line af shall follow and all the intermediate points between f and d will receive impressions from the convergd rays so much the more like the impressions on f and d by how much the nearer they approach that or this  from the consideration of the proprieties of which impressions we may collect these short definitions of colours that blue is an impression on the retina of an oblique and confusd pulse of light whose weakest part precedes and whose strongest follows and that red is an impression on the retina of an oblique and confusd pulse of light whose strongest part precedes and whose weakest follows  which proprieties as they have been already manifested in the prisme and falling drops of rain to be the causes of the colours there generated may be easily found to be the efficients also of the colours appearing in thin laminated transparent bodies for the explication of which all this has been premised  and that this is so a little closer examination of the ph√¶nomena and the figure of the body by this hypothesis will make evident  for first as we have already observed the laminated body must be of a determinate thickness that is it must not be thinner then such a determinate quantity for i have always observd that neer the edges of those which are exceeding thin the colours disappear and the part grows white nor must it be thicker then another determinate quantity for i have likewise observd that beyond such a thickness no colours appeard but the plate looked white between which two determinate thicknesses were all the colourd rings of which in some substances i have found ten or twelve in others not half so many which i suppose depends much upon the transparency of the laminated body thus though the consecutions are the same in the scumm or the skin on the top of metals yet in those consecutions in the same colour is not so often repeated as in the consecutions in thin glass or in sopewater or any other more transparent and glutinous liquor for in these i have observd red yellow green blue purple red yellow green blue purple red yellow green blue purple red yellow c to succeed each other ten or twelve times but in the other more opacous bodies the consecutions will not be half so many  and therefore secondly the laminated body must be transparent and this i argue from this that i have not been able to produce any colour at all with an opacous body though never so thin and this i have often tryd by pressing small globule of mercury between two smooth plates of glass whereby i have reducd that body to a much greater thinness then was requisite to exhibit the colours with a transparent body  thirdly there must be a considerable reflecting body adjacent to the under or further side of the lamina or plate for this i always found that the greater that reflection was the more vivid were the appearing colours  from which observations is most evident that the reflection from the under or further side of the body is the principal cause of the production of these colours which that it is so and how it conduces to that effect i shall further explain in the following figure which is here described of a very great thickness as if it had been viewd through the microscope and tis indeed much thicker than any microscope i have yet usd has been able to shew me those colourd plates of glass or muscovieglass which i have not without much trouble viewd with it for though i have endeavoured to magnifie them as much as the glasses were capable of yet are they so exceeding thin that i have not hitherto been able positively to determine their thickness this figure therefore i here represent is wholy hypothetical  let abcdhfe in the sixth figure be a frustum of muscovyglass thinner toward the end ae and thicker towards df let us first suppose the ray aghb coming from the sun of some remote luminous object to fall obliquely on the thinner plate bae part therefore is reflected back by cghd the first superficies whereby the perpendicular pulse ab is after reflexion propagated by cd cd equally remote from each other with ab ab so that ag  gc or bh  hd are either of them equal to aa as is also cc but the body bae being transparent a part of the light of this ray is refracted in the surface ab and propagated by gikh to the surface ef whence it is reflected and refracted again by the surface ab so that after two refractions and one reflection there is propagated a kind of fainter ray emnf whose pulse is not only weaker by reason of the two refractions in the surface ab but by reason of the time spent in passing and repassing between the two surfaces ab and ef ef which is this fainter or weaker pulse comes behind the pulse cd so that hereby the surfaces ab and ef being so neer together that the eye cannot discriminate them from one this confusd or duplicated pulse whose strongest part precedes and whose weakest follows does produce on the retina or the optick nerve that covers the bottom of the eye the sensation of a yellow  and secondly this yellow will appear so much the deeper by how much the further back towards the middle between cd and cd the spurious pulse ef is removd as in 2 where the surface bc being further removd from ef the weaker pulse ef will be nearer to the middle and will make an impression on the eye of a red  but thirdly if the two reflecting surfaces be yet further removd asunder as in 3 cd and ef are then will the weaker pulse be so farr behind that it will be more then half the distance between cd and cd and in this case it will rather seem to precede the following stronger pulse then to follow the preceding one and consequently a blue will be generated and when the weaker pulse is just in the middle between two strong ones then is a deep and lovely purple generated but when the weaker pulse ef is very neer to cd then is there generated a green which will be bluer or yellower according as the approximate weak pulse does precede or follow the stronger  now fourthly if the thicker plate chance to be cleft into two thinner plates as cdfe is divided into two plates by the surface gh then from the composition arising from the three reflections in the surfaces cd gh and ef there will be generated several compounded or mixt colours which will be very differing according as the proportion between the thicknesses of those two divided plates cdhg and ghfe are varied  and fifthly if these surfaces cd and fe are further removd asunder the weaker pulse will yet lagg behind much further and not onely be coincident with the second cd but lagg behind that also and that so much the more by how much the thicker the plate be so that by degrees it will be coincident with the third cd backward also and by degrees as the plate grows thicker with a fourth and so onward to a fifth sixth seventh or eighth so that if there be a thin transparent body that from the greatest thinness requisite to produce colours does in the manner of a wedge by degrees grow to the greatest thickness that a plate can be of to exhibit a colour by the reflection of light from such a body there shall be generated several consecutions of colours whose order from the thin end towards the thick shall be yellow red purple blue green yellow red purple blue green yellow red purple blue green yellow c and these so often repeated as the weaker pulse does lose paces with its primary or first pulse and is coincident with a second third fourth fifth sixth c pulse behind the first and this as it is coincident or follows from the first hypothesis i took of colours so upon experiment have i found it in multitudes of instances that seem to prove it one thing which seems of the greatest concern in this hypothesis is to determine the greatest or least thickness requisite for these effects which though i have not been wanting in attempting yet so exceeding thin are these coloured plates and so imperfect our microscope that i have not been hitherto successfull though if my endeavours shall answer my expectations i shall hope to gratifie the curious reader with some things more removd beyond our reach hitherto  thus have i with as much brevity as i was able endeavoured to explicate hypothetically at least the causes of the ph√¶nomena i formerly recited on the consideration of which i have been the more particular  first because i think these i have newly given are capable of explicating all the ph√¶nomena of colours not onely of those appearing in the prisme waterdrop or rainbow and in laminated or plated bodies but of all that are in the world whether they be fluid or solid bodies whether in thick or thin whether transparent or seemingly opacous as i shall in the next observation further endeavour to shew and secondly because this being one of the two ornaments of all bodies discoverable by the sight whether looked on with or without a microscope it seemd to deserve somewhere in this tract which contains a description of the figure and colour of some minute bodies to be somewhat the more intimately enquird into                                        observ x of metalline and other real colours  having in the former discourse from the fundamental cause of colour made it probable that there are but two colours and shewn that the phantasm of colour is causd by the sensation of the oblique or uneven pulse of light which is capable of no more varieties than two that arise from the two sides of the oblique pulse though each of those be capable of infinite gradations or degrees each of them beginning from white and ending the one in the deepest scarlet or yellow the other in the deepest blue i shall in this section set down some observations which i have made of other colours such as metalline powders tinging or colourd bodies and several kinds of tinctures or tingd liquors all which together with those i treated of in the former observation will i suppose comprise the several subjects in which colour is observd to be inherent and the several manners by which it inheres or is apparent in them and here i shall endeavour to shew by what composition all kind of compound colours are made and how there is no colour in the world but may be made from the various degrees of these two colours together with the intermixtures of black and white  and this being so as i shall anon shew it seems an evident argument to me that all colours whatsoever whether in fluid or solid whether in very transparent or seemingly opacous have the same efficient cause to wit some kind of refraction whereby the rays that proceed from such bodies have their pulse obliquated or confusd in the manner i explicated in the former section that is a red is causd by a duplicated or confusd pulse whose strongest pulse precedes and a weaker follows and a blue is causd by a confusd pulse where the weaker pulse precedes and the stronger follows and according as these are more or less or variously mixt and compounded so are the sensations and consequently the phantasms of colours diversified  to proceed therefore i suppose that all transparent colourd bodies whether fluid or solid do consist at least of two parts or two kinds of substances the one of a substance of a somewhat differing refraction from the other that one of these substances which may be calld the tinging substance does consist of distinct parts or particles of a determinate bigness which are disseminated or dispersd all over the other that these particles if the body be equally and uniformly colourd are evenly rangd and dispersd over the other contiguous body that where the body is deepest tingd there these particles are rangd thickest and where tis but faintly tingd they are rangd much thinner but uniformly that by the mixture of another body that unites with either of these which has a differing refraction from either of the other quite differing effects will be producd that is the consecutions of the confusd pulses will be much of another kind and consequently produce other sensations and phantasms of colours and from a red may turn to a blue or from a blue to a red c  now that this may be the better understood i shall endeavour to explain my meaning a little more sensible by a scheme suppose we therefore in the seventh figure of the sixth scheme that abcd represents a vessel holding a tingd liquor let iiiii c be the clear liquor and let the tinging body that is mixt with it be ee c ff c gg c hh c whose particles whether round or some other determinate figure is little to our purpose are first of a determinate and equal bulk next they are rangd into the form of quincunx or equilaterotriangular order which that probably they are so and why they are so i shall elsewhere endeavour to shew thirdly they are of such a nature as does either more easily or more difficultly transmit the rays of light then the liquor if more easily a blue is generated and if more difficultly a red or scarlet  and first let us suppose the tinging particles to be of a substance that does more impede the rays of light we shall find that the pulse or wave of light movd from ad to bc will proceed on through the containing medium by the pulses or waves kk ll mm nn oo but because several of these rays that go to the constitution of these pulses will be slugged or stopped by the tinging particles e f g h therefore there shall be secundary and weak pulse that shall follow the ray namely pp which will be the weaker first because it has sufferd many refractions in the impeding body next for that the rays will be a little dispersd or confusd by reason of the refraction in each of the particles whether round or angular and this will be more evident if we a little more closely examine any one particular tinging globule  suppose we therefore ab in the eighth figure of the sixth scheme to represent a tinging globule or particle which has a greater refraction than the liquor in which it is containd let cd be a part of the pulse of light which is propagated through the containing medium this pulse will be a little stopt or impeded by the globule and so by that time the pulse is past to ef that part of it which has been impeded by passing through the globule will get but to lm and so that pulse which has been propagated through the globule to wit lm no pq will always come behind the pulses ef gh ik c  next by reason of the greater impediment in ab and its globular figure the rays that pass through it will be dispersd and very much scatterd whence ca and db which before went direct and parallel will after the refraction in ab diverge and spread by ap and bq so that as the rays do meet with more and more of these tinging particles in their way by so much the more will the pulse of light further lagg behind the clearer pulse or that which has fewer refractions and thence the deeper will the colour be and the fainter the light that is trajected through it for not onely many rays are reflected from the surfaces of ab but those rays that get through it are very much disordered  by this hypothesis there is no one experiment of colour that i have yet met with but may be i conceive very rationably solvd and perhaps had i time to examine several particulars requisite to the demonstration of it i might prove it more than probable for all the experiments about the changes and mixings of colours related in the treatise of colours published by the incomparable mr boyle and multitudes of others which i have observd do so easily and naturally flow from those principles that i am very apt to think it probable that they own their production to no other secundary cause as to instance in two or three experiments in the twentieth experiment this noble authour has shewn that the deep bluish purplecolour of violets may be turnd into a green by alcalizate salts and to a red by acid that is a purple consists of two colours a deep red and a deep blue when the blue is diluted or altered or destroyd by acid salts the red becomes predominant but when the red is diluted by alcalizate and the blue heightned there is generated a green for of a red diluted is made a yellow and yellow and blue make a green  now because the spurious pulses which cause a red and a blue do the one follow the clear pulse and the other precede it it usually follows that those saline refracting bodies which do dilute the colour of the one do deepen that of the other and this will be made manifest by almost all kinds of purples and many sorts of greens both these colours consisting of mixt colours for if we suppose a and a in the ninth figure to represent two pulses of clear light which follow each other at a convenient distance aa each of which has a spurious pulse preceding it as bb which makes a blue and another following it as cc which makes a red the one causd by tinging particles that have a greater refraction the other by others that have a less refracting quality then the liquor or menstruum in which these are dissolvd whatsoever liquor does so alter the refraction of the one without altering that of the other part of the tingd liquor must needs very much alter the colour of the liquor for if the refraction of the dissolvent be increasd and the refraction of the tinging particles not altered then will the preceding spurious pulse be shortned or stopt and not outrun the clear pulse so much so that bb will become ee and the blue be diluted whereas the other spurious pulse which follows will be made to lagg much more and be further behind aa than before and cc will become ff and so the yellow or red will be heightned  a saline liquor therefore mixt with another tingd liquor may alter the colour of it several ways either by altering the refraction of the liquor in which the colour swims or secondly by varying the refraction of the coloured particles by uniting more intimately either with some particular corpuscles of the tinging body or with all of them according as it has a congruity to some more especially or to all alike or thirdly by uniting and interweaving it self with some other body that is already joynd with the tinging particles with which substance it may have a congruity though it have very little with the particles themselves or fourthly it may alter the colour of a tingd liquor by disjoyning certain particles which were before united with the tinging particles which though they were somewhat congruous to these particles have yet a greater congruity with the newly infusd saline menstruum it may likewise alter the colour by further dissolving the tinging substance into smaller and smaller particles and so diluting the colour or by uniting several particles together as in precipitations and so deepning it and some such other ways which many experiments and comparisons of differing trials together might easily inform one of  from these principles applied may be made out all the varieties of colours observable either in liquors or any other tingd bodies with great ease and i hope intelligible enough there being nothing in the notion of colour or in the supposd production but is very conceivable and may be possible  the greatest difficulty that i find against this hypothesis is that there seem to be more distinct colours then two that is then yellow and blue this objection is grounded on this reason that there are several reds which diluted make not a saffron or pale yellow and therefore red or scarlet seems to be a third colour distinct from a deep degree of yellow  to which i answer that saffron affords us a deep scarlet tincture which may be diluted into as pale a yellow as any either by making a weak solution of the saffron by infusing a small parcel of it into a great quantity of liquor as in spirit of wine or else by looking through a very thin quantity of the tincture and which may be heightnd into the loveliest scarlet by looking through a very thick body of this tincture or through a thinner parcel of it which is highly impregnated with the tinging body by having had a greater quantity of the saffron dissolvd in a smaller parcel of the liquor  now though there may be some particles of other tinging bodies that give a lovely scarlet also which though diluted never so much with liquor or looked on through never so thin a parcel of tingd liquor will not yet afford a pale yellow but onely a kind of faint red yet this is no argument but that those tingd particles may have in them the faintest degree of yellow though we may be unable to make them exhibit it for that power of being diluted depending upon the divisibility of the tingd body if i am unable to make the tinging particles so thin as to exhibit that colour it does not therefore follow that the thing is impossible to be done now the tinging particles of some bodies are of such a nature that unless there be found some way of comminuting them into less bulks then the liquor does dissolve them into all the rays that pass through them must necessarily receive a tincture so deep as their appropriate refractions and bulks compard with the proprieties of the dissolving liquor must necessarily dispose them to empress which may perhaps be a pretty deep yellow or pale red  and that this is not gratis dictum i shall add one instance of this kind wherein the thing is most manifest  if you take blue smalt you shall find that to afford the deepest blue which c√¶teris paribus has the greatest particles or sands and if you further divide or grind those particles on a grindstone or porphyry stone you may by comminuting the sands of it dilute the blue into as pale a one as you please which you cannot do by laying the colour thin for wheresoever any single particle is it exhibits as deep a blue as the whole mass now there are other blues which though never so much ground will not be diluted by grinding because consisting of very small particles very deeply tingd they cannot by grinding be actually separated into smaller particles then the operation of the fire or some other dissolving menstruum reducd them to already  thus all kind of metalline colours whether precipitated sublimd calcind or otherwise prepard are hardly changd by grinding as ultra marine is not more diluted nor is vermilion or redlead made of a more faint colour by grinding for the smallest particles of these which i have viewd with my greatest magnifyingglass if they be well enlightned appear very deeply tingd with their peculiar colours nor though i have magnified and enlightned the particles exceedingly could i in many of them perceive them to be transparent or to be whole particles but the smallest specks that i could find among well ground vermilion and redlead seemd to be a red mass compounded of a multitude of less and less motes which sticking together composd a bulk not one thousand thousandth part of the smallest visible sand or mote  and this i find generally in most metalline colours that though they consist of parts so exceedingly small yet are they very deeply tingd they being so ponderous and having such a multitude of terrestrial particles throngd into a little room so that tis difficult to find any particle transparent or resembling a pretious stone though not impossible for i have observd divers such shining and resplendent colours intermixt with the particles of cinnaber both natural and artificial before it hath been ground and broken or flawd into vermilion as i have also in orpiment redlead and bise which makes me suppose that those metalline colours are by grinding not onely broken and separated actually into smaller pieces but that they are also flawd and brused whence they for the most part become opacous like flawd crystal or glass c but for smalts and verditures i have been able with a microscope to perceive their particles very many of them transparent  now that the others also may be transparent though they do not appear so to the microscope may be made probable by this experiment that if you take ammel that is almost opacous and grind it very well on a porphyry or serpentine the small particles will by reason of their flaws appear perfectly opacous and that tis the flaws that produce this opacousness may be argued from this that particles of the same ammel much thicker if unflawd will appear somewhat transparent even to the eye and from this also that the most transparent and clear crystal if heated in the fire and then suddenly quenched so that it be all over flawd will appear opacous and white  and that the particles of metalline colours are transparent may be argued yet further from this that the crystals or vitriols of all metals are transparent which since they consist of metalline as well as saline particles those metalline ones must be transparent which is yet further confirmd from this that they have for the most part appropriate colours so the vitriol of gold is yellow of copper blue and sometimes green of iron green of tinn and lead a pale white of silver a pale blue   and next the solution of all metals into menstruums are much the same with the vitriols or crystals it seems therefore very probable that those colours which are made by the precipitation of those particles out of the menstruums by transparent precipitating liquors should be transparent also thus gold precipitates with oyl of tartar or spirit of urine into a brown yellow copper with spirit of urine into a mucous blue which retains its transparency a solution of sublimate as the same illustrious authour i lately mentiond shews in his 40 experiment precipitates with oyl of tartar per deliquium into an orange colourd precipitate nor is it less probable that the calcination of those vitriols by the fire should have their particles transparent thus saccarum saturni or the vitriol of lead by calcination becomes a deep orangecolourd minium which is a kind of precipitation by some salt which proceeds from the fire common vitriol calcind yields a deep brown red etc  a third argument that the particles of metals are transparent is that being calcind and melted with glass they tinge the glass with transparent colours thus the calx of silver tinges the glass on which it is anneald with a lovely yellow or gold colour c  and that the parts of metals are transparent may be farther argued from the transparency of leafgold which held against the light both to the naked eye and the microscope exhibits a deep green and though i have never seen the other metals laminated so thin that i was able to perceive them transparent yet for copper and brass if we had the same conveniency for laminating them as we have for gold we might perhaps through such plates or leaves find very differing degrees of blue or green for it seems very probable that those rays that rebound from them tingd with a deep yellow or pale red as from copper or with a pale yellow as from brass have past through them for i cannot conceive how by reflection alone those rays can receive a tincture taking any hypothesis extant  so that we see there may a sufficient reason be drawn from these instances why those colours which we are unable to dilute to the palest yellow or blue or green are not therefore to be concluded not to be a deeper degree of them for supposing we had a great company of small globular essence bottles or round glass bubbles about the bigness of a walnut filld each of them with a very deep mixture of saffron and that every one of them did appear of a deep scarlet colour and all of them together did exhibit at a distance a deep dyd scarlet body it does not follow because after we have come nearer to this congeries or mass and divided it into its parts and examining each of its parts severally or apart we find them to have much the same colour with the whole mats it does not i say therefore follow that if we could break those globules smaller or any other ways come to see a smaller or thinner parcel of the tingd liquor that filld those bubbles that that tingd liquor must always appear red or of a scarlet hue since if experiment be made the quite contrary will ensue for it is capable of being diluted into the palest yellow  now that i might avoid all the objections of this kind by exhibiting an experiment that might by ocular proof convince those whom other reasons would not prevail with i provided me a prismatical glass made hollow just in the form of a wedge such as is represented in the tenth figure of the sixth scheme the two parallelogram sides abcd abef which met at a point were made of the clearest lookingglass plates well ground and polishd that i could get these were joynd with hard cement to the triangular sides bce adf which were of wood the parallelogram base bcef likewise was of wood joynd on to the rest with hard cement and the whole prismatical box was exactly stopt every where but onely a little hole near the base was left whereby the vessel could be filld with any liquor or emptied again at pleasure  one of these boxes for i had two of them i filld with a pretty deep tincture of aloes drawn onely with fair water and then stopt the hole with a piece of wax then by holding this wedge against the light and looking through it it was obvious enough to see the tincture of the liquor near the edge of the wedge where it was but very thin to be a pale but well colourd yellow and further and further from the edge as the liquor grew thicker and thicker this tincture appeard deeper and deeper so that near the blunt end which was seven inches from the edge and three inches and an half thick it was of a deep and well colourd red now the clearer and purer this tincture be the more lovely will the deep scarlet be and the fouler the tincture be the more dirty will the red appear so that some dirty tinctures have afforded their deepest red much of the colour of burnt oker or spanish brown others as lovely a colour as vermilion and some much brighter but several others according as the tinctures were worse or more foul exhibited various kinds of reds of very differing degrees  the other of these wedges i filld with a most lovely tincture of copper drawn from the filings of it with spirit of urine and this wedge held as the former against the light afforded all manner of blues from the faintest to the deepest so that i was in good hope by these two to have producd all the varieties of colours imaginable for i thought by this means to have been able by placing the two parallelogram sides together and the edges contrary ways to have so movd them to and fro one by another as by looking through them in several places and through several thicknesses i should have compounded and consequently have seen all those colours which by other like compositions of colours would have ensued  but insteed of meeting with what i lookd for i met with somewhat more admirable and that was that i found my self utterly unable to see through them when placed both together though they were transparent enough when asunder and though i could see through twice the thickness when both of them were filld with the same colourd liquors whether both with the yellow or both with the blue yet when one was filld with the yellow the other with the blue and both looked through they both appeard dark onely when the parts near the tops were lookd through they exhibited greens and those of very great variety as i expected but the purples and other colours i could not by any means make whether i endeavourd to look through them both against the sun or whether i placd them against the hole of a darkned room  but notwithstanding this misghessing i proceeded on with my trial in a dark room and having two holes near one another i was able by placing my wedges against them to mix the tingd rays that past through them and fell on a sheet of white paper held at a convenient distance from them as i pleasd so that i could make the paper appear of what colour i would by varying the thicknesses of the wedges and consequently the tincture of the rays that past through the two holes and sometimes also by varying the paper that is insteed of a white paper holding a gray or a black piece of paper  whence i experimentally found what i had before imagind that all the varieties of colours imaginable are producd from several degrees of these two colours namely yellow and blue or the mixture of them with light and darkness that is white and black and all those almost infinite varieties which limners and painters are able to make by compounding those several colours they lay on their shels or palads are nothing else but some compositum made up of some one or more or all of these four  now whereas it may here again be objected that neither can the reds be made out of the yellows added together or laid on in greater or less quantity nor can the yellows be made out of the reds though laid never so thin and as for the addition of white or black they do nothing but either whiten or darken the colours to which they are added and not at all make them of any other kind of colour as for instance vermilion by being temperd with white lead does not at all grow more yellow but onely there is made a whiter kind of red nor does yellow oker though laid never so thick produce the colour of vermilion nor though it be temperd with black does it at all make a red nay though it be temperd with white it will not afford a fainter kind of yellow such as masticut but onely a whitend yellow nor will the blues be diluted or deepned after the manner i speak of as indico will never afford so fine a blue as ultramarine or bise nor will it temperd with vermilion ever afford a green though each of them be never so much temperd with white  to which i answer that there is a great difference between diluting a colour and whitening of it for diluting a colour is to make the colourd parts more thin so that the tingd light which is made by trajecting those tingd bodies does not receive so deep a tincture but whitening a colour is onely an intermixing of many clear reflections of light among the same tingd parts deepning also and darkning or blacking a colour are very different for deepning a colour is to make the light pass through a greater quantity of the same tinging body and darkning or blacking a colour is onely interposing a multitude of dark or black spots among the same tingd parts or placing the colour in a more faint light  first therefore as to the former of these operations that is diluting and deepning most of the colours usd by the limners and painters are incapable of to wit vermilion and redlead and oker because the tingd parts are so exceeding small that the most curious grindstones we have are not able to separate them into parts actually divided so small as the tingd particles are for looking on the most curiously ground vermilion and oker and redlead i could perceive that even those small corpuscles of the bodies they left were compounded of many pieces that is they seemd to be small pieces compounded of a multitude of lesser tingd parts each piece seeming almost like a piece of red glass or tingd crystal all flawd so that unless the grindstone could actually divide them into smaller pieces then those flawd particles were which compounded that tingd mote i could see with my microscope it would be impossible to dilute the colour by grinding which because the finest we have will not reach to do in vermilion or oker therefore they cannot at all or very hardly be diluted  other colours indeed whose tingd particles are such as may be made smaller by grinding their colour may be diluted thus several of the blues may be diluted as smalt and bise and masticut which is yellow may be made more faint and even vermilion it self may by too much grinding be brought to the colour of redlead which is but an orange colour which is confest by all to be very much upon the yellow now though perhaps somewhat of this diluting of vermilion by overmuch grinding may be attributed to the grindstone or muller for that some of their parts may be worn off and mixt with the colour yet there seems not very much for i have done it on a serpentinestone with a muller made of a pebble and yet observd the same effect follow  and secondly as to the other of these operations on colours that is the deepning of them limners and painters colours are for the most part also uncapable for they being for the most part opacous and that opacousness as i said before proceeding from the particles being very much flawd unless we were able to joyn and reunite those flawd particles again into one piece we shall not be able to deepen the colour which since we are unable to do with most of the colours which are by painters accounted opacous we are therefore unable to deepen them by adding more of the same kind  but because all those opacous colours have two kinds of beams or rays reflected from them that is rays untingd which are onely reflected from the outward surface without at all penetrating of the body and tingd rays which are reflected from the inward surfaces or flaws after they have sufferd a twofold refraction and because that transparent liquors mixt with such corpuscles do for the most part take off the former kind of reflection therefore these colours mixt with water or oyl appear much deeper than when dry for most part of that white reflection from the outward surface is removd nay some of these colours are very much deepned by the mixture with some transparent liquor and that because they may perhaps get between those two flaws and so consequently joyn two or more of those flawd pieces together but this happens but in a very few  now to shew that all this is not gratis dictum i shall set down some experiments which do manifest these things to be probable and likely which i have here deliverd  for first if you take any tingd liquor whatsoever especially if it be pretty deeply tingd and by any means work it into a froth the congeries of that froth shall seem an opacous body and appear of the same colour but much whiter than that of the liquor out of which it is made for the abundance of reflections of the rays against those surfaces of the bubbles of which the froth consists does so often rebound the rays backwards that little or no light can pass through and consequently the froth appears opacous  again if to any of these tingd liquors that will endure the boiling there be added a small quantity of fine flower the parts of which through the microscope are plainly enough to be perceivd to consist of transparent corpuscles and sufferd to boyl till it thicken the liquor the mass of the liquor will appear opacous and tingd with the same colour but very much whitend  thus if you take a piece of transparent glass that is well colourd and by heating it and then quenching it in water you flaw it all over it will become opacous and will exhibit the same colour with which the piece is tingd but fainter and whiter  or if you take a pipe of this transparent glass and in the flame of a lamp melt it and then blow it into very thin bubbles then break those bubbles and collect a good parcel of those lamin√¶ together in a paper you shall find that a small thickness of those plates will constitute an opacous body and that you may see through the mass of glass before it be thus laminated above four times the thickness and besides they will now afford a colour by reflection as other opacous as they are calld colours will but much fainter and whiter than that of the lump or pipe out of which they were made  thus also if you take putty and melt it with any transparent colourd glass it will make it become an opacous colourd lump and to yield a paler and whiter colour than the lump by reflection  the same thing may be done by a preparation of antimony as has been shewn by the learned physician dr cm in his excellent observations and notes on nerys art of glass and by this means all transparent colours become opacous or ammels and though by being ground they lose very much of their colour growing much whiter by reason of the multitude of single reflections from their outward surface as i shewd afore yet the fire that in the nealing or melting reunites them and so renews those spurious reflections removes also those whitenings of the colour that proceed from them  as for the other colours which painters use which are transparent and usd to varnish over all other paintings tis well enough known that the laying on of them thinner or thicker does very much dilute or deepen their colour  painters colours therefore consisting most of them of solid particles so small that they cannot be either reunited into thicker particles by any art yet known and consequently cannot be deepned or divided into particles so small as the flawd particles that exhibit that colour much less into smaller and consequently cannot be diluted it is necessary that they which are to imitate all kinds of colours should have as many degrees of each colour as can be procurd  and to this purpose both limners and painters have a very great variety both of yellows and blues besides several other colourd bodies that exhibit very compounded colours such as greens and purples and others that are compounded of several degrees of yellow or several degrees of blue sometimes unmixt and sometimes compounded with several other colourd bodies  the yellows from the palest to the deepest red or scarlet which has no intermixture of blue are pale and deep masticut orpament english oker brown oker red lead and vermilion burnt english oker and burnt brown oker which last have a mixture of dark or dirty parts with them c  their blues are several kinds of smalts and verditures and bise and ultramarine and indico which last has many dirty or dark parts intermixt with it  their compounded colourd bodies as pink and verdigrese which are greens the one a popingay the other a seagreen then lac which is a very lovely purple  to which may be added their black and white which they also usually call colours of each of which they have several kinds such as bone black made of ivory burnt in a close vessel and blue black made of the small coal of willow or some other wood and cullens earth which is a kind of brown black c their usual whites are either artificial or natural white lead the last of which is the best they yet have and with the mixing and tempering these colours together are they able to make an imitation of any colour whatsoever their reds or deep yellows they can dilute by mixing pale yellows with them and deepen their pale by mixing deeper with them for it is not with opacous colours as it is with transparent where by adding more yellow to yellow it is deepned but in opacous diluted they can whiten any colour by mixing white with it and darken any colour by mixing black or some dark and dirty colour and in a word most of the colours or colourd bodies they use in limning and painting are such as though mixt with any other of their colours they preserve their own hue and by being in such very smal parts dispersd through the other colourd bodies they both or altogether represent to the eye a compositum of all the eye being unable by reason of their smalness to distinguish the peculiarly colourd particles but receives them as one intire compositum whereas in many of these the microscope very easily distinguishes each of the compounding colours distinct and exhibiting its own colour  thus have i by gently mixing vermilion and bise dry producd a very fine purple or mixt colour but looking on it with the microscope i could easily distinguish both the red and the blue particles which did not at all produce the phantasm of purple  to summ up all therefore in a word i have not yet found any solid colourd body that i have yet examind perfectly opacous but those that are least transparent are metalline and mineral bodies whose particles generally seeming either to be very small or very much flawd appear for the most part opacous though there are very few of them that i have lookd on with a microscope that have not very plainly or circumstantially manifested themselves transparent  and indeed there seem to be so few bodies in the world that are in minimis opacous that i think one may make it a rational query whether there be any body absolutely thus opacous for i doubt not at all and i have taken notice of very many circumstances that make me of this mind that could we very much improve the microscope we might be able to see all those bodies very plainly transparent which we now are fain onely to ghess at by circumstances nay the object glasses we yet make use of are such that they make many transparent bodies to the eye seem opacous through them which if we widen the aperture a little and cast more light on the objects and not charge the glasses so deep will again disclose their transparency  now as for all kinds of colours that are dissolvable in water or other liquors there is nothing so manifest as that all those tingd liquors are transparent and many of them are capable of being diluted and compounded or mixt with other colours and divers of them are capable of being very much changd and heightned and fixt with several kinds of saline menstruums others of them upon compounding destroy or vitiate each others colours and precipitate or otherwise very much alter each others tincture in the true ordering and diluting and deepning and mixing and fixing of each of which consists one of the greatest mysteries of the dyers of which particulars because our microscope affords us very little information i shall add nothing more at present but onely that with a very few tinctures orderd and mixt after certain ways too long to be here set down i have been able to make an appearance of all the various colours imaginable without at all using the help of salts or saline menstruums to vary them  as for the mutation of colours by saline menstruums they have already been so fully and excellently handled by the lately mentiond incomparable authour that i can add nothing but that of a multitude of trials that i made i have found them exactly to agree with his rules and theories and though there may be infinite instances yet may they be reducd under a few heads and comprisd within a very few rules and generally i find that saline menstruums are most operative upon those colours that are purple or have some degree of purple in them and upon the other colours much less the spurious pulses that compose which being as i formerly noted so very neer the middle between the true ones that a small variation throws them both to one side or both to the other and so consequently must make a vast mutation in the formerly appearing colour                                        observ xi of figures observd in small sand  sand generally seems to be nothing else but exceeding small pebbles or at least some very small parcels of a bigger stone the whiter kind seems through the microscope to consist of small transparent pieces of some pellucid body each of them looking much like a piece of alum or salt gem and this kind of sand is angled for the most part irregularly without any certain shape and the granules of it are for the most part flawd through amongst many of them it is not difficult to find some that are perfectly pellucid like a piece of clear crystal and divers likewise most curiously shapd much after the manner of the bigger stiri√¶ of crystal or like the small diamants i observd in certain flints of which i shall by and by relate which last particular seems to argue that this kind of sand is not made by the comminution of greater transparent crystaline bodies but by the concretion or coagulation of water or some other fluid body  there are other kinds of courser sands which are browner and have their particles much bigger these viewd with a microscope seem much courser and more opacous substances and most of them are of some irregularly rounded figures and though they seem not so opacous as to the naked eye yet they seem very foul and cloudy but neither do these want curiously transparent no more than they do regularly figurd and well colourd particles as i have often found  there are multitudes of other kinds of sands which in many particulars plainly enough discoverable by the microscope differ both from these last mentiond kinds of sands and from one another there seeming to be as great variety of sands as there is of stones and as amongst stones some are calld precious from their excellency so also are there sands which deserve the same epithite for their beauty for viewing a small parcel of eastindia sand which was given me by my highly honoured friend mr daniel colwall and since that another parcel much of the same kind i found several of them both very transparent like precious stones and regularly figurd like crystal cornish diamants some rubies c and also tingd with very lively and deep colours like rubys saphyrs emeralds c these kinds of granuls i have often found also in english sand and tis easie to make such a counterfeit sand with deeply tingd glass enamels and painters colours  it were endless to describe the multitudes of figures i have met with in these kind of minute bodies such as spherical oval pyramidal conical prismatical of each of which kinds i have taken notice  but amongst many others i met with none more observable than this pretty shell described in the figure x of the fifth scheme which though as it was light on by chance deservd to have been omitted i being unable to direct any one to find the like yet for its rarity was it not inconsiderable especially upon the account of the information it may afford us for by it we have a very good instance of the curiosity of nature in another kind of animals which are removd by reason of their minuteness beyond the reach of our eyes so that as there are several sorts of insects as mites and others so small as not yet to have had any names some of which i shall afterwards describe and small fishes as leeches in vineger and smal vegetables as moss and roseleaveplants and small mushroms as mould so are there it seems small shelfish likewise nature shewing her curiosity in every tribe of animals vegetables and minerals  i was trying several small and single magnifying glasses and casually viewing a parcel of white sand when i perceivd one of the grains exactly shapd and wreathd like a shell but endeavouring to distinguish it with my naked eye it was so very small that i was fain again to make use of the glass to find it then whilest i thus lookd on it with a pin i separated all the rest of the granules of sand and found it afterwards to appear to the naked eye an exceeding small white spot no bigger than the point of a pin afterwards i viewd it every way with a better microscope and found it on both sides and edgeways to resemble the shell of a small watersnail with a flat spiral shell it had twelve wreathings a b c d e c all very proportionably growing one less than another toward the middle or center of the shell where there was a very small round white spot i could not certainly discover whether the shell were hollow or not but it seemd filld with somewhat and tis probable that it might be petrifyd as other larger shels often are such as are mentiond in the seventeenth observation                                        observ xii of gravel in urine  i have often observd the sand or gravel of urine which seems to be a tartareous substance generated out of a saline and a terrestrial substance crystallizd together in the form of tartar sometimes sticking to the sides of the urinal but for the most part sinking to the bottom and there lying in the form of coorse common sand these through the microscope appear to be a company of small bodies partly transparent and partly opacous some white some yellow some red others of more brown and duskie colours  the figure of them is for the most part flat in the manner of slats or such like plated stones that is each of them seem to be made up of several other thinner plates much like muscovie glass or englsh sparr to the last of which the white plated gravel seems most likely for they seem not onely plated like that but their sides shapd also into rhombs rhomboeids and sometimes into rectangles and squares their bigness and figure may be seen in the second figure of the seventh plate which represents about a dozen of them lying upon a plate abcd some of which as a b c d seemd more regular than the rest and e which was a small one sticking on the top of another was a perfet rhomboeid on the top and had four rectangular sides  the line e which was the the measure of the microscope is 132 part of an english inch so that the greatest bredth of any of them exceeded not 1128 part of an inch  putting these into several liquors i found oyl of vitriol spirit of urine and several other saline menstruums to dissolve them and the first of these in less than a minute without ebullition water and several other liquors had no sudden operation upon them this i mention because those liquors that dissolve them first make them very white not vitiating but rather rectifying their figure and thereby make them afford a very pretty object for the microscope  how great an advantage it would be to such as are troubled with the stone to find some menstruum might dissolve them without hurting the bladder is easily imagind since some injections made of such bodies might likewise dissolve the stone which seems much of the same nature  it may therefore perhaps be worthy some physicians enquiry whether there may not be something mixt with the urine in which the gravel or stone lies which may again make it dissolve it the first of which seems by its regular figures to have been sometimes crystallizd out of it for whether this crystallization be made in the manner as alum peter c are crystallized out of a cooling liquor in which by boyling they have been dissolvd or whether it be made in the manner of tartarum vitriolatum that is by the coalition of an acid and a sulphureous substance it seems not impossible but that the liquor it lies in may be again made a dissolvent of it but leaving these inquiries to physicians or chymists to whom it does more properly belong i shall proceed                                        observ xiii of the small diamants or sparks in flints  chancing to break a flint stone in pieces i found within it a certain cavity all crusted over with a very pretty candied substance some of the parts of which upon changing the posture of the stone in respect of the incident light exhibited a number of small but very vivid reflections and having made use of my microscope i could perceive the whole surface of that cavity to be all beset with a multitude of little crystaline or adamantine bodies so curiously shapd that it afforded a not unpleasing object  having considered those vivid repercussions of light i found them to be made partly from the plain external surface of these regularly figured bodies which afforded the vivid reflexions and partly to be made from within the somewhat pellucid body that is from some surface of the body opposite to that superficies of it which was next the eye  and because these bodies were so small that i could not well come to make experiments and examinations of them i provided me several small stiri√¶ of crystals or diamants found in great quantities in cornwall and are therefore commonly called cornish diamants these being very pellucid and growing in a hollow cavity of a rock as i have been several times informed by those that have observd them much after the same manner as these do in the flint and having besides their outward surface very regularly shapd retaining very near the same figures with some of those i observd in the other became a convenient help to me for the examination of the proprieties of those kinds of bodies  and first for the reflections in these i found it very observable that the brightest reflections of light proceeded from within the pellucid body that is that the rays admitted through the pellucid substance in their getting out on the opposite side were by the contiguous and strong reflecting surface of the air very vividly reflected so that more rays were reflected to the eye by this surface though the ray in entring and getting out of the crystal had sufferd a double refraction than there were from the outward surface of the glass where the ray had sufferd no reflection at all  and that this was the surface of the air that gave so vivid a repercussion i tryd by this means i sunk half of a stiria in water so that only water was contiguous to the under surface and then the internal reflection was so exceedingly faint that it was scarce discernable again i tryd to alter this vivid reflection by keeping off the air with a body not fluid and that was by rubbing and holding my finger very hard against the under surface so as in many places the pulp of my finger did touch the glass without any interjacent air between then observing the reflection i found that wheresoever my finger or skin toucht the surface from that part there was no reflection but in the little furrows or creases of my skin where there remaind little small lines of air from them was returnd a very vivid reflection as before i tryd further by making the surface of very pure quicksilver to be contiguous to the under surface of this pellucid body and then the reflection from that was so exceedingly more vivid than from the air as the reflection from air was than the reflection from the water from all which trials i plainly saw that the strong reflecting air was the cause of this ph√¶nomenon  and this agrees very well with the hypothesis of light and pellucid bodies which i have mentiond in the description of muscovyglass for we there suppose glass to be a medium which does less resist the pulse of light and consequently that most of the rays incident on it enter into it and are refracted towards the perpendicular whereas the air i suppose to be a body that does more resist it and consequently more are repercussd then do enter it the same kind of trials have i made with crystalline glass with drops of fluid bodies and several other ways which do all seem to agree very exactly with this theory so that from this principle well establishd we may deduce severall corollaries not unworthy observation  and the first is that it plainly appears by this that the production of the rainbow is as much to be ascribed to the reflection of the concave surface of the air as to the refraction of the globular drops this will be evidently manifest by these experiments if you foliate that part of a glassball that is to reflect an iris as in the cartesian experiment above mentiond the reflections will be abundantly more strong and the colours more vivid and if that part of the surface be touchd with water scarce affords any sensible colour at all  next we learn that the great reason why pellucid bodies beaten small are white is from the multitude of reflections not from the particles of the body but from the contiguous surface of the air and this is evidently manifested by filling the interstitia of those powderd bodies with water whereby their whiteness presently disappears from the same reason proceeds the whiteness of many kinds of sands which in the microscope appear to be made up of a multitude of little pellucid bodies whose brightest reflections may by the microscope be plainly perceivd to come from their internal surfaces and much of the whiteness of it may be destroyd by the affusion of fair water to be contiguous to those surfaces  the whiteness also of froth is for the most part to be ascribed to the reflection of the light from the surface of the air within the bubbles and very little to the reflection from the surface of the water it self for this last reflection does not return a quarter so many rays as that which is made from the surface of the air as i have certainly found by a multitude of observations and experiments  the whiteness of linnen paper silk c proceeds much from the same reason as the microscope will easily discover for the paper is made up of an abundance of pellucid bodies which afford a very plentifull reflection from within that is from the concave surface of the air contiguous to its component particles wherefore by the affusion of water oyl tallow turpentine c all those reflections are made more faint and the beams of light are sufferd to traject  run through the paper more freely  hence further we may learn the reason of the whiteness of many bodies and by what means they maybe in part made pellucid as white marble for instance for this body is composed of a pellucid body exceedingly flawd that is there are abundance of thin and very fine cracks or chinks amongst the multitude of particles of the body that contain in them small parcels of air which do so repercuss and drive back the penetrating beams that they cannot enter very deep within that body which the microscope does plainly inform us to be made up of a congeries of pellucid particles and i further found it somewhat more evidently by some attempts i made towards the making transparent marble for by heating the stone a little and baking it in oyl turpentine oyl of turpentine c i found that i was able to see much deeper into the body of marble then before and one trial which was not with an unctuous substance succeeded better than the rest of which when i have a better opportunity i shall make further trial  this also gives us a probable reason of the so much admired ph√¶nomena of the oculus mundi an oval stone which commonly looks like white alabaster but being laid a certain time in water it grows pellucid and transparent and being sufferd to lie again dry it by degrees loses that transparency and becomes white as before for the stone being of a hollow spongie nature has in the first and last of these appearances all those pores filld with the obtunding and reflecting air whereas in the second all those pores are filld with a medium that has much the same refraction with the particles of the stone and therefore those two being contiguous make as twere one continued medium of which more is said in the 15 observation  there are a multitude of other ph√¶nomena that are producd from this same principle which as it has not been taken notice of by any yet that i know so i think upon more diligent observation will it not be found the least considerable but i have here onely time to hint hypotheses and not to prosecute them so fully as i could wish many of them having a vast extent in the production of a multitude of ph√¶nomena which have been by others either not attempted to be explaind or else attributed to some other cause than what i have assignd and perhaps than the right and therefore i shall leave this to the prosecution of such as have more leisure onely before i leave it i must not pretermit to hint that by this principle multitudes of the ph√¶nomena of the air as about mists clouds meteors haloes c are most plainly and perhaps truly explicable multitudes also of the ph√¶nomena in colourd bodies as liquors c are deducible from it  and from this i shall proceed to a second considerable ph√¶nomenon which these diamants exhibit and that is the regularity of their figure which is a propriety not less general than the former it comprising within its extent all kinds of metals all kinds of minerals most precious stones all kinds of salts multitudes of earths and almost all kinds of fluid bodies and this is another propiety which though a little superficially taken notice of by some has not that i know been so much as attempted to be explicated by any  this propriety of bodies as i think it the most worthy and next in order to be considerd after the contemplation of the globular figure so have i long had a desire as wel as a determination to have prosecuted it if i had had an opportunity having long since proposd to my self the method of my enquiry therein it containing all the allurements that i think any enquiry is capable of for first i take it to proceed from the most simple principle that any kind of form can come from next the globular which was therefore the first i set upon and what i have therein performd i leave the judicious reader to determine for as that form proceeded from a propiety of fluid bodies which i have calld congruity or incongruity so i think had i time and opportunity i could make probable that all these regular figures that are so conspicuously various and curious and do so adorn and beautifie such multitudes of bodies as i have above hinted arise onely from three or four several positions or postures of globular particles and those the most plain obvious and necessary conjunctions of such figurd particles that are possible so that supposing such and such plain and obvious causes concurring the coagulating particles must necessarily compose a body of such a determinate regular figure and no other and this with as much necessity and obviousness as a fluid body encompast with a heterogeneous fluid must be protruded into a spherule or globe and this i have ad oculum demonstrated with a company of bullets and some few other very simple bodies so that there was not any regular figure which i have hitherto met withall of any of those bodies that i have above named that i could not with the composition of bullets or globules and one or two other bodies imitate even almost by shaking them together and thus for instance may we find that the globular bullets will of themselves if put on an inclining plain so that they may run together naturally run into a triangular order composing all the variety of figures that can be imagind to be made out of √¶quilateral triangles and such will you find upon trial all the surfaces of alum to be composd of for three bullets lying on a plain as close to one another as they can compose an √¶quilaterotriangular form as in a in the 7 scheme if a fourth be joynd to them on either side as closely as it can they four compose the most regular rhombus consisting of two √¶quilateral triangles as b if a fifth be joynd to them on either side in as close a position as it can which is the propriety of the texture it makes a trapezium or foursided figure two of whole angles are 120 and two 60 degrees as c if a sixth be added as before either it makes an √¶quilateral triangle as d or a rhomboeid as e or an hexangular figure as f which is composd of two primary rhombes if a seventh be added it makes either an √¶quilaterohexagonal figure as g or some kind of sixsided figure as h or i and though there be never so many placed together they may be rangd into some of these lately mentioned figures all the angles of which will be either 60 degrees or 120 as the figure k which is an √¶quiangular hexagonal figure is compounded of 12 globules or may be of 25 or 27 or 36 or 42 c and by these kinds of texture or position of globular bodies may you find out all the variety of regular shapes into which the smooth surfaces of alum are formd as upon examination any one may easily find nor does it hold only in superficies but in solidity also for its obvious that a fourth globule laid upon the third in this texture composes a regular tetrahedron which is a very usual figure of the crystals of alum and to hasten there is no one figure into which alum is observd to be crystallized but may by this texture of globules be imitated and by no other  i could instance also in the figure of seasalt and salgem that it is composd of a texture of globules placed in a cubical form as l and that all the figures of those salts may be imitated by this texture of globules and by no other whatsoever and that the forms of vitriol and of saltpeter as also of crystal horefrost c are compounded of these two textures but modulated by certain proprieties but i have not here time to insist upon as i have not neither to shew by what means globules come to be thus context and what those globules are and many other particulars requisite to a full and intelligible explication of this propriety of bodies nor have i hitherto found indeed an opportunity of prosecuting the inquiry so farr as i designd nor do i know when i may it requiring abundance of time and a great deal of assistance to go through with what i designd the model of which was this  first to get as exact and full a collection as i could of all the differing kinds of geometrical figurd bodies some three or four several bodies of each kind  secondly with them to get as exact a history as possibly i could learn of their places of generation or finding and to enquire after as many circumstances that tended to the illustrating of this enquiry as possibly i could observe  thirdly to make as many trials as upon experience i could find requisite in dissolutions and coagulations of several crystallizing salts for the needfull instruction and information in this enquiry  fourthly to make several trials on divers other bodies as metals minerals and stones by dissolving them in several menstruums and crystalizing them to see what figures would arise from those several compositums  fifthly to make compositions and coagulations of several salts together into the same mass to observe of what figure the product of them would be and in all to note as many circumstances as i should judge conducive to my enquiry  sixthly to enquire the closeness or rarity of the texture of these bodies by examining their gravity and their refraction c  seventhly to enquire particularly what operations the fire has upon several kinds of salts what changes it causes in their figures textures or energies  eighthly to examine their manner of dissolution or acting upon those bodies dissoluble in them the texture of those bodies before and after the process and this for the history  next for the solution to have examind by what and how many means such and such figures actions and effects could be producd possibly  and lastly from all circumstances well weighd i should have endeavoured to have shewn which of them was most likely and if the informations by these enquiries would have born it to have demonstrated which of them it must be and was  but to proceed as i believe it next to the globular the most simple so do i in the second place judge it not less pleasant for that which makes an enquiry pleasant are first a noble inventum that promises to crown the successfull endeavour and such must certainly the knowledge of the efficient and concurrent causes of all these curious geometrical figures be which has made the philosophers hitherto to conclude nature in these things to play the geometrician according to that saying of plato greek ho theos geometrei or next a great variety of matter in the enquiry and here we meet with nothing less than the mathematicks of nature having every day a new figure to contemplate or a variation of the same in another body  which do afford us a third thing which will yet more sweeten the enquiry and that is a multitude of information we are not so much to grope in the dark as in most other enquiries where the inventum is great for having such a multitude of instances to compare and such easie ways of generating or compounding and of destroying the form as in the solution and crystallization of salts we cannot but learn plentifull information to proceed by and this will further appear from the universality of the principle which nature has made use of almost in all inanimate bodies and therefore as the contemplation of them all conduces to the knowledg of any one so from a scientifical knowledge of any one does follow the fame of all and every one  and fourthly for the usefulness of this knowledge when acquird certainly none can doubt that considers that it caries us a step forward into the labirinth of nature in the right way towards the end we propose our selves in all philosophical enquiries so that knowing what is the form of inanimate or mineral bodies we shall be the better able to proceed in our next enquiry after the forms of vegetative bodies and last of all of animate ones that seeming to be the highest step of natural knowledge that the mind of man is capable of                                        observ xiv of several kindes of frozen figures  i have very often in a morning when there has been a great hoarfrost with an indifferently magnifying microscope observd the small stiri√¶ or crystalline beard which then usually covers the face of most bodies that lie open to the cold air and found them to be generally hexangular prismatical bodies much like the long crystals of saltpeter save onely that the ends of them were differing for whereas those of nitre are for the most part pyramidal being terminated either in a point or edge these of frost were hollow and the cavity in some seemd pretty deep and this cavity was the more plainly to be seen because usually one or other of the six parallelogram sides was wanting or at least much shorter then the rest  but this was onely the figure of the bearded hoarfrost and as for the particles of other kinds of hoarfrosts they seemd for the most part irregular or of no certain figure nay the parts of those curious branchings or vortices that usually in cold weather tarnish the surface of glass appear through the microscope very rude and unshapen as do most other kinds of frozen figures which to the naked eye seem exceeding neat and curious such as the figures of snow frozen urine hail several figures frozen in common water c some observations of each of which i shall hereunto annex because if well considerd and examind they may perhaps prove very instructive for the finding out of what i have endeavoured in the preceding observation to shew to be next the globular figure which is causd by congruity as i hope i have made probable in the sixth observation the most simple and plain operation of nature of which notwithstanding we are yet ignorant  i  several observables in the sixbranched figures formd on the surface of urine by freezing  1 11the figures were all frozen almost even with the surface of the urine in the vessel but the bigger stems were a little prominent above that surface and the parts of those stems which were nearest the center a were biggest above the surface  2 i have observd several kinds of these figures some smaller no bigger then a twopence others so bigg that i have by measure found one of its stems or branches above four foot long and of these some were pretty round having all their branches pretty neer alike other of them were more extended towards one side as usually those very large ones were which i have observd in ditches which have been full of foul water  3 none of all these figures i have yet taken notice of had any regular position in respect of one another or of the sides of the vessel nor did i find any of them equally to exactness extended every way from the center a  4 where ever there was a center the branchings from it ab ac ad ae af ag were never fewer or more then six which usually concurrd or met one another very neer in the same point or center a though oftentimes not exactly and were enclind to each other by an angle of very near sixty degrees i say very neer because though having endeavoured to measure them the most acurately i was able with the largest compasses i had i could not find any sensible variation from that measure yet the whole sixbranched figure seeming to compose a solid angle they must necessarily be somewhat less  5 the middle lines or stems of these branches ab ac ad ae af ag seemd somewhat whiter and a little higher then any of the intermediate branchings of these figures and the center a was the most prominent part of the whole figure seeming the apex of a solid angle or pyramid each of the six plains being a little enclind below the surface of the urin  6 the lateral branchings issuing out of the great ones such as op mq c were each of them inclind to the great ones by the same angle of about sixty degrees as the great ones were one to another and always the bigger branchings were prominent above the less and the less above the least by proportionate gradations  7 the lateral branches shooting out of the great ones went all of them from the center and each of them was parallel to that great branch next to which it lay so that as all the branches on one side were parallel to one another so were they all of them to the approximate great branch as po qr as they were parallel to each other and shot from the center so were they parallel also to the great branch ab  8 some of the stems of the six branches proceeded straight and of a thickness that gradually grew sharper towards the end as ag  9 others of the stems of those branches grew bigger and knotty towards the middle and the branches also as well as stems from cylinders grew into plates in a most admirable and curious order so exceeding regular and delicate as nothing could be more as is visible in ab ac ad ae af but towards the end of some of these stems they began again to grow smaller and to recover their former branchings as about k and n  10 many of the lateral branches had collateral branches if i may so call them as qm had many such as st and most of those again subcollateral as vw and these again had others less which one may call laterosubcollateral and these again others and they others c in greater figures  11 the branchings of the main stems joynd not together by any regular line nor did one side of the one lie over the other side of the other but the small collateral and subcollateral branches did lie at top of one another according to a certain order or method which i always observd to be this  12 that side of a collateral or subcollateral c branch lay over the side of the approximate as the feathers in the wing of a bird whose branchings proceeded parallel to the last biggest stem from which it sprung and not to the biggest stem of all unless that were a second stem backwards  13 this rule that held in the branchings of the sexangular figure held also in the branchings of any other great or small stem though it did not proceed from a center  14 the exactness and curiosity of the figuration of these branches was in every particular so transcendent that i judge it almost impossible for humane art to imitate  15 tasting several cleer pieces of this ice i could not find any urinous taste in them but those few i tasted seemd as insipid as water  16 a figuration somewhat like this though indeed in some particulars much more curious i have several times observd in regulus martis stellatus but with this difference that all the stems and branchings are bended in a most excellent and regular order whereas in ice the stems and branchings are streight but in all other particulars it agrees with this and seems indeed nothing but one of these stars or branched figures frozen on urine distorted or wreathed a little with a certain proportion lead also that has arsenick and some other things mixt with it i have found to have its surface when sufferd to cool figured somewhat like the branchings of urine but much smaller  17 but there is a vegetable which does exceedingly imitate these branches and that is fearn where the main stem may be observd to shoot out branches and the stems of each of these lateral branches to send forth collateral and those subcollateral and those laterosubcollateral c and all those much after the same order with the branchings divisions and subdivisions in the branchings of these figures in frozen urine so that if the figures of both be well considerd one would ghess that there were not much greater need of a seminal principle for the production of fearn then for the production of the branches of urine or the stella martis there seeming to be as much form and beauty in the one as in the other  and indeed this plant of fearn if all particulars be well considerd will seem of as simple and uncompounded a form as any vegetable next to mould or mushromes and would next after the invention of the forms of those deserve to be enquird into for notwithstanding several have affirmd it to have seed and to be propagated thereby yet though i have made very diligent enquiry after that particular i cannot find that there is any part of it that can be imagind to be more seminal then another but this onely here by the by  for the freezing figures in urine i found it requisite  first that the superficies be not disturbed with any wind or other commotion of the air or the like  secondly that it be not too long exposed so as that the whole bulk be frozen for oftentimes in such cases by reason of the swelling the of ice or from some other cause the curious branched figures disappear  thirdly an artificial freezing with snow and salt applyd to the outside of the containing vessel succeeds not well unless there be a very little quantity in the vessel  fourthly if you take any cleer and smooth glass and wetting all the inside of it with urine you expose it to a very sharp freezing you will find it coverd with a very regular and curious figure  ii  observables in figurd snow  exposing a piece of black cloth or a black hatt to the falling snow i have often with great pleasure observd such an infinite variety of curiously figurd snow that it would be as impossible to draw the figure and shape of every one of them as to imitate exactly the curious and geometrical mechanisme of nature in any one some coorse draughts such as the coldness of the weather and the ill provisions i had by me for such a purpose would permit me to make i have here added in the second figure of the eighth scheme12  in all which i observd that if they were of any regular figures they were always branched out with six principal branches all of equal length shape and make from the center being each of them inclind to either of the next branches on either side of it by an angle of sixty degrees  now as all these stems were for the most part in one flake exactly of the same make so were they in differing figures of very differing ones so that in a very little time i have observd above an hundred several cizes and shapes of these starry flakes  the branches also out of each stem of any one of these flakes were exactly alike in the same flake so that of whatever figure one of the branches were the other five were sure to be of the same very exactly that is if the branchings of the one were small perallelipipeds or plates the branchings of the other five were of the same and generally the branchings were very conformable to the rules and method observd before in the figures on urine that is the branchings from each side of the stems were parallel to the next stem on that side and if the stems were plated the branches also were the same if the stems were very long the branches also were so c  observing some of these figurd flakes with a microscope i found them not to appear so curious and exactly figurd as one would have imagind but like artificial figures the bigger they were magnifyd the more irregularites appeard in them but this irregularity seemd ascribable to the thawing and breaking of the flake by the fall and not at all to the defect of the plastick virtue of nature whose curiosity in the formation of most of these kind of regular figures such as those of salt minerals c appears by the help of the microscope to be very many degrees smaller then the most acute eye is able to perceive without it and though one of these sixbranched stars appeard here below much of the shape described in the third figure of the eighth scheme yet i am very apt to think that could we have a sight of one of them through a microscope as they are generated in the clouds before their figures are vitiated by external accidents they would exhibit abundance of curiosity and neatness there also though never so much magnifyd for since i have observd the figures of salts and minerals to be some of them so exceeding small that i have scarcely been able to perceive them with the microscope and yet have they been regular and since as far as i have yet examind it there seems to be but one and the same cause that produces both these effects i think it not irrational to suppose that these pretty figurd stars of snow when at first generated might be also very regular and exact  iii  several kinds of figures in water frozen  putting fair water into a large capacious vessel of glass and exposing it to the cold i observd after a little time several broad flat and thin lamin√¶ or plates of ice crossing the bulk of the water and one another very irregularly onely most of them seemd to turn one of their edges towards that side of the glass which was next it and seemd to grow as twere from the inside of the vessel inwards towards the middle almost like so many blades of fern having taken several of these plates out of water on the blade of a knife i observd them figurd much after the manner of herring bones or fern blades that is there was one bigger stem in the middle like the backbone and out of it on either side were a multitude of small stiri√¶ or icicles like the smaller bones or the smaller branches in fern each of these branches on the one side were parallel to all the rest on the same side and all of them seemd to make an angle with the stem towards the top of sixty degrees and towards the bottom or root of this stem of 120 see the fourth figure of the 8 plate  i observd likewise several very pretty varieties of figures in water frozen on the top of a broad flat marblestone exposd to the cold with a little water on it some like feathers some of other shapes many of them were very much of the shape exprest in the fifth figure of the 8 scheme which is extremely differing from any of the other figures  i observd likewise that the shootings of ice on the top of water beginning to freez were in streight prismatical bodies much like those of rochpeter that they crost each other usually without any kind of order or rule that they were always a little higher then the surface of the water that lay between them that by degrees those interjacent spaces would be filld with ice also which usually would be as high as the surface of the rest  in flakes of ice that had been frozen on the top of water to any considerable thickness i observd that both the upper and the under sides of it were curiously quilld furrowd or graind as it were which when the sun shone on the plate was exceeding easily to be perceivd to be much after the shape of the lines in the 6 figure of the 8 scheme that is they consisted of several streight ends of parallel plates which were of divers lengths and angles to one another without any certain order  the cause of all which regular figures and of hundreds of others namely of salts minerals metals c which i could have here inserted would it not have been too long seems to be deducible from the same principles which i have in the 13 observation hinted only having not yet had time to compleat a theory of them but indeed which i there also hinted i judge it the second step by which the pyramid of natural knowledge which is the knowledge of the form of bodies is to be ascended and whosoever will climb it must be well furnishd with that which the noble verulam calls scalam intellectus he must have scaling ladders otherwise the steps are so large and high there will be no getting up them and consequently little hopes of attaining any higher station such as to the knowledge of the most simple principle of vegetation manifested in mould and mushromes which as i elsewhere endeavoured to shew seems to be the third step for it seems to me that the intellect of man is like his body destitute of wings and cannot move from a lower to a higher and more sublime station of knowledg otherwise then step by step nay even there where the way is prepard and already made passible as in the elements of geometry or the like where it is fain to climb a whole series of propositions by degrees before it attains the knowledge of one probleme but if the ascent be high difficult and above its reach it must have recourse to a novum organum some new engine and contrivance some new kind of algebra or analytick art before it can surmount it                                        observ xv of ketteringstone and of the pores of inanimate bodies  13this stone which is brought from kettering in northamptonshire and diggd out of a quarry as i am informd has a grain altogether admirable nor have i ever seen or heard of any other stone that has the like it is made up of an innumerable company of small bodies not all of the same cize or shape but for the most part not much differing from a globular form nor exceed they one another in diameter above three or four times they appear to the eye like the cobb or ovary of a herring or some smaller fishes but for the most part the particles seem somewhat less and not so uniform but their variation from a perfect globular ball seems to be only by the pressure of the contiguous bals which have a little deprest and protruded those toucht sides inward and forcd the other sides as much outwards beyond the limits of a globe just as it would happen if a heap of exactly round balls of soft clay were heaped upon one another or as i have often seen a heap of small globules of quicksilver reducd to that form by rubbing it much in a glazd vessel with some slimy or sluggish liquor such as spittle when though the top of the upper globules be very neer spherical yet those that are prest upon by others exactly imitate the forms of these lately mentiond grains  where these grains touch each other they are so firmly united or settled together that they seldom part without breaking a hole in one or thother of them such as a a a b c c c some of which fractions as a a a a where the touch has been but light break no more then the outward crust or first shell of the stone which is of a white colour a little dashd with a brownish yellow and is very thin like the shell of an egg and i have seen some of those grains perfectly resemble some kind of eggs both in colour and shape but where the union of the contiguous granules has been more firm there the divulsion has made a greater chasm as at b b b in so much that i have observd some of them quite broken in two as at c c c which has discovered to me a further resemblance they have to eggs they having an appearance of a white and yelk by two differing substances that envelope and encompass each other  that which we may call the white was pretty whitish neer the yelk but more duskie towards the shell some of them i could plainly perceive to be shot or radiated like a pyrites or firestone the yelk in some i saw hollow in others filld with a duskie brown and porous substance like a kind of pith  the small pores or interstitia eeee betwixt the globules i plainly saw and found by other trials to be every way pervious to air and water for i could blow through a piece of this stone of a considerable thickness as easily as i have blown through a cane which minded me of the pores which des cartes allow his materia subtilis between the √¶thereal globules  the object through the microscope appears like a congeries or heap of pibbles such as i have often seen cast up on the shore by the working of the sea after a great storm or like in shape though not colour a company of small globules of quicksilver lookd on with a microscope when reducd into that form by the way lately mentioned and perhaps this last may give some hint at the manner of the formation of the former for supposing some lapidescent substance to be generated or some way brought either by some commixture of bodies in the sea it self or protruded in perhaps out of some subterraneous caverns to the bottom of the sea and there remaining in the form of a liquor like quicksilver heterogeneous to the ambient saline fluid it may by the working and tumblings of the sea to and fro be jumbled and comminuted into such globules as may afterwards be hardned into flints the lying of which one upon another when in the sea being not very hard by reason of the weight of the incompassing fluid may cause the undermost to be a little though not much varied from a globular figure but this only by the by  after what manner this ketteringstone should be generated i cannot learn having never been there to view the place and observe the circumstances but it seems to me from the structure of it to be generated from some substance once more fluid and afterwards by degrees growing harder almost after the same manner as i supposed the generation of flints to be made  but whatever were the cause of its curious texture we may learn this information from it that even in those things which we account vile rude and coorse nature has not been wanting to shew abundance of curiosity and excellent mechanisme  we may here find a stone by help of a microscope to be made up of abundance of small balls which do but just touch each other and yet there being so many contacts they make a firm hard mass or a stone much harder then freestone  next though we can by a microscope discern so curious a shape in the particles yet to the naked eye there scarce appears any such thing which may afford us a good argument to think that even in those bodies also whose texture we are not able to discern though helpd with microscopes there may be yet latent so curious a schematisme that it may abundantly satisfie the curious searcher who shall be so happy as to find some way to discover it  next we here find a stone though to the naked eye a very close one yet every way perforated with innumerable pores which are nothing else but the interstitia between those multitudes of minute globular particles that compose the bulk it self and these pores are not only discoverd by the microscope but by this contrivance  i took a pretty large piece of this stone and covering it all over with cement save only at two opposite parts i found my self able by blowing in at one end that was left open to blow my spittle with which i had wet the other end into abundance of bubbles which argued these pores to be open and pervious through the whole stone which affords us a very pretty instance of the porousness of some seemingly close bodies of which kind i shall anon have occasion to subjoyn many more tending to prove the same thing  i must not here omit to take notice that in this body there is not a vegetative faculty that should so contrive this structure for any peculiar use of vegetation or growth whereas in the other instances of vegetable porous bodies there is an anima or forma informans that does contrive all the structures and mechanismes of the constituting body to make them subservient and usefull to the great work or function they are to perform and so i ghess the pores in wood and other vegetables in bones and other animal substances to be as so many channels provided by the great and alwise creator for the conveyance of appropriated juyces to particular parts and therefore that this may tend or be pervious all towards one part and may have impediments as valves or the like to any other but in this body we have very little reason so suspect there should be any such design for it is equally pervious every way not onely forward but backwards and sideways and seems indeed much rather to be homogeneous or similar to those pores which we may with great probability believe to be the channels of pellucid bodies not directed or more open any one way then any other being equally pervious every way and according as these pores are more or greater in respect of the interstitial bodies the more transparent are the so constituted concretes and the smaller those pores are the weaker is the impulse of light communicated through them though the more quick be the progress  upon this occasion i hope it will not be altogether unseasonable if i propound my conjectures and hypothesis about the medium and conveyance of light  i suppose then that the greatest part of the interstitia of the world that lies between the bodies of the sun and starrs and the planets and the earth to be an exceeding fluid body very apt and ready to be movd and to communicate the motion of any one part to any other part though never so far distant nor do i much concern my self to determine what the figure of the particles of this exceedingly subtile fluid medium must be nor whether it have any interstitiated pores or vacuities it being sufficient to solve all the ph√¶nomena to suppose it an exceedingly fluid or the most fluid body in the world and as yet impossible to determine the other difficulties  that being so exceeding fluid a body it easily gives passage to all other bodies to move to and fro in it  that it neither receives from any of its parts or from other bodies nor communicates to any of its parts or to any other body any impulse or motion in a direct line that is not of a determinate quickness and that when the motion is of such determinate swiftness it both receives and communicates or propagates an impulse or motion to any imaginable distance in streight lines with an unimaginable celerity and vigour  that all kind of solid bodies consist of pretty massie particles in respect of the particles of this fluid medium which in many places do so touch each other that none of this fluid medium interposes much after the same mannner to use a gross similitude as a heap of great stones compose one great congeries or mass in the midst of the water  that all fluid bodies which we may call tangible are nothing but some more subtile parts of those particles that serve to constitute all tangible bodies  that the water and such other fluid bodies are nothing but a congeries of particles agitated or made fluid by it in the same manner as the particles of salt are agitated or made fluid by a parcel of water in which they are dissolvd and subsiding to the bottom of it constitute a fluid body much more massie and dense and less fluid then the pure water it self  that the air on the other side is a certain company of particles of quite another kind that is such as are very much smaller and more easiely moveable by the motion of this fluid medium much like those very subtile parts of cochenel other very deep tinging bodies where by a very small parcel of matter is able to tinge and diffuse it self over a very great quantity of the fluid dissolvent or somewhat after that manner as smoak and such like minute bodies or steams are observd to tinge a very great quantity of air onely this last similitude is deficient in one propriety and that is a perpetuity or continuance in that state of commixture with the air but the former does more neerly approach to the nature and manner of the airs being dissolvd by this fluid or √Üther and this similitude will further hold in these proprieties that as those tinctures may be increased by certain bodies so may they be precipitated by others as i shall afterwards shew it to be very probable that the like accidents happen even to the air it self  further as these solutions and tinctures do alter the nature of these fluid bodies as to their aptness to propagate a motion or impulse through them even so does the particles of the air water and other fluid bodies and of glass crystal c which are commixt with this bulk of the √Üther alter the motion of the propagated pulse of light that is where these more bulkie particles are more plentifull and consequently a lesser quantity of the √Üther between them to be movd there the motion must necessarily be the swifter though not so robust which will produce those effects which i have i hope with some probability ascribed to it in the digression about colours at the end of the observations on muscovyglass  now that other stones and those which have the closest and hardest textures and seem as far as we are able to discover with our eyes though helpd with the best microscopes freest from pores are yet notwithstanding replenishd with them an instance or two will i suppose make more probable  a very solid and unflawd piece of cleer white marble if it be well polishd and glazd has so curiously smooth a surface that the best and most polishd surface of any wroughtglass seems not to the naked eye nor through a microscope to be more smooth and less porous and yet that this hard close body is replenishd with abundance of pores i think these following experiments will sufficiently prove  the first is that if you take such a piece and for a pretty while boyl it in turpentine and oyl of turpentine you shall find that the stone will be all imbud with it and whereas before it lookd more white but more opacous now it will look more greasie but be much more transparent and if you let it lie but a little while and then break off a part of it you shall find the unctuous body to have penetrated it to such a determinate depth every way within the surface this may be yet easier tryd with a piece of the same marble a little warmd in the fire and then a little pitch or tarr melted on the top of it for these black bodies by their insinuating themselves into the invisible pores of the stone ting it with so black a hue that there can be no further doubt of the truth of this assertion that it abounds with small imperceptible pores  now that other bodies will also sink into the pores of marble besides unctuous i have tryd and found that a very blue tincture made in spirit of urine would very readily and easily sink into it as would also several tinctures drawn with spirit of wine  nor is marble the only seemingly close stone which by other kinds of experiments may be found porous for i have by this kind of experiment on divers other stones found much the same effect and in some indeed much more notable other stones i have found so porous that with the microscope i could perceive several small winding holes much like wormholes as i have noted in some kind of purbeckstone by looking on the surface of a piece newly flawd off for if otherwise the surface has been long exposd to the air or has been scraped with any tool those small caverns are filld with dust and disappear  and to confirm this conjecture yet further i shall here insert an excellent account given into the royal society by that eminently learned physician doctor goddard of an experiment not less instructive then curious and accurate made by himself on a very hard and seemingly close stone calld oculus mundi as i find it preservd in the records of that honourable society      a small stone of the kind calld by some authours oculus mundi     being dry and cloudy weighd 5209256 grains      the same put under water for a night and somewhat more became     transparent and the superficies being wiped dry weighed 63256     grains      the difference between these two weights 050256 of a grain      the same stone kept out of water one day and becoming cloudy again     weighed 5225256 graines      which was more then the first weight 016256 of a grain      the same being kept two days longer weighed 5202256 graines      which was less then at first 07256 a grain      being kept dry something longer it did not grow sensibly lighter      being put under water for a night and becoming again transparent and     wiped dry the weight was 63256 grains the same with the first     after putting in water and more then the last weight after keeping of     it dry 057256 of a grain      another stone of the same kind being variegated with milky white and     gray like some sorts of agates while it lay under water was     alwaies invironed with little bubbles such as appear in water a little     before boyling next the sides of the vessel      there were also some the like bubbles on the surface of the water just     over it as if either some exhalations came out of it or that it did     excite some fermentation in the parts of the water contiguous to it      there was little sensible difference in the transparency of this stone     before the putting under water and after to be sure the milkywhite     parts continued as before but more difference in weight then in the     former for whereas before the putting into the water the weight was     1897128 graines after it had lyen in about four and twenty hours     the weight was 2027128 graines so the difference was 158128     graines      the same stone was infused in the water scalding hot and so continued     for a while after it was cold but got no more weight then upon     infusing in the cold neither was there any sensible difference in the     weight both times  in which experiment there are three observables that seem very manifestly to prove the porousness of these seemingly close bodies the first is their acquiring a transparency and losing their whiteness after steeping in water which will seem the more strongly to argue it if what i have already said about the making transparent or clarifying of some bodies as the white powder of beaten glass and the froth of some glutinous transparent liquor be well considerd for thereby it will seem rational to think that this transparency arises from the insinuation of the water which has much the same refraction with such stony particles as may be discoverd by sand viewd with a microscope into those pores which were formerly repleat with air that has a very differing refraction and consequently is very reflective which seems to be confirmd by the second observable namely the increase of weight after keeping and decrease upon drying and thirdly seemd yet more sensibly confirmd by the multitude of bubbles in the last experiment  we find also most acid salts very readily to dissolve and separate the parts of this body one from another which is yet a further argument to confirm the porousness of bodies and will serve as such to shew that even glass also has an abundance of pores in it since there are several liquors that with long staying in a glass will so corrode and eat into it as at last to make it pervious to the liquor it containd of which i have seen very many instances  since therefore we find by other proofs that many of those bodies which we think the most solid ones and appear so to our sight have notwithstanding abundance of those grosser kind of pores which will admit several kinds of liquors into them why should we not believe that glass and all other transparent bodies abound with them since we have many other arguments besides the propagation of light which seem to argue for it  and whereas it may be objected that the propagation of light is no argument that there are those atomical pores in glass since there are hypotheses plausible enough to solve those ph√¶nomena by supposing the pulse onely to be communicated through the transparent body  to this i answer that that hypothesis which the industrious mersennus has publishd about the slower motion of the end of a ray in a denser medium then in a more rare and thin seems altogether unsufficient to solve abundance of ph√¶nomena of which this is not the least considerable that it is impossible from that supposition that any colours should be generated from the refraction of the rays for since by that hypothesis the undulating pulse is always carried perpendicular or at right angles with the ray or line of direction it follows that the stroke of the pulse of light after it has been once or twice refracted through a prisme for example must affect the eye with the same kind of stroke as if it had not been refracted at all nor will it be enough for a defendant of that hypothesis to say that perhaps it is because the refractions have made the rays more weak for if so then two refractions in the two parallel sides of a quadrangular prisme would produce colours but we have no such ph√¶nomena producd  there are several arguments that i could bring to evince that there are in all transparent bodies such atomical pores and that there is such a fluid body as i am arguing for which is the medium or instrument by which the pulse of light is conveyd from the lucid body to the enlightnd but that it being a digression from the observations i was recording about the pores of kettering stone it would be too much such if i should protract it too long and therefore i shall proceed to the next observation                                        observ xvi of charcoal or burnt vegetables  charcoal or a vegetable burnt black affords an object no less pleasant than instructive for if you take a small round charcoal and break it short with your fingers you may perceive it to break with a very smooth and sleek surface almost like the surface of black sealing wax this surface if it be lookd on with an ordinary microscope does manifest abundance of those pores which are also visible to the eye in many kinds of wood rangd round the pith both a in kind of circular order and a radiant one of these there are a multitude in the substance of the coal every where almost perforating and drilling it from end to end by means of which be the coal never so long you may easily blow through it and this you may presently find by wetting one end of it with spittle and blowing at the other  but this is not all for besides those many great and conspicuous irregular spots or pores if a better microscope be made use of there will appear an infinite company of exceedingly small and very regular pores so thick and so orderly set and so close to one another that they leave very little room or space between them to be filld with a solid body for the apparent interstitia or separating sides of these pores seem so thin in some places that the texture of a honeycomb cannot be more porous though this be not every where so the intercurrent partitions in some places being very much thicker in proportion to the holes  most of these small pores seemd to be pretty round and were rangd in rows that radiated from the pith to the bark they all of them seemd to be continued open pores running the whole length of the stick and that they were all perforated i tryd by breaking off a very thin sliver of the coal crossways and then with my microscope diligently surveying them against the light for by that means i was able to see quite through them  these pores were so exceeding small and thick that in a line of them 118 part of an inch long i found by numbring them no less then 150 small pores and therefore in a line of them an inch long must be no less then 2700 pores and in a circular area of an inch diameter must be about 5725350 of the like pores so that a stick of an inch diameter may containe no less then seven hundred and twenty five thousand besides 5 millions of pores which would i doubt not seem even incredible were not every one left to believe his own eyes nay having since examind cocus black and green ebony lignum vit√¶ c i found that all these woods have their pores abundantly smaller then those of soft light wood in so much that those of guajacum seemd not above an eighth part of the bigness of the pores of beech but then the interstitia were thicker so prodigiously curious are the contrivances pipes or sluces by which the succus nutritius or juyce of a vegetable is conveyd from place to place  this observation seems to afford us the true reason of several ph√¶nomena of coals as  first why they look black and for this we need go no further then the scheme for certainly a body that has so many pores in it as this is discoverd to have from each of which no light is reflected must necessarily look black especially when the pores are somewhat bigger in proportion to the intervals then they are cut in the scheme black being nothing else but a privation of light or a want of reflection and wheresover this reflecting quality is deficient there does that part look black whether it be from a porousness of the body as in this instance or in a deadning and dulling quality such as i have observd in the scoria of lead tin silver copper c  next we may also as plainly see the reason of its shining quality and that is from the even breaking off of the stick the solid interstitia having a regular termination or surface and having a pretty strong reflecting quality the many small reflections become united to the naked eye and make a very pretty shining surface  thirdly the reason of its hardness and brittleness seems evident for since all the watery or liquid substance that moistnd and toughnd those interstitia of the more solid parts are evaporated and removd that which is left behind becomes of the nature almost of a stone which will not at all or very little bend without a divulsion or solution of its continuity  it is not my design at present to examine the use and mechanisme of these parts of wood that being more proper to another enquiry but rather to hint that from this experiment we may learn  first what is the cause of the blackness of many burnt bodies which we may find to be nothing else but this that the heat of the fire agitating and rarifying the waterish transparent and volatile water that is containd in them by the continuation of that action does so totally expel and drive away all that which before filld the pores and was dispersd also through the solid mass of it and thereby causd an universal kind of transparency that it not onely leaves all the pores empty but all the interstitia also so dry and opacous and perhaps also yet further perforated that that light onely is reflected back which falls upon the very outward edges of the pores all they that enter into the pores of the body never returning but being lost in it  now that the charring or coaling of a body is nothing else may be easily believd by one that shall consider the means of its production which may be done after this or any such manner the body to be charrd or coald may be put into a crucible pot or any other vessel that will endure to be made redhot in the fire without breaking and then coverd over with sand so as no part of it be sufferd to be open to the air then set into a good fire and there kept till the sand has continud red hot for a quarter half an hour or two or more according to the nature and bigness of the body to be coald or charrd then taking it out of the fire and letting it stand till it be quite cold the body may be taken out of the sand well charrd and cleansd of its waterish parts but in the taking of it out care must be had that the sand be very neer cold for else when it comes into the free air it will take fire and readily burn away  this maybe done also in any close vessel of glass as a retort or the like and the several fluid substances that come over may be receivd in a fit recipient which will yet further countenance this hypothesis and their manner of charring wood in great quantity comes much to the same thing namely an application of a great heat to the body and preserving it from the free access of the devouring air this may be easily learnd from the history of charring of coal most excellently describd and publishd by that most accomplishd gentleman mr john evelin in the 100 101 103 pages of his sylva to which i shall therefore refer the curious reader that desires a full information of it  next we may learn what part of the wood it is that is the combustible matter for since we shall find that none or very little of those fluid substances that are driven over into the receiver are combustible and that most of that which is left behind is so it follows that the solid interstitia of the wood are the combustible matter further the reason why uncharrd wood burns with a greater flame then that which is charrd is as evident because those waterish or volatil parts issuing out of the fired wood every way not onely shatter and open the body the better for the fire to enter but issuing out in vapours or wind they become like so many little √¶olipiles or bellows whereby they blow and agitate the fird part and conduce to the more speedy and violent consumption or dissolution of the body  thirdly from the experiment of charring of coals whereby we see that notwithstanding the great heat and the duration of it the solid parts of the wood remain whilest they are preservd from the free access of the air undissipated we may learn that which has not that i know of been publishd or hinted nay not so much as thought of by any and that in short is this  first that the air in which we live move and breath and which encompasses very many and cherishes most bodies it encompasses that this air is the menstruum or universal dissolvent of all sulphureous bodies  secondly that this action it performs not till the body be first sufficiently heated as we find requisite also to the dissolution of many other bodies by several other menstruums  thirdly that this action of dissolution produces or generates a very great heat and that which we call fire and this is common also to many dissolutions of other bodies made by menstruums of which i could give multitudes of instances  fourthly that this action is performd with so great a violence and does so minutely act and rapidly agitate the smallest parts of the combustible matter that it produces in the diaphanous medium of the air the action or pulse of light which what it is i have elsewhere already shewn  fifthly that the dissolution of sulphureous bodies is made by a substance inherent and mixt with the air that is like if not the very same with that which is fixt in saltpeter which by multitudes of experiments that may be made with saltpeter will i think most evidently be demonstrated  sixthly that in this dissolution of bodies by the air a certain part is united and mixt or dissolvd and turnd into the air and made to fly up and down with it in the same manner as a metalline or other body dissolved into any menstruums does follow the motions and progresses of that menstruum till it be precipitated  seventhly that as there is one part that is dissoluble by the air so are there other parts with which the parts of the air mixing and uniting do make a coagulum or precipitation as one may call it which causes it to be separated from the air but this precipitate is so light and in so small and rarifyd or porous clusters that it is very volatil and is easily carryd up by the motion of the air though afterwards when the heat and agitation that kept it rarifyd ceases it easily condenses and commixt with other indissoluble parts it sticks and adheres to the next bodies it meets withall and this is a certain salt that may be extracted out of soot  eighthly that many indissoluble parts being very apt and prompt to be rarifyd and so whilest they continue in that heat and agitation are lighter then the ambient air are thereby thrust and carryd upwards with great violence and by that means carry along with them not onely that saline concrete i mentiond before but many terrestrial or indissoluble and irrarefiable parts nay many parts also which are dissoluble but are not sufferd to stay long enough in a sufficient heat to make them prompt and apt for that action and therefore we find in soot not onely a part that being continued longer in a competent heat will be dissolvd by the air or take fire and burn but a part also which is fixt terrestrial and irrarefiable  ninthly that as there are these several parts that will rarifie and fly or be driven up by the heat so are there many others that as they are indissoluble by the aerial menstruum so are they of such sluggish and gross parts that they are not easily rarifyd by heat and therefore cannot be raisd by it the volatility or fixtness of a body seeming to consist only in this that the one is of a texture or has component parts that will be easily rarifyd into the form of air and the other that it has such as will not without much ado be brought to such a constitution and this is that part which remains behind in a white body calld ashes which contains a substance or salt which chymists call alkali what the particular natures of each of these bodies are i shall not here examine intending it in another place but shall rather add that this hypothesis does so exactly agree with all ph√¶nomena of fire and so genuinely explicate each particular circumstance that i have hitherto observd that it is more then probable that this cause which i have assignd is the true adequate real and onely cause of those ph√¶nomena and therefore i shall proceed a little further to shew the nature and use of the air  tenthly therefore the dissolving parts of the air are but few that is it seems of the nature of those saline menstruums or spirits that have very much flegme mixt with the spirits and therefore a small parcel of it is quickly glutted and will dissolve no more and therefore unless some fresh part of this menstruum be applyd to the body to be dissolvd the action ceases and the body leaves to be dissolvd and to shine which is the indication of it though placd or kept in the greatest heat whereas saltpeter is a menstruum when melted and redhot that abounds more with those dissolvent particles and therefore as a small quantity of it will dissolve a great sulphureous body so will the dissolution be very quick and violent  therefore in the eleventh place it is observable that as in other solutions if a copious and quick supply of fresh menstruum though but weak be poured on or applied to the dissoluble body it quickly consumes it so this menstruum of the air if by bellows or any other such contrivance it be copiously applyd to the shining body is found to dissolve it as soon and as violently as the more strong menstruum of melted nitre  therefore twelfthly it seems reasonable to think that there is no such thing as an element of fire that should attract or draw up the flame or towards which the flame should endeavour to ascend out of a desire or appetite of uniting with that as its homogeneal primitive and generating element but that that shining transient body which we call flame is nothing else but a mixture of air and volatil sulphureous parts of dissoluble or combustible bodies which are acting upon each other whilst they ascend that is flame seems to be a mixture of air and the combustible volatil parts of any body which parts the encompassing air does dissolve or work upon which action as it does intend the heat of the aerial parts of the dissolvent so does it thereby further rarifie those parts that are acting or that are very neer them whereby they growing much lighter then the heavie parts of that menstruum that are more remote are thereby protruded and driven upward and this may be easily observd also in dissolution made by any other menstruum especially such as either create heat or bubbles now this action of the menstruum or air on the dissoluble parts is made with such violence or is such that it imparts such a motion or pulse to the diaphanous parts of the air as i have elsewhere shewn is requisite to produce light  this hypothesis i have endeavoured to raise from an infinite of observations and experiments the process of which would be much too long to be here inserted and will perhaps another time afford matter copious enough for a much larger discourse the air being a subject which though all the world has hitherto livd and breathd in and been unconversant about has yet been so little truly examind or explaind that a diligent enquirer will be able to find but very little information from what has been till of late written of it but being once well understood it will i doubt not inable a man to render an intelligible nay probable if not the true reason of all the ph√¶nomena of fire which as it has been found by writers and philosophers of all ages a matter of no small difficulty as may be sufficiently understood by their strange hypotheses and unintelligible solutions of some few ph√¶nomena of it so will it prove a matter of no small concern and use in humane affairs as i shall elsewhere endeavour to manifest when i come to shew the use of the air in respiration and for the preservation of the life nay for the conservation and restauration of the health and natural constitution of mankind as well as all other aereal animals as also the uses of this principle or propriety of the air in chymical mechanical and other operations in this place i have onely time to hint an hypothesis which if god permit me life and opportunity i may elsewhere prosecute improve and publish in the mean time before i finish this discourse i must not forget to acquaint the reader that having had the liberty granted me of making some trials on a piece of lignum fossile shewn to the royal society by the eminently ingenious and learned physician doctor ent who receivd it for a present from the famous ingenioso cavalliero de pozzi it being one of the fairest and best pieces of lignum fossile he had seen having i say taken a small piece of this wood and examind it i found it to burn in the open air almost like other wood and insteed of a resinous smoak or fume it yielded a very bituminous one smelling much of that kind of sent but that which i chiefly took notice of was that cutting off a small piece of it about the bigness of my thumb and charring it in a crucible with sand after the manner i above prescribd i found it infinitely to abound with the smaller sort of pores so extreamly thick and so regularly perforating the substance of it longways that breaking it off across i found it to look very like an honeycomb but as for any of the second or bigger kind of pores i could not find that it had any so that it seems whatever were the cause of its production it was not without those small kind of pores which we have onely hitherto found in vegetable bodies and comparing them with the pores which i have found in the charcoals that i by this means made of several other kinds of wood i find it resemble none so much as those of fire to which it is not much unlike in grain also and several other proprieties  and therefore what ever is by some who have written of it and particularly by francisco stelluto wrote a treatise in italian of that subject which was printed at rome 1637 affirmd that it is a certain kind of clay or earth which in tract of time is turnd into wood i rather suspect the quite contrary that it was at first certain great trees of fir or pine which by some earthquake or other casualty came to be buried under the earth and was there after a long times residence according to the several natures of the encompassing adjacent parts either rotted and turnd into a kind of clay or petrifyd and turnd into a kind of stone or else had its pores filld with certain mineral juices which being stayd in them and in tract of time coagulated appeard upon cleaving out like small metaline wires or else from some flames or scorching forms that are the occasion oftentimes and usually accompany earthquakes might be blasted and turnd into coal or else from certain subterraneous fires which are affirmd by that authour to abound much about those parts namely in a province of italy calld umbria now the dutchie of spoletto in the territory of todi anciently calld tudor and between the two villages of collesecco and rosaro not far distant from the highway leading to rome where it is found in greater quantity then elsewhere are by reason of their being encompassed with earth and so kept close from the dissolving air charrd and converted into coal it would be too long a work to describe the several kinds of pores which i met withall and by this means discovered in several other vegetable bodies nor is it my present design to expatiate upon instances of the same kind but rather to give a specimen of as many kinds as i have had opportunity as yet of observing reserving the prosecution and enlarging on particulars till a more fit opportunity and in prosecution of this design i shall here add                                        observ xvii of petrifyd wood and other petrifyd bodies  of this sort of substance i observd several pieces of very differing kinds both for their outward shape colour grain texture hardness c some being brown and redish others gray like a hone others black and flintlike some soft like a slate or whetstone others as hard as a flint and as brittle that which i more particular examind was a piece about the bigness of a mans hand which seemd to have been a part of some large tree that by rottenness had been broken off from it before it began to be petrifyd  and indeed all that i have yet seen seem to have been rotten wood before the petrifaction was begun and not long since examining and viewing a huge great oak that seemd with meer age to be rotten as it stood i was very much confirmd in this opinion for i found that the grain colour and shape of the wood was exactly like this petrifyd substance and with a microscope i found that all those microscopical pores which in sappy or firm and sound wood are filld with the natural or innate juices of those vegetables in this they were all empty like those of vegetables charrd but with this difference that they seemd much larger then i have seen any in charcoals nay even then those of coals made of great blocks of timber which are commonly calld oldcoals  the reason of which difference may probably be that the charring of vegetables being an operation quickly performd and whilest the wood is sappy the more solid parts may more easily shrink together and contract the pores or interstitia between them then in the rotten wood where that natural juice seems onely to be washd away by adventitious or unnatural moisture and so though the natural juice be wasted from between the firm parts yet those parts are kept asunder by the adventitious moystures and so by degrees settled in those postures  and this i likewise found in the petrifyd wood that the pores were somewat bigger then those of charcoal each pore being neer upon half as bigg again but they did not bear that disproportion which is exprest in the tenth scheme between the small specks or pores in the first figure which representeth the pores of coal or wood charrd and the black spots of the second figure which represent the like microscopical pores in the petrifyd wood for these last were drawn by a microscope that magnifyd the object above six times more in diameter then the microscope by which those pores of coal were observd  now though they were a little bigger yet did they keep the exact figure and order of the pores of coals and of rotten wood which last also were much of the same cize  the other observations on this petrifyd substance that a while since by the appointment of the royal society i made and presented to them an account of were these that follow which had the honour done them by the most accomplishd mr evelin my highly honoured friend to be inserted and published among those excellent observations wherewith his sylva is replenishd and would therefore have been here omitted had not the figure of them as they appeard through the microscope been before that engraven  this petrifyd substance resembled wood in that  first all the parts of it seemd not at all dislocated or alterd from their natural position whilst they were wood but the whole piece retaind the exact shape of wood having many of the conspicuous pores of wood still remaining pores and shewing a manifest difference visible enough between the grain of the wood and that of the bark especially when any side of it was cut smooth and polite for then it appeard to have a very lovely grain like that of some curious close wood  next it resembled wood in that all the smaller and if i may so call those which are onely visible with a good magnifying glass microscopical pores of it appear both when the substance is cut and polishd transversly and parallel to the pores of it perfectly like the microscopical pores of several kinds of wood especially like and equal to those of several sorts of rotten wood which i have since observd retaining both the shape position and magnitude of such pores it was differing from wood  first in weight being to common water as 3¬º to 1 whereas there are few of our english woods that when very dry are found to be full as heavie as water  secondly in hardness being very neer as hard as a flint and in some places of it also resembling the grain of a flint and like it it would very readily cut glass and would not without difficulty especially in some parts of it be scratchd by a black hard flint it would also as readily strike fire against a steel or against a flint as any common flint  thirdly in the closeness of it for though all the microscopical pores of this petrifyd substance were very conspicuous in one position yet by altering that position of the polishd surface to the light it was also manifest that those pores appeard darker then the rest of the body onely because they were filld up with a more duskie substance and not because they were hollow  fourthly in its incombustibleness in that it would not burn in the fire nay though i kept it a good while redhot in the flame of a lamp made very intense by the blast of a small pipe and a large charcoal yet it seemd not at all to have diminishd its extension but only i found it to have changd its colour and to appear of a more dark and duskie brown colour nor could i perceive that those parts which seemd to have been wood at first were any thing wasted but the parts appeard as solid and close as before it was further observable also that as it did not consume like wood so neither did it crack and flie like a flint or such like hard stone nor was it long before it appeard redhot  fifthly in its dissolubleness for putting some drops of distilld vinegar upon the stone i found it presently to yield very many bubbles just like those which may be observd in spirit of vinegar when it corrodes corals though perhaps many of those small bubbles might proceed from some small parcels of air which were driven out of the pores of this petrifyd substance by the insinuating liquid menstruum  sixthly in its rigidness and friability being not at all flexible but brittle like a flint insomuch that i could with one knock of a hammer break off a piece of it and with a few more reduce that into a pretty fine powder  seventhly it seemd also very differing from wood to the touch feeling more cold then wood usually does and much like other close stones and minerals  the reasons of all which ph√¶nomena seem to be  that petrifyd wood having lain in some place where it was well soakd with petrifying water that is such a water as is well impregnated with stony and earthy particles did by degrees separate either by straining and filtration or perhaps by precipitation cohesion or coagulation abundance of stony particles from the permeating water which stony particles being by means of the fluid vehicle conveyd not onely into the microscopical pores and so perfectly stoping them up but also into the pores or interstitia which may perhaps be even in the texture or schematisme of that part of the wood which through the microscope appears most solid do thereby so augment the weight of the wood as to make it above three times heavier then water and perhaps six times as heavie as it was when wood  next they thereby so lock up and fetter the parts of the wood that the fire cannot easily make them flie away but the action of the fire upon them is onely able to char those parts as it were like a piece of wood if it be closd very fast up in clay and kept a good while redhot in the fire will by the heat of the fire be charrd and not consumd which may perhaps also be somewhat of the cause why the petrifyd substance appeard of a dark brown colour after it had been burnt  by this intrusion of the petrifying particles this substance also becomes hard and friable for the smaller pores of the wood being perfectly wedgd and stuft up with those stony particles the small parts of the wood have no places or pores into which they may slide upon bending and consequently little or no flexion or yielding at all can be causd in such a substance  the remaining particles likewise of the wood among the stony particles may keep them from cracking and flying when put into the fire as they are very apt to do in a flint  nor is wood the onely substance that may by this kind of transmutation be changd into stone for i my self have seen and examind very many kinds of substances and among very credible authours we may meet with histories of such metamorphoses wrought almost on all kind of substances both vegetable and animal which histories it is not my business at present either to relate or epitomise but only to set down some observation i lately made on several kind of petrifyd shels found about keinsham which lies within four or five miles of bristol which are commonly calld serpentinestones  examining several of these very curiously figurd bodies which are commonly thought to be stones formd by some extraordinary plastick virtue latent in the earth itself i took notice of these particulars  first that these figured bodies or stones were of very differing substances as to hardness some of clay some marle some soft stone almost of the hardness of those soft stones which masons call firestone others as hard as portland stone others as hard as marble and some as hard as a flint or crystal  next they were of very differing substances as to transparency and colour some white some almost black some brown some metalline or like marchasites some transparent like white marble others like flawd crystal some gray some of divers colours some radiated like those long petrifyd drops which are commonly found at the peak and in other subterraneous caverns which have a kind of pith in the middle  thirdly that they were very different as to the manner of their outward figuration for some of them seemd to have been the substance that had filld the shell of some kind of shelfish others to have been the substance that had containd or enwrappd one of those shels on both which the perfect impression either of the inside or outside of such shells seemd to be left but for the most part those impressions seemd to be made by an imperfect or broken shell the great end or mouth of the shell being always wanting and often times the little end and sometimes half and in some there were impressions just as if there had been holes broken in the figurating imprinting or moulding shell some of them seemd to be made by such a shell very much brused or flawd insomuch that one would verily have thought that very figurd stone had been broken or brused whilst a gelly as twere and so hardned but within in the grain of the stone there appeard not the least sign of any such bruse or breaking but onely on the very uttermost superficies  fourthly they were very different as to their outward covering some having the perfect shell both in figure colour and substance sticking on upon its surface and adhering to it but might very easily be separated from it and like other common cockle or scolopshels which some of them most accurately resembled were very dissoluble in common vinegar others of them especially those serpentine or helical stones were coverd or retained the shining or pearlcolourd substance of the inside of a shel which substance on some parts of them was exceeding thin and might very easily be rubbed off on other parts it was pretty thick and retained a white coat or flaky substance on the top just like the outsides of such shells some of them had very large pieces of the shell very plainly sticking on to them which were easily to be broken or flaked off by degrees they likewise some of them retaind all along the surface of them very pretty kind of sutures such as are observd in the skulls of several kinds of living creatures which sutures were most curiously shapd in the manner of leaves and every one of them in the same shell exactly one like another which i was able to discover plainly enough with my naked eye but more perfectly and distinctly with my microscope all these sutures by breaking some of these stones i found to be the termini or boundings of certain diaphragms or partitions which seemd to divide the cavity of the shell into a multitude of very proportionate and regular cells or caverns these diaphragms in many of them i found very perfect and compleat of a very distinct substance from that which filld the cavities and exactly of the same kind with that which covered the outside being for the most part whitish or motherofpearl colourd  as for the cavities between those diaphragms i found some of them filld with marle and others with several kinds of stones others for the most part hollow onely the whole cavity was usually covered over with a kind of tartareous petrifyd substance which stuck about the sides and was there shot into very curious regular figures just as tartar or other dissolvd salts are observd to stick and crystallize about the sides of the containing vessels or like those little diamants which i before observed to have covered the vaulted cavity of a flint others had these cavities all lind with a kind of metalline or marchasitelike substance which with a microscope i could as plainly see most curiously and regularly figured as i had done those in a flint  from all which and several other particulars which i observd i cannot but think that all these and most other kinds of stony bodies which are found thus strangely figured do owe their formation and figuration not to any kind of plastick virtue inherent in the earth but to the shells of certain shelfishes which either by some deluge inundation earthquake or some such other means came to be thrown to that place and there to be filld with some kind of mudd or clay or petrifying water or some other substance which in tract of time has been settled together and hardned in those shelly moulds into those shaped substances we now find them that the great and thin end of these shells by that earthquake or what ever other extraordinary cause it was that brought them thither was broken off and that many others were otherwise broken bruised and disfigured that these shells which are thus spirallied and separated with diaphragmes were some kind of nautili or porcelane shells and that others were shells of cockles muscles periwincles scolops c of various sorts that these shells in many from the particular nature of the containing or enclosd earth or some other cause have in tract of time rotted and mouldred away and onely left their impressions both on the containing and contained substances and so left them pretty loose one within another so that they may be easily separated by a knock or two of a hammer that others of these shells according to the nature of the substances adjacent to them have by a long continuance in that posture been petrifyd and turnd into the nature of stone just as i even now observd several sorts of wood to be that oftentimes the shell may be found with one kind of substance within and quite another without having perhaps been filld in one place and afterwards translated to another which i have very frequently observd in cockle muscle periwincle and other shells which i have found by the sea side nay further that some parts of the same shell may be filld in one place and some other caverns in another and others in a third or a fourth or a fifth place for so many differing substances have i found in one of these petrifyd shells and perhaps all these differing from the encompassing earth or stone the means how all which varieties may be causd i think will not be difficult to conceive to any one that has taken notice of those shells which are commonly found on the sea shore and he that shall throughly examine several kinds of such curiously formd stones will i am very apt to think find reason to suppose their generation or formation to be ascribable to some such accidents as i have mentiond and not to any plastick virtue for it seems to me quite contrary to the infinite prudence of nature which is observable in all its works and productions to design every thing to a determinate end and for the attaining of that end makes use of such ways as are as farr as the knowledge of man has yet been able to reach altogether consonant and most agreeable to mans reason and of no way or means that does contradict or is contrary to humane ratiocination whence it has a long time been a general observation and maxime that nature does nothing in vain it seems i say contrary to that great wisdom of nature that these prettily shapd bodies should have all those curious figures and contrivances which many of them are adornd and contrivd with generated or wrought by a plastick virtue for no higher end then onely to exhibite such a form which he that shall throughly consider all the circumstances of such kind of figurd bodies will i think have great reason to believe though i confess one cannot presently be able to find out what natures designs are it were therefore very desirable that a good collection of such kind of figurd stones were collected and as many particulars circumstances and informations collected with them as could be obtained that from such a history of observations well rangd examind and digested the true original or production of all those kinds of stones might be perfectly and surely known such as are thunderstones lapides stellares lapides judaici and multitudes of other whereof mention is made in aldonandus wormius and other writers of minerals                                        observ xviii of the schematisme or texture of cork and of the cells and pores of some other such frothy bodies  i took a good clear piece of cork and with a penknife sharpend as keen as a razor i cut a piece of it off and thereby left the surface of it exceeding smooth then examining it very diligently with a microscope me thought i could perceive it to appear a little porous but i could not so plainly distinguish them as to be sure that they were pores much less what figure they were of but judging from the lightness and yielding quality of the cork that certainly the texture could not be so curious but that possibly if i could use some further diligence i might find it to be discernable with a microscope i with the same sharp penknife cut off from the former smooth surface an exceeding thin piece of it and placing it on a black object plate because it was it self a white body and casting the light on it with a deep planoconvex glass i could exceeding plainly perceive it to be all perforated and porous much like a honeycomb but that the pores of it were not regular yet it was not unlike a honeycomb in these particulars  first in that it had a very little solid substance in comparison of the empty cavity that was containd between as does more manifestly appear by the figure a and b of the xi scheme for the interstitia or walls as i may so call them or partitions of those pores were neer as thin in proportion to their pores as those thin films of wax in a honeycomb which enclose and constitute the sexangular celts are to theirs  next in that these pores or cells were not very deep but consisted of a great many little boxes separated out of one continued long pore by certain diaphragms as is visible by the figure b which represents a sight of those pores split the longways  i no sooner discernd these which were indeed the first microscopical pores i ever saw and perhaps that were ever seen for i had not met with any writer or person that had made any mention of them before this but me thought i had with the discovery of them presently hinted to me the true and intelligible reason of all the ph√¶nomena of cork as  first if i enquird why it was so exceeding light a body my microscope could presently inform me that here was the same reason evident that there is found for the lightness of froth an empty honeycomb wool a spunge a pumicestone or the like namely a very small quantity of a solid body extended into exceeding large dimensions  next it seemd nothing more difficult to give an intelligible reason why cork is a body so very unapt to suck and drink in water and consequently preserves it self floating on the top of water though left on it never so long and why it is able to stop and hold air in a bottle though it be there very much condensd and consequently presses very strongly to get a passage out without suffering the least bubble to pass through its substance for as to the first since our microscope informs us that the substance of cork is altogether filld with air and that that air is perfectly enclosed in little boxes or cells distinct from one another it seems very plain why neither the water nor any other air can easily insinuate it self into them since there is already within them an intus existens and consequently why the pieces of cork become so good floats for nets and stopples for viols or other close vessels  and thirdly if we enquire why cork has such a springiness and swelling nature when compressd and how it comes to suffer so great a compression or seeming penetration of dimensions so as to be made a substance as heavie again and more bulk for bulk as it was before compression and yet sufferd to return is found to extend it self again into the same space our microscope will easily inform us that the whole mass consists of an infinite company of small boxes or bladders of air which is a substance of a springy nature and that will suffer a considerable condensation as i have several times found by divers trials by which i have most evidently condensd it into less then a twentieth part of its usual dimensions neer the earth and that with no other strength then that of my hands without any kind of forcing engine such as racks leavers wheels pullies or the like but this onely by and by and besides it seems very probable that those very films or sides of the pores have in them a springing quality as almost all other kind of vegetable substances have so as to help to restore themselves to their former position  and could we so easily and certainly discover the schematisme and texture even of these films and of several other bodies as we can these of cork there seems no probable reason to the contrary but that we might as readily render the true reason of all their ph√¶nomena as namely what were the cause of the springingess and toughness of some both as to their flexibility and restitution what of the friability or brittleness of some others and the like but till such time as our microscope or some other means enable us to discover the true schematism and texture of all kinds of bodies we must grope as it were in the dark and onely ghess at the true reasons of things by similitudes and comparisons  but to return to our observation i told several lines of these pores and found that there were usually about threescore of these small cells placed endways in the eighteenth part of an inch in length whence i concluded there must be neer eleven hundred of them or somewhat more then a thousand in the length of an inch and therefore in a square inch above a million or 1166400 and in a cubick inch above twelve hundred millions or 1259712000 a thing almost incredible did not our microscope assure us of it by ocular demonstration nay did it not discover to us the pores of a body which were they diaphragmd like those of cork would afford us in one cubick inch more then ten times as many little cells as is evident in several charrd vegetables so prodigiously curious are the works of nature that even these conspicuous pores of bodies which seem to be the channels or pipes through which the succus nutritius or natural juices of vegetables are conveyd and seem to correspond to the veins arteries and other vessels in sensible creatures that these pores i say which seem to be the vessels of nutrition to the vastest body in the world are yet so exceeding small that the atoms which epicurus fancyd would go neer to prove too bigg to enter them much more to constitute a fluid body in them and how infinitely smaller then must be the vessels of a mite or the pores of one of those little vegetables i have discovered to grow on the backside of a roseleaf and shall anon more fully describe whose bulk is many millions of times less then the bulk of the small shrub it grows on and even that shrub many millions of times less in bulk then several trees that have heretofore grown in england and are this day flourishing in other hotter climates as we are very credibly informd if at least the pores of this small vegetable should keep any such proportion to the body of it as we have found these pores of other vegetables to do to their bulk but of these pores i have said more elsewhere  to proceed then cork seems to be by the transverse constitution of the pores a kind of fungus or mushrome for the pores lie like so many rays tending from the center or pith of the tree outwards so that if you cut off a piece from a board of cork transversly to the flat of it you will as it were split the pores and they will appear just as they are expressd in the figure b of the xi scheme but if you shave off a very thin piece from this board parallel to the plain of it you will cut all the pores transversly and they will appear almost as they are expressd in the figure a save onely the solid interstitia will not appear so thick as they are there represented  so that cork seems to suck its nourishment from the subjacent bark of the tree immediately and to be a kind of excrescence or a substance distinct from the substances of the entire tree something analogus to the mushrome or moss on other trees or to the hairs on animals and having enquird into the history of cork i find it reckoned as an excrescency of the bark of a certain tree which is distinct from the two barks that lie within it which are common also to other trees that tis some time before the cork that covers the young and tender sprouts comes to be discernable that it cracks flaws and cleaves into many great chaps the bark underneath remaining entire that it may be separated and removd from the tree and yet the two underbarks such as are also common to that with other trees not at all injurd but rather helped and freed from an external injury thus jonstonus in dendrologia speaking de subere says arbor est procera lignum est robustum dempto cortice in aquis non fluitat cortice in orbem detracto juvatur crascescens enim pr√¶stringit  strangulat intra triennium iterum repletur caudex ubi adolescit crassus cortex superior densus carnosus duos digitos crassus scaber rimosus  qui nisi detrahatur dehiscit alioque subnascente expellitur interior qui subest novellus ita rubet ut arbor minio picta videatur which histories if well considerd and the tree substance and manner of growing if well examind would i am very apt to believe much confirm this my conjecture about the origination of cork  nor is this kind of texture peculiar to cork onely for upon examination with my microscope i have found that the pith of an elder or almost any other tree the inner pulp or pith of the cany hollow stalks of several other vegetables as of fennel carrets daucus burdocks teasels fearn some kinds of reeds c have much such a kind of schematisme as i have lately shewn that of cork save onely that here the pores are rangd the longways or the same ways with the length of the cane whereas in cork they are transverse  the pith also that fills that part of the stalk of a feather that is above the quil has much such a kind of texture save onely that which way soever i set this light substance the pores seemd to be cut transversly so that i ghess this pith which fills the feather not to consist of abundance of long pores separated with diaphragms as cork does but to be a kind of solid or hardned froth or a congeries of very small bubbles consolidated in that form into a pretty stiff as well as tough concrete and that each cavern bubble or cell is distinctly separate from any of the rest without any kind of hole in the encompassing films so that i could no more blow through a piece of this kinde of substance then i could through a piece of cork or the sound pith of an elder  but though i could not with my microscope nor with my breath nor any other way i have yet tryd discover a passage out of one of those cavities into another yet i cannot thence conclude that therefore there are none such by which the succus nutritius or appropriate juices of vegetables may pass through them for in several of those vegetables whilst green i have with my microscope plainly enough discoverd these cells or poles filld with juices and by degrees sweating them out as i have also observed in green wood all those long microscopical pores which appear in charcoal perfectly empty of any thing but air  now though i have with great diligence endeavoured to find whether there be any such thing in those microscopical pores of wood or piths as the valves in the heart veins and other passages of animals that open and give passage to the containd fluid juices one way and shut themselves and impede the passage of such liquors back again yet have i not hitherto been able to say any thing positive in it though me thinks it seems very probable that nature has in these passages as well as in those of animal bodies very many appropriated instruments and contrivances whereby to bring her designs and end to pass which tis not improbable but that some diligent observer if helpd with better microscopes may in time detect  and that this may be so seems with great probability to be argued from the strange ph√¶nomena of sensitive plants wherein nature seems to perform several animal actions with the same schematism or orginization that is common to all vegetables as may appear by some no less instructive then curious observations that were made by divers eminent members of the royal society on some of these kind of plants whereof an account was delivered in to them by the most ingenious and excellent physician doctor clark which having that liberty granted me by that most illustrious society i have hereunto adjoynd  observations on the humble and sensible plants in m chiffins garden in saint jamess park made august the 9th 1661 present the lord brouncker sr robert moray dr wilkins mr evelin dr henshaw and dr clark      there are four plants two of which are little shrub plants with a     little short stock about an inch above the ground from whence are     spread several sticky branches round streight and smooth in the     distances between the sprouts but just under the sprouts there are two     sharp thorny prickles broad in the letting on as in the bramble one     just under the sprout the other on the opposite side of the branch      14the distances betwixt the sprouts are usually something more then     an inch and many upon a branch according to its length and they grew     so that if the lower sprout be on the left side of the branch the     next above is on the right and so to the end not sprouting by pairs      at the end of each sprout are generally four sprigs two at the     extremity and one on each side just under it at the first sprouting     of these from the branch to the sprig where the leaves grow they are     full of little short white hairs which wear off as the leaves grow     and then they are smooth as the branch      upon each of these sprigs are for the most part eleven pair of     leaves neatly set into the uppermost part of the little sprig exactly     one against another as it were in little articulations such as     anatomists call enarthrosis where the round head of a bone is     received into another fitted for its motion and standing very fitly to     shut themselves and touch the pairs just above them closing somewhat     upon them as in the shut sprig so is the little round pedunculus of     this leaf fitted into a little cavity of the sprig visible to the eye     in a sprig new pluckd or in a sprig withered on the branch from     which the leaves easily fall by touching      the leaf being almost an oblong square and set into the pedunculus     at one of the lower corners receiveth from that not onely a spine     as i may call it which passing through the leaf divides it so     lengthways that the outerside is broader then the inner next the     sprig but little fibres passing obliquely towards the opposite     broader side seem to make it here a little muscular and fitted to     move the whole leaf which together with the whole sprig are set full     with little short whitish hairs      one of these plants whose branch seemd to be older and more grown     then the other onely the tender sprouts of it after the leaves are     shut fall and hang down of the other the whole branches fall to the     ground if the sun shine very warm upon the first taking off the     glass which i therefore call the humble plant      the other two which do never fall nor do any of their branches flagg     and hang down shut not their leaves but upon somewhat a hard stroke     the stalks seem to grow up from a root and appear more herbaceous     they are round and smooth without any prickle the sprouts from them     have several pairs of sprigs with much less leaves then the other on     them and have on each sprig generally seventeen pair      upon touching any of the sprigs with leaves on all the leaves on that     sprig contracting themselves by pairs joyned their upper superficies     close together      upon the dropping a drop of aqua fortis on the sprig betwixt the     leaves ff all the leaves above shut presently those below by pairs     successively after and by the lower leaves of the other branches ll     kk c and so every pair successively with some little distance of     time betwixt to the top of each sprig and so they continud shut all     the time we were there but i returning the next day and several days     since found all the leaves dilated again on two of the sprigs but     from ff where the aqua fortis had dropped upwards dead and     withered but those below on the same sprig green and closing upon     the touch and are so to this day august 14      with a pair of scissers as suddenly as it could be done one of the     leaves bb was clipped off in the middle upon which that pair and the     pair above closed presently after a little interval dd then ee and     so the rest of the pairs to the bottom of the sprig and then the     motion began in the lower pairs ll on the other sprigs and so shut     them by pairs upwards though not with such distinct distances      under a pretty large branch with its sprigs on there lying a large     shell betwixt two and three inches below it there was rubbed on a     strong sented oyl after a little time all the leaves on that sprig     were shut and so they continued all the time of our stay there but at     my returne the next day i found the position of the shell alterd and     the leaves expanded as before and closing upon the touch      upon the application of the sunbeams by a burningglass the more     humble plant fell the other shut their leaves      we could not so apply the smoak of sulpher as to have any visible     effect from that at two or three times trial but on another trial     the smoak touching the leaves it succeeded      the humble plant fell upon taking off the glass wherewith it was     covered      cutting off one of the little sprouts two or three drops of liquor     were thrust out of the part from whence that was cut very cleer and     pellucid of a bright greenish colour tasting at first a little     bitterish but after leaving a licorishlike taste in my mouth      since going two or three times when it was cold i took the glasses     from the more humble plant and it did not fall as formerly but shut     its leaves onely but coming afterwards when the sun shone very warm     as soon as it was taken off it fell as before      since i pluckd off another sprig whose leaves were all shut and had     been so some time thinking to observe the liquor should come from that     i had broken off but finding none though with pressing to come i     as dexterously as i could pulld off one whose leaves were expanded     and then had upon the shutting of the leaves a little of the mentiond     liquor from the end of the sprig i had broken from the plant and this     twice successively as often almost as i durst rob the plant      but my curiosity carrying me yet further i cut off one of the harder     branches of the stronger plant and there came of the liquor both from     that i had cut and that i had cut it from without pressure      which made me think that the motion of this plant upon touching might     be from this that there being a constant intercourse betwixt every     part of this plant and its root either by a circulation of this     liquor or a constant pressing of the subtiler parts of it to every     extremity of the plant upon every pressure from whatsoever it     proceeds greater then that which keeps it up the subtile parts of     this liquor are thrust downwards towards its articulations of the     leaves where not having room presently to get into the sprig the     little round pedunculus from whence the spine and those oblique     fibres i mentioned rise being dilated the spine and fibres     being continued from it must be contracted and shortned and so draw     the leaf upwards to joyn with its fellow in the same condition with it     self where being closed they are held together by the implications     of the little whitish hair as well as by the still retreating liquor     which distending the fibres that are continued lower to the branch     and root shorten them above and when the liquor is so much forced     from the sprout whose fibres are yet tender and not able to support     themselves but by that tensness which the liquor filling their     interstices gives them the sprout hangs and flags      but perhaps he that had the ability and leisure to give you the exact     anatomy of this pretty plant to shew you its fibres and visible     canales through which this fine liquor circulateth or is moved and     had the faculty of better and more copiously expressing his     observations and conceptions such a one would easily from the motion     of this liquor solve all the ph√¶nomena and would not fear to     affirm that it is no obscure sensation this plant hath but i have     said too much i humbly submit and am ready to stand corrected  i have not yet made so full and satisfactory observations as i desire on this plant which seems to be a subject that will afford abundance of information but as farr as i have had opportunity to examine it i have discovered with my microscope very curious structures and contrivances but designing much more accurate examinations and trials both with my microscope and otherwise as soon as the season will permit i shall not till then add any thing of what i have already taken notice of but as farr as i have yet observd i judge the motion of it to proceed from causes very differing from those by which gutstrings or lutestrings the beard of a wilde oat or the beard of the seeds of geranium mosscatum or muskgrass and other kinds of cranesbill move themselves of which i shall add more in the subsequent observations on those bodies                                        observ xix of a plant growing in the blighted or yellow specks of damaskroseleaves brambleleaves and some other kind of leaves  i have for several years together in the moneths of june july august and september when any of the green leaves of roses begin to dry and grow yellow observd many of them especially the leaves of the old shrubs of damask roses all bespecked with yellow stains and the undersides just against them to have little yellow hillocks of a gummous substance and several of them to have small black spots in the midst of those yellow ones which to the naked eye appeard no bigger then the point of a pin or the smallest black spot or tittle of ink one is able to make with a very sharp pointed pen  examining these with a microscope i was able plainly to distinguish up and down the surface several small yellow knobs of a kind of yellowish red gummy substance out of which i perceivd there sprung multitudes of little cases or black bodies like seedcods and those of them that were quite without the hillock of gumm disclosd themselves to grow out of it with a small strawcolourd and transparent stem the which seed and stem appeard very like those of common moss which i elsewhere describe but that they were abundantly less many hundreds of them being not able to equalize one single seed cod of moss  i have often doubted whether they were the seed cods of some little plant or some kind of small buds or the eggs of some very small insect they appeard of a dark brownish red some almost quite black and of a figure much resembling the seedcod of moss but their stalks on which they grew were of a very fine transparent substance almost like the stalk of mould but that they seemd somewhat more yellow  that which makes me to suppose them to be vegetables is for that i perceivd many of those hillocks bare or destitute as if those bodies lay yet conceald as g in others of them they were just springing out of their gummy hillocks which all seemd to shoot directly outwards as at a in others as at b i found them just gotten out with very little or no stalk and the cods of an indifferent cize but in others as c i found them begin to have little short stalks or stems in others as d those stems were grown bigger and larger and in others as at e f h i k l c those stems and cods were grown a great deal bigger and the stalks were more bulky about the root and very much taperd towards the top as at f and l is most visible  i did not find that any of them had any seed in them or that any of them were hollow but as they grew bigger and bigger i found those heads or cods begin to turn their tops towards their roots in the same manner as i had observd that of moss to do so that in all likelihood nature did intend in that posture what she does in the like seedcods of greater bulk that is that the seed when ripe should be shaken out and dispersed at the end of it as we find in columbine cods and the like  the whole oval oooo in the second figure of the 12 scheme represents a small part of a rose leaf about the bigness of the little oval in the hillock c marked with the figure x in which i have not particularly observd all the other forms of the surface of the roseleaf as being little to my present purpose  now if these cods have a seed in them so proportiond to the cod as thole of pinks and carnations and columbines and the like how unimaginably small must each of those seeds necessarily be for the whole length of one of the largest of those cods was not 1500 part of an inch some not above 11000 and therefore certainly very many thousand of them would be unable to make a bulk that should be visible to the naked eye and if each of these contain the rudiments of a young plant of the same kind what must we say of the pores and constituent parts of that  the generation of this plant seems in part ascribable to a kind of mildew or blight whereby the parts of the leaves grow scabby or putrifyd as it were so as that the moisture breaks out in little scabs or spots which as i said before look like little knobs of a red gummous substance  from this putrifyd scabb breaks out this little vegetable which may be somewhat like a mould or moss and may have its equivocal generation much after the same manner as i have supposed moss or mould to have and to be a more simple and uncompounded kind of vegetation which is set a moving by the putrifactive and fermentative heat joynd with that of the ambient aerial when by the putrifaction and decay of some other parts of the vegetable that for a while staid its progress it is unfetterd and left at liberty to move in its former course but by reason of its regulators moves and acts after quite another manner then it did when a coagent in the more compounded machine of the more perfect vegetable  and from this very same principle i imagine the misleto of oaks thorns appletrees and other trees to have its original it seldom or never growing on any of those trees till they begin to wax decrepid and decay with age and are pesterd with many other infirmities  hither also may be referrd those multitudes and varieties of mushroms such as that calld jewsears all sorts of gray and green mosses c which infest all kind of trees shrubs and the like especially when they come to any bigness and this we see to be very much the method of nature throughout its operations putrifactive vegetables very often producing a vegetable of a much less compounded nature and of a much inferiour tribe and putrefactive animal substances degenerating into some kind of animal production of a much inferiour rank and of a more simple nature  thus we find the humours and substances of the body upon putrifaction to produce strange kinds of moving vermine the putrifaction of the slimes and juices of the stomack and guts produce worms almost like earthworms the wheals in childrens hands produce a little worm calld a whealworm the bloud and milk and other humours produce other kinds of worms at least if we may believe what is deliverd to us by very famous authors though i confess i have not yet been able to discover such my self  and whereas it may seem strange that vinegar meal musty casks c are observd to breed their differing kinds of insects or living creatures whereas they being vegetable substances seem to be of an inferiour kind and so unable to produce a creature more noble or of a more compounded nature then they themselves are of and so without some concurrent seminal principle may be thought utterly unfit for such an operation i must add that we cannot presently positively say there are no animal substances either mediately as by the soil or fatning of the plant from whence they sprung or more immediately by the real mixture or composition of such substances joind with them or perchance some kind of insect in such places where such kind of putrifying or fermenting bodies are may by a certain instinct of nature eject some sort of seminal principle which cooperating with various kinds of putrifying substances may produce various kinds of insects or animate bodies for we find in most sorts of those lower degrees of animate bodies that the putrifying substances on which these eggs seeds or seminal principles are cast by the insect become as it were the matrices or wombs that conduce very much to their generation and may perchance also to their variation and alteration much after the same manner as by strange and unnatural copulations several new kinds of animals are producd as mules and the like which are usually calld monstrous because a little unusual though many of them have all their principal parts as perfectly shapd and adapted for their peculiar uses as any of the most perfect animals if therefore the putrifying body on which any kind of seminal or vital principle chances to be cast become somewhat more then meerly a nursing and fostering helper in the generation and production of any kind of animate body the more neer it approaches the true nature of a womb the more power will it have on the byblow it incloses but of this somewhat more in the description of the watergnat perhaps some more accurate enquiries and observations about these matters might bring the question to some certainty which would be of no small concern in natural philosophy  but that putrifying animal substances may produce animals of an inferior kind i see not any so very great a difficulty but that one may without much absurdity admit for as there may be multitudes of contrivances that go to the making up of one compleat animate body so that some of those coadjutors in the perfect existence and life of it may be vitiated and the life of the whole destroyed and yet several of the constituting contrivances remain intire i cannot think it beyond imagination or possibility no more then that a like accidental process as i have elswhere hinted may also be supposed to explicate the method of nature in the metamorphosis of plants and though the difference between a plant and an animal be very great yet i have not hitherto met with any so cogent an argument as to make me positive in affirming these two to be altogether heterogeneous and of quite differing kinds of nature and besides as there are many zoophyts and sensitive plants divers of which i have seen which are of a middle nature and seem to be natures transition from one degree to another which may be observd in all her other passages wherein she is very seldom observd to leap from one step to another so have we in some authors instances of plants turning into animals and animals into plants and the like and some other very strange because unheeded proceedings of nature something of which kind may be met with in the description of the watergnat though it be not altogether so direct to the present purpose  but to refer this discourse of animals to their proper places i shall add that though one should suppose or it should be provd by observations that several of these kinds of plants are accidentally producd by a casual purifaction i see not any great reason to question but that notwithstanding its own production was as twere casual yet it may germinate and produce seed and by it propagate its own that is a new species for we do not know but that the omnipotent and allwise creator might as directly design the structure of such a vegetable or such an animal to be producd out of such or such a putrifaction or change of this or that body towards the constitution or structure of which he knew it necessary or thought it fit to make it an ingredient as that the digestion or moderate heating of an egg either by the female or the sun or the heat of the fire or the like should produce this or that bird or that putrifactive and warm steams should out of the blowings as they call them that is the eggs of a flie produce a living magot and that by degrees be turnd into an aurelia and that by a longer and a proportiond heat be transmuted into a fly nor need we therefore to suppose it the more imperfect in its kind then the more compounded vegetable or animal of which it is a part for he might as compleatly furnish it with all kinds of contrivances necessary for its own existence and the propagation of its own species and yet make it a part of a more compounded body as a clockmaker might make a set of chimes to be a part of a clock and yet when the watch part or striking part are taken away and the hindrances of its motion removd this chiming part may go as accurately and strike its tune as exactly as if it were still a part of the compounded automaton so though the original cause or seminal principle from which this minute plant on rose leaves did spring were before the corruption causd by the milldew a component part of the leaf on which it grew and did serve as a coagent in the production and constitution of it yet might it be so consummate as to produce a seed which might have a power of propagating the same species the works of the creator seeming of such an excellency that though they are unable to help to the perfecting of the more compounded existence of the greater plant or animal they may have notwithstanding an ability of acting singly upon their own internal principle so as to produce a vegetable body though of a less compounded nature and to proceed so farr in the method of other vegetables as to bear flowers and seeds which may be capabale of propagating the like so that the little cases which appear to grow on the top of the slender stalks may for ought i know though i should suppose them to spring from the perverting of the usual course of the parent vegetable contain a seed which being scatterd on other leaves of the same plant may produce a plant of much the same kind  nor are damaskrose leaves the onely leaves that produce these kinds of vegetable sproutings for i have observd them also in several other kinds of rose leaves and on the leaves of several sorts of briers and on bramble leaves they are oftentimes to be found in very great clusters so that i have found in one cluster three four or five hundred of them making a very conspicuous black spot or scab on the back side of the leaf                                        observ xx of blue mould and of the first principles of vegetation arising from putrefaction  the blue and white and several kinds of hairy mouldy spots which are observable upon divers kinds of putrifyd bodies whether animal substances or vegetable such as the skin raw or dressd flesh bloud humours milk green cheese c or rotten sappy wood or herbs leaves barks roots c of plants are all of them nothing else but several kinds of small and variously figurd mushroms which from convenient materials in those putrifying bodies are by the concurrent heat of the air excited to a certain kind of vegetation which will not be unworthy our more serious speculation and examination as i shall by and by shew but first i must premise a short description of this specimen which i have added of this tribe in the first figure of the xii scheme which is nothing else but the appearance of a small white spot of hairy mould multitudes of which i found to bespeck  whiten over the red covers of a small book which it seems were of sheeps skin that being more apt to gather mould even in a dry and clean room then other leathers these spots appeard through a good microscope to be a very pretty shapd vegetative body which from almost the same part of the leather shot out multitudes of small long cylindrical and transparent stalks not exactly streight but a little bended with the weight of a round and white knob that grew on the top of each of them many of these knobs i observd to be very round and of a smooth surface such as a a c others smooth likewise but a little oblong as b several of them a little broken or cloven with chops at the top as c others flitterd as twere or flown all to pieces as d d the whole substance of these pretty bodies was of a very tender constitution much like the substance of the softer kind of common white mushroms for by touching them with a pin i found them to be brused and torn they seemd each of them to have a distinct root of their own for though they grew neer together in a cluster yet i could perceive each stem to rise out of a distinct part or pore of the leather some of these were small and short as seeming to have been but newly sprung up of these the balls were for the most part round others were bigger and taller as being perhaps of a longer growth and of these for the most part the heads were broken and some much wasted as e what these heads containd i could not perceive whether they were knobs and flowers or seed cases i am not able to say but they seemd most likely to be of the same nature with those that grow on mushroms which they did some of them not a little resemble  both their smell and taste which are active enough to make a sensible impression upon those organs are unpleasant and noisome  i could not find that they would so quickly be destroyd by the actual flame of a candle as at first sight of them i conceived they would be but they remaind intire after i had past that part of the leather on which they stuck three or four times through the flame of a candle so that it seems they are not very apt to take fire no more then the common white mushroms are when they are sappy  there are a multitude of other shapes of which these microscopical mushroms are figurd which would have been a long work to have described and would not have suited so well with my design in this treatise onely amongst the rest i must not forget to take notice of one that was a little like to or resembled a spunge consisting of a multitude of little ramifications almost as that body does which indeed seems to be a kind of watermushrom of a very pretty texture as i elsewhere manifest and a second which i must not omit because often mingled and neer adjoining to these i have describd and this appeard much like a thicket of bushes or brambles very much branchd and extended some of them to a great length in proportion to their diameter like creeping brambles  the manner of the growth and formation of this kind of vegetable is the third head of enquiry which had i time i should follow the figure and method of generation in this concrete seeming to me next after the enquiry into the formation figuration or chrystalization of salts to be the most simple plain and easie and it seems to be a medium through which he must necessarily pass that would with any likelihood investigate the forma informans of vegetables for as i think that he shall find it a very difficult task who undertakes to discover the form of saline crystallizations without the consideration and prescience of the nature and reason of a globular form and as difficult to explicate this configuration of mushroms without the previous consideration of the form of salts so will the enquiry into the forms of vegetables be no less if not much more difficult without the foreknowledge of the forms of mushroms these several enquiries having no less dependance one upon another then any select number of propositions in mathematical elements may be made to have  nor do i imagine that the skips from the one to another will be found very great if beginning from fluidity or body without any form we descend gradually till we arrive at the highest form of a bruite animals soul making the steps or foundations of our enquiry fluidity orbiculation fixation angulization or crystallization germination or ebullition vegetation plantanimation animation sensation imagination  now that we may the better proceed in our enquiry it will be requisite to consider  first that mould and mushroms require no seminal property but the former may be producd at any time from any kind of putrifying animal or vegetable substance as flesh c kept moist and warm and the latter if what mathiolus relates be true of making them by art are as much within our command of which matter take the epitomie which mr parkinson has deliverd in his herbal in his chapter of mushroms because i have not mathiolus now by me unto these mushroms saith he may also be adjoynd those which are made of art whereof mathiolus makes mention that grow naturally among certain stones in naples and that the stones being diggd up and carried to rome and other places where they set them in their wine cellars covering them with a little earth and sprinkling a little warm water thereon would within four days produce mushroms fit to be eaten at what time one will as also that mushroms may be made to grow at the foot of a wilde poplar tree within four days after warm water wherein some leaves have been dissolvd shall be pourd into the root which must be slit and the stock above ground  next that as mushroms may be generated without seed so does it not appear that they have any such thing as seed in any part of them for having considered several kinds of them i could never find any thing in them that i could with any probability ghess to be the seed of it so that it does not as yet appear that i know of that mushroms may be generated from a seed but they rather seem to depend merely upon a convenient constitution of the matter out of which they are made and a concurrence of either natural or artificial heat  thirdly that by several bodies as salts and metals both in water and in the air and by several kinds of sublimations in the air actuated and guided with a congruous heat there may be producd several kinds of bodies as curiously if not of a more composd figure several kinds of rising or ebulliating figures seem to manifest as witness the shooting in the rectification of spirits of urine harthorn bloud c witness also the curious branches of evaporated dissolutions some of them against the sides of the containing jar others standing up or growing an end out of the bottom of which i have taken notice of a very great variety but above all the rest it is a very pretty kind of germination which is afforded us in the silver tree the manner of making which with mercury and silver is well known to the chymists in which there is an ebullition or germination very much like this of mushroms if i have been rightly informd of it  fourthly i have very often taken notice of and also observd with a microscope certain excrescencies or ebullitions in the snuff of a candle which partly from the sticking of the smoaky particles as they are carryed upwards by the current of the rarifyd air and flame and partly also from a kind of germination or ebullition of some actuated unctuous parts which creep along and filter through some small string of the week are formed into pretty round and uniform heads very much resembling the form of hooded mushroms which being by any means exposd to the fresh air or that air which encompasses the flame they are presently lickd up and devourd by it and vanish  the reason of which ph√¶nomenon seems to me to be no other then this  that when a convenient thread of the week is so bent out by the sides of the snuff that are about half an inch or more removd above the bottom or lowest part of the flame and that this part be wholly included in the flame the oyl for the reason of filtration which i have elsewhere rendred being continualy driven up the snuff is driven likewise into this ragged bendedend and this being removd a good distance as half an inch or more above the bottom of the flame the parts of the air that passes by it are already almost satiated with the dissolution of the boiling unctuous steams that issued out below and therefore are not onely glutted that is can dissolve no more then what they are already acting upon but they carry up with them abundance of unctuous and sooty particles which meeting with that rag of the week that is plentifully filld with oyl and onely spends it as fast as it evaporates and not at all by dissolution or burning by means of these steamy parts of the filterated oyl issuing out at the sides of this ragg and being inclosd with an air that is already satiated and cannot prey upon them nor burn them the ascending sooty particles are stayd about it and fixd so as that about the end of that ragg or filament of the snuff whence the greatest part of the steams issue there is conglobated or fixd a round and pretty uniform cap much resembling the head of a mushrom which if it be of any great bigness you may observe that its underside will be bigger then that which is above the ragg or stem of it for the oyl that is brought into it by filtration being by the bulk of the cap a little shelterd from the heat of the flame does by that means issue as much out beneath from the stalk or downwards as it does upwards and by reason of the great access of the adventitious smoak from beneath it increases most that way that this may be the true reason of this ph√¶nomenon i could produce many arguments and experiments to make it probable as  first that the filtration carries the oyl to the top of the week at least as high as these raggs is visible to one that will observe the snuff of a burning candle with a microscope where he may see an ebullition or bubbling of the oyl as high as the snuff looks black  next that it does steam away more then burn i could tell you of the dim burning of a candle the longer the snuff be which arises from the abundance of vapours out of the higher parts of it  and thirdly that in the middle of the flame of the candle neer the top of the snuff the fire or dissolving principle is nothing neer so strong as neer the bottom and out edges of the flame which may be observd by the burning asunder of a thread that will first break in those parts that the edges of the flame touch and not in the middle  and i could add several observables that i have taken notice of in the flame of a lamp actuated with bellows and very many others that confirm me in my opinion but that it is not so much to my present purpose which is onely to consider this concreet in the snuff of a candle so farr as it has any resemblance of a mushrom to the consideration of which that i may return i say we may also observe  in the fifth place that the droppings or trillings of lapidescent waters in vaults under ground seem to constitute a kind of petrifyd body formd almost like some kind of mushroms inverted in so much that i have seen some knobbd a little at the lower end though for the most part indeed they are otherwise shapd and taperd towards the end the generation of which seems to be from no other reason but this that the water by soaking through the earth and lime for i ghess that substance to add much to it petrifying quality does so impregnate it self with stony particles that hanging in drops in the roof of the vault by reason that the soaking of the water is but slow it becomes exposd to the air and thereby the outward part of the drop by degrees grows hard by reason that the water gradually evaporating the stony particles neer the outsides of the drop begin to touch and by degrees to dry and grow closer together and at length constitute a crust or shell about the drop and this soaking by degrees being more and more supplyd the drop grows longer and longer and the sides harden thicker and thicker into a quill or cane and at length that hollow or pith becomes almost stopd up and solid afterwards the soaking of the petrifying water finding no longer a passage through the middle bursts out and trickles down the outside and as the water evaporates leaves new superinducd shells which more and more swell the bulk of those iceicles and because of the great supply from the vault of petrifying wafer those bodies grow bigger and bigger next to the vault and taper or sharpen towards the point for the access from the arch of the vault being but very slow and consequently the water being spread very thinly over the surface of the iceicle the water begins to settle before it can reach to the bottom or corner end of it whence if you break one of these you would almost imagine it a stick of wood petrifyd it having so pretty a resemblance of pith and grain and if you look on the outside of a piece or of one whole you would think no less both from its vegetable roundness and tapering form but whereas all vegetables are observd to shoot and grow perpendicularly upwards this does shoot or propend directly downwards  by which last observables we see that there may be a very pretty body shapd and concreeted by mechanical principles without the least shew or probability of any other seminal formatrix  and since we find that the great reason of the ph√¶nomena of this pretty petrifaction are to be reducd from the gravity of a fluid and pretty volatil body impregnated with stony particles why may not the ph√¶nomena of ebullition or germination be in part possibly enough deducd from the levity of an impregnated liquor which therefore perpendicularly ascending by degrees evaporates and leaves the more solid and fixd parts behind in the form of a mushrom which is yet further diversifyd and specificated by the forms of the parts that impregnated the liquor and compose or help to constitute the mushrom  that the forementiond figures of growing salts and the silver tree are from this principle i could very easily manifest but that i have not now a convenient opportunity of following it nor have i made a sufficient number of experiments and observations to propound explicate and prove so usefull a theory as this of mushroms for though the contrary principle to that of petrifyd iceicles may be in part a cause yet i cannot but think that there is somewhat a more complicated caufe though yet mechanical and possible to be explaind  we therefore have further to enquire of it what makes it to be such a liquor and to ascend whether the heat of the sun and air or whether that firmentiation and putrifaction or both together as also whether there be not a third or fourth whether a saline principle be not a considerable agent in this business also as well as heat whether also a fixation precipitation or settling of certain parts out of the aerial menstruum may not be also a considerable coadjutor in the business since we find that many pretty beards stiri√¶ of the particles of silver may be precipitated upon a piece of brass put into a solution of silver very much diluted with fair water which look not unlike a kind of mould or hoar upon that piece of metal and the hoar frost looks like a kind of mould and whether there may not be several others that do concurr to the production of a mushrom having not yet had sufficient time to prosecute according to my desires i must referr this to a better opportunity of my own or leave and recommend it to the more diligent enquiry and examination of such as can be masters both of leisure and conveniencies for such an enquiry  and in the mean time i must conclude that as far as i have been able to look into the nature of this primary kind of life and vegetation i cannot find the least probable argument to perswade me there is any other concurrent cause then such as is purely mechanical and that the effects or productions are as necessary upon the concurrence of those causes as that a ship when the sails are hoist up and the rudder is set to such a position should when the wind blows be movd in such a way or course to that or tother place or as that the brused watch which i mention in the description of moss should when those parts which hindred its motion were fallen away begin to move but after quite another manner then it did before                                        observ xxi of moss and several other smallvegetative substances  moss is a plant that the wisest of kings thought neither unworthy his speculation nor his pen and though amongst plants it be in bulk one of the smallest yet it is not the least considerable for as to its shape it may compare for the beauty of it with any plant that grows and bears a much bigger breadth it has a root almost like a seedy parsnep furnishd with small strings and suckers which are all of them finely branchd like those of the roots of much bigger vegetables out of this springs the stem or body of the plant which is somewhat quadrangular rather then cylindrical most curiously fluted or lining with small creases which run for the most part parallel the whole stem on the sides of this are close and thick set a multitude of fair large wellshapd leaves some of them of a rounder others of a longer shape according as they are younger or older when pluckd as i ghess by this that those plants that had the stalks growing from the top of them had their leaves of a much longer shape all the surface of each side of which is curiously coverd with a multitude of little oblong transparent bodies in the manner as you see it expressd in the leaf b in the xiii scheme  this plant when young and springing up does much resemble a housleek having thick leaves almost like that and seems to be somwhat of kin to it in other particulars also from the top of the leaves there shoots out a small white and transparent hair or thorn this stem in time come to shoot out into a long round and even stalk which by cutting transversly when dry i manifestly found to be a stiff hard and hollow cane or reed without any kind of knot or stop from its bottom where the leaves encompassd it to the top on which there grows a large seed case a coverd with a thin and more whitish skin b terminated in a long thorny top which at first covers all the case and by degrees as that swells the skin cleaves and at length falls off with its thorny top and all which is a part of it and leaves the seed case to ripen and by degrees to shatter out its seed at a place underneath this cap b which before the seed is ripe appears like a flat barrd button without any hole in the middle but as it ripens the button grows bigger and a hole appears in the middle of it e out of which in all probability the seed falls for as it ripens by a provision of nature that end of this case turns downward after the same manner as the ears of wheat and barley usually do and opening several of these dry red cases f i found them to be quite hollow without anything at all in them whereas when i cut them asunder with a sharp penknife when green i found in the middle of this great case another smaller round case between which two the interstices were filld with multitudes of stringie fibres which seemd to suspend the lesser case in the middle of the other which as farr as i was able to discern seemd full of exceeding small white seeds much like the seedbagg in the knop of a carnation after the flowers have been two or three days or a week fallen off but this i could not so perfectly discern and therefore cannot positively affirm it  after the seed was fallen away i found both the case stalk and plant all grow red and wither and from other parts of the root continually to spring new branches or slips which by degrees increased and grew as bigg as the former seeded ripend shatterd and witherd  i could not find that it observd any particular seasons for these several kinds of growth but rather found it to be springing mature ripe seedy and witherd at all times of the year but i found it most to flourish and increase in warm and moist weather  it gathers its nourishments for the most part out of some lapidescent or other substance corrupted or changd from its former texture or substantial form for i have found it to grow on the rotten parts of stone of bricks of wood of bones of leather c  it oft grows on the barks of several trees spreading it self sometimes from the ground upwards and sometimes from some chink or cleft of the bark of the tree which has some putrifyd substance in it but this seems of a distinct kind from that which i observd to grow on putrifyd inanimate bodies and rotten earth  there are also great varieties of other kinds of mosses which grow on trees and several other plants of which i shall here make no mention nor of the moss growing on the skull of a dead man which much resembles that of trees  whether this plant does sometimes originally spring or rise out of corruption without any disseminated seed i have not yet made trials enough to be very much either positive or negative for as it seems very hard to conceive how the seed should be generally dispersd into all parts where there is a corruption begun unless we may rationally suppose that this seed being so exceeding small and consequently exceeding light is thereby taken up and carried to and fro in the air into every place and by the falling drops of rain is washd down out of it and so dispersd into all places and there onely takes root and propagates where it finds a convenient soil or matrix for it to thrive in so if we will have it to proceed from corruption it is not less difficult to conceive  first how the corruption of any vegetable much less of any stone or brick should be the parent of so curiously figurd and so perfect a plant as this is but here indeed i cannot but add that it seems rather to be a product of the rain in those bodies where it is stayd then of the very bodies themselves since i have found it growing on marble and flint but always the microscope if not the naked eye would discover some little hole of dirt in which it was rooted  next how the corruption of each of those exceedingly differing bodies should all conspire to the production of the same plant that is that stones bricks wood or vegetable substances and bones leather horns or animate substances unless we may with some plausibleness say that air and water are the coadjutors or menstruums all kinds of putrifactions and that thereby the bodies though whilst they retaind their substantial forms were of exceeding differing natures yet since they are dissolvd and mixt into another they may be very homogeneous they being almost resolvd again into air water and earth retaining perhaps one part of their vegetative faculty yet entire which meeting with congruous assistants such as the heat of the air and the fluidity of the water and such like coadjutors and conveniences acquires a certain vegetation for a time wholly differing perhaps from that kind of vegetation it had before  to explain my meaning a little better by a gross similitude  suppose a curious piece of clockwork that had had several motions and contrivances in it which when in order would all have movd in their designd methods and periods we will further suppose by some means that this clock comes to be broken brused or otherwise disordered so that several parts of it being dislocated are impeded and so stand still and not onely hinder its own progressive motion and produce not the effect which they were designd for but because the other parts also have a dependence upon them put a stop to their motion likewise and so the whole instrument becomes unserviceable and not fit for any use this instrument afterwards by some shaking and tumbling and throwing up and down comes to have several of its parts shaken out and several of its curious motions and contrivances and particles all fallen asunder here a pin falls out and there a pillar and here a wheel and there a hammer and a spring and the like and among the rest away falls those parts also which were brused and disorderd and had all this while impeded the motion of all the rest hereupon several of those other motions that yet remain whole springs were not quite run down being now at liberty begin each of them to move thus or thus but quite after another method then before there being many regulating parts and the like fallen away and lost upon this the owner who chances to hear and observe some of these effects being ignorant of the watchmakers art wonders what is betid his clock and presently imagines that some artist has been at work and has set his clock in order and made a new kind of instrument of it but upon examining circumstances he finds there was no such matter but that the casual slipping out of a pin had made several parts of his clock fall to pieces and that thereby the obstacle that all this while hindred his clock together with other usefull parts were fallen out and so his clock was set at liberty and upon winding up those springs again when run down he finds his clock to go but quite after another manner then it was wont heretofore  and thus may it be perhaps in the business of moss and mould and mushroms and several other spontaneous kinds of vegetations which may be causd by a vegetative principle which was a coadjutor to the life and growth of the greater vegetable and was by the destroying of the life of it stopt and impeded in performing its office but afterwards upon a further corruption of several parts that had all the while impeded it the heat of the sun winding up as it were the spring sets it again into a vegetative motion and this being single and not at all regulated as it was before when a part of that greater machine the pristine vegetable is movd after quite a differing manner and produces effects very differing from those it did before  but this i propound onely as a conjecture not that i am more enclind to this hypothesis then the seminal which upon good reason i ghess to be mechanical also as i may elsewhere more fully shew but because i may by this hint a possible way how this appearance may be solvd supposing we should be driven to confess from certain experiments and observations made that such or such vegetables were producd out of the corruption of another without any concurrent seminal principle as i have given some reason to suppose in the description of a microscopical mushrome without derogating at all from the infinite wisdom of the creator for this accidental production as i may call it does manifest as much if not very much more of the excellency of his contrivance as any thing in the more perfect vegetative bodies of the world even as the accidental motion of the automaton does make the owner see that there was much more contrivance in it then at first he imagind but of this i have added more in the description of mould and the vegetables on rose leaves c those being much more likely to have their original from such a cause then this which i have here described in the 13 scheme which indeed i cannot conceive otherwise of then as of a most perfect vegetable wanting nothing of the perfections of the most conspicuous and vastest vegetables of the world and to be of a rank so high as that it may very properly be reckond with the tall cedar of lebanon as that kingly botanist has done  we know there may be as much curiosity of contrivance and excellency of form in a very small pocketclock that takes not up an inch square of room as there may be in a churchclock that fills a whole room and i know not whether all the contrivances and mechanisms requisite to a perfect vegetable may not be crowded into an exceedingly less room then this of moss as i have heard of a striking watch so small that it servd for a pendant in a ladies ear and i have already given you the description of a plant growing on rose leaves that is abundantly smaller then moss insomuch that neer 1000 of them would hardly make the bigness of one single plant of moss and by comparing the bulk of moss with the bulk of the biggest kind of vegetable we meet with in story of which kind we find in some hotter climates as guine and brasile the stock or body of some trees to be twenty foot in diameter whereas the body or stem of moss for the most part is not above one sixtieth part of an inch we shall find that the bulk of the one will exceed the bulk of the other no less then 2985984 millions or 2985984000000 and supposing the production on a rose leaf to be a plant we shall have of those indian plants to exceed a production of the same vegetable kingdom no less then 1000 times the former number so prodigiously various are the works of the creator and so allsufficient is he to perform what to man would seem unpossible they being both alike easie to him even as one day and a thousand years are to him as one and the same time  i have taken notice of such an infinite variety of those smaller kinds of vegetations that should i have described every one of them they would almost have filld a volume and provd bigg enough to have made a new herbal such multitudes are there to be found in moist hot weather especially in the summer time on all kind of putrifying substances which whether they do more properly belong to the classis of mushrooms or moulds or mosses i shall not now dispute there being some that seem more properly of one kind others of another their colours and magnitudes being as much differing as their figures and substances  nay i have observd that putting fair water whether rainwater or pumpwater or maydew or snowwater it was almost all one i have often observd i say that this water would with a little standing tarnish and cover all about the sides of the glass that lay under water with a lovely green but though i have often endeavourd to discover with my microscope whether this green were like moss or long striped seaweed or any other peculiar form yet so ill and imperfect are our microscopes that i could not certainly discriminate any  growing trees also and any kinds of woods stones bones c that have been long exposd to the air and rain will be all over coverd with a greenish scurff which will very much foul and green any kind of cloaths that are rubbd against it viewing this i could not certainly perceive in many parts of it any determinate form though in many i could perceive a bed as twere of young moss but in other parts it lookd almost like green bushes and very confusd but always of what ever irregular figures the parts appeard of they were always green and seemd to be either some vegetable or to have some vegetating principle                                        observ xxii of common sponges and several other spongie fibrous bodies  a sponge is commonly reckond among the zoophyts or plant animals and the texture of it which the microscope discovers seems to confirm it for it is of a form whereof i never observd any other vegetable and indeed it seems impossible that any should be of it for it consists of an infinite number of small short fibres or nervous parts much of the same bigness curiously jointed or contexd together in the form of a net as is more plainly manifest by the little draught which i have added in the third figure of the ix scheme of a piece of it which you may perceive represents a confusd heap of the fibrous parts curiously jointed and implicated the joints are for the most part where three fibres onely meet for i have very seldom met with any that had four  at these joints there is no one of the three that seems to be the stock whereon the other grow but each of the fibres are for the most part of an equal bigness and seem each of them to have an equal share in the joint the fibres are all of them much about the same bigness not smaller towards the top of the sponge and bigger neerer the bottom or root as is usuall in plants the length of each between the joints is very irregular and different the distance between some two joints being ten or twelve times more then between some others  nor are the joints regular and of an equitriagonal figure but for the most part the three fibres so meet that they compose three angles very differing all of them from one another  the meshes likewise and holes of this reticulated body are not less various and irregular some bilateral others trilateral and quadrilateral figures nay i have observd some meshes to have 5 6 7 8 or 9 sides and some to have onely one so exceeding various is the lusus natur√¶ in this body  as to the outward appearance of this vegetative body they are so usuall everywhere that i need not describe them consisting of a soft and porous substance representing a lock sometimes a fleece of wooll but it has besides these small microscopical pores which lie between the fibres a multitude of round pores or holes which from the top of it pierce into the body and sometimes go quite through to the bottom  i have observd many of these sponges to have included likewise in the midst of their fibrous contextures pretty large friable stones which must either have been inclosd whilst this vegetable was in formation or generated in those places after it was perfectly shapd the later of which seems the more improbable because i did not find that any of these stony substances were perforated with the fibres of the sponge  i have never seen nor been enformd of the true manner of the growing of sponges on the rock whether they are found to increase from little to great like vegetables that is part after part or like animals all parts equally growing together or whether they be matrices or feedbaggs of any kind of fishes or some kind of watry insect or whether they are at any times more soft and tender or of another nature and texture which things if i knew how i should much desire to be informed of but from a cursory view that i at first made with my microscope and some other trials i supposed it to be some animal substance cast out and fastned upon the rocks in the form of a froth or congeries of bubbles like that which i have often observd on rosemary and other plants wherein is included a little insect that all the little films which divide these bubbles one from another did presently almost after the substance began to grow a little harder break and leave onely the thread behind which might be as twere the angle or thread between the bubbles that the great holes or pores observable in these sponges were made by the eruption of the included heterogeneous substance whether air or some other body for many other fluid bodies will do the same thing which breaking out of the lesser were collected into very large bubbles and so might make their way out of the sponge and in their passage might leave a round cavity and if it were large might carry up with it the adjacent bubbles which may be perceivd at the outside of the sponge if it be first throughly wetted and sufferrd to plump itself into its natural form or be then wrung dry and sufferd to expand it self again which it will freely do whilst moist for when it has thus plumpd it self into its natural shape and dimensions tis obvious enough that the mouths of the larger holes have a kind of lip or rising round about them but the other smaller pores have little or none it may further be found that each of these great pores has many other small pores below that are united unto it and help to constitute it almost like so many rivulets or small streams that contribute to the maintenance of a large river nor from this hypothesis would it have been difficult to explicate how those little branches of coral smal stones shells and the like come to be included by these frothy bodies but this inded was but a conjecture and upon a more accurate enquiry into the form of it with the microscope it seems not to be the true origine of them for whereas sponges have onely three arms which join together at each knot if they had been generated from bubbles they must have had four  but that they are animal substances the chymical examination of them seems to manifest they affording a volatil salt and spirit like hartshorn as does also their great strength and toughness and their smell when burnd in the fire or a candle which has a kind of fleshy sent not much unlike to hair and having since examind several authors concerning them among others i find this account given by bellonius in the xi chap of his 2d book de aquatilibus spongi√¶ recentes says he √† siccis longe divers√¶ scopulis aqu√¶ marin√¶ ad duos vel tres cubitos nonnunquam quatuor tantum digitos immersis ut fungi arboribus adh√¶rent sordido quodam succo aut mucosa potius sanie refert√¶ usque ade√≤ foetida ut vel

latent inferne ver√≤ quaterni aut quini patent per quos eas sugere existimamus from which description they seem to be a kind of plantanimal that adheres to a rock and these small fibres or threads which we have described seem to have been the vessels which tis very probable were very much bigger whilst the interstitia were filld as he affirms with a mucous pulpy or fleshy substance but upon the drying were shrunk into the bigness they now appear  the texture of it is such that i have not yet met with any other body in the world that has the like but onely one of a larger sort of sponge which is preservd in the museum harveanum belonging to the most illustrious and most learned society of the physicians of london which is of a horney or rather of a petrifyd substance and of this indeed the texture and make is exactly the same with common sponges but onely that both the holes and the fibres or texture of it is exceedingly much bigger for some of the holes were above an inch and half over and the fibres and texture of it was bigg enough to be distinguished easily with ones eye but conspicuously with an ordinary single microscope and these indeed seemd to have been the habitation of some animal and examining aristotle i find a very consonant account hereunto namely that he had known a certain little animal calld pinnothera like a spider to be bred in those caverns of a sponge from within which by opening and closing those holes he insnares and catches the little fishes and in another place he says that tis very confidently reported that there are certain moths or worms that reside in the cavities of a sponge and are there nourished notwithstanding all which histories i think it well worth the enquiring into the history and nature of a sponge it seeming to promise some information of the vessels in animal substances which by reason of the solidity of the interserted flesh that is not easily removd without destroying also those interspersd vessels are hitherto undiscoverd whereas here in a sponge the parenchyma it seems is but a kind of mucous gelly which is very easily and cleerly washd away  the reason that makes me imagine that there may probably be some such texture in animal substances is that examining the texture of the filaments of tannd leather i find it to be much of the same nature and strength of a sponge and with my microscope i have observd many such joints and knobs as i have described in sponges the fibres also in the hollow of several sorts of bones after the marrow has been removd i have found somewhat to resemble this texture though i confess i never yet found any texture exactly the same nor any for curiosity comparable to it  the filaments of it are much smaller then those of silk and through the microscope appear very neer as transparent nay some parts of them i have observd much more  having examind also several kinds of mushroms i finde their texture to be somewhat of this kind that is to consist of an infinite company of small filaments every way contexd and woven together so as to make a kind of cloth and more particularly examining a piece of touchwood which is a kind jewsear or mushrom growing here in england also on several sorts of trees such as elders maples willows c and is commonly calld by the name of spunk but that we meet with to be sold in shops is brought from beyond seas i found it to be made of an exceeding delicate texture for the substance of it feels and looks to the naked eye and may be stretchd any way exactly like a very fine piece of chamois leather or washd leather but it is of somewhat a browner hew and nothing neer so strong but examining it with my microscope i found it of somewhat another make then any kind of leather for whereas both chamois and all other kinds of leather i have yet viewd consist of an infinite company of filaments somewhat like bushes interwoven one within another that is of bigger parts or stems as it were and smaller branchings that grow out of them or like a heap of ropes ends where each of the larger ropes by degrees seem to split or untwist into many smaller cords and each of those cords into smaller lines and those lines into threads c and these strangely intangled or interwoven one within another the texture of this touchwood seems more like that of a lock or a fleece of wool for it consists of an infinite number of small filaments all of them as farr as i could perceive of the same bigness like those of a sponge but that the filaments of this were not a twentieth part of the bigness of those of a sponge and i could not so plainly perceive their joints or their manner of interweaving though as farr as i was able to discern with that microscope i had i suppose it to have some kind of resemblance but the joints are nothing neer so thick nor without much trouble visible  the filaments i could plainly enough perceive to be even round cylindrical transparent bodies and to cross each other every way that is there were not more seemd to lie horizontally then perpendicularly and thwartway so that it is somewhat difficult to conceive how they should grow in that manner by tearing off a small piece of it and looking on the ragged edge i could among several of those fibres perceive small joints that is one of those hairs split into two each of the same bigness with the other out of which they seemd to grow but having not lately had an opportunity of examining their manner of growth i cannot positively affirm any thing of them  but to proceed the swelling of sponges upon wetting and the rising of the water in it above the surface of the water that it touches are both from the same cause of which an account is already given in the sixth observation  the substance of them indeed has so many excellent properties scarce to be met with in any other body in the world that i have often wondered that so little use is made of it and those onely vile and sordid certainly if it were well considerd it would afford much greater conveniencies  that use which the divers are said to make of it seems if true very strange but having made trial of it my self by dipping a small piece of it in very good salletoyl and putting it in my mouth and then keeping my mouth and nose under water i could not find any such thing for i was as soon out of breath as if i had had no sponge nor could i fetch my breath without taking in water at my mouth but i am very apt to think that were there a contrivance whereby the expird air might be forcd to pass through a wet or oyly sponge before it were again inspird it might much cleanse and strain away from the air divers fuliginous and other noisome steams and the dipping of it in certain liquors might perhaps so renew that property in the air which it loses in the lungs by being breathd that one square foot of air might last a man for respiration much longer perhaps then ten will now serve him of common air                                        observ xxiii of the curious texture of seaweeds  for curiosity and beauty i have not among all the plants or vegetables i have yet observd seen any one comparable to this seaweed i have here describd of which i am able to say very little more then what is represented by the second figure of the ninth scheme namely that it is a plant which grows upon the rocks under the water and increases and spreads it self into a great tuft which is not onely handsomely branchd into several leaves but the whole surface of the plant is coverd over with a most curious kind of carvd work which consists of a texture much resembling a honeycomb for the whole surface on both sides is coverd over with a multitude of very small holes being no bigger then so many holes made with the point of a small pinn and rangd in the neatest and most delicate order imaginable they being placd in the manner of a quincunx or very much like the rows of the eyes of a fly the rows or orders being very regular which way soever they are observd what the texture was as it appeard through a pretty bigg magnifying microscope i have here adjoind in the first figure of the 14 scheme which round area abcd represents a part of the surface about one eighth part of an inch in diameter those little holes which to the eye lookd round like so many little spots here appeard very regularly shapd holes representing almost the shape of the sole of a round toed shoe the hinder part of which is as it were trod on or coverd by the toe of that next below it these holes seemd walld about with a very thin and transparent substance looking of a pale strawcolour from the edge of which against the middle of each hole were sprouted out four small transparent strawcolourd thorns which seemd to protect and cover those cavities from either side two neer the root of this plant were sprouted out several small branches of a kind of bastard coralline curiously branchd though small  and to confirm this having lately the opportunity of viewing the large plant if i may so call it of a sponge petrifyd of which i made mention in the last observation i found that each of the branches or figures of it did by the range of its pores exhibit just such a texture the rows of pores crossing one another much after the manner as the rows of eyes do which are describd in the 26 scheme coralline also and several sorts of white coral i have with a microscope observd very curiously shapd and i doubt not but that he that shall observe these several kinds of plants that grow upon rocks which the sea sometimes overflows and those heaps of others which are vomited out of it upon the shore may find multitudes of little plants and other bodies which like this will afford very beautifull objects for the microscope and this specimen here is adjoind onely to excite their curiosities who have opportunity of observing to examine and collect what they find worthy their notice for the sea among terrestrial bodies is also a prolifick mother and affords as many instances of spontaneous generations as either the air or earth                                        observ xxiv of the surfaces of rosemary and other leaves  this which is delineated within the circle of the second figure of the 14 scheme is a small part of the back or under side of a leaf of rosemary which i did not therefore make choice of because it had any thing peculiar which was not observable with a microscope in several other plants but because it exhibits at one view  first a smooth and shining surface namely ab which is a part of the upper side of the leaf that by a kind of hem or doubling of the leaf appears on this side there are multitudes of leaves which surfaces are like this smooth and as it were quilted which look like a curious quilted bagg of green silk or like a bladder or some such pliable transparent substance full stuffed out with a green juice or liquor the surface of rue or herbgrass is polishd and all over indented or pitted like the silkworms egg which i shall anon describe the smooth surfaces of other plants are otherwise quilted nature in this as it were expressing her needlework or imbroidery  next a downy or bushy surface such as is all the under side almost appearing through the microscope much like a thicket of bushes and with this kind of down or hair the leaves and stalks of multitudes of vegetables are covered and there seems to be as great a variety in the shape bulk and manner of the growing of these secundary plants as i may call them they being as it were a plant growing out of a plant or somewhat like the hairs of animals as there is to be found amongst small shrubs that compose bushes but for the most part they consist of small transparent parts some of which grow in the shape of small needles or bodkins as on the thistle cowagecod and nettle others in the form of cats claws as in cliders the beards of barley the edges of several sorts of grass and reeds c in other as coltsfoot rosecampion aps poplar willow and almost all other downy plants they grow in the form of bushes very much diversifyd in each particular plant that which i have before in the 19 observation noted on roseleaves is of a quite differing kind and seems indeed a real vegetable distinct from the leaf  thirdly among these small bushes are observable an infinite company of small round balls exactly globular and very much resembling pearls namely cccc of these there maybe multitudes observd in sage and several other plants which i suppose was the reason why athanasius kircher supposed them to be all coverd with spiders eggs or young spiders which indeed is nothing else but some kind of gummous exsudation which is always much of the same bigness at first sight of these i confess i imagind that they might have been some kind of matrices or nourishing receptacles for some small insect just as i have found oakapples and multitudes of such other large excrescencies on the leaves and other parts of trees and shrubs to be for flyes and divers other insects but observing them to be there all the year and scarce at all to change their magnitude that conjecture seemd not so probable but what ever be the use of it it affords a very pleasant object through the microscope and may perhaps upon further examination prove very luciferous                                        observ xxv of the stinging points and juice of nettles and some other venomous plants  a nettle is a plant so well known to every one as to what the appearance of it is to the naked eye that it needs no description and there are very few that have not felt as well as seen it and therefore it will be no news to tell that a gentle and slight touch of the skin by a nettle does oftentime not onely create very sensible and acute pain much like that of a burn or scald but often also very angry and hard swellings and inflamations of the parts such as will presently rise and continue swoln divers hours these observations i say are common enough but how the pain is so suddenly created and by what means continued augmented for a time and afterwards diminishd and at length quite exstinguishd has not that i know been explaind by any  and here we must have recourse to our microscope and that will if almost any part of the plant be looked on shew us the whole surface of it very thick set with turnpikes or sharp needles of the shape of those represented in the 15 scheme and first figure by ab which are visible also to the naked eye each of which consists of two parts very distinct for shape and differing also in quality from one another for the part a is shaped very much like a round bodkin from b tapering till it end in a very sharp point it is of substance very hard and stiff exceedingly transparent and cleer and as i by many trials certainly found is hollow from top to bottom  this i found by this experiment i had a very convenient microscope with a single glass which drew about half an inch this i had fastned into a little frame almost like a pair of spectacles which i placed before mine eyes and so holding the leaf of a nettle at a convenient distance from my eye i did first with the thrusting of several of these bristles into my skin perceive that presently after i had thrust them in i felt the burning pain begin next i observd in divers of them that upon thrusting my finger against their tops the bodkin if i may so call it did not in the least bend but i could perceive moving up and down within it a certain liquor which upon thrusting the bodkin against its basis or bagg b i could perceive to rise towards the top and upon taking away my hand i could see it again subside and shrink into the bagg this i did very often and saw this ph√¶nomenon as plain as i could ever see a parcel of water ascend and descend in a pipe of glass but the basis underneath these bodkins on which they were fast were made of a more pliable substance and looked almost like a little bagg of green leather or rather resembled the shape and surface of a wilde cucumber or cucumeris asinini and i could plainly perceive them to be certain little baggs bladders or receptacles full of water or as i ghess the liquor of the plant which was poisonous and those small bodkins were but the syringepipes or glysterpipes which first made way into the skin and then served to convey that poisonous juice upon the pressing of those little baggs into the interior and sensible parts of the skin which being so dischargd does corrode or as it were burn that part of the skin it touches and this pain will sometimes last very long according as the impression is made deeper or stronger  the other parts of the leaf or surface of the nettle have very little considerable but what is common to most of these kinds of plants as the ruggedness or indenting and hairiness and other roughnesses of the surface or outside of the plant of which i may say more in another place as i shall likewise of certain little pretty cleer balls or apples which i have observed to stick to the sides of these leaves both on the upper and under side very much like the small apples which i have often observd to grow on the leaves of an oak calld oakapples which are nothing but the matrices of an infect as i elsewhere shew  the chief thing therefore is how this plant comes by so slight a touch to create so great a pain and the reason of this seems to be nothing else but the corrosive penetrant liquor containd in the small baggs or bladders upon which grow out those sharp syringepipes as i before noted and very consonant to this is the reason of the pain created by the sting of a bee wasp c as i elsewhere shew for by the dart which is likewise a pipe is made a deep passage into the skin and then by the anger of the fly is his gally poisonous liquor injected which being admitted among the sensible parts and so mixd with the humours or stagnating juices of that part does create an ebullition perhaps or effervescens as is usually observd in the mingling of two differing chymical saline liquors by which means the parts become swelld hard and very painfull for thereby the nervous and sensible parts are not onely stretchd and straind beyond their natural tone but are also prickd perhaps or corroded by the pungent and incongruous parts of the intruded liquor  and this seems to be the reason why aqua fortis and other saline liquors if they come to touch the sensitive parts as in a cut of the skin or the like do so violently and intollerably excruciate and torment the patient and tis not unlikely but the inventors of that diabolical practice of poisoning the points of arrows and ponyards might receive their first hint from some such instance in natural contrivances as this of the nettle for the ground why such poisond weapons kill so infallibly as they do seems no other then this of our nettles stinging for the ponyard or dart makes a passage or entrance into the sensitive or vital parts of the body whereby the contagious substance comes to be dissolvd by and mixd with the fluid parts or humours of the body and by that means spreads it self by degrees into the whole liquid part of the body in the same manner as a few grains of salt put into a great quantity of water will by degrees diffuse it self over the whole  and this i take to be the reason of killing of toads frogs effs and several fishes by strewing salt on their backs which experiment was shewn to the royal society by a very ingenious gentleman and a worthy member of it for those creatures having always a continual exsudation as it were of slimy and watry parts sweating out of the pores of their skin the saline particles by that means obtain a vehicle which conveys them into the internal and vital parts of the body  this seems also to be the reason why bathing in mineral waters are such soveraign remedies for multitudes of distempers especially chronical for the liquid  warm vehicles of the mineral particles which are known to be in very considerable quantities in those healing baths by the bodys long stay in them do by degrees steep and insinuate themselves into the pores and parts of the skin and thereby those mineral particles have their ways and passages opend to penetrate into the inner parts and mingle themselves with the stagnant juices of the several parts besides many of those offensive parts which were united with those stagnant juices and which were contrary to the natural constitution of the parts and so become irksome and painfull to the body but could not be discharged because nature had made no provision for such accidental mischiefs are by means of this soaking and filling the pores of the skin with a liquor afforded a passage through that liquor that fills the pores into the ambient fluid and thereby the body comes to be discharged  so that tis very evident there may be a good as well as an evil application of this principle and the ingenious invention of that excellent person doctor wren of injecting liquors into the veins of an animal seems to be reducible to this head i cannot stay nor is this a fit place to mention the several experiments made of this kind by the most incomparable mr boyle the multitudes made by the lately mentiond physician doctor clark the history whereof as he has been pleasd to communicate to the royal society so he may perhaps be prevaild with to make publique himself but i shall rather hint that certainly if this principle were well considerd there might besides the further improving of bathing and syringing into the veins be thought on several ways whereby several obstinate distempers of a humane body such as the gout dropsie stone c might be masterd and expelld and good men might make as good a use of it as evil men have made a perverse and diabolical  and that the filling of the pores of the skin with some fluid vehicle is of no small efficacy towards the preparing a passage for several kinds of penetrant juices and other dissoluble bodies to insinuate themselves within the skin and into the sensitive parts of the body may be i think provd by an instance given us by bellonius in the 26 chapter of the second book of his observations which containing a very remarkable story i have here transcribd cum cham√¶leonis nigri radices says he apud pagum quendam livadochorio nuncupatum erui curaremus plurimi gr√¶ci  turc√¶ spectatum venerunt quid erueremus eas vero frustulatim secabamus  filo trajiciebamus ut facilius exsiccari possent turc√¶ in eo negotio occupatos nos videntes similiter eas radices tractare  secare voluerunt at cum summus esset √¶stus  omnes sudore maderent quicunque eam radicem manibus tractaverant sudoremque absterserant aut faciem digitis scalpserant tantam pruriginem iis locis quos attigerant postea senserunt ut aduri viderentur cham√¶leonis enim nigri radix ea virtute pollet ut cuti applicata ipsam adeo inflammet ut nec squill√¶ nec urtic√¶ ull√¶ centesima parte ita adurent at prurigo non adeo celeriter sese prodit post unam aut alteram porro horam singuli variis faciei locis cutem adeo inflammatam habere c√¶pimus ut tota sanguinea videretur atque quo magis eam confricabamus tanto magis excitabatur prurigo fonti assidebamus sub platano atque initio pro ludicro habebamus  ridebamus at tandem illi plurimum indignati sunt  nisi asseverassemus nunquam expertos tali virtute eam plantam pollere haud dubie male nos multassent attamen nostra excusatio fuit ab illis facilitus accepta cum eodem incommodo nos affectos conspicerent mirum sane quod in tantillo radice tam ingentem efficaciam nostro malo experti sumus  by which observation of his it seems manifest that their being all coverd with sweat who gatherd and cut this root of the black chameleon thistle was the great reason why they sufferd that inconvenience for it seems the like circumstance had not been before that noted nor do i find any mention of such a property belonging to this vegetable in any of the herbals i have at present by me  i could give very many observations which i have made of this kind whereby i have found that the best way to get a body to be insinuated into the substance or insensible pores of another is first to find a fluid vehicle that has some congruity both to the body to be insinuated and to the body into whose pores you would have the other conveyd and in this principle lies the great mystery of staining several sorts of bodies as marble woods bones c and of dying silks cloaths wools feathers c but these being digressions i shall proceed to                                        observ xxvi of cowage and the itching operation of some bodies  there is a certain down of a plant brought from the eastindies calld commonly though very improperly cowitch the reason of which mistake is manifest enough from the description of it which mr parkinson sets down in his herbal tribe xi chap 2 phasiolus siliqua hirsuta the hairy kidneybean called in zurratte where it grows couhage we have had says he another of this kind brought us out of the eastindies which being planted was in shew like the former but came not to perfection the unkindly season not suffering it to shew the flower but of the cods that were brought some were smaller shorter and rounder then the garden kind others much longer and many growing together as it were in clusters and coverd all over with a brown short hairiness so fine that if any of it be rubbd or fall on the back of ones hand or other tender parts of the skin it will cause a kind of itching but not strong nor long induring but passing quickly away without either danger or harm the beans were smaller then ordinary and of a black shining colour  having one of these cods given me by a seacaptain who had frequented those parts i found it to be a small cod about three inches long much like a short cod of french beans which had six beans in it the whole surface of it was coverd over with a very thick and shining brown down or hair which was very fine and for its bigness stiff taking some of this down and rubbing it on the back of my hand i found very little or no trouble only i was sensible that several of these little downy parts with rubbing did penetrate and were sunk or stuck pretty deep into my skin after i had thus rubbd it for a pretty while i felt very little or no pain in so much that i doubted whether it were the true couhage but whilst i was considering i found the down begin to make my hand itch and in some places to smart again much like the stinging of a flea or gnat and this continued a pretty while so that by degrees i found my skin to be swelld with little red pustules and to look as if it had been itchie but suffering it without rubbing or scratching the itching tickling pain quickly grew languid and within an hour i felt nothing at all and the little protuberancies were vanishd  the cause of which odd ph√¶nomenon i suppose to be much the same with that of the stinging of a nettle for by the microscope i discoverd this down to consist of a multitude of small and slender conical bodies much resembling needles or bodkins such as are represented by ab cd ef of the first figure of the xvi scheme that their ends aaa were very sharp and the substance of them stiff and hard much like the substance of several kinds of thorns and crooks growing on trees and though they appeard very cleer and transparent yet i could not perceive whether they were hollow or not but to me they appeard like solid transparent bodies without any cavity in them whether though they might not be a kind of cane filld with some transparent liquor which was hardned because the cod which i had was very dry i was not able to examine  now being such stiff sharp bodies it is easie to conceive how with rubbing they might easily be thrust into the tender parts of the skin and there by reason of their exceeding fineness and driness not create any considerable trouble or pain till by remaining in those places moistned with the humours of the body some caustick part sticking on them or residing within them might be dissolvd and mixd with the ambient juices of that place and thereby those fibres and tender parts adjoyning become affected and as it were corroded by it whence while that action lasts the pains created are pretty sharp and pungent though small which is the essential property of an itching one  that the pain also caused by the stinging of a flea a gnat a flie a wasp and the like proceeds much from the very same cause i elsewhere in their proper places endeavour to manifest the stinging also of shred horshair which in meriment is often strewd between the sheets of a bed seems to proceed from the same cause                                        observ xxvii of the beard of a wilde oat and the use that may be made of it for exhibiting always to the eye the temperature of the air as to driness and moisture  this beard of a wild oat is a body of a very curious structure though to the naked eye it appears very slight and inconsiderable it being only a small black or brown beard or bristle which grows out of the side of the inner husk that covers the grain of a wild oat the whole length of it when put in water so that it may extend it self to its full length is not above an inch and a half and for the most part somewhat shorter but when the grain is ripe and very dry which is usualy in the moneths of july and august this beard is bent somewhat below the middle namely about 25 from the bottom of it almost to a right angle and the under part of it is wreathd lik a with the substance of it is very brittle when dry and it will very easily be broken from the husk on which it grows  if you take one of these grains and wet the beard in water you will presently see the small bended top to turn and move round as if it were sensible and by degrees if it be continued wet enough the joint or knee will streighten it self and if it be sufferd to dry again it will by degrees move round another way and at length bend again into its former posture  if it be viewd with an ordinary single microscope it will appear like a small wreathd sprig with two clefts and if wet as before and then lookd on with this microscope it will appear to unwreath it self and by degrees to streighten its knee and the two clefts will become streight and almost on opposite sides of the small cylindrical body  if it be continued to be lookd on a little longer with a microscope it will within a little while begin to wreath it self again and soon after return to its former posture bending it self again neer the middle into a kind of knee or angle  several of those bodies i examind with larger microscopes and there found them much of the make of those two long wreathd cylinders delineated in the second figure of the 15 scheme which two cylinders represent the wreathed part broken into two pieces whereof the end ab is to be supposd to have joind to the end cd so that eacf does represent the whole wreathd part of the beard and eg a small piece of the upper part of the beard which is beyond the knee which as i had not room to insert so was it not very considerable either for its form or any known property but the under or wreathed part is notable for both as to its form it appeard if it were lookd on sideways almost like a willow or a small tapering rod of hazel the lower or bigger half of which onely is twisted round several times in some three in others more in others less according to the bigness and maturity of the grain on which it grew and according to the driness and moisture of the ambient air as i shall shew more at large by and by  the whole outward superficies of this cylindrical body is curiously adorned or fluted with little channels and interjacent ridges or little protuberances between them which run the whole length of the beard and are streight where the beard is not twisted and wreathd where it is just after the same manner each of those sides is beset pretty thick with small brides or thorns somewhat in form resembling that of porcupines quills such as aaaaa in the figure all whose points are directed like so many turnpikes towards the small end or top of the beard which is the reason why if you endeavour to draw the beard between your fingers the contrary way you will find it to stick and grate as it were against the skin  the proportion of these small conical bodies aaaaa to that whereon they grow the figure will sufficiently shew as also their manner of growing their thickness and neerness to each other as that towards the root or bottom of the beard they are more thin and much shorter insomuch that there is usually left between the top of the one and the bottom of that next above it more then the length of one of them and that towards the top of the beard they grow more thick and close though there be fewer ridges so that the root and almost half the upper are hid by the tops of those next below them  i could not perceive any transverse pores unless the whole wreathd part were separated and cleft in those little channels by the wreathing into so many little strings as there were ridges which was very difficult to determine but there were in the wreathed part two very conspicuous channels or clefts which were continued from the bottom f to the elbow bow eh or all along the part which was wreathd which seemd to divide the wreathd cylinder into two parts a bigger and a less the bigger was that which was at the convex side of the knee namely on the side a and was wreathd by ooooo this as it seemd the broader so did it also the longer the other ppppp which was usually pursd or wrinckled in the bending of the knee as about e seemd both the shorter and narrower so that at first i thought the wreathing and unwreathing of the beard might have been causd by the shrinking or swelling of that part but upon further examination i sound that the clefts kk ll were stuft up with a kind of spongie substance which for the most part was very conspicuous neer the knee as in the cleft kk when the beard was dry upon the discovery of which i began to think that it was upon the swelling of this porous pith upon the access of moisture or water that the beard being made longer in the midst was streightned and by the shrinking or subsiding of the parts of that spongie substance together when the water or moisture was exhald or dried the pith or middle parts growing shorter the whole became twisted  but this i cannot be positive in for upon cutting the wreathd part in many places transversly i was not so well satisfyd with the shape and manner of the pores of the pith for looking on these transverse sections with a very good microscope i found that the ends of those transverse sections appeard much of the manner of the third figure of the 15 scheme abcfe and the middle of pith cc seemd very full of pores indeed but all of them seemd to run the longways  this figure plainly enough shews in what manner those clefts k and l divided the wreathd cylinder into two unequal parts and also of what kind of substance the whole body consists for by cutting the same beard in many places with transverse sections i found much the same appearance with this expressd so that those pores seem to run as in most other such cany bodies the whole length of it  the clefts of this body kk and ll seemd as is also expressd in the figure to wind very oddly in the inner part of the wreath and in some parts of them they seemd stuffed as it were with that spongie substance which i just now described  this so oddly constituted vegetable substance is first that i have met with taken notice of by baptista porta in his natural magick as a thing known to children and juglers and it has been calld by some of those last named persons the better to cover their cheat the legg of an arabian spider or the legg of an inchanted egyptian fly and has been used by them to make a small index cross or the like to move round upon the wetting of it with a drop of water and muttering certain words  but the use that has been made of it for the discovery of the various constitutions of the air as to driness and moistness is incomparably beyond any other for this it does to admiration the manner of contriving it so as to perform this great effect is onely thus  provide a good large box of ivory about four inches over and of what depth you shall judge convenient according to your intention of making use of one two three or more of these small beards ordered in the manner which i shall by and by describe let all the sides of this box be turned of basketwork which here in london is easily enough procurd full of holes in the manner almost of a lettice the bigger or more the holes are the better that so the air may have the more free passage to the inclosed beard and may the more easily pass through the instrument it will be better yet though not altogether so handsom if insteed of the basketwork on the sides of the box the bottom and top of the box be joind together onely with three or four small pillars after the manner represented in the 4 figure of the 15 scheme or if you intend to make use of many of these small beards joind together you may have a small long case of ivory whose sides are turnd of basketwork full of holes which may be screwd on to the underside of a broad plate of ivory on the other side of which is to be made the divided ring or circle to which divisions the pointing of the hand or index which is moved by the conjoind beard may shew all the minute variations of the air  there may be multitudes of other ways for contriving this small instrument so as to produce this effect which any one may according to his peculiar use and the exigency of his present occasion easily enough contrive and take on which i shall not therefore insist the whole manner of making any one of them is thus having your box or frame aabb fitly adapted for the free passage of the air through it in the midst of the bottom bbb you must have a very small hole c into which the lower end of the beard is to be fixd the upper end of which beard ab is to pass through a small hole of a plate or top aa if you make use onely of a single one and on the top of it e is to be fixd a small and very light index fg made of a very thin sliver of a reed or cane but if you make use of two or more beards they must be fixd and bound together either with a very fine piece of silk or with a very small touch of hard wax or glew which is better and the index fg is to be fixd on the top of the second third or fourth in the same manner as on the single one  now because that in every of these contrivances the index fg will with some temperatures of air move two three or more times round which without some other contrivance then this will be difficult to distinguish therefore i thought of this expedient the index or hand fg being raisd a pretty way above the surface of the plate aa fix in at a little distance from the middle of it a small pin h so as almost to touch the surface of the plate aa and then in any convenient place of the surface of the plate fix a small pin on which put on a small piece of paper or thin pastboard vellom or parchment made of a convenient cize and shapd in the manner of that in the figure expressd by ik so that having a convenient number of teeth every turn or return of the pin h may move this small indented circle a tooth forward or backwards by which means the teeth of the circle being markd it will be thereby very easie to know certainly how much variation any change of weather will make upon the small wreathd body in the making of this secundary circle of vellom or the like great care is to be had that it be made exceeding light and to move very easily for otherwise a small variation will spoil the whole operation the box may be made of brass silver iron or any other substance if care be taken to make it open enough to let the air have a sufficiently free access to the beard the index also may be various ways contrived so as to shew both the number of the revolutions it makes and the minute divisions of each revolution  i have made several trials and instruments for discovering the driness and moisture of the air with this little wreathd body and find it to vary exceeding sensibly with the least change in the constitution of the air as to driness and moisture so that with one breathing upon it i have made it untwist a whole bout and the index or hand has shewd or pointed to various divisions on the upper face or ring of the instrument according as it was carried neerer and neerer to the fire or as the heat of the sun increased upon it  other trials i have made with gutstrings but find them nothing neer so sensible though they also may be so contrivd as to exhibit the changes of the air as to driness and moisture both by their stretching and shrinking in length and also by their wreathing and unwreathing themselves but these are nothing neer so exact or so tender for their varying property will in a little time change very much but there are several other vegetable substances that are much more sensible then even this beard of a wilde oat such i have found the beard of the seed of muskgrass or geranium moschatum and those of other kinds of cranesbil seeds and the like but always the smaller the wreathing substance be the more sensible is it of the mutations of the air a conjecture at the reason of which i shall by and by add  the lower end of this wreathd cylinder being stuck upright in a little soft wax so that the bended part or index of it lay horizontal i have observd it always with moisture to unwreath it self from the east for instance by the south to the west and so by the north to the east again moving with the sun as we commonly say and with heat and drouth to retwist and wreath it self the contrary way namely from the east for instance by the north to the west and so onwards  the cause of all which ph√¶nomena seems to be the differing texture of the parts of these bodies each of them especially the beard of a wilde oat and of moskgrass seed seeming to have two kind of substances one that is very porous loose and spongie into which the watry steams of the air may be very easily forced which will be thereby swelld and extended in its dimensions just as we may observe all kind of vegetable substance upon steeping in water to swell and grow bigger and longer and a second that is more hard and close into which the water can very little or not at all penetrate this therefore retaining always very neer the same dimensions and the other stretching and shrinking according as there is more or less moisture or water in its pores by reason of the make and shape of the parts the whole body must necessarily unwreath and wreath it self  and upon this principle it is very easie to make several sorts of contrivances that should thus wreath and unwreath themselves either by heat and cold or by driness and moisture or by any greater or less force from whatever cause it proceed whether from gravity or weight or from wind which is motion of the air or from some springing body or the like  this had i time i should enlarge much more upon for it seems to me to be the very first footstep of sensation and animate motion the most plain simple and obvious contrivance that nature has made use of to produce a motion next to that of rarefaction and condensation by heat and cold and were this principle very well examind i am very apt to think it would afford us a very great help to find out the mechanism of the muscles which indeed as farr as i have hitherto been able to examine seems to me not so very perplex as one might imagine especially upon the examination which i made of the muscles of crabs lobsters and several sorts of large shellfish and comparing my observations on them with the circumstances i observd in the muscles of terrestrial animals  now as in this instance of the beard of a wilde oat we see there is nothing else requisite to make it wreath and unwreath it self and to streighten and bend its knee then onely a little breath of moist or dry air or a small atome almost of water or liquor and a little heat to make it again evaporate for by holding this beard placd and fixd as i before directed neer a fire and dipping the tip of a small shred of paper in well rectifyd spirit of wine and then touching the wreathd cylindrical part you may perceive it to untwist it self and presently again upon the avolation of the spirit by the great heat it will retwist it self and thus will it move forward and backwards as oft as you repeat the touching it with the spirit of wine so may perhaps the shrinking and relaxing of the muscles be by the influx and evaporation of some kind of liquor or juice but of this enquiry i shall add more elsewhere                                        observ xxviii of the seeds of venus lookingglass or corn violet  from the leaves and downs and beards of plants we come at last to the seeds and here indeed seems to be the cabinet of nature wherein are laid up its jewels the providence of nature about vegetables is in no part manifested more then in the various contrivances about the seed nor indeed is there in any part of the vegetable so curious carvings and beautifull adornments as about the seed this in the larger sorts of seeds is most evident to the eye nor is it lest manifest through the microscope in those seeds whose shape and structure by reason of their smalness the eye is hardly able to distinguish  of these there are multitudes many of which i have observd through a microscope and find that they do for the most part every one afford exceeding pleasant and beautifull objects for besides those that have various kinds of carvd surfaces there are other that have smooth and perfectly polishd surfaces others a downy hairy surface some are coverd onely with a skin others with a kind of shell others with both as is observable also in greater seeds  of these seeds i have onely described four sorts which may serve as a specimen of what the inquisitive observers are likely to find among the rest the first of these seeds which are described in the 17 scheme are those of cornviolets the seed is very small black and shining and to the naked eye looks almost like a very small flea but through the microscope it appears a large body coverd with a tough thick and bright reflecting skin very irregularly shrunk and pitted insomuch that it is almost an impossibility to find two of them wrinkled alike so great a variety may there be even in this little seed  this though it appeard one of the most promising seeds for beauty to the naked eye yet through the microscope it appeard but a rude mishapen seed which i therefore drew that i might thereby manifest how unable we are by the naked eye to judge of beauteous or less curious microscopical objects cutting some of them in sunder i observd them to be filld with a greenish yellow pulp and to have a very thick husk in proportion to the pulp                                        observ xxix of the seeds of tyme  these pretty fruits here represented in the 18 scheme are nothing else but nine several seeds of tyme they are all of them in differing posture both as to the eye and the light nor are they all of them exactly of the same shape there being a great variety both in the bulk and figure of each seed but they all agreed in this that being lookd on with a microscope they each of them exactly resembled a lemmon or orange dryd and this both in shape and colour some of them are a little rounder of the shape of an orange as a and b they have each of them a very conspicuous part by which they were joind to their little stalk and one of them had a little piece of stalk remaining on the opposite side of the seed you may perceive very plainly by the figure is very copped and prominent as is very usual in lemmons which prominencies are expressd in d e and f  they seemd each of them a little creasd or wrinckled but e was very conspicuously furrowd as if the inward make of this seed had been somewhat like that of a lemmon also but upon dividing several seeds with a very sharp penknife and examining them afterward i found their make to be in nothing but bulk differing from that of peas that is to have a pretty thick coat and all the rest an indifferent white pulp which seemd very close so that it seems nature does not very much alter her method in the manner of inclosing and preserving the vital principle in the seed in these very small grains from that of beans peas c  the grain affords a very pretty object for the microscope namely a dish of lemmons placd in a very little room should a lemmon or nut be proportionably magnifyd to what this seed of tyme is it would make it appear as bigg as a large hayreek and it would be no great wonder to see homers iliads and homer and all crammd into such a nutshell we may perceive even in these small grains as well as in greater how curious and carefull nature is in preserving the seminal principle of vegetable bodies in what delicate strong and most convenient cabinets she lays them and closes them in a pulp for their safer protection from outward dangers and for the supply of convenient alimental juice when the heat of the sun begins to animate and move these little automatons or engines as if she would from the ornaments wherewith she has deckt these cabinets hint to us that in them she has laid up her jewels and masterpieces and this if we are but diligent in observing we shall find her method throughout there is no curiosity in the elemental kingdom if i may so call the bodies of air water earth that are comparable in form to those of minerals air and water having no form at all unless a potentiality to be formd into globules and the clods and parcels of earth are all irregular whereas in minerals she does begin to geometrize and practise as twere the first principles of mechanicks shaping them of plain regular figures as triangles squares c and tetraedrons cubes c but none of their forms are comparable to the more compounded ones of vegetables for here she goes a step further forming them both of more complicated shapes and adding also multitudes of curious mechanick contrivances in their structure for whereas in vegetables there was no determinate number of the leaves or branches nor no exacly certain figure of leaves or flowers or seeds in animals all those things are exactly defind and determind and whereever there is either an excess or defect of those determinate parts or limbs there has been some impediment that has spoild the principle which was most regular here we shall find not onely most curiously compounded shapes but most stupendious mechanisms and contrivances here the ornaments are in the highest perfection nothing in all the vegetable kingdom that is comparable to the deckings of a peacock nay to the curiosity of any feather as i elsewhere shew nor to that of the smallest and most despicable fly but i must not stay on these speculations though perhaps it were very well worth while for one that had leisure to see what information may be learnd of the nature or use or virtues of bodies by their several forms and various excellencies and properties who knows but adam might from some such contemplation give names to all creatures if at least his names had any significancy in them of the creatures nature on which he imposd it as many upon what grounds i know not have supposd and who knows but the creator may in those characters have written and engraven many of his most mysterious designs and counsels and given man a capacity which assisted with diligence and industry may be able to read and understand them but not to multiply my digression more then i can the time i will proceed to the next which is                                        observ xxx of the seeds of poppy  the small seeds of poppy which are described in the 19 scheme both for their smalness multiplicity and prettiness as also for their admirable soporifick quality deserve to be taken notice of among the other microscopical seeds of vegetables for first though they grow in a case or hive oftentimes bigger then one of these pictures of the microscopical appearance yet are they for the most part so very little that they exceed not the bulk of a small nitt being not above 132 part of an inch in diameter whereas the diameter of the hive of them oftentimes exceeds two inches so that it is capable of containing near two hundred thousand and so in all likelihood does contain a vast quantity though perhaps not that number next for their prettiness they may be compard to any microscopical seed i have yet seen for they are of a dark brownish red colour curiously honeycombd all over with a very pretty variety of network or a small kind of imbosment of very orderly raisd ridges the surface of them looking not unlike the inside of a beevs stomack but that which makes it most considerable of all is the medicinal virtues of it which are such as are not afforded us by any mineral preparation and that is for the procuring of sleep a thing as necessary to the wellbeing of a creature as his meat and that which refreshes both the voluntary and rational faculties which whilst this affection has seisd the body are for the most part unmovd and at rest and methinks nature does seem to hint some very notable virtue or excellency in this plant from the curiosity it has bestowd upon it first in its flower it is of the highest scarletdye which is indeed the prime and chiefest colour and has been in all ages of the world most highly esteemd next it has as much curiosity shewd also in the husk or case of the seed as any one plant i have yet met withall and thirdly the very seeds themselves the microscope discovers to be very curiously shapd bodies and lastly nature has taken such abundant care for the propagation of it that one single seed grown into a plant is capable of bringing some hundred thousands of seeds  it were very worthy some able mans enquiry whether the intention of nature as to the secundary end of animal and vegetable substances might not be found out by some such characters and notable impressions as these or from divers other circumstances as the figure colour place time of flourishing springing and fading duration taste smell c for if such there are as an able physician upon good grounds has given me cause to believe we might then insteed of studying herbals where so little is deliverd of the virtues of a plant and less of truth have recourse to the book of nature it self and there find the most natural usefull and most effectual and specifick medicines of which we have amongst vegetables two very noble instances to incourage such a hope the one of the jesuite powder for the cure of intermitting feavers and the other of the juice of poppy for the curing the defect of sleeping                                        observ xxxi of purslaneseed  the seeds of purslane seem of very notable shapes appearing through the microscope shapd somewhat like a nautilus or porcelane shell as may be seen in the xx scheme it being a small body coyld round in the manner of a spiral at the greater end whereof which represents the mouth or orifice of the shell there is left a little white transparent substance like a skin represented by bbbb which seems to have been the place whereunto the stem was joind the whole surface of this coclea or shell is coverd over with abundance of little prominencies or buttons very orderly rangd into spiral rows the shape of each of which seemd much to resemble a wart upon a mans hand the order variety and curiosity in the shape of this little seed makes it a very pleasant object for the microscope one of them being cut asunder with a very sharp penknife discoverd this carved casket to be of a brownish red and somewhat transparent substance and manifested the inside to be filld with a whitish green substance or pulp the bed wherein the seminal principle lies invelopd  there are multitudes of other seeds which in shape represent or imitate the forms of divers other sorts of shells as the seed of scurvygrass very much resembles the make of a concha venerea a kind of purcelane shell others represent several sorts of larger fruits sweat marjerome and potmarjerome represent olives carret seeds are like a cleft of a coconut husk others are like artificial things as succory seeds are like a quiver full of arrows the seeds of amaranthus are of an exceeding lovely shape somewhat like an eye the skin of the black and shrivled seeds of onyons and leeks are all over knobbed like a seals skin sorrel has a pretty black shining threesquare seed which is picked at both ends with three ridges that are bent the whole length of it it were almost endless to reckon up the several shapes they are so many and so various leaving them therefore to the curious observer i shall proceed to the observations on the parts of animals                                        observ xxxii of the figure of several sorts of hair and of the texture of the skin  viewing some of the hairs of my head with a very good microscope i took notice of these particulars  1 that they were for the most part cylindrical some of them were somewhat prismatical but generally they were very neer round such as are represented in the second figure of the 5 scheme by the cylinders eee nor could i find any that had sharp angules  2 that that part which was next the top was bigger then that which was neerer the root  3 that they were all along from end to end transparent though not very cleer the end next the root appearing like a black transparent piece of horn the end next the top more brown somewhat like transparent horn  4 that the root of the hairs were pretty smooth tapering inwards almost like a parsneb nor could i find that it had any filaments or any other vessels such as the fibres of plants  5 that the top when split which is common in long hair appeard like the end of a stick beaten till it be all flitterd there being not onely two splinters but sometimes half a score and more  6 that they were all as farr as i was able to find solid cylindrical bodies not pervious like a cane or bulrush nor could i find that they had any pith or distinction of rind or the like such as i had observd in horsehairs the bristles of a cat the indian deers hair c  observations on several other sorts of hair  for the brisles of a hogg i found them to be first a hard transparent horny substance without the least appearance of pores or holes in it and this i tryd with the greatest care i was able cutting many of them with a very sharp razor so that they appeard even in the glass to have a pretty smooth surface but somewhat waved by the sawing to and fro of the razor as is visible in the end of the prismatical body a of the same figure and then making trials with causing the light to be cast on them all the various ways i could think of that was likely to make the pores appear if there had been any i was not able to discover any  next the figure of the brisles was very various neither perfectly round nor sharp edgd but prismatical with divers sides and round angles as appears in the figure a the bending of them in any part where they before appeard cleer would all flaw them and make them look white  the mustacheos of a cat part of one of which is represented by the short cylinder b of the same figure seemd to have all of them that i observd a large pith in the middle like the pith of an elder whose texture was so close that i was not able to discover the least sign of pores and those parts which seem to be pores as they appeard in one position to the light in another i could find a manifest reflection to be cast from them  this i instance in to hint that it is not safe to conclude any thing to be positively this or that though it appear never so plain and likely when lookd on with a microscope in one posture before the same be examind by placing it in several other positions  and this i take to be the reason why many have believed and asserted the hairs of a mans head to be hollow and like so many small pipes perforated from end to end  now though i grant that by an analogie one may suppose them so and from the polonian disease one may believe them such yet i think we have not the least encouragement to either from the microscope much less positively to assert them such and perhaps the very essence of the plica polonica may be the hairs growing hollow and of an unnatural constitution  and as for the analogie though i am apt enough to think that the hairs of several animals may be perforated somewhat like a cane or at least have a kind of pith in them first because they seem as twere a kind of vegetable growing on an animal which growing they say remains a long while after the animal is dead and therefore should like other vegetables have a pith and secondly because horns and feathers and porcupines quils and cats bristles and the long hairs of horses which come very neer the nature of a mans hair seem all of them to have a kind of pith and some of them to be porous yet i think it not in these cases where we have such helps for the sense as the microscope affords safe concluding or building on more then we sensibly know since we may with examining find that nature does in the make of the same kind of substance often vary her method in framing of it instances enough to confirm this we may find in the horns of several creatures as what a vast difference is there between the horns of an oxe and those of some sorts of staggs as to their shape and even in the hairs of several creatures we find a vast difference as the hair of a mans head seems as i said before long cylindrical and sometime a little prismatical solid or impervious and very small the hair of an indian deer a part of the middle of which is described in the third figure of the fifth scheme marked with f is bigger in compass through all the middle of it then the bristle of an hogg but the end of it is smaller then the hair of any kind of animal as may be seen by the figure g the whole belly of it which is about two or three inches long looks to the eye like a thread of course canvass that has been newly unwreathd it being all wavd or bended to and fro much after that manner but through the microscope it appears all perforated from side to side and spongie like a small kind of spongy coral which is often found upon the english shores but though i cut it transversly i could not perceive that it had any pores that ran the longway of the hair the long hairs of horses cc and d seem cylindrical and somewhat pithy the bristles of a cat b are conical and pithy the quils of porcupines and hedghoggs being cut transversly have a whitish pith in the manner of a starr or spurrowel piggshair a is somewhat triagonal and seems to have neither pith nor pore and other kinds of hair have quite a differing structure and form and therefore i think it no way agreeable to a true natural historian to pretend to be so sharpsighted as to see what a preconceivd hypothesis tells them should be there where another man though perhaps as seeing but not forestalld can discover no such matter  but to proceed i observd several kind of hairs that had been dyed and found them to be a kind of horny cylinder being of much about the transparency of a pretty cleer piece of oxe horn these appeard quite throughout tingd with the colours they exhibited and tis likely that those hairs being boyld or steepd in those very hot tingd liquors in the dyefat and the substance of the hair being much like that of an oxes horn the penetrant liquor does so far mollifie and soften the substance that it sinks into the very center of it and so the tingd parts come to be mixd and united with the very body of the hair and do not as some have thought only stick on upon the outward surface and this the boiling of horn will make more probable for we shall find by that action that the water will insinuate it self to a pretty depth within the surface of it especially if this penetrancy of the water be much helped by the salts that are usually mixd with the dying liquors now whereas silk may be dyed or tingd into all kind of colours without boiling or dipping into hot liquors i ghess the reason to be twofold first because the filaments or small cylinders of silk are abundantly smaller and finer and so have a much less depth to be penetrated then most kind of hairs and next because the substance or matter of silk is much more like a glew then the substance of hair is and that i have reason to suppose first because when it is spun or drawn out of the worm it is a perfect glutinous substance and very easily sticks and cleaves to any adjacent body as i have several times observed both in silkworms and spiders next because that i find that water does easily dissolve and mollifie the substance again which is evident from their manner of ordering those bottoms or pods of the silkworm before they are able to unwind them it is no great wonder therefore if those dyes or tingd liquors do very quickly mollifie and tinge the surfaces of so small and so glutinous a body and we need not wonder that the colours appear so lovely in the one and so dull in the other if we view but the tingd cylinders of both kinds with a good microscope for whereas the substance of hair at best is but a dirty duskish white somewhat transparent the filaments of silk have a most lovely transparency and cleerness the difference between those two being not much less then that between a piece of horn and a piece of crystal the one yielding a bright and vivid reflection from the concave side of the cylinder that is from the concave surface of the air that incompasses the backpart of the cylinder the other yielding a dull and perturbd reflection from the several heterogeneous parts that compose it and this difference will be manifest enough to the eye if you get a couple of small cylinders the smaller of crystal glass the other of horn and then varnishing them over very thinly with some transparent colour which will represent to the naked eye much the same kind of object which is represented to it from the filaments of silk and hair by the help of the microscope now since the threads of silk and serge are made up of a great number of these filaments we may henceforth cease to wonder at the difference from much the same reason proceeds the vivid and lovely colours of feathers wherein they very farr exceed the natural as well as artificial colours of hair of which i shall say more in its proper place  the teguments indeed of creatures are all of them adapted to the peculiar use and convenience of that animal which they inwrap and very much also for the ornament and beauty of it as will be most evident to any one that shall attentively consider the various kinds of cloathings wherewith most creatures are by nature invested and coverd thus i have observed that the hair or furr of those northern white bears that inhabite the colder regions is exceeding thick and warm the like have i observd of the hair of a greenland deer which being brought alive to london i had the opportunity of viewing its hair was so exceeding thick long and soft that i could hardly with my hand grasp or take hold of his skin and it seemd so exceeding warm as i had never met with any before and as for the ornamentative use of them it is most evident in a multitude of creatures not onely for colour as the leopards cats rhein deer c but for the shape as in horses manes cats beards and several other of the greater sort of terrestrial animals but is much more conspicuous in the vestments of fishes birds insects of which i shall by and by give some instances  as for the skin the microscope discovers as great a difference between the texture of those several kinds of animals as it does between their hairs but all that i have yet taken notice of when tannd or dressd are of a spongie nature and seem to be constituted of an infinite company of small long fibres or hairs which look not unlike a heap of tow or okum every of which fibres seem to have been some part of a muscle and probably whilst the animal was alive might have its distinct function and serve for the contraction and relaxation of the skin and for the stretching and shrinking of it this or that way  and indeed without such a kind of texture as this which is very like that of spunk it would seem very strange how any body so strong as the skin of an animal usually is and so close as it seems whilst the animal is living should be able to suffer so great an extension any ways without at all hurting or dilacerating any part of it but since we are informd by the microscope that it consists of a great many small filaments which are implicated or intangled one within another almost no otherwise then the hairs in a lock of wool or the flakes in a heap of tow though not altogether so loose but the filaments are here and there twisted as twere or interwoven and here and there they join and unite with one another so as indeed the whole skin seems to be but one piece we need not much wonder and though these fibres appear not through a microscope exactly jointed and contexd as in sponge yet as i formerly hinted i am apt to think that could we find some way of discovering the texture of it whilst it invests the living animal or had some very easie way of separating the pulp or intercurrent juices such as in all probability fill those interstitia without dilacerating brusing or otherwise spoiling the texture of it as it seems to be very much by the ways of tanning and dressing now usd we might discover a much more curious texture then i have hitherto been able to find perhaps somewhat like that of sponges  that of chamoise leather is indeed very much like that of spunk save onely that the filaments seem nothing neer so even and round nor altogether so small nor has it so curious joints as spunk has some of which i have lately discoverd like those of a sponge and perhaps all these three bodies may be of the same kind of substance though two of them indeed are commonly accounted vegetable which whether they be so or no i shall not now dispute but this seems common to all three that they undergo a tanning or dressing whereby the interspersd juices are wasted and washd away before the texture of them can be discoverd  what their way is of dressing or curing sponges i confess i cannot learn but the way of dressing spunk is by boiling it a good while in a strong lixivium and then beating it very well and the manner of dressing leather is sufficiently known  it were indeed extremely desirable if such a way could be found whereby the parenchyma or flesh of the muscles and several other parts of the body might be washd or wafted clean away without vitiating the form of the fibrous parts or vessells of it for hereby the texture of thole parts by the help of a good microscope might be most accurately found  but to digress no further we may from this discovery of the microscope plainly enough understand how the skin though it looks so close as it does comes to give a passage to so vast a quantity of excrementitious substances as the diligent sanctorius has excellently observed it to do in his medicina statica for it seems very probable from the texture after dressing that there are an infinit of pores that every way pierce it and that those pores are onely filld with some kind of juice or some very pulpy soft substance and thereby the steams may almost as easily find a passage through such a fluid vehicle as the vaporous bubbles which are generated at the bottom of a kettle of hot water do find a passage through that fluid medium into the ambient air  nor is the skin of animals only thus pervious but even those of vegetables also seem to be the same for otherwise i cannot conceive why if two sprigs of rosemary for instance be taken as exactly alike in all particulars as can be and the one be set with the bottom in a glass of water and the other be set just without the glass but in the air onely though you stop the lower end of that in the air very carefully with wax yet shall it presently almost wither whereas the other that seems to have a supply from the subjacent water by its small pipes or microscopical pores preserves its greenness for many days and sometimes weeks  now this to me seems not likely to proceed from any other cause then the avolation of the juice through the skin for by the wax all those other pores of the stem are very firmly and closely stopd up and from the more or less porousness of the skins or rinds of vegetables may perhaps be somewhat of the reason given why they keep longer green or sooner wither for we may observe by the bladdering and craking of the leaves of bays holly laurel c that their skins are very close and do not suffer so free a passage through them of the included juices  but of this and of the experiment of the rosemary i shall elsewhere more fully consider seeming to me an extreme luciferous experiment such as seems indeed very plainly to prove the schematism or structure of vegetables altogether mechanical and as necessary that water and warmth being applyd to the bottom of the sprig of a plant some of it should be carried upwards into the stem and thence distributed into the leaves as that the water of the thames covering the bottom of the mills at the bridge foot of london and by the ebbing and flowing of it passing strongly by them should have some part of it conveyd to the cesterns above and thence into several houses and cesterns up and down the city                                        observ xxxiii of the scales of a soal and other fishes  having hinted somewhat of the skin and covering of terrestrial animals i shall next add an observation i made on the skin and scales of a soal a small fish commonly enough known and here in fishes as well as other animals nature follows its usual method framing all parts so as that they are both usefull and ornamental in all its composures mingling utile and dulce together and both these designs it seems to follow though our unassisted senses are not able to peceive them this is not onely manifest in the covering of this fish but in multitudes of others which it would be too long to enumerate witness particularly that small sand shell which i mentiond in the xi observation and infinite other small shells and scales divers of which i have viewd this skin i viewd was flead from a pretty large soal and then expanded and dryd the inside of it when dry to the naked eye lookd very like a piece of canvass but the microscope discoverd that texture to be nothing else but the inner ends of those curious scolopd scales i i i in the second figure of the xxi scheme namely the part of gggg of the larger representation of a single scale in the first figure of the same scheme which on the back side through an ordinary single magnifying glass lookd not unlike the tyles on an house  the outside of it to the naked eye exhibited nothing more of ornament save the usual order of ranging the scales into a triagonal form onely the edges seemd a little to shine the finger being rubbd from the tailwards towards the head the scales seemd to stay and raze it but through an ordinary magnifying glass it exhibited a most curiously carved and adorned surface such as is visible in the second figure each of those formerly almost imperceptible scales appearing much of the shape i i i that is they were round and protuberant and somewhat shapd like a scolop the whole scale being creasd with curiously wavd and indented ridges with proportionable furrows between each of which was terminated with a very sharp transparent bony substance which like so many small turnpikes seemd to arm the edges  the back part kkk was the skin into which each of these scales were very deeply fixd in the curious regular order visible in the second figure the length and shape of the part of the scale which was buried by the skin is evidenced by the first figure which is the representation of one of them pluckd out and viewd through a good microscope namely the part lfggfl wherein is also more plainly to be seen the manner of carving of the scolopt part of every particular scale how each ridge or barr eee is alternately hollowed or engraven and how every gutter between them is terminated with very transparent and hard pointed spikes and how every other of these as aaaa are much longer then the interjacent ones ddd  the texture or form also of the hidden part appears namely the middle part ggg seems to consist of a great number of small quills or pipes by which perhaps the whole may be nourished and the side parts ff consist of a more fibrous texture though indeed the whole scale seemd to be of a very tough gristly substance like the larger scales of other fishes  the scales of the skin of a dogfish which is usd by such as work in wood for the smoothing of their work and consists plainly enough to the naked eye of a great number off small horny points through the microscope appeard each of them curiously ridgd and very neatly carved and indeed you can hardly look on the scales of any fish but you may discover abundance of curiosity and beautifying and not only in these fishes but in the shells and crusts or armour of most sorts of marine animals so invested                                        observ xxxiv of the sting of a bee  the sting of a bee delineated in the second figure of the xvi scheme seems to be a weapon of offence and is as great an instance that nature did realy intend revenge as any and that first because there seems to be no other use of it secondly by reason of its admirable shape seeming to be purposely shapd for that very end thirdly from the virulency of the liquor it ejects and the sad effects and symptoms that follow it  but whatever be the use of it certain it is that the structure of it is very admirable what it appears to the naked eye i need not describe the thing being known almost to every one but it appears through the microscope to consist of two parts the one a sheath without a chape or top shapd almost like the holster of a pistol beginning at d and ending at b this sheath i could most plainly perceive to be hollow and to contain in it both a sword or dart and the poisonous liquor that causes the pain the sheath or case seemd to have several joints or settings together marked by fghiklmno it was armd moreover neer the top with several crooks or forks pqrst on one side and pqrstu on the other each of which seemd like so many thorns growing on a briar or rather like so many cats claws for the crooks themselves seemd to be little sharp transparent points or claws growing out of little protuberancies on the side of the sheath which by observing the figure diligently is easie enough to be perceivd and from several particulars i suppose the animal has a power of displaying them and shutting them in again as it pleases as a cat does its claws or as an adder or viper can its teeth or fangs  the other part of the sting was the sword as i may so call it which is sheathd as it were in it the top of which ab appears quite through at the smaller end just as if the chape of the sheath of a sword were lost and the end of it appeard beyond the scabbard the end of this darta was very sharp and it was armd likewise with the like tenterhooks or claws with those of the sheath such as vxy xyzz these crooks i am very apt to think can be closd up also or laid flat to the sides of the sword when it is drawn into the scabbard as i have several times observd it to be and can be spred again or extended when ever the animal pleases  the consideration of which very pretty structure has hinted to me that certainly the use of these claws seems to be very considerable as to the main end of this instrument for the drawing in and holding the sting in the flesh for the point being very sharp the top of the sting or dagger ab is very easily thrust into an animals body which being once entred the bee by endeavouring to pull it into the sheath draws by reason of the crooks vxy and xyzz which lay hold of the skin on either side the top of the sheath tsrv into the skin after it and the crooks t s and r v being entred when the bee endeavours to thrust out the top of the sting out of the sheath again they lay hold of the skin on either side and do not onely keep the sheath from sliding back but helps the top inwards and thus by an alternate and successive retracting and emitting of the sting in and out of the sheath the little enraged creature by degrees makes his revengfull weapon pierce the toughest and thickest hides of his enemies in so much that some few of these stout and resolute soldiers with these little engines do often put to flight a huge masty bear one of their deadly enemies and thereby shew the world how much more considerable in warr a few skilfull engineers and resolute soldiers politickly orderd that know how to manage such engines are then a vast unweildy rude force that confides in and acts onely by its strength but to proceed that he thus gets in his sting into the skin i conjecture because when i have observd this creature living i have found it to move the sting thus to and fro and thereby also perhaps does as twere pump or force out the poisonous liquor and make it hang at the end of the sheath about b in a drop the crooks i suppose also to be the cause why these angry creatures hastily removing themselves from their revenge do often leave these weapons behind them sheathd as twere in the flesh and by that means cause the painfull symptoms to be greater and more lasting which are very probably causd partly by the piercing and tearing of the skin by the sting but chiefly by the corrosive and poisonous liquor that is by this syringepipe conveyd among the sensitive parts thereof and thereby more easily gnaws and corrodes those tender fibres as i have shewed in the description of a nettle and of cowhage                                        observ xxxv of the contexture and shape of the particles of feathers  examining several sorts of feathers i took notice of these particulars in all sorts of wingfeathers especially in those which servd for the beating of the air in the action of flying  that the outward surface of the quill and stem was of a very hard stiff and horny substance which is obvious enough and that the part above the quill was filld with a very white and light pith and with the microscope i found this pith to be nothing else but a kind of natural congeries of small bubbles the films of which seem to be of the same substance with that of the quill that is of a stiff transparent horny substance  which particular seems to me very worthy a more serious consideration for here we may observe nature as twere put to its shifts to make a substance which shall be both light enough and very stiff and strong without varying from its own establishd principles which we may observe to be such that very strong bodies are for the most part very heavie also a strength of the parts usually requiring a density and a density a gravity and therefore should nature have made a body so broad and so strong as a feather almost any other way then what it has taken the gravity of it must necessarily have many times exceeded this for this pith seems to be like so many stops or cross pieces in a long optical tube which do very much contribute to the strength of the whole the pores of which were such as that they seemd not to have any communication with one another as i have elsewhere hinted  but the mechanism of nature is usually so excellent that one and the same substance is adapted to serve for many ends for the chief use of this indeed seems to be for the supply of nourishment to the downy or feathery part of the stem for tis obvious enough in all sorts of feathers that tis placd just under the roots of the branches that grow out of either side of the quill or stalk and is exactly shapd according to the ranking of those branches coming no lower into the quill then just the beginning of the downy branches and growing onely on the under side of of the quill where those branches do so now in a ripe feather as one may call it it seems difficult to conceive how the succus nutritius should be conveyd to this pith for it cannot i think be well imagind to pass through the substance of the quill since having examind it with the greatest diligence i was able i could not find the least appearance of pores but he that shall well examine an unripe or pinnd feather will plainly enough perceive the vessel for the conveyance of it to be the thin filmy pith as tis calld which passes through the middle of the quill  as for the make and contexture of the down it self it is indeed very rare and admirable and such as i can hardly believe that the like is to be discoverd in any other body in the world for there is hardly a large feather in the wing of a bird but contains neer a million of distinct parts and every one of them shapd in a most regular  admirable form adapted to a particular design for examining a middle cizd goosequill i easily enough found with my naked eye that the main stem of it containd about 300 longer and more downy branchings upon one side and as many on the other of more stiff but somewhat shorter branchings many of these long and downy branchings examining with an ordinary microscope i found divers of them to contain neer 1200 small leaves as i may call them such as ef of the first figure of the 22 scheme and as many stalks on the other side such as ik of the same figure each of the leaves or branchings ef seemd to be divided into about sixteen or eighteen small joints as may be seen plainly enough in the figure out of most of which there seem to grow small long fibres such as are expressd in the figure each of them very proportionably shapd according to its position or place on the stalk ef those on the under side of it namely 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 c being much longer then those directly opposite to them on the upper and divers of them such as 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 c were terminated with small crooks much resembling those small crooks which are visible enough to the naked eye in the seedbuttons of burdocks the stalks likewise ik on the other side seemd divided into neer as many small knotted joints but without any appearance of strings or crooks each of them about the middle k seemd divided into two parts by a kind of fork one side of which namely kl was extended neer the length of ki the other m was very short  the transverse sections of the stems of these branchings manifested the shape or figure of it to be much like inoe which consisted of a horny skin or covering and a white seemingly frothy pith much like the make of the main stem of a feather  the use of this strange kind of form is indeed more admirable then all the rest and such as deserves to be much more seriously examind and considerd then i have hitherto found time or ability to do for certainly it may very much instruct us in the nature of the air especially as to some properties of it  the stems of the downy branches inoe being rangd in the order visible enough to the naked eye at the distance of if or somewhat more the collateral stalks and leaves if i may so call those bodies i newly described are so rangd that the leaves or hairy stalks of the one side lie at top or are incumbent on the stalks of the other and cross each other much after the manner expressd in the second figure of the 22 scheme by which means every of those little hooked fibres of the leaved stalk get between the naked stalks and the stalks being full of knots and a prety way disjoind so as that the fibres can easily get between them the two parts are so closely and admirably woven together that it is able to impede for the greatest part the transcursion of the air and though they are so exceeding small as that the thickness of one of these stalks amounts not to a 500 part of an inch yet do they compose so strong a texture as notwithstanding the exceeding quick and violent beating of them against the air by the strength of the birds wing they firmly hold together and it argues an admirable providence of nature in the contrivance and fabrick of them for their texture is such that though by any external injury the parts of them are violently disjoynd so as that the leaves and stalks touch not one another and consequently several of these rents would impede the birds flying yet for the most part of themselves they readily rejoin and recontex themselves and are easily by the birds stroking the feather or drawing it through its bill all of them settled and woven into their former and natural posture for there are such an infinite company of those small fibres in the under side of the leaves and most of them have such little crooks at their ends that they readily catch and hold the stalks they touch  from which strange contexture it seems rational to suppose that there is a certain kind of mesh or hole so small that the air will not very easily pass through it as i hinted also in the sixth observation about small glass canes for otherwise it seems probable that nature would have drawn over some kind of thin film which should have covered all those almost square meshes or holes there seeming through the microscope to be more then half of the surface of the feather which is open and visibly pervious which conjecture will yet seem more probable from the texture of the brushie wings of the tinea argentea or white feather wingd moth which i shall anone describe but nature that knows best its own laws and the several properties of bodies knows also best how to adapt and fit them to her designed ends and whoso would know those properties must endeavour to trace nature in its working and to see what course she observes and this i suppose will be no inconsiderable advantage which the schematisms and structures of animate bodies will afford the diligent enquirer namely most sure and excellent instructions both as to the practical part of mechanicks and to the theory and knowledge of the nature of the bodies and motions                                        observ xxxvi of peacoks ducks and other feathers of   changeable colours  the parts of the feathers of this glorious bird appear through the microscope no less gaudy then do the whole feathers for as to the naked eye tis evident that the stem or quill of each feather in the tail sends out multitudes of lateral branches such as ab in the third figure of the 22 scheme represents a small part of about 132 part of an inch long and each of the lateral branches emit multitudes of little sprigs threads or hairs on either side of them such as cd cd cd so each of those threads in the microscope appears a large long body consisting of a multitude of bright reflecting parts whose figure tis no easie matter to determine as he that examines it shall find for every new position of it to the light makes it perfectly seem of another form and shape and nothing what it appeard a little before nay it appeard very differing ofttimes from so seemingly inconsiderable a circumstance that the interposing of ones hand between the light and it makes a very great change and the opening or shutting a casement and the like very much diversifies the appearance and though by examining the form of it very many ways which would be tedious here to enumerate i suppose i have discoverd the true figure of it yet oftentimes upon looking on it in another posture i have almost thought my former observations deficient though indeed upon further examination i have found even those also to confirm them  these threads therefore i find to be a congeries of small lamin√¶ or plates as eeeee c each of them shapd much like this of abcd in the fourth figure the part ac being a ridge prominency or stem and b and d the corners of two small thin plates that grow unto the small stalk in the middle so that they make a kind of little feather each of these plates lie one close to another almost like a company of sloping ridge or gutter tyles they grow on each side of the stalk opposite to one another by two and two from top to bottom in the manner expressd in the fifth figure the tops of the lower covering the roots of the next above them the under side of each of these laminated bodies is of a very dark and opacous substance and suffers very few rays to be trajected but reflects them all toward that side from whence they come much like the foil of a lookingglass but their upper sides seem to me to consist of a multitude of thin plated bodies which are exceeding thin and lie very close together and thereby like mother of pearl shells do not onely reflect a very brisk light but tinge that light in a most curious manner and by means of various positions in respect of the light they reflect back now one colour and then another and those most vividly  now that these colours are onely fantastical ones that is such as arise immediately from the refractions of the light i found by this that water wetting these colourd parts destroyd their colours which seemd to proceed from the alteration of the reflection and refraction now though i was not able to see those hairs at all transparent by a common light yet by looking on them against the sun i found them to be tingd with a darkish red colour nothing akin to the curious and lovely greens and blues they exhibited  what the reason of colour seems to be in such thin plated bodies i have elsewhere shewn but how water cast upon those threads destroys their colours i suppose to be performd thus the water falling upon these plated bodies from its having a greater congruity to feathers then the air insinuates it self between those plates and so extrudes the strong reflecting air whence both these parts grow more transparent as the microscope informs and colourless also at best retaining a very faint and dull colour but this wet being wasted away by the continual evaporations and steams that pass through them from the peacock whilst that bird is yet alive the colours again appear in their former luster the interstitia of these plates being filld with the strongly reflecting air  the beauteous and vivid colours of the feathers of this bird being found to proceed from the curious and exceeding smalness and fineness of the reflecting parts we have here the reason given us of all those gauderies in the apparel of other birds also and how they come to exceed the colours of all other kinds of animals besides insects for since as we here and elsewhere also shew the vividness of a colour depends upon the fineness and transparency of the reflecting and refracting parts and since our microscope discovers to us that the component parts of feathers are such and that the hairs of animals are otherwise and since we find also by the experiment of that noble and most excellent person i formerly named that the difference between silk and flax as to its colour is nothing else for flax reducd to a very great fineness of parts both white and colourd appears as white and as vivid as any silk but loses that brightness and its silken aspect as soon as it is twisted into thread by reason that the component parts though very small and fine are yet pliable flakes and not cylinders and thence by twisting become united into one opacous body whereas the threads of silk and feathers retain their lustre by preserving their cylindrical form intire without mixing so that each reflected and refracted beam that composes the gloss of silk preserves its own property of modulating the light intire and since we find the same confirmd by many other experiments elsewhere mentioned i think we may safely conclude this for an axiome that wheresoever we meet with transparent bodies spun out into very fine parts either cleer or any ways tingd the colours resulting from such a composition must necessarily be very glorious vivid and cleer like those of silk and feathers this may perhaps hint some usefull way of making other bodies besides silk be susceptible of bright tinctures but of this onely by the by  the changeable colourd feathers also of ducks and several other birds i have found by examination with my microscope to proceed from much the same causes and textures                                        observ xxxvii of the feet of flies and several other insects  the foot of a fly delineated in the first figure of the 23 scheme which represents three joints the two tallons and the two pattens in a flat posture and in the second figure of the same scheme which represents onely one joint the tallons and pattens in another posture is of a most admirable and curious contrivance for by this the flies are inabled to walk against the sides of glass perpendicularly upwards and to contain themselves in that posture as long as they please nay to walk and suspend themselves against the under surface of many bodies as the ceiling of a room or the like and this with as great a seeming facility and firmness as if they were a kind of antipodes and had a tendency upwards as we are sure they have the contrary which they also evidently discover in that they cannot make themselves so light as to stick or suspend themselves on the under surface of a glass well polishd and cleansd their suspension therefore is wholly to be ascribd to some mechanical contrivance in their feet which what it is we shall in brief explain by shewing that its mechanism consists principally in two parts that is first its two claws or tallons and secondly two palms pattens or soles  the two tallons are very large in proportion to the foot and handsomly shapd in the manner describd in the figures by ab and ac the bigger part of them from a to dd is all hairy or brisled but toward the top at c and b smooth the tops or points which seem very sharp turning downwards and inwards are each of them movd on a joint at a by which the fly is able to open or shut them at pleasure so that the points b and c being entered in any pores and the fly endeavouring to shut them the claws not onely draw one against another and so fasten each other but they draw the whole foot ggadd forward so that on a soft footing the tenters or points gggg whereof a fly has about ten in each foot to wit two in every joint run into the pores if they find any or at least make their way and this is sensible to the naked eye in the feet of a chafer which if he be sufferd to creep over the hand or any other part of the skin of ones body does make his steps as sensible to the touch as the sight  but this contrivance as it often fails the chafer when he walks on hard and close bodies so would it also our fly though he be a much lesser and nimbler creature and therefore nature has furnishd his foot with another additament much more curious and admirable and that is with a couple of palms pattens or soles dd the structure of which is this  from the bottom or under part of the last joint of his foot k arise two small thin plated horny substances each consisting of two flat pieces dd which seem to be flexible like the covers of a book about ff by which means the plains of the two sides ee do not always lie in the same plain but may be sometimes shut closer and so each of them may take a little hold themselves on a body but that is not all for the under sides of these soles are all beset with small brisles or tenters like the wire teeth of a card used for working wool the points of all which tend forwards hence the two tallons drawing the feet forwards as i before hinted and these being applied to the surface of the body with all the points looking the contrary way that is forwards and outwards if there be any irregularity or yielding in the surface of the body the fly suspends it self very firmly and easily without the access or need of any such sponges filld with an imaginary gluten as many have for want of good glasses perhaps or a troublesome and diligent examination supposd  now that the fly is able to walk on glass proceeds partly from some ruggedness of the surface and chiefly from a kind of tarnish or dirty smoaky substance which adheres to the surface of that very hard body and though the pointed parts cannot penetrate the substance of glass yet may they find pores enough in the tarnish or at least make them  this structure i somewhat the more diligently surveyd because i could not well comprehend how if there were such a glutinous matter in those supposed sponges as most that have observd that object in a microscope have hitherto believd how i say the fly could so readily unglew and loosen its feet and because i have not found any other creature to have a contrivance any ways like it and chiefly that we might not be cast upon unintelligible explications of the ph√¶nomena of nature at least others then the true ones where our senses were able to furnish us with an intelligible rationall and true one  somewhat a like contrivance to this of flies shall we find in most other animals such as all kinds of flies and casewingd creatures nay in a flea an animal abundantly smaller then this fly other creatures as mites the landcrab c have onely one small very sharp tallon at the end of each of their legs which all drawing towards the center or middle of their body inable these exceeding light bodies to suspend and fasten themselves to almost any surface  which how they are able to do will not seem strange if we consider first how little body there is in one of these creatures compard to their superficies or outside their thickness perhaps oftentimes not amounting to the hundredth part of an inch next the strength and agility of these creatures compard to their bulk being proportionable to their bulk perhaps an hundred times stronger then an horse or man and thirdly if we consider that nature does always appropriate the instruments so as they are the most fit and convenient to perform their offices and the most simple and plain that possibly can be this we may see further verifyd also in the foot of a louse which is very much differing from those i have been describing but more convenient and necessary for the place of its habitation each of his leggs being footed with a couple of small claws which he can open or shut at pleasure shapd almost like the claws of a lobster or crab but with appropriated contrivances for his peculiar life which being to move its body to and fro upon the hairs of the creature it inhabits nature has furnishd one of its claws with joints almost like the joints of a mans fingers so as thereby it is able to encompass or grasp a hair as firmly as a man can a stick or rope  nor is there a less admirable and wonderfull mechanism in the foot of a spider whereby he is able to spin weave and climb or run on his curious transparent clew of which i shall say more in the description of that animal  and to conclude we shall in all things find that nature does not onely work mechanically but by such excellent and most compendious as well as stupendious contrivances that it were impossible for all the reason in the world to find out any contrivance to do the same thing that should have more convenient properties and can any be so sottish as to think all those things the productions of chance certainly either their ratiocination must be extremely depraved or they did never attentively consider and contemplate the works of the almighty                                        observ xxxviii of the structure and motion of the wings of flies  the wings of all kinds of insects are for the most part very beautifull objects and afford no less pleasing an object to the mind to speculate upon then to the eye to behold this of the blue fly among the rest wants not its peculiar ornaments and contrivances it grows out of the thorax or middle part of the body of a fly and is seated a little beyond the center of gravity in the body towards the head but that excentricly is curiously balancd first by the expanded area of the wings which lies all more backwards then the root by the motion of them whereby the center of their vibration is much more backwards towards the tail of the fly then the root of the wing is what the vibrative motion of the wings is and after what manner they are moved i have endeavoured by many trials to find out and first for the manner of their motion i endeavoured to observe several of those kind of small spinning flies which will naturally suspend themselves as it were poisd and steady in one place of the air without rising or falling or moving forwards or backwards for by looking down on those i could by a kind of faint shadow perceive the utmost extremes of the vibrative motion of their wings which shadow whilst they so endeavoured to suspend themselves was not very long but when they endeavourd to flie forwards it was somewhat longer next i tried it by fixing the leggs of a fly upon the top of the stalk of a feather with glew wax c and then making it endeavour to flie away for being thereby able to view it in any posture i collected that the motion of the wing was after this manner the extreme limits of the vibrations were usually somewhat about the length of the body distant from one another oftentimes shorter and sometimes also longer that the formost limit was usually a little above the back and the hinder somwhat beneath the belly between which two limits if one may ghess by the sound the wing seemd to be movd forwards and backwards with an equal velocity and if one may from the shadow or faint representation the wings afforded and from the consideration of the nature of the thing ghess at the posture or manner of the wings moving between them it seemd to be this the wing being supposd placed in the upmost limit seems to be put so that the plain of it lies almost horizontal but onely the forepart does dip a little or is somewhat more deprest in this position is the wing vibrated or movd to the lower limit being almost arrived at the lower limit the hinder part of the wing moving somewhat faster then the former the area of the wing begins to dip behind and in that posture seems it to be movd to the upper limit back again and thence back again in the first posture the former part of the area dipping again as it is moved downwards by means of the quicker motion of the main stem which terminates or edges the forepart of the wing and these vibrations or motions to and fro between the two limits seem so swift that tis very probable from the sound it affords if it be compard with the vibration of a musical string tund unison to it it makes many hundreds if not some thousands of vibrations in a second minute of time and if we may be allowd to ghess by the sound the wing of a bee is yet more swift for the tone is much more acute and that in all likelihood proceeds from the exceeding swift beating of the air by the small wing and it seems the more likely too because the wing of a bee is less in proportion to its body then the other wing to the body of a fly so that for ought i know it may be one of the quickest vibrating spontaneous motions of any in the world and though perhaps there may be many flies in other places that afford a yet more shrill note with their wings yet tis most probable that the quickest vibrating spontaneous motion is to be found in the wing of some creature now if we consider the exceeding quickness of these animal spirits that must cause these motions we cannot chuse but admire the exceeding vividness of the governing faculty or anima of the insect which is able to dispose and regulate so the the motive faculties as to cause every peculiar organ not onely to move or act so quick but to do it also so regularly  whilst i was examining and considering the curious mechanism of the wings i observd that under the wings of most kind of flies bees c there were placd certain pendulums or extended drops as i may so call them from their resembling motion and figure for they much resembled a long hanging drop of some transparent viscous liquor and i observed them constantly to move just before the wings of the fly began to move so that at the first sight i could not but ghess that there was some excellent use as to the regulation of the motion of the wing and did phancy that it might be something like the handle of a cock which by vibrating to and fro might as twere open and shut the cock and thereby give a passage to the determinate influences into the muscles afterwards upon some other trials i supposd that they might be for some use in respiration which for many reasons i suppose those animals to use and me thought it was not very improbable but that they might have convenient passages under the wings for the emitting at least of the air if not admitting as in the gills of fishes is most evident or perhaps this pendulum might be somewhat like the staff to a pump whereby these creatures might exercise their analogous lungs and not only draw in but force out the air they live by but these were but conjectures and upon further examination seemd less probable  the fabrick of the wing as it appears through a moderately magnifying microscope seems to be a body consisting of two parts as is visible in the 4 figure of the 23 scheme and by the 2 figure of the 26 scheme the one is a quilly or finny substance consisting of several long slender and variously bended quills or wires something resembling the veins of leaves these are as twere the finns or quills which stiffen the whole area and keep the other part distended which is a very thin transparent skin or membrane variously folded and platted but not very regularly and is besides exceeding thickly bestuck with innumerable small bristles which are onely perceptible by the bigger magnifying microscope and not with that neither but with a very convenient augmentation of skylight projected on the object with a burning glass as i have elsewhere shewd or by looking through it against the light  in steed of these small hairs in several other flies there are infinite of small feathers which cover both the under and upper sides of this thin film as in almost all the sorts of butterflies and moths and those small parts are not onely shapd very much like the feathers of birds but like those variegated with all the variety of curious bright and vivid colours imaginable and those feathers are likewise so admirably and delicately rangd as to compose very fine flourishings and ornamental paintings like turkie and persian carpets but of far more surpassing beauty as is evident enough to the naked eye in the painted wings of butterflies but much more through an ordinary microscope  intermingled likewise with these hairs may be perceived multitudes of little pits or black spots in the exended membrane which seem to be the root of the hairs that grow on the other side these two bodies seem dispersd over the whole surface of the wing  the hairs are best perceivd by looking through it against the light or by laying the wing upon a very white piece of paper in a convenient light for thereby every little hair most manifestly appears a specimen of which you may observe drawn in the fourth figure of the 23 scheme ab cd ef whereof represent some parts of the bones or quills of the wing each of which you may perceive to be coverd over with a multitude of scales or bristles the former ab is the biggest stem of all the wing and may be properly enough calld the cutair it being that which terminates and stiffens the formost edge of the wing the foreedge of this is armd with a multitude of little brisles or tenterhooks in some standing regular and in order in others not all the points of which are directed from the body towards the tip of the wing nor is this edge onely thus fringd but even all the whole edge of the wing is covered with a small fringe consisting of short and more slender brisles  this subject had i time would afford excellent matter for the contemplation of the nature of wings and of flying but because i may perhaps get a more convenient time to prosecute that speculation and recollect several observations that i have made of that particular i shall at present proceed to                                        observ xxxix of the eyes and head of a grey dronefly and of several other creatures  i took a large grey dronefly that had a large head but a small and slender body in proportion to it and cutting off its head i fixd it with the forepart or face upwards upon my object plate this i made choice of rather then the head of a great blue fly because my enquiry being now about the eyes i found this fly to have first the biggest clusters of eyes in proportion to his head of any small kind of fly that i have yet seen it being somewhat inclining towards the make of the large dragonflies next because there is a greater variety in the knobs or balls of each cluster then is of any small fly then examining it according to my usual manner by varying the degrees of light and altering its position to each kinde of light i drew that representation of it which is delineated in the 24 scheme and found these things to be as plain and evident as notable and pleasant  first that the greatest part of the face nay of the head was nothing else but two large and protuberant bunches or prominent parts abcdea the surface of each of which was all coverd over or shapd into a multitude of small hemispheres placd in a triagonal order that being the closest and most compacted and in that order rangd over the whole surface of the eye in very lovely rows between each of which as is necessary were left long and regular trenches the bottoms of every of which were perfectly intire and not at all perforated or drilld through which i most certainly was assured of by the regularly reflected image of certain objects which i movd to and fro between the head and the light and by examining the cornea or outward skin after i had stript it off from the several substances that lay within it and by looking both upon the inside and against the light  next that of those multitudes of hemispheres there were observable two degrees of bigness the half of them that were lowermost and lookd toward the ground or their own leggs namely cde cde being a pretty deal smaller then the other namely abce abce that lookd upward and sideways or foreright and backward which variety i have not found in any other small fly  thirdly that every one of these hemispheres as they seemd to be pretty neer the true shape of a hemisphere so was the surface exceeding smooth and regular reflecting as exact regular and perfect an image of any object from the surface of them as a small ball of quicksilver of that bigness would do but nothing neer so vivid the reflection from these being very languid much like the reflection from the outside of water glass crystal c in so much that in each of these hemispheres i have been able to discover a landscape of those things which lay before my window one thing of which was a large tree whose trunk and top i could plainly discover as i could also the parts of my window and my hand and fingers if i held it between the window and the object a small draught of nineteen of which as they appeard in the bigger magnifyingglass to reflect the image of the two windows of my chamber are delineated in the third figure of the 23 scheme  fourthly that these rows were so disposd that there was no quarter visible from his head that there was not some of these hemispheres directed against so that a fly may be truly said to have an eye every way and to be really circumspect and it was further observable that that way where the trunk of his body did hinder his prospect backward these protuberances were elevated as it were above the plain of his shoulders and back so that he was able to see backwards also over his back  fifthly in living flies i have observd that when any small mote or dust which flies up and down the air chances to light upon any part of these knobs as it is sure to stick firmly to it and not fall though through the microscope it appears like a large stone or stick which one would admire especially since it is no ways probable that there is any wet or glutinous matter upon these hemispheres but i hope i shall render the reason in another place so the fly presently makes use of his two forefeet in stead of eyelids with which as with two brooms or brushes they being all bestuck with brisles he often sweeps or brushes off what ever hinders the prospect of any of his hemispheres and then to free his leggs from that dirt he rubs them one against another the pointed brisles or tenters of which looking both one way the rubbing of them to and fro one against another does cleanse them in the same manner as i have observd those that card wool to cleanse their cards by placing their cards so as the teeth of both look the same way and then rubbing them one against another in the very same manner do they brush and cleanse their bodies and wings as i shall by and by shew other creatures have other contrivances for the cleansing and cleering their eyes  sixthly that the number of the pearls or hemispheres in the clusters of this fly was neer 14000 which i judged by numbering certain rows of them several ways and casting up the whole content accounting each cluster to contain about seven thousand pearls three thousand of which were of a size and consequently the rows not so thick and the foure thousand i accounted to be the number of the smaller pearls next the feet and proboscis other animals i observd to have yet a greater number as the dragonfly or adderbolt and others to have a much less company as an ant c and several other small flies and insects  seventhly that the order of these eies or hemispheres was altogether curious and admirable they being placd in all kind of flies and aerial animals in a most curious and regular ordination of triangular rows in which order they are rangd the neerest together that possibly they can and consequently leave the least pits or trenches between them but in shrimps crawfishes lobsters and such kinds of crustaceous water animals i have yet observd them rangd in a quadrangular order the rows cutting each other at right angles which as it admits of a less number of pearls in equal surfaces so have those creatures a recompence made them by having their eyes a little movable in their heads which the other altogether want so infinitely wise and provident do we find all the dispensations in nature that certainly epicurus and his followers must very little have considerd them who ascribd those things to the production of chance that wil to a more attentive considerer appear the products of the highest wisdom and providence  upon the anatomy or dissection of the head i observd these particulars  first that this outward skin like the cornea of the eyes of the greater animals was both flexible and transparent and seemd through the microscope perfectly to resemble the very substance of the cornea of a mans eye for having cut out the cluster and removd the dark and mucous stuff that is subjacent to it i could see it transparent like a thin piece of skin having as many cavities in the inside of it and rangd in the same order as it had protuberances on the outside and this propriety i found the same in all the animals that had it whether flies or shellfish  secondly i found that all animals that i have observd with those kind of eyes have within this cornea a certain cleer liquor or juice though in a very little quantity and  i observd thirdly that within that cleer liquor they had a kind of dark mucous lining which was all spread round within the cavity of the clutter and seemd very neer adjoining to it the colour of which in some flies was grey in others black in others red in others of a mixd colour in others spotted and that the whole clusters when lookd on whilst the animal was living or but newly killd appeard of the same colour that this coat as i may so call it appeard of when that outward skin or cornea was removd  fourthly that the rest of the capacity of the clusters was in some as in dragon flies c hollow or empty in others filld with some kind of substance in blue flies with a reddish musculous substance with fibres tending from the center or bottom outwards and divers other with various and differing kinds of substances  that this curious contrivance is the organ of sight to all those various crustaceous animals which are furnishd with it i think we need not doubt if we consider but the several congruities it has with the eyes of greater creatures  as first that it is furnishd with a cornea with a transparent humour and with a uvea or retina that the figure of each of the small hemispheres are very spherical exactly polishd and most vivid lively and plump when the animal is living as in greater animals and in like manner dull flaccid and irregular or shrunk when the animal is dead  next that those creatures that are furnishd with it have no other organs that have any resemblance to the known eyes of other creatures  thirdly that those which they call the eyes of crabs lobsters shrimps and the like and are really so are hemispherd almost in the same manner as these of flies are and that they really are so i have very often tryd by cutting off these little movable knobs and putting the creature again into the water that it would swim to and fro and move up and down as well as before but would often hit it self against the rocks or stones and though i put my hand just before its head it would not at all start or fly back till i touchd it whereas whilst those were remaining it would start back and avoid my hand or a stick at a good distance before it touchd it and if in crustaceous seaanimals then it seems very probable also that these knobs are the eyes in crustaceous insects which are also of the same kind onely in a higher and more active element this the conformity or congruity of many other parts common to either of them will strongly argue their crustaceous armour their number of leggs which are six beside the two great claws which answer to the wings in insects and in all kind of spiders as also in many other insects that want wings we shall find the compleat number of them and not onely the number but the very shape figure joints and claws of lobsters and crabs as is evident in scorpions and spiders as is visible in the second figure of the 31 scheme and in the little miteworm which i call a landcrab describd in the second figure of the 33 scheme but in their manner of generation being oviparous c and it were very worthy observation whether there be not some kinds of transformation and metamorphosis in the several states of crustaceous wateranimals as there is in several sorts of insects for if such could be met with the progress of the variations would be much more conspicuous in those larger animals then they can be in any kind of insects our colder climate affords  these being their eyes it affords us a very pretty speculation to contemplate their manner of vision which as it is very differing from that of biocular animals so is it not less admirable  that each of these pearls or hemispheres is a perfect eye i think we need not doubt if we consider onely the outside or figure of any one of them for they being each of them coverd with a transparent protuberant cornea and containing a liquor within them resembling the watry or glassie humours of the eye must necessarily refract all the parallel rays that fall on them out of the air into a point not farr distant within them where in all probability the retina of the eye is placed and that opacous dark and mucous inward coat that i formerly shewd i found to subtend the concave part of the cluster is very likely to be that tunicle or coat it appearing through the microscope to be placd a little more than a diameter of those pearls below or within the tunica cornea and if so then is there in all probability a little picture or image of the objects without painted or made at the bottom of the retina against every one of those pearls so that there are as many impressions on the retina or opacous skin as there are pearls or hemispheres on the cluster but because it is impossible for any protuberant surface whatsoever whether sph√¶rial or other so to refract the rays that come from farr remote lateral points of any object as to collect them again and unite them each in a distinct point and that onely those rays which come from some point that lies in the axis of the figure producd are so accurately refracted to one and the same point again and that the lateral rays the further they are removd the more imperfect is their refracted confluence it follows therefore that onely the picture of those parts of the external objects that lie in or neer the axis of each hemisphere are discernably painted or made on the retina of each hemisphere and that therefore each of them can distinctly sensate or see onely those parts which are very neer perpendicularly opposd to it or lie in or neer its optick axis now though there may be by each of these eyepearls a representation to the animal of a whole hemisphere in the same manner as in a mans eye there is a picture or sensation in the retina of all the objects lying almost in an hemisphere yet as in a mans eye also there are but some very few points which liyng in or neer the optick axis are distinctly discernd so there may be multitudes of pictures made of an object in the several pearls and yet but one or some very few that are distinct the representation of any object that is made in any other pearl but that which is directly or very neer directly opposd being altogether confusd and unable to produce a distinct vision  so that we see that though it has pleasd the allwise creator to indue this creature with such multitudes of eyes yet has he not indued it with the faculty of seeing more then another creature for whereas this cannot move his head at least can move it very little without moving his whole body biocular creatures can in an instant or the twinkling of an eye which being very quick is vulgarly used in the same signification move their eyes so as to direct the optick axis to any point nor is it probable that they are able to see attentively at one time more then one physical point for though there be a distinct image made in every eye yet tis very likely that the observing faculty is only imployd about some one object for which they have most concern  now as we accurately distinguish the site or position of an object by the motion of the muscles of the eye requisite to put the optick line in a direct position and confusedly by the position of the imperfect picture of the object at the bottom of the eye so are these crustaceous creatures able to judge confusedly of the position of objects by the picture or impression made at the bottom of the opposite pearl and distinctly by the removal of the attentive or observing faculty from one pearl to another but what this faculty is as it requires another place so a much deeper speculation now because it were impossible even with this multitude of eyeballs to see any object distinct for as i hinted before onely those parts that lay in or very neer the optick lines could be so the infinitely wise creator has not left the creature without a power of moving the head a little in aerial crustaceous animals and the very eyes also in crustaceous seaanimals so that by these means they are inabled to direct some optick line or other against any object and by that means they have the visive faculty as compleat as any animal that can move its eyes  distances of objects also tis very likely they distinguish partly by the consonant impressions made in some two convenient pearls one in each cluster for according as those congruous impressions affect two pearls neerer approachd to each other the neerer is the object and the farther they are distant the more distant is the object partly also by the alteration of each pearl requisite to make the sensation or picture perfect for tis impossible that the pictures of two objects variously distant can be perfectly painted or made on the same retina or bottom of the eye not altered as will be very evident to any one that shall attentively consider the nature of refraction now whether this alteration may be in the figure of the cornea in the motion of access or recess of the retina towards the cornea or in the alteration of a crustaline humour if such there be i pretend not to determine though i think we need not doubt but that there may be as much curiosity of contrivance and structure in every one of these pearls as in the eye of a whale or elephant and the almightys fiat could as easily cause the existence of the one as the other and as one day and a thousand years are the same with him so may one eye and ten thousand  this we may be sure of that the filaments or sensative parts of the retina must be most exceedingly curious and minute since the whole picture it self is such what must needs the component parts be of that retina which distinguishes the part of an objects picture that must be many millions of millions less then that in a mans eye and how exceeding curious and subtile must the component parts of the medium that conveys light be when we find the instrument made for its reception or refraction to be so exceedingly small we may i think from this speculation be sufficiently discouraged from hoping to discover by any optick or other instrument the determinate bulk of the parts of the medium that conveys the pulse of light since we find that there is not less accurateness shewn in the figure and polish of those exceedingly minute lenticular surfaces then in those more large and conspicuous surfaces of our own eyes and yet can i not doubt but that there is a determinate bulk of those parts since i find them unable to enter between the parts of mercury which being in motion must necessarily have pores as i shall elsewhere shew and here pass by as being a digression  as concerning the horns ff the feelers or smellers gg the probascis hh and i the hairs and brisles kk i shall indeavour to describe in the 42 observation                                        observ xl of the teeth of a snail  i have little more to add of the teeth of a snail besides the picture of it which is represented in the first figure of the 25 scheme save that his bended body abcdef which seemd fashioned very much like a row of small teeth orderly placd in the gums and looks as if it were divided into several smaller and greater black teeth was nothing but one small bended hard bone which was placd in the upper jaw of the mouth of a housesnail with which i observd this very snail to feed on the leaves of a rosetree and to bite out pretty large and half round bits not unlike the figure of a c nor very much differing from it in bigness the upper part abcd of this bone i found to be much whiter and to grow out of the upper chap of the snail ggg and not to be any thing neer so much creasd as the lower and blacker part of it hiihkkh which was exactly shapd like teeth the bone growing thinner or tapering to an edge towards kkk it seemd to have nine teeth or prominent parts ik ik if c which were joind together by the thinner interposd parts of the bone the animal to which these teeth belong is a very anomalous creature and seems of a kind quite distinct from any other terrestrial animal or insect the anatomy whereof exceedingly differing from what has been hitherto given of it i should have inserted but that it will be more proper in another place i have never met with any kind of animal whose teeth are all joind in one save onely that i lately observd that all the teeth of a rhinocerot which grow on either side of its mouth are joind into one large bone the weight of one of which i found to be neer eleven pound haverdupois so that it seems one of the biggest sort of terrestrial animals as well as one of the smallest has his teeth thus shapd                                        observ xli of the eggs of silkworms and other insects  the eggs of silkworms one of which i have describd in the second figure of 25 scheme afford a pretty object for a microscope that magnifies very much especially if it be bright weather and the light of a window be cast or collected on it by a deep convexglass or waterball for then the whole surface of the shell may be perceivd all coverd over with exceeding small pits or cavities with interposed edges almost in the manner of the surface of a poppyseed but that these holes are not an hundredth part scarce of their bigness the shell when the young ones were hatchd which i found an easie thing to do if the eggs were kept in a warm place appeard no thicker in proportion to its bulk then that of an hens or gooss egg is to its bulk and all the shell appeard very white which seemd to proceed from its transparency whence all those pittings did almost vanish so that they could not without much difficulty be discernd the inside of the shell seemd to be lind also with a kind of thin film not unlike keeping the proportion to its shell that with which the shell of an henegg is lind and the shell it self seemd like common eggshells very brittle and crackd in divers other of these eggs i could plainly enough through the shell perceive the small insect lie coyled round the edges of the shell the shape of the egg it self the figure pretty well represents though by default of the graver it does not appear so rounded and lying above the paper as it were as it ought to do that is it was for the most part pretty oval endways somewhat like an egg but the other way it was a little flatted on two opposite sides divers of these eggs as is common to most others i found to be barren or addle for they never afforded any young ones and those i usually found much whiter then the other that were prolifick the eggs of other kinds of oviparous insects i have found to be perfectly round every way like so many globules of this sort i have observd some sorts of spiders eggs and chancing the last summer to inclose a very large and curiously painted butterfly in a box intending to examine its gaudery with my microscope i found within a day or two after i inclosd her almost all the inner surface of the box coverd over with an infinite of exactly round eggs which were stuck very fast to the sides of it and in so exactly regular and close an order that made me call to mind my hypothesis which i had formerly thought on for the making out of all the regular figures of salt which i have elsewhere hinted for here i found all of them rangd into a most exact triagonal order much after the manner as the hemispheres are place on the eye of a fly all which eggs i found after a little time to be hatchd and out of them to come a multitude of small worms very much resembling young silkworms leaving all their thin hollow shells behind them sticking on the box in their triagonal posture these i found with the microscope to have much such a substance as the silkworms eggs but could not perceive them pitted and indeed there is as great a variety in the shape of the eggs of oviparous insects as among those of birds  of these eggs a large and lusty fly will at one time lay neer four or five hundred so that the increase of these kind of insects must needs be very prodigious were they not preyd on by multitudes of birds and destroyd by frosts and rains and hence tis those hotter climates between the tropicks are infested with such multitudes of locusts and such other vermine                                        observ xlii of a blue fly  this kind of fly whereof a microscopical picture is delineated in the first figure of the 26 scheme is a very beautifull creature and has many things about it very notable divers of which i have already partly describd namely the feet wings eyes and head in the preceding observations  and though the head before describd be that of a grey dronefly yet for the main it is very agreeable to this the things wherein they differ most will be easily enough found by the following particulars  first the clusters of eyes of this fly are very much smaller then those of the dronfly in proportion to the head  and next all the eyes of each cluster seemd much of the same bigness one with another not differing as the other but rangd in the same triagonal order  thirdly between these two clusters there was a scaly prominent front b which was armd and adornd with large tapering sharp black brisles which growing out in rows on either side were so bent toward each other neer the top as to make a kind of arched arbour of brisles which almost coverd the former front  fourthly at the end of this arch about the middle of the face on a prominent part c grew two small oblong bodies dd which through a microscope lookd not unlike the pendants in lillies these seemd to be jointed on to two small parts at c each of which seemd again jointed into the front  fifthly out of the upper part and outsides of these horns as i may call them from the figure they are of in the 24 scheme where they are marked with ff there grows a single feather or brushy brisle ee somewhat of the same kind with the tufts of a gnat which i have before described  what the use of these kind of horned and tufted bodies should be i cannot well imagine unless they serve for smelling or hearing though how they are adapted for either it seems very difficult to describe they are in almost every several kind of flies of so various a shape though certainly they are some very essential part of the head and have some very notable office assignd them by nature since in all insects they are to be found in one or other form  sixthly at the under part of the face ff were several of the former sort of bended brisles and below all the mouth out of the middle of which grew the proboscis ghi which by means of several joints whereof it seemd to consist the fly was able to move to and fro and thrust it in and out as it pleasd the end of this hollow body which was all over coverd with small short hairs or brisles was as twere bent at h and the outer or formost side of the bended part hi slit as it were into two chaps hi hi all the outside of which where coverd with hairs and pretty large brisles these he could like two chaps very readily open and shut and when he seemd to suck any thing from the surface of a body he would spread abroad those chaps and apply the hollow part of them very close to it  from either side of the proboscis within the mouth grew two other small horns or fingers kk which were hairy but small in this figure but of another shape and bigger in proportion in the 24 scheme where they are marked with gg which two indeed seemd a kind of smellers but whether so or not i cannot positively determine  the thorax or middle part of this fly was casd both above and beneath with a very firm crust of armour the upper part more round and covered over with long conical brisles all whose ends pointed backwards out of the hinder and under part of this grew out in a cluster six leggs three of which are apparent in the figure the other three were hid by the body placd in that posture the leggs were all much of the same make being all of them coverd with a strong hairy scale or shel just like the legs of a crabb or lobster and the contrivance of the joints seemd much the same each legg seemd made up of eight parts 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 to the eighth or last of which grew the soles and claws described before in the 38 observation  out of the upper part of this trunck grew the two wings which i mentiond in the 38 observation consisting of a film extended on certain small stiff wires or bones these in a blue fly were much longer then the body but in other kind of flies they are of very differing proportions to the body these films in many flies were so thin that like several other plated bodies mentiond in the ninth observation they afforded all varieties of fantastical or transient colours the reason of which i have here endeavoured to explain they seemd to receive their nourishment from the stalks or wires which seemd to be hollow and neer the upper part of the wing ll several of them seemd jointed the shape of which will sufficiently appear by the black lines in the second figure of the 26 scheme which is a delineation of one of those wings expanded directly to the eyes  all the hinder part of its body is coverd with a most curious blue shining armour looking exactly like a polishd piece of steel brought to that blue colour by annealing all which armour is very thick bestuck with abundance of tapering brisles such as grow on its back as is visible enough by the figure  nor was the inside of this creature less beautifull then its outside for cutting off a part of the belly and then viewing it to see if i could discover any vessels such as are to be found in a greater animals and even in snails exceeding manifestly i found much beyond my expectation that there were abundance of branchings of milkwhite vessels no less curious then the branchings of veins and arteries in bigger terrestrial animals in one of which i found two notable branches joining their two main stocks as it were into one common ductus now to what veins or arteries these vessells were analogus whether to the vena porta or the meseraick vessells or the like or indeed whether they were veins and arteries or vasa lactea properly so called i am not hitherto able to determine having not yet made sufficient enquiry but in all particulars there seems not to be any thing less of curious contrivance in these insects then in those larger terrestrial animals for i had never seen any more curious branchings of vessels then those i observd in two or three of these flies thus opened  it is a creature active and nimble so as there are very few creatures like it whether bigger or smaller in so much that it will scape and avoid a small body though coming on it exceeding swiftly and if it sees any thing approaching it which it fears it presently squats down as it were that it may be the more ready for its rise  nor is it less hardy in the winter then active in the summer induring all the frosts and surviving till the next summer notwithstanding the bitter cold of our climate nay this creature will indure to be frozen and yet not be destroyd for i have taken one of them out of the snow whereon it has been frozen almost white with the ice about it and yet by thawing it gently by the warmth of a fire it has quickly revivd and flown about  this kind of fly seems by the steams or taste of fermenting and putrifying meat which it often kisses as twere with its proboscis as it trips over it to be stimulated or excited to eject its eggs or seed on it perhaps from the same reason as dogs cats and many other brute creatures are excited to their particular lusts by the smell of their females when by nature prepared for generation the males seeming by those kind of smells or other incitations to be as much necessitated thereto as aqua regis strongly impregnated with a solution of gold is forced to precipitate it by the affusion of spirit of urine or a solution of salt of tartar  one of these put in spirit of wine was very quickly seemingly killd and both its eys and mouth began to look very red but upon the taking of it out and suffering it to lie three or four hours and heating it with the sun beams cast through a burningglass it again revivd seeming as it were to have been all the intermediate time but dead drunk and after certain hours to grow fresh again and sober                                        observ xliii of the waterinsect or gnat  this little creature described in the first figure of the 27 scheme was a small scaled or crusted animal which i have often observd to be generated in rainwater i have also observd it both in pond and riverwater it is supposd by some to deduce its first original from the putrifaction of rainwater in which if it have stood any time open to the air you shall seldom miss all the summer long of store of them frisking too and fro  tis a creature wholly differing in shape from any i ever observd nor is its motion less strange it has a very large head in proportion to its body all covered with a shell like other testaceous animals but it differs in this that it has up and down several parts of it several tufts of hairs or brisles placd in the order expressd in the figure it has two horns which seemd almost like the horns of an oxe inverted and as neer as i could guess were hollow with tufts of brisles likewise at the top these horns they could move easily this or that way and might perchance be their nostrils it has a pretty large mouth which seemd contrivd much like those of crabs and lobsters by which i have often observd them to feed on water or some imperceptible nutritive substance in it  i could perceive through the transparent shell while the animal survivd several motions in the head thorax and belly very distinctly of differing kinds which i may perhaps elsewhere endeavour more accurately to examine and to shew of how great benefit the use of a microscope may be for the discovery of natures course in the operations performd in animal bodies by which we have the opportunity of observing her through these delicate and pellucid teguments of the bodies of insects acting according to her usual course and way undisturbed whereas when we endeavour to pry into her secrets by breaking open the doors upon her and dissecting and mangling creatures whilst there is life yet within them we find her indeed at work but put into such disorder by the violence offerd as it may easily be imagind how differing a thing we should find if we could as we can with a microscope in these smaller creatures quietly peep in at the windows without frighting her out of her usual byas  the form of the whole creature as it appeard in the microscope may without troubling you with more descriptions be plainly enough perceivd by the scheme the hinder part or belly consisting of eight several jointed parts namely abcdefgh of the first figure from the midst of each of which on either side issued out three or four small brisles or hairs i i i i i the tail was divided into two parts of very differing make one of them namely k having many tufts of hair or brisles which seemd to serve both for the finns and tail for the oars and ruder of this little creature wherewith it was able by frisking and bending its body nimbly to and fro to move himself any whither and to skull and steer himself as he pleasd the other part l seemd to be as twere the ninth division of his belly and had many single brisles on either side from the end v of which through the whole belly there was a kind of gut of a darker colour mmm wherein by certain peristaltick motions there was a kind of black substance movd upwards and downwards through it from the orbicular part of it n which seemd the ventricle or stomach to the tail v and so back again which peristaltick motion i have observd also in a louse a gnat and several other kinds of transparent bodyd flies the thorax or chest of this creature oooo was thick and short and pretty transparent for through it i could see the white heart which is the colour also of the bloud in these and most other insects to beat and several other kind of motions it was bestuck and adornd up and down with several tufts of brisles such as are pointed out by p p p p the head q was likewise bestuck with several of those tufts sss it was broad and short had two black eyes tt which i could not perceive at all pearld as they afterwards appeard and two small horns rr such as i formerly describd  both its motion and rest is very strange and pleasant and differing from those of most other creatures i have observd for where it ceases from moving its body the tail of it seeming much lighter then the rest of its body and a little lighter then the water it swims in presently boys it up to the top of the water where it hangs suspended with the head always downward and like our antipodes if they do by a frisk get below that superficies they presently ascend again unto it if they cease moving until they tread as it were under that superficies with their tails the hanging of these in this posture put me in mind of a certain creature i have seen in london that was brought out of america which would very firmly suspend it self by the tail with the head downwards and was said to keep in that posture with her young ones in her false belly which is a purse provided by nature for the production nutrition and preservation of her young ones which is described by piso in the 24 chapter of the fifth book of his natural history of brasil  the motion of it was with the tail forwards drawing its self backwards by the striking to and fro of that tuft which grew out of one of the stumps of its tail it had another motion which was more sutable to that of other creatures and that is with the head forward for by the moving of his chaps if i may so call the parts of his mouth it was able to move it self downwards very gently towards the bottom and did as twere eat up its way through the water  but that which was most observable in this creature was its metamorphosis or change for having kept several of these animals in a glass of rainwater in which they were producd i found after about a fortnight or three weeks keeping that several of them flew away in gnats leaving their husks behind them in the water floating under the surface the place where these animals were wont to reside whilst they were inhabitants of the water this made me more diligently to watch them to see if i could find them at the time of their transformation and not long after i observd several of them to be changed into an unusual shape wholly differing from that they were of before their head and body being grown much bigger and deeper but not broader and their belly or hinder part smaller and coyld about this great body much of the fashion represented by the prickd line in the second figure of the 27 scheme the head and horns now swam uppermost and the whole bulk of the body seemd to be grown much lighter for when by my frighting of it it would by frisking out of its tail in the manner expressd in the figure by bc sink it self below the surface towards the bottom the body would more swiftly reascend then when it was in its former shape  i still marked its progress from time to time and found its body still to grow bigger and bigger nature as it were fitting and accoutring it for the lighter element of which it was now going to be an inhabitant for by observing one of these with my microscope i found the eyes of it to be altogether differing from what they seemd before appearing now all over pearld or knobbd like the eyes of gnats as is visible in the second figure by a at length i saw part of this creature to swim above and part beneath the surface of the water below which though it would quickly plunge it self if i by any means frighted it and presently reascend into its former posture after a little longer expectation i found that the head and body of a gnat began to appear and stand cleer above the surface and by degrees it drew out its leggs first the two formost then the other at length its whole body perfect and entire appeard out of the husk which it left in the water standing on its leggs upon the top of the water and by degrees it began to move and after flew about the glass a perfect gnat  i have been the more particular and large in the relation of the transformation of divers of these little animals which i observd because i have not found that any authour has observd the like and because the thing it self is so strange and heterogeneous from the usual progress of other animals that i judge it may not onely be pleasant but very usefull and necessary towards the compleating of natural history  there is indeed in piso a very odd history which this relation may make the more probable and that is in the 2 chapter of the 4 book of his natural history of brasil where he says porro

a plant growing at the bottom of the sea before of it self out of whose putrifaction might be generated these strange kind of magots or whether the seed of certain bees sinking to the bottom might there naturally form it self that vegetable hive and take root or whether it might not be placed there by some diving fly or whether it might not be some peculiar propriety of that plant whereby it might ripen or form its vegetable juice into an animal substance or whether it may not be of the nature of a sponge or rather a sponge of the nature of this according to some of those relations and conjectures i formerly made of that body is a matter very difficult to be determined but indeed in this description the excellent piso has not been sufficiently particular in the setting down the whole process as it were to be wishd there are indeed very odd progresses in the production of several kinds of insects which are not less instructive then pleasant several of which the diligent goedartius has carefully observd and recorded but among all his observations he has none like this though that of the hemerobius be somewhat of this kind which is added as an appendix by johannes mey  i have for my own particular besides several of those mentiond by him observd divers other circumstances perhaps not much taken notice of though very common which do indeed afford us a very coercive argument to admire the goodness and providence of the infinitely wise creator in his most excellent contrivances and dispensations i have observd at several times of the summer that many of the leaves of divers plants have been spotted or as it were scabbed and looking on the undersides of those of them that have been but a litte irregular i have perceivd them to be sprinkled with divers sorts of little eggs which letting alone i have found by degrees to grow bigger and become little worms with leggs but still to keep their former places and those places of the leaves of their own accords to be grown very protuberant upwards and very hollow and arched underneath whereby those young creatures are as it were shelterd and housed from external injury divers leaves i have observd to grow and swell so farr as at length perfectly to inclose the animal which by other observations i have made i ghess to contain it and become as it were a womb to it so long till it be fit and prepard to be translated into another state at what time like what they say of vipers they gnaw their way through the womb that bred them divers of these kinds i have met with upon goosberry leaves rosetree leaves willow leaves and many other kinds  there are often to be found upon rosetrees and brier bushes little red tufts which are certain knobs or excrescencies growing out from the rind or barks of those kinds of plants they are coverd with strange kinds of threads or red hairs which feel very soft and look not unpleasantly in most of these if it has no hole in it you shall find certain little worms which i suppose to be the causes of their production for when that worm has eat its way through they having performed what they were designd by nature to do by degrees die and wither away  now the manner of their production i suppose to be thus that the alwise creator has as well implanted in every creature a faculty of knowing what place is convenient for the hatching nutrition and preservation of their eggs and ofsprings whereby they are stimulated and directed to convenient places which becom as twere the wombs that perform those offices as he has also suited and adapted a property to those places wherby they grow and inclose those seeds and having inclosed them provide a convenient nourishment for them but as soon as they have done the office of a womb they die and wither  the progress of inclosure i have often observd in leaves which in those places where those seeds have been cast have by degrees swelld and inclosd them so perfectly round as not to leave any perceptible passage out  from this same cause i suppose that galls oakapples and several other productions of that kind upon the branches and leaves of trees have their original for if you open any of them when almost ripe you shall find a little worm in them thus if you open never so many dry galls you shall find either a hole whereby the worm has eat its passage out or if you find no passage you may by breaking or cutting the gall find in the middle of it a small cavity and in it a small body which does plainly enough yet retain a shape to manifest it once to have been a worm though it dyd by a too early reparation from the oak on which it grew its navelstring as twere being broken off from the leaf or branch by which the globular body that invelopd it received its nourishment from the oak  and indeed if we consider the great care of the creator in the dispensations of his providences for the propagation and increase of the race not onely of all kind of animals but even of vegetables we cannot chuse but admire and adore him for his excellencies but we shall leave off to admire the creature or to wonder at the strange kind of acting in several animals which seem to favour so much of reason it seeming to me most manifest that those are but actings according to their structures and such operations as such bodies so composd must necessarily when there are such and such circumstances concurring perform thus when we find flies swarming about any piece of flesh that does begin a little to ferment butterflies about colworts and several other leaves which will serve to hatch and nourish their young gnats and several other flies about the waters and marishy places or any other creatures seeking and placing their seeds in convenient repositories we may if we attentively consider and examine it find that there are circumstances sufficient upon the supposals of the excellent contrivance of their machine to excite and force them to act after such or such a manner those steams that rise from these several places may perhaps set several parts of these little animals at work even as in the contrivance of killing a fox or wolf with a gun the moving of a string is the death of the animal for the beast by moving the flesh that is laid to entrap him pulls the string which moves the trigger and that lets go the cock which on the steel strikes certain sparks of fire which kindle the powder in the pann and that presently flies into the barrel where the powder catching fire rarifies and drives out the bullet which kills the animal in all which actions there is nothing of intention or ratiocination to be ascribd either to the animal or engine but all to the ingeniousness of the contriver  but to return to the more immediate consideration of our gnat we have in it an instance not usual or common of a very strange amphibious creature that being a creature that inhabits the air does yet produce a creature that for some time lives in the water as a fish though afterward which is as strange it becomes an inhabitant of the air like its sire in the form of a fly and this methinks does prompt me to propose certain conjectures as queries having not yet had sufficient opportunity and leisure to answer them my self from my own experiments or observations  and the first is whether all those things that we suppose to be bred from corruption and putrifaction may not be rationally supposd to have their origination as natural as these gnats who tis very probable were first dropt into this water in the form of eggs those seeds or eggs must certainly be very small which so small a creature as a gnat yields and therefore we need not wonder that we find not the eggs themselves some of the younger of them which i have observd having not exceeded a tenth part of the bulk they have afterwards come to and next i have observed some of those little ones which must have been generated after the water was inclosed in the bottle and therefore most probably from eggs whereas those creatures have been supposd to be bred of the corruption of the water there being not formerly known any probable way how they should be generated  a second is whether these eggs are immediately dropt into the water by the gnats themselves or mediately are brought down by the falling rain for it seems not very improbable but that those small seeds of gnats may being perhaps of so light a nature and having so great a proportion of surface to so small a bulk of body be ejected into the air and so perhaps carried for a good while too and fro in it till by the drops of rain it be washd out of it  a third is whether multitudes of those other little creatures that are found to inhabit the water for some time do not at certain times take wing and fly into the air others dive and hide themselves in the earth and so contribute to the increase both of the one and the other element                                       postscript  a good while since the writing of this description i was presented by doctor peter ball an ingenious member of the royal society with a little paper of nuts which he told me was sent him from a brother of his out of the countrey from mamhead in devonshire some of them were loose having been as i suppose broken off others were still growing fast on upon the sides of a stick which seemd by the bark pliableness of it and by certain strings that grew out of it to be some piece of the root of a tree they were all of them dryd and a little shrivelld others more round of a brown colour their shape was much like a figg but very much smaller some being about the bigness of a bayberry others and the biggest of a hazelnut some of these that had no hole in them i carefully opened with my knife and found in them a good large round white maggot almost as bigg as a small pea which seemd shapd like other maggots but shorter i could not find them to move though i ghessd them to be alive because upon pricking them with a pinn there would issue out a great deal of white mucous matter which seemd to be from a voluntary contraction of their skin their husk or matrix consisted of three coats like the barks of trees the outermost being more rough and spongie and the thickest the middlemost more close hard white and thin the innermost very thin seeming almost like the skin within an eggs shell the two outermost had root in the branch or stick but the innermost had no stem or process but was onely a skin that coverd the cavity of the nut all the nuts that had no holes eaten in them i found to contain these maggots but all that had holes i found empty the maggots it seems having eaten their way through taken wings and flown away as this following account which i receivd in writing from the same person as it was sent him by his brother manifests in a moorish black peaty mould with some small veins of whitish yellow sands upon occasion of digging a hole two or three foot deep at the head of a pond or pool to set a tree in at that depth were found about the end of october 1663 in those very veins of sand those buttons or nuts sticking to a little loose stick that is not belonging to any live tree and some of them also free by themselves  four or five of which being then opend some were found to contain live insects come to perfection most like to flying ants if not the same in others insects yet imperfect having but the head and wings formd the rest remaining a soft white pulpy substance  now as this furnishes us with one odd history more very agreeable to what i before hinted so i doubt not but were men diligent observers they might meet with multitudes of the same kind both in the earth and in the water and in the air on trees plants and other vegetables all places and things being as it were animarum plena and i have often with wonder and pleasure in the spring and summertime lookd close to and diligently on common garden mould and in a very small parcel of it found such multitudes and diversities of little reptiles some in husks others onely creepers many wingd and ready for the air divers husks or habitations left behind empty now if the earth of our cold climate be so fertile of animate bodies what may we think of the fat earth of hotter climates certainly the sun may there by its activity cause as great a parcel of earth to fly on wings in the air as it does of water in steams and vapours and what swarms must we suppose to be sent out of those plentifull inundations of water which are poured down by the sluces of rain in such vast quantities so that we need not much wonder at those innumerable clouds of locusts with which africa and other hot countries are so pestred since in those places are found all the convenient causes of their production namely genitors or parents concurrent receptacles or matrixes and a sufficient degree of natural heat and moisture  i was going to annex a little draught of the figure of those nuts sent out of devonshire but chancing to examine mr parkinsons herbal for something else and particularly about galls and oakapples i found among no less then 24 several kinds of excrescencies of the oak which i doubt not but upon examination will be all found to be the matrixes of so many several kinds of insects i having observd many of them my self to be so among 24 several kinds i say i found one described and figurd directly like that which i had by me the scheme is there to be seen the description because but short i have here adjoind theatri botanici trib 16 chap 2 there groweth at the roots of old oaks in the springtime and semetimes also in the very heat of summer a peculiar kind of mushrom or excrescence calld uva quercina swelling out of the earth many growing one close unto another of the fashion of a grape and therefore took the name the oakgrape and is of a purplish colour on the outside and white within like milk and in the end of summer becometh hard and woody whether this be the very same kind i cannot affirm but both the picture and description come very neer to that i have but that he seems not to take notice of the hollowness or worm for which tis most observable and therefore tis very likely if men did but take notice they might find very many differing species of these nuts ovaries or matrixes and all of them to have much the same designation and office and i have very lately found several kinds of excrescencies on trees and shrubs which having endured the winter upon opening them i found most of them to contain little worms but dead those things that containd them being witherd and dry                                        observ xliv of the tufted or brushhornd gnat  this little creature was one of those multitudes that fill our english air all the time that warm weather lasts and is exactly of the shape of that i observd to be generated and hatchd out of those little insects that wriggle up and down in rainwater but though many were of this form yet i observd others to be of quite other kinds nor were all of this or the other kind generated out of water insects for whereas i observd that those that proceeded from those insects were at their full growth i have also found multitudes of the same shape but much smaller and tenderer seeming to be very young ones creep up and down upon the leaves of trees and flying up and down in small clusters in places very remote from water and this spring i observd one day when the wind was very calm and the afternoon very fair and pretty warm though it had for a long time been very cold weather and the wind continued still in the east several small swarms of them playing to and fro in little clouds in the sun each of which were not a tenth part of the bigness of one of these i here have delineated though very much of the same shape which makes me ghess that each of these swarms might be the ofspring of one onely gnat which had been hoorded up in some safe repository all this winter by some provident parent and were now by the warmth of the springair hatchd into little flies  and indeed so various and seemingly irregular are the generations or productions of insects that he that shall carefully and diligently observe the several methods of nature therein will have infinitely cause further to admire the wisdom and providence of the creator for not onely the same kind of creature may be producd from several kinds of ways but the very same creature may produce several kinds for as divers watches may be made out of several materials which may yet have all the same appearance and move after the same manner that is shew the hour equally true the one as the other and out of the same kind of matter like watches may be wrought differing ways and as one and the same watch may by being diversly agitated or movd by this or that agent or after this or that manner produce a quite contrary effect so may it be with these most curious engines of insects bodies the allwise god of nature may have so ordered and disposed the little automatons that when nourished acted or enlivened by this cause they produce one kind of effect or animate shape when by another they act quite another way and another animal is producd so may he so order several materials as to make them by several kinds of methods produce similar automatons  but to come to the description of this insect as it appears through a microscope of which a representation is made in the 28 scheme its head a is exceeding small in proportion to its body consisting of two clusters of pearld eyes bb on each side of its head whose pearls or eyeballs are curiously rangd like those of other flies between these in the forehead of it there are placd upon two small black balls cc two long jointed horns tapering towards the top much resembling the long horns of lobsters each of whose stems or quills dd were brisled or brushed with multitudes of small stiff hairs issuing out every way from the several joints like the strings or sproutings of the herb horsetail which is oft observd to grow among corn and for the whole shape it does very much resemble those brushy vegetables besides these there are two other jointed and brisled horns or feelers ee in the forepart of the head and a proboscis f underneath which in some gnats are very long streight hollow pipes by which these creatures are able to drill and penetrate the skin and thence through those pipes suck so much bloud as to stuff their bellies so full till they be ready to burst  this small head with its appurtenances is fastned on by a short neck g to the middle of the thorax which is large and seems cased with a strong black shel hik out of the under part of which issue six long and slender legs llllll shapd just like the legs of flies but spun or drawn out longer and slenderer which could not be expressd in the figure because of their great length and from the upper part two oblong but slender transparent wings mm shaped somewhat like those of a fly underneath each of which as i have observd also in divers sorts of flies and other kinds of gnats was placed a small body n much resembling a drop of some transparent glutinous substance hardned or coold as it was almost ready to fall for it has a round knob at the end which by degrees grows slenderer into a small stem and neer the insertion under the wing this stem again grows bigger these little pendulums i may so call them the litle creature vibrates to and fro very quick when it moves its wings and i have sometimes observd it to move them also whilst the wing lay still but always their motion seemd to further the motion of the wing ready to follow of what use they are as to the moving of the wing or otherwise i have not now time to examine  its belly was large as it is usually in all insects and extended into nine lengths or partitions each of which was coverd with round armed rings or shells six of which opqrst were transparent and divers kinds of peristaltick motions might be very easily perceivd whilst the animal was alive but especially a small cleer white part v seemed to beat like the heart of a larger animal the last three divisios wxy were coverd with black and opacous shells to conclude take this creature altogether and for beauty and curious contrivances it may be compared with the largest animal upon the earth nor doth the alwise creator seem to have shewn less care and providence in the fabrick of it then in those which seem most considerable                                        observ xlv of the great bellyd gnat or female gnat  the second gnat delineated in the twenty ninth scheme is of a very differing shape from the former but yet of this sort also i found several of the gnats that were generated out of the water insect the wings of this were much larger then those of the other and the belly much bigger shorter and of an other shape and from several particulars i ghest it to be the female gnat and the former to be the male  the thorax of this was much like that of the other having a very strong and ridged backpiece which went also on either side of its leggs about the wings there were several joynted pieces of armor which seemd curiously and conveniently contrivd for the promoting and strengthning the motion of the wings its head was much differing from the other being much bigger and neater shapd and the horns that grew out between his eyes on two little balls were of a very differing shape from the tufts of the other gnat these having but a few knots or joynts and each of those but a few and those short and strong brisles the formost horns or feelers were like those of the former gnat  one of these gnats i have sufferd to pierce the skin of my hand with its proboscis and thence to draw out as much blood as to fill its belly as full as it could hold making it appear very red and transparent and this without any further pain then whilst it was sinking in its proboscis as it is also in the stinging of fleas a good argument that these creatures do not wound the skin and suck the blood out of enmity and revenge but for meer necessity and to satisfy their hunger by what means this creature is able to suck we shall shew in another place                                        observ xlvi of the white featherwingd moth or tinea argentea  this white long wingd moth which is delineated in the 30 scheme afforded a lovely object both to the naked eye and through a microscope to the eye it appeard a small milk white fly with four white wings the two formost somewhat longer then the two hindermost and the two shorter about half an inch long each of which four wings seemd to consist of two small long feathers very curiously tufted or haired on each side with purely white and exceedingly fine and small haires proportiond to the stalks or stems out of which they grew much like the tufts of a long wingfeather of some bird and their stalks or stems were like those bended backwards and downwards as may be plainly seen by the draughts of them in the figure  observing one of these in my microscope i found in the first place that all the body legs horns and the stalks of the wings were covered over with various kinds of curious white feathers which did with handling or touching easily rubb off and fly about in so much that looking on my fingers with which i had handled this moth and perceiving on them little white specks i found by my microscope that they were several of the small feathers of this little creature that stuck up and down in the rugosities of my skin  next i found that underneath these feathers the pretty insect was covered all over with a crusted shell like other of those animals but with one much thinner and tenderer  thirdly i found as in birds also is notable it had differing and appropriate kinds of feathers that covered several parts of its body  fourthly surveying the parts of its body with a more accurate and better magnifying microscope i found that the tufts or haires of its wings were nothing else but a congeries or thick set cluster of small vimina or twiggs resembling a small twigg of birch stript or whitned with which brushes are usually made to beat out or brush off the dust from cloth and hangings every one of the twiggs or branches that composed the brush of the feathers appeared in this bigger magnifying glass of which ef which represents ¬Ω4 part of an inch is the scale as g is of the lesser which is only 13 like the figure d the feathers also that covered a part of his body and were interspersed among the brush of his wings i found in the bigger magnifying glass of the shape a consisting of a stalk or stem in the middle and a seeming tuftedness or brushy part on each side the feathers that coverd most part of his body and the stalk of his wings were in the same microscope much of the figure b appearing of the shape of a small feather and seemed tufted those which covered the horns and small parts of the leggs through the same microscope appeard of the shape c whether the tufts of any or all of these small feathers consisted of such component particles as the feathers of birds i much doubt because i find that nature does not alwaies keep or operate after the same method in smaller and bigger creatures and of this we have particular instances in the wings of several creatures for whereas in birds of all kinds it composes each of the feathers of which its wing consists of such an exceeding curious and most admirable and stupendious texture as i else where shew in the observations on a feather we find it to alter its method quite in the fabrick of the wings of these minute creatures composing some of thin extended membranes or skins such as the wings of dragonflys in others those skins are all overgrown or pretty thick bestuck with short brisles as in fleshflies in others those filmes are covered both on the upper and under side with small feathers placd almost like the tyles on a house and are curiously rangd and adornd with most lively colours as is observable in butterflies and several kinds of moths in others instead of their films nature has provided nothing but a matter of half a score stalks if i well remember the number for i have not lately met with any of these flys and did not when i first observd them take sufficient notice of divers particulars and each of these stalks with a few single branchings on each side resembling much the branched backbone of a herring or the like fish or a thin haird peacocks feather the top or the eye being broken off with a few of these on either side which it was able to shut up or expand at pleasure much like a fann or rather like the posture of the feathers in a wing whichly all one under another when shut and by the side of each other when expanded this pretty little grey moth for such was the creature i observd thus wingd could very nimbly and as it seemd very easily move its corpuscle through the air from place to place other insects have their wings casd or coverd over with certain hollow shells shapd almost like those hollow trayes in which butchers carry meat whose hollow sides being turnd downwards do not only secure their folded wings from injury of the earth in which most of those creatures reside but whilst they fly serves as a help to sustain and bear them up and these are observable in scarabees and a multitude of other terrestrial crustaceous insects in which we may yet further observe a particular providence of nature  now in all these kinds of wings we observe this particular as a thing most worthy remark that where ever a wing consists of discontinued parts the pores or interstitia between those parts are very seldom either much bigger or much smaller then these which we here find between the particles of these brushes so that it should seem to intimate that the parts of the air are such that they will not easily or readily if at all pass through these pores so that they seem to be strainers fine enough to hinder the particles of the air whether hinderd by their bulk or by their agitation circulation rotation or undulation i shall not here determine from getting through them and by that means serve the animal as well if not better then if they were little films i say if not better because i have observd that all those creatures that have filmd wings move them aboundantly quicker and more strongly such as all kind of flies and scarabees and batts then such as have their wings covered with feathers as butterflies and birds or twiggs as moths which have each of them a much slower motion of their wings that little ruggedness perhaps of their wings helping them somewhat by taking better hold of the parts of the air or not suffering them so easily to pass by any other way then one  but what ever be the reason of it tis most evident that the smooth wingd insects have the strongest muscles or movent parts of their wings and the other much weaker and this very insect we are now describing had a very small thorax or middle part of his body if compard to the length and number of his wings which therefore as he movd them very slowly so must he move them very weakly and this last propriety do we find somewhat observd also in bigger kind of flying creatures birds so that we see that the wisdom and providence of the allwise creator is not less shewn in these small despicable creatures flies and moths which we have branded with a name of ignominy calling them vermine then in those greater and more remakable animate bodies birds  i cannot here stand to add any thing about the nature of flying though perhaps on another occasion i may say something on that subject it being such as may deserve a much more accurate examination and scrutiny then it has hitherto met with for to me there seems nothing wanting to make a man able to fly but what may be easily enough supplyd from the mechanicks hitherto known save onely the want of strength which the muscles of a man seem utterly uncapable of by reason of their smalness and texture but how even strength also may be mechanically made and an artificial muscle so contriv d that thereby a man shall be able to exert what strength he pleases and to regulate it also to his own mind i may elsewhere endeavour to manifest                                        observ xlvii of the shepherd spider or long leggd spider  the carter shepherd spider or longleggd spider has for two particularities very few similar creatures that i have met with the first which is discoverable onely by the microscope and is in the first and second figures of the 31 scheme plainly describd is the curious contrivance of his eyes of which differing from most other spiders he has onely two and those placd upon the top of a small pillar or hillock rising out of the middle of the top of its back or rather the crown of its head for they were fixd on the very top of this pillar which is about the heighth of one of the transverse diameters of the eye and lookd on in another posture appeard much of the shape bcd the two eyes bb were placed back to back with the transparent parts or the pupils looking towards either side but somewhat more forward then backwards c was the column or neck on which they stood and d the crown of the head out of which that neck sprung  these eyes to appearance seemd to be of the very same structure with that of larger binocular creatures seeming to have a very smooth and very protuberant cornea and in the midst of it to have a very black pupil incompassed about with a kind of grey iris as appears by the figure whether it were able to move these eyes to and fro i have not observd but tis not very likely he should the pillar or neck c seeming to be coverd and stiffend with a crusty shell but nature in probability has supplyd that defect by making the cornea so very protuberant and setting it so cleer above the shadowing or obstructing of its prospect by the body that tis likely each eye may perceive though not see distinctly almost a hemisphere whence having so small and round a body placd upon such long leggs it is quickly able so to wind and turn it as to see any thing distinct this creature as do all other spiders i have yet examind does very much differ from most other insects in the figure of its eyes for i cannot with my best microscope discover its eyes to be any ways knobbd or pearld like those of other insects  the second peculiarity which is obvious to the eye is also very remarkable and that is the prodigious length of its leggs in proportion to its small round body each legg of this i drew being above sixteen times the length of its whole body and there are some which have them yet longer and others that seem of the same kind that have them a great deal shorter the eight leggs are each of them jointed just like those of a crab but every of the parts are spun out prodigiously longer in proportion each of these leggs are terminated in a small case or shell shapd almost like that of a musleshell as is evident in the third figure of the same scheme that represents the appearance ot the under part or belly of the creature by the shape of the protuberant conical body iiii c these are as twere placd or fastend on to the protuberant body of the insect which is to be supposd very high at m making a kind of blunt cone whereof m is to be supposd the apex about which greater cone of the body the smaller cones of the leggs are placd each of them almost reaching to the top in so admirable a manner as does not a little manifest the wisdom of nature in the contrivance for these long leavers as i may so call them of the legs having not the advantage of a long end on the other side of the hypomochlion or centers on which the parts of the leggs move must necessarily require a vast strength to move them and keep the body ballancd and suspended in so much that if we should suppose a mans body suspended by such a contrivance an hundred and fifty times the strength of a man would not keep the body from falling on the breast to supply therefore each of these leggs with its proper strength nature has allowd to each a large chest or cell in which is included a very large and strong muscle and thereby this little animal is not onely able to suspend its body upon less then these eight but to move it very swiftly over the tops of grass and leaves  nor are these eight leggs so prodigiously long but the ninth and tenth which are the two claws kk are as short and serve in steed of a proboscis for those seemd very little longer then his mouth each of them had three parts but very short the joints kk which represented the third being longer then both the other this creature seems which i have several times with pleasure observd to throw its body upon the prey insteed of its hands not unlike a hunting spider which leaps like a cat at a mouse the whole fabrick was a very pretty one and could i have dissected it i doubt not but i should have found as many singularities within it as without perhaps for the most part not unlike the parts of a crab which this little creature does in many things very much resemble the curiosity of whose contrivance i have in another place examind i omit the description of the horns aa of the mouth ll which seemd like that of a crab the speckledness of his shell which proceeded from a kind of feathers or hairs and the hairiness of his leggs his large thorax and little belly and the like they being manifested by the figure and shall onely take notice that the three parts of the body namely the head breast and belly are in this creature strangely confusd so that tis difficult to determine which is which as they are also in a crab and indeed this seems to be nothing else but an aircrab being made more light and nimble proportionable to the medium wherin it resides and as air seems to have but one thousandth part of the body of water so does this spider seem not to be a thousandth part of the bulk of a crab                                        observ xlviii of the hunting spider and several other sorts of spiders  the hunting spider is a small grey spider prettily bespeckd with black spots all over its body which the microscope discovers to be a kind of feathers like those on butterflies wings or the body of the white moth i lately describd its gate is very nimble by fits sometimes running and sometimes leaping like a grashopper almost then standing still and setting it self on its hinder leggs it will very nimbly turn its body and look round it self every way it has six very conspicuous eyes two looking directly forwards placd just before two other on either side of those looking forward and sideways and two other about the middle of the top of its back or head which look backwards and sidewards these seemd to be the biggest the surface of them all was very black sph√¶rical purely polishd reflecting a very cleer and distinct image of all the ambient objects such as a window a mans hand a white paper or the like some other properties of this spider observd by the most accomplishd mr evelyn in his travels in italy are most emphatically set forth in the history hereunto annexed which he was pleasd upon my desire to send me in writing      of all the sorts of insects there is none has afforded me more     divertisements then the venatores which are a sort of lupi that     have their denns in the rugged walls and crevices of our houses a     small brown and delicately spotted kind of spiders whose hinder leggs     are longer then the rest      such i did frequently observe at rome which espying a fly at three     or four yards distance upon the balcony where i stood would not make     directly to her but craul under the rail till being arrivd to the     antipodes it would steal up seldom missing its aim but if it     chanced to want any thing of being perfectly opposite would at first     peep immediatly slide down again till taking better notice it would     come the next time exactly upon the flys back but if this hapnd not     to be within a competent leap then would this insect move so softly     as the very shadow of the gnomon seemd not to be more imperceptible     unless the fly movd and then would the spider move also in the same     proportion keeping that just time with her motion as if the same soul     had animated both those little bodies and whether it were forwards     backwards or to either side without at all turning her body like a     well mannagd horse but if the capricious fly took wing and pitchd     upon another place behind our huntress then would the spider whirle     its body so nimbly about as nothing could be imagind more swift by     which means she always kept the head towards her prey though to     appearance as immovable as if it had been a nail driven into the     wood till by that indiscernable progress being arrivd within the     sphere of her reach she made a fatal leap swift as lightning upon     the fly catching him in the pole where she never quitted hold till     her belly was full and then carried the remainder home i have beheld     them instructing their young ones how to hunt which they would     sometimes discipline for not well observing but when any of the old     ones did as sometimes miss a leap they would run out of the field     and hide them in their crannies as ashamd and haply not be seen     abroad for four or five hours after for so long have i watched the     nature of this strange insect the contemplation of whose so wonderfull     sagacity and address has amazd me nor do i find in any chase     whatsoever more cunning and stratagem observd i have found some of     these spiders in my garden when the weather towards the spring is     very hot but they are nothing so eager of hunting as they are in     italy  there are multitudes of other sorts of spiders whose eyes and most other parts and properties are so exceedingly different both from those i have describd and from one another that it would be almost endless at least too long for my present essay to describe them as some with six eyes placd in quite another order others with eight eyes others with fewer and some with more they all seem to be creatures of prey and to feed on other small insects but their ways of catching them seem very differing the shepherd spider by running on his prey the hunting spider by leaping on it other sorts weave nets or cobwebs whereby they ensnare them nature having both fitted them with materials and tools and taught them how to work and weave their nets and to lie perdue and to watch diligently to run on any fly as soon as ever entangled  their thread or web seems to be spun out of some viscous kind of excrement lying in their belly which though soft when drawn out is presently by reason of its smallness hardned and dried by the ambient air examining several of which with my microscope i found them to appear much like white horshair or some such transparent horny substance and to be of very differing magnitudes some appearing as bigg as a piggs brisle others equal to a horsshair other no bigger then a mans hair others yet smaller and finer i observd further that the radiating chords of the web were much bigger and smoother then those that were woven round which seemd smaller and all over knotted or pearld with small transparent globules not unlike small crystal beads or seed pearls thin strung on a clew of silk which whether they were so spun by the spider or by the adventitious moisture of a fogg which i have observd to cover all these filaments with such crystalline beads i will not now dispute  these threads were some of them so small that i could very plainly with the microscope discover the same consecutions of colours as in a prisme and they seemd to proceed from the same cause with those colours which i have already describd in thin plated bodies  much resembling a cobweb or a confusd lock of these cylinders is a certain white substance which after a fogg may be observd to fly up and down the air catching several of these and examining them with my microscope i found them to be much of the same form looking most like to a flake of worsted prepard to be spun though by what means they should be generated or producd is not easily imagined they were of the same weight or very little heavier then the air and tis not unlikely but that those great white clouds that appear all the summer time may be of the same substance                                        observ xlix of an ant or pismire  this was a creature more troublesom to be drawn then any of the rest for i could not for a good while think of a way to make it suffer its body to ly quiet in a natural posture but whilst it was alive if its feet were fetterd in wax or glew it would so twist and wind its body that i could not any wayes get a good view of it and if i killed it its body was so little that i did often spoile the shape of it before i could throughly view it for this is the nature of these minute bodies that as soon almost as ever their life is destroyd their parts immediately shrivel and lose their beauty and so is it also with small plants as i instanced before in the description of moss and thence also is the reason of the variations in the beards of wild oats and in those of muskgrass seed that their bodies being exceeding small those small variations which are made in the surfaces of all bodies almost upon every change of air especially if the body be porous do here become sensible where the whole body is so small that it is almost nothing but surface for as in vegetable substances i see no great reason to think that the moisture of the aire that sticking to a wreathd beard does make it untwist should evaporate or exhale away any faster then the moisture of other bodies but rather that the avolation from or access of moisture to the surfaces of bodies being much the same those bodies become most sensible of it which have the least proportion of body to their surface so is it also with animal substances the dead body of an ant or such little creature does almost instantly shrivel and dry and your object shall be quite another thing before you can half delineate it which proceeds not from the extraordinary exhalation but from the small proportion of body and juices to the usual drying of bodies in the air especially if warm for which inconvenience where i could not otherwise remove it i thought of this expedient  i took the creature i had designd to delineate and put it into a drop of very well rectified spirit of wine this i found would presently dispatch as it were the animal and being taken out of it and layd on a paper the spirit of wine would immediately fly away and leave the animal dry in its natural posture or at least in a constitution that it might easily with a pin be placd in what posture you desired to draw it and the limbs would so remain without either moving or shriveling and thus i dealt with this ant which i have here delineated which was one of many of a very large kind that inhabited under the roots of a tree from whence they would sally out in great parties and make most grievous havock of the flowers and fruits in the ambient garden and return back again very expertly by the same wayes and paths they went  it was more then half the bigness of an earwig of a dark brown or reddish colour with long legs on the hinder of which it would stand up and raise its head as high as it could above the ground that it might stare the further about it just after the same manner as i have also observd a hunting spider to do and putting my finger towards them they have at first all run towards it till almost at it and then they would stand round about it at a certain distance and smell as it were and consider whether they should any of them venture any further till one more bold then the rest venturing to climb it all the rest if i would have suffered them would have immediately followed many such other seemingly rational actions i have observd in this little vermine with much pleasure which would be too long to be here related those that desire more of them may satisfie their curiosity in ligons history of the barbadoes  having insnard several of these into a small box i made choice of the tallest grown among them and separating it from the rest i gave it a gill of brandy or spirit of wine which after a while een knockd him down dead drunk so that he became moveless though at first putting in he struggled for a pretty while very much till at last certain bubbles issuing out of its mouth it ceased to move this because i had before found them quickly to recover again if they were taken out presently i suffered to lye above an hour in the spirit and after i had taken it out and put its body and legs into a natural posture remained moveless about an hour but then upon a sudden as if it had been awaken out of a drunken sleep it suddenly revivd and ran away being caught and servd as before he for a while continued struggling and striving till at last there issued several bubbles out of its mouth and then tanquam animam expirasset he remained moveless for a good while but at length again recovering it was again redipt and suffered to lye some hours in the spirit notwithstanding which after it had layen dry some three or four hours it again recovered life and motion which kind of experiments if prosecuted which they highly deserve seem to me of no inconsiderable use towards the invention of the latent scheme as the noble verulam calls it or the hidden unknown texture of bodies  of what figure this creature appeard through the microscope the 32 scheme though not so carefully graven as it ought will represent to the eye namely that it had a large head aa at the upper end of which were two protuberant eyes pearld like those of a fly but smaller bb out of the nose or foremost part issued two horns cc of a shape sufficiently differing from those of a blew fly though indeed they seem to be both the same kind of organ and to serve for a kind of smelling beyond these were two indented jaws dd which he opend sidewayes and was able to gape them asunder very wide and the ends of them being armed with teeth which meeting went between each other it was able to grasp and hold a heavy body three or four times the bulk and weight of its own body it had only six legs shapd like those of a fly which as i shewed before is an argument that it is a winged insect and though i could not perceive any sign of them in the middle part of its body which seemd to consist of three joints or pieces efg out of which sprung two legs yet tis known that there are of them that have long wings and fly up and down in the air  the third and last part of its body iii was bigger and larger then the other two unto which it was joynd by a very small middle and had a kind of loose shell or another distinct part of its body h which seemd to be interposd and to keep the thorax and belly from touching  the whole body was casd over with a very strong armour and the belly iii was covered likewise with multitudes of small white shining brisles the legs horns head and middle parts of its body were bestuck with hairs also but smaller and darker                                        observ l of the wandring mite  in september and october 1661 i observd in oxford several of these little pretty creatures to wander to and fro and often to travel over the plains of my window and in september and october 1663 i observd likewise several of these very same creatures traversing a window at london and looking without the window upon the subjacent wall i found whole flocks of the same kind running to and fro among the small groves and thickets of green moss and upon the curiously spreading vegetable blew or yellow moss which is a kind of a mushrome or jewsear  these creatures to the naked eye seemed to be a kind of black mite but much nimbler and stronger then the ordinary cheesemites but examining them in a microscope i found them to be a very fine crusted or shelld insect much like that represented in the first figure of the three and thirtieth scheme with a protuberant oval shell a indented or pitted with an abundance of small pits all covered over with little white brisles whose points all directed backwards  it had eight legs each of them provided with a very sharp tallon or claw at the end which this little animal in its going fastned into the pores of the body over which it went each of these legs were bestuck in every joynt of them with multitudes of small hairs or if we respect the proportion they bore to the bigness of the leg turnpikes all pointing towards the claws  the thorax or middle parts of the body of this creature was exceeding small in respect both of the head and belly it being nothing but that part which was covered by the two shells bb though it seemd to grow thicker underneath and indeed if we consider the great variety nature uses in proportioning the three parts of the body the head thorax and belly we shall not wonder at the small proportion of this thorax nor at the vaster bulk of the belly for could we exactly anatomise this little creature and observe the particular designs of each part we should doubtless as we do in all her more manageable and tractable fabricks find much more reason to admire the excellency of her contrivance and workmanship then to wonder it was not made otherwise  the head of this little insect was shapd somewhat like a mites that is it had a long snout in the manner of a hogs with a knobbed ridge running along the middle of it which was bestuck on either side with many small brisles all pointing forward and two very large pikes or horns which rose from the top of the head just over each eye and pointed forward also it had two pretty large black eyes on either side of the head ee from one of which i could see a very bright reflection of the window which made me ghess that the cornea of it was smooth like those of bigger insects its motion was pretty quick and strong it being able very easily to tumble a stone or clod four times as big as its whole body  at the same time and place and divers times since i have observed with my microscope another little insect which though i have not annexed the picture of may be worth noting for its exceeding nimbleness as well as smalness it was as small as a mite with a body deep and ridged almost like a flea it had eight bloodred legs not very long but slender and two horns or feelers before its motion was so exceeding quick that i have often lost sight of one i have observed with my naked eye and though when it was not frighted i was able to follow the motions of some with my microscope yet if it were never so little startled it posted away with such speed and turnd and winded it self so quick that i should presently lose sight of it  when i first observd the former of these insects or mites i began to conjecture that certainly i had found out the vagabond parents of those mites we find in cheeses meal corn seeds musty barrels musty leather c these little creatures wandring to and fro every whither might perhaps as they were invited hither and thither by the musty steams of several putrifying bodies make their invasions upon those new and pleasing territories and there spending the remainder of their life which might be perhaps a day or thereabouts in very plentiful and riotous living might leave their offspring behind them which by the change of the soil and country they now inhabite might be quite alterd from the hew of their primogenitors and like mores translated into northern european climates after a little time change both their skin and shape and this seems yet more probable in these insects because that the soil or body they inhabit seems to be almost half their parent for it not only hatches and brings those little eggs or seminal principles to perfection but seems to augment and nourish them also before they are hatchd or shaped for it is obvious enough to be observd that the eggs of many other insects and particularly of mites are increasd in bulk after they are laid out of the bodies of the insects and plumpd sometimes into many times their former bigness so that the bodies they are laid in being as it were half their mothers we shall not wonder that it should have such an active power to change their forms we find by relations how much the negro women do besmeer the ofspring of the spaniard bringing forth neither whiteskinnd nor black but tawny hided mulattos  now though i propound this as probable i have not yet been so farr certifyd by observations as to conclude any thing either positively or negatively concerning it perhaps some more lucky diligence may please the curious inquirer with the discovery of this to be a truth which i now conjecture and may thereby give him a satisfactory account of the cause of those creatures whose original seems yet to obscure and may give him cause to believe that many other animate beings that seem also to be the mere product of putrifaction may be innobled with a pedigree as ancient as the first creation and farr exceed the greatest beings in their numerous genealogies but on the other side if it should be found that these or any other animate body have no immediate similar parent i have in another place set down a conjectural hypothesis whereby those ph√¶nomena may likely enough be solvd wherein the infinite wisdom and providence of the creator is no less rare and wonderfull                                        observ li of the crablike insect  reading one day in septemb i chanced to observe a very smal creature creep over the book i was reading very slowly having a microscope by me i observd it to be a creature of a very unusual form and that not less notable such as is describd in the second figure of the 33 scheme it was about the bigness of a large mite or somewhat longer it had ten legs eight of which aaaa were topt with very sharp claws and were those upon which he walkd seeming shapd much like those of a crab which in many other things also this little creature resembled for the two other claws bb which were the formost of all the ten and seemd to grow out of his head like the horns of other animals were exactly formd in the manner of crabs or lobsters claws for they were shapd and jointed much like those represented in the scheme and the ends of them were furnishd with a pair of claws or pincers cc which this little animal did open and shut at pleasure it seemd to make use of those two horns or claws both for feelers and holders for in its motion it carried these aloft extended before moving them to and fro just as a man blindfolded would do his hands when he is fearfull of running against a wall and if i put a hair to it it would readily take hold of it with these claws and seem to hold it fast now though these horns seemd to serve him for two uses namely for feeling and holding yet he seemd neither blind having two small black spots dd which by the make of them and the bright reflection from them seemd to be his eyes nor did it want other hands having another pair of claws ee very neer placd to its mouth and seemd adjoining to it  the whole body was cased over with armourshells as is usuall in all those kinds of crustaceous creatures especially about their bellies and seemd of three kinds the head f seemd coverd with a kind of scaly shell the thorax with two smooth shells or rings gg and the belly with eight knobbd ones i could not certainly find whether it had under these last shells any wings but i suspect the contrary for i have not found any wingd insect with eight leggs two of those leggs being always converted into wings and for the most part those that have but six have wings  this creature though i could never meet with more then one of them and so could not make so many examinations of it as otherwise i would i did notwithstanding by reason of the great curiosity that appeard to me in its shape delineate it to shew that in all likelihood nature had crouded together into this very minute insect as many and as excellent contrivances as into the body of a very large crab which exceeds it in bulk perhaps some millions of times for as to all the apparent parts there is a greater rather then a less multiplicity of parts each legg has as many parts and as many joints as a crabs nay and as many hairs or brisles and the like may be in all the other visible parts and tis very likely that the internal curiosities are not less excellent it being a general rule in natures proceedings that where she begins to display any excellency if the subject be further searchd into it will manifest that there is not less curiosity in those parts which our single eye cannot reach then in those which are more obvious                                        observ lii of the small silvercolourd bookworm  as among greater animals there are many that are scaled both for ornament and defence so are there not wanting such also among the lesser bodies of insects whereof this little creature gives us an instance it is a small white silvershining worm or moth which i found much conversant among books and papers and is supposd to be that which corrodes and eats holes through the leaves and covers it appears to the naked eye a small glittering pearlcolourd moth which upon the removing of books and papers in the summer is often observd very nimbly to scud and pack away to some lurking cranney where it may the better protect itself from any appearing dangers its head appears bigg and blunt and its body tapers from it towads the tail smaller and smaller being shapd almost like a carret  this the microscopical appearance will more plainly manifest which exhibits in the third figure of the 33 scheme a conical body divided into fourteen several partitions being the appearance of so many several shels or shields that cover the whole body every of these shells are again coverd or tiled over with a multitude of thin transparent scales which from the multiplicity of their reflecting surfaces make the whole animal appear of a perfect pearlcolour  which by the way may hint us the reason of that so much admired appearance of those so highly esteemd bodies as also of the like in mother of pearlshells and in multitudes of other shelly seasubstances for they each of them consisting of an infinite number of very thin shells or laminated orbiculations cause such multitudes of reflections that the compositions of them together with the reflections of others that are so thin as to afford colours of which i elsewhere give the reason gives a very pleasant reflection of light and that this is the true cause seems likely first because all those so appearing bodies are compounded of multitudes of plated substances and next that by ordering any trasparent substance after this manner the like ph√¶nomena may be producd this will be made very obvious by the blowing of glass into exceeding thin shells and then breaking them into scales which any lampworker will presently do for a good quantity of these scales laid in a heap together have much the same resemblance of pearls another way not less instructive and pleasant is a way which i have several times done which is by working and tossing as twere a parcel of pure crystalline glass whilst it is kept glowing hot in the blown flame of a lamp for by that means that purely transparent body will be so divided into an infinite number of plates or small strings with interposd aerial plates and fibres that from the multiplicity of the reflections from each of those internal surfaces it may be drawn out into curious pearllike or silver wire which though small will yet be opacous the same thing i have done with a composition of red colophon and turpentine and a little bees wax and may be done likewise with birdlime and such like glutinous and transparent bodies but to return to our description  the small blunt head of this insect was furnishd on either side of it with a cluster of eyes each of which seemd to contain but a very few in comparison of what i had observd the clusters of other insects to abound with each of these clusters were beset with a row of small brisles much like the cilia or hairs on the eyelids and perhaps they servd for the same purpose it had two long horns before which were streight and tapering towards the top curiously ringd or knobbd and brisled much like the marsh weed calld horsetail or catstail having at each knot a fringd girdle as i may so call it of smaller hairs and several bigger and larger brisles here and there dispersd among them besides these it had two shorter horns or feelers which were knotted and fringd just as the former but wanted brisles and were blunt at the ends the hinder part of the creature was terminated with three tails in every particular resembling the two longer horns that grew out of the head the leggs of it were scald and haird much like the rest but are not expressd in this figure the moth being intangled all in glew and so the leggs of this appeard not through the glass which looked perpendicularly upon the back  this animal probably feeds upon the paper and covers of books and perforates in them several small round holes finding perhaps a convenient nourishment in those hulks of hemp and flax which have passd through so many scourings washings dressings and dryings as the parts of old paper must necessarily have sufferd the digestive faculty it seems of these little creatures being able yet further to work upon those stubborn parts and reduce them into another form  and indeed when i consider what a heap of sawdust or chips this little creature which is one of the teeth of time conveys into its intrals i cannot chuse but remember and admire the excellent contrivance of nature in placing in animals such a fire as is continually nourished and supplyd by the materials conveyd into the stomach and fomented by the bellows of the lungs and in so contriving the most admirable fabrick of animals as to make the very spending and wasting of that fire to be instrumental to the procuring and collecting more materials to augment and cherish it self which indeed seems to be the principal end of all the contrivances observable in bruit animals                                        observ liii of a flea  the strength and beauty of this small creature had it no other relation at all to man would deserve a description  for its strength the microscope is able to make no greater discoveries of it then the naked eye but onely the curious contrivance of its leggs and joints for the exerting that strength is very plainly manifested such as no other creature i have yet observd has any thing like it for the joints of it are so adapted that he can as twere fold them short one within another and suddenly stretch or spring them out to their whole length that is of the foreleggs the part a of the 34 scheme lies within b and b within c parallel to or side by side each other but the parts of the two next lie quite contrary that is d without e and e without f but parallel also but the parts of the hinder leggs g h and i bend one within another like the parts of a double jointed ruler or like the foot legg and thigh of a man these six leggs he clitches up altogether and when he leaps springs them all out and thereby exerts his whole strength at once  but as for the beauty of it the microscope manifests it to be all over adornd with a curiously polishd suit of sable armour neatly jointed and beset with multitudes of sharp pinns shapd almost like porcupines quills or bright conical steelbodkins the head is on either side beautifyd with a quick and round black eye k behind each of which also appears a small cavity l in which he seems to move to and fro a certain thin film beset with many small transparent hairs which probably may be his ears in the forepart of his head between the two foreleggs he has two small long jointed feelers or rather smellers mm which have four joints and are hairy like those of several other creatures between these it has a small proboscis or probe nno that seems to consist of a tube nn and a tongue or sucker o which i have perceivd him to slip in and out besides these it has also two chaps or biters pp which are somewhat like those of an ant but i could not perceive them toothd these were shapd very like the blades of a pair of round topd scizers and were opened and shut just after the same manner with these instruments does this little busie creature bite and pierce the skin and suck out the blood of an animal leaving the skin inflamed with a small round red spot these parts are very difficult to be discovered because for the most part they lye covered between the forelegs there are many other particulars which being more obvious and affording no great matter of information i shall pass by and refer the reader to the figure                                        observ liv of a louse  this is a creature so officious that twill be known to every one at one time or other so busie and so impudent that it will be intruding it self in every ones company and so proud and aspiring withall that it fears not to trample on the best and affects nothing so much as a crown feeds and lives very high and that makes it so saucy as to pull any one by the ears that comes in its way and will never be quiet till it has drawn blood it is troubled at nothing so much as at a man that scratches his head as knowing that man is plotting and contriving some mischief against it and that makes it oftentime sculk into some meaner and lower place and run behind a mans back though it go very much against the hair which ill conditions of it having made it better known then trusted would exempt me from making any further description of it did not my faithful mercury my microscope bring me other information of it for this has discovered to me by means of a very bright light cast on it that it is a creature of a very odd shape it has a head shapd like that exprest in 35 scheme marked with a which seems almost conical but is a little flatted on the upper and under sides at the biggest part of which on either side behind the head as it were being the place where other creatures ears stand are placed its two black shining goggle eyes bb looking backwards and fenced round with several small cilia or hairs that incompass it so that it seems this creature has no very good foresight it does not seem to have any eyelids and therefore perhaps its eyes were so placed that it might the better cleanse them with its forelegs and perhaps this may be the reason why they so much avoid and run from the light behind them for being made to live in the shady and dark recesses of the hair and thence probably their eye having a great aperture the open and clear light especially that of the sun must needs very much offend them to secure these eyes from receiving any injury from the hairs through which it passes it has two horns that grow before it in the place where one would have thought the eyes should be each of these cc hath four joynts which are fringed as twere with small brisles from which to the tip of its snout d the head seems very round and tapering ending in a very sharp nose d which seems to have a small hole and to be the passage through which he sucks the blood now whereas if it be placd on its back with its belly upwards as it is in the 35 scheme it seems in several positions to have a resemblance of chaps or jaws as is represented in the figure by ee yet in other postures those dark strokes disappear and having kept several of them in a box for two or three dayes so that for all that time they had nothing to feed on i found upon letting one creep on my hand that it immediately fell to sucking and did neither seem to thrust its nose very deep into the skin nor to open any kind of mouth but i could plainly perceive a small current of blood which came directly from its snout and past into its belly and about a there seemd a contrivance somewhat resembling a pump pair of bellows or heart for by a very swift systole and diastole the blood seemd drawn from the nose and forced into the body it did not seem at all though i viewed it a good while as it was sucking to thrust more of its nose into the skin then the very snout d nor did it cause the least discernable pain and yet the blood seemd to run through its head very quick and freely so that it seems there is no part of the skin but the blood is dispersd into nay even into the cuticula for had it thrust its whole nose in from d to cc it would not have amounted to the supposed thickness of that tegument the length of the nose being not more then a three hundredth part of an inch it has six legs covered with a very transparent shell and joynted exactly like a crabs or lobsters each leg is divided into six parts by these joynts and those have here and there several small hairs and at the end of each leg it has two claws very properly adapted for its peculiar use being thereby inabled to walk very securely both on the skin and hair and indeed this contrivance of the feet is very curious and could not be made more commodiously and compendiously for performing both these requisite motions of walking and climbing up the hair of a mans head then it is for by having the lesser claw a set so much short of the bigger b when it walks on the skin the shorter touches not and then the feet are the same with those of a mite and several other small insects but by means of the small joynts of the longer claw it can bend it round and so with both claws take hold of a hair in the manner represented in the figure the long transparent cylinder fff being a mans hair held by it  the thorax seemd casd with another kind of substance then the belly namely with a thin transparent horny substance which upon the fasting of the creature did not grow flaccid through this i could plainly see the blood suckd from my hand to be variously distributed and movd to and fro and about g there seemd a pretty big white substance which seemd to be moved within its thorax besides there appeard very many small milkwhite vessels which crost over the breast between the legs out of which on either side were many small branchings these seemd to be the veins and arteries for that which is analogus to blood in all insects is milkwhite  the belly is covered with a transparent substance likewise but more resembling a skin then a shell for tis graind all over the belly just like the skin in the palms of a mans hand and when the belly is empty grows very flaccid and wrinkled at the upper end of this is placed the stomach hh and perhaps also the white spot ii may be the liver or pancreas which by the peristalick motion of the guts is a little movd to and fro not with a systole and diastole but rather with a thronging or justling motion viewing one of these creatures after it had fasted two dayes all the hinder part was lank and flaccid and the white spot ii hardly movd most of the white branchings disappeard and most also of the redness or sucked blood in the guts the peristaltick motion of which was scarce discernable but upon the suffering it to suck it presently filld the skin of the belly and of the six scolopd embosments on either side as full as it could be stuft the stomach and guts were as full as they could hold the peristaltick motion of the gut grew quick and the justling motion of ii accordingly multitudes of milkwhite vessels seemd quickly filled and turgid which were perhaps the veins and arteries and the creature was so greedy that though it could not contain more yet it continued sucking as fast as ever and as fast emptying it self behind the digestion of this creature must needs be very quick for though i perceivd the blood thicker and blacker when suckd yet when in the guts it was of a very lovely ruby colour and that part of it which was digested into the veins seemed white whence it appears that a further digestion of blood may make it milk at least of a resembling colour what is else observable in the figure of this creature may be seen by the 35 scheme                                        observ lv of mites  the least of reptiles i have hitherto met with is a mite a creature whereof there are some so very small that the sharpest sight unassisted with glasses is not able to discern them though being white of themselves they move on a black and smooth surface and the eggs out of which these creatures seem to be hatchd are yet smaller those being usually not above a four or five hundredth part of a well grown mite and those well grown mites not much above one hundredth of an inch in thickness so that according to this reckoning there may be no less then a million of well grown mites containd in a cubick inch and five hundred times as many eggs  notwithstanding which minuteness a good microscope discovers those small movable specks to be very prettily shapd insects each of them furnished with eight well shapd and proportiond legs which are each of them joynted or bendable in eight several places or joynts each of which is covered for the most part with a very transparent shell and the lower end of the shell of each joynt is fringed with several small hairs the contrivance of the joynts seems the very same with that of crabs and lobsters legs and like those also they are each of them terminated with a very sharp claw or point four of these legs are so placed that they seem to draw forwards the other four are placed in a quite contrary position thereby to keep the body backwards when there is occasion  15the body as in other larger insects consists of three regions or parts the hinder or belly a seems covered with one intire shell the middle or chest seems divided into two shells bc which running one within the other the mite is able to shrink in and thrust out as it finds occasion as it can also the snout d the whole body is pretty transparent so that being lookd on against the light divers motions within its body may be perceived as also all the parts are much more plainly delineable then in other postures to the light the shell especially that which covers the back is curiously polisht so that tis easie to see as in a convex lookingglass or foliated glassball the picture of all the objects round about up and down in several parts of its body it has several small long white hairs growing out of its shell which are often longer then the whole body and are represented too short in the first and second figures they seem all pretty straight and plyable save only two upon the forepart of its body which seem to be the horns as may be seen in the figures the first whereof is a prospect of a smaller sort of mites which are usually more plump as it was passant to and fro the second is the prospect of one fixt on its tail by means of a little mouthglew rubd on the object plate exhibiting the manner of the growing of the legs together with their several joynts  this creature is very much diversifyd in shape colour and divers other properties according to the nature of the substance out of which it seems to be ingendred and nourished being in one substance more long in another more round in some more hairy in others more smooth in this nimble in that slow here pale and whiter there browner blacker more transparent c i have observed it to be resident almost on all kinds of substances that are mouldy or putrifying and have seen it very nimbly meshing through the thickets of mould and sometimes to lye dormant underneath them and tis not unlikely but that it may feed on that vegetating substance spontaneous vegetables seeming a food proper enough for spontaneous animals  but whether indeed this creature or any other be such or not i cannot positively from any experiment or observation i have yet made determine but as i formerly hinted it seems probable that some kind of wandring mite may sow as twere the first seeds or lay the first eggs in those places which nature has instructed them to know convenient for the hatching and nourishing their young and though perhaps the prime parent might be of a shape very differing from what the offspring after a little while by reason of the substance they feed on or the region as twere they inhabite yet perhaps even one of these alterd progeny wandering again from its native soil and lighting on by chance the same place from whence its prime parent came and there settling and planting may produce a generation of mites of the same shapes and properties with the first wandring mite and from some such accidents as these i am very apt to think the most sorts of animals generally accounted spontaneous have their origination and all those various sorts of mites that are to be met with up and down in divers putrifying substances may perhaps be all of the same kind and have sprung from one and the same sort of mites at the first                                        observ lvi of a small creature hatchd on a vine  there is almost all the spring and summer time a certain small round white cobweb as twere about the bigness of a pea which sticks very close and fast to the stocks of vines nayld against a warm wall being attentively viewed they seem coverd upon the upper side of them with a small husk not unlike the scale or shell of a woodlouse or hoglouse a small insect usually found about rotten wood which upon touching presently rouls it self into the form of a peppercorn separating several of these from the stock i found them with my microscope to consist of a shell which now seemed more likely to be the husk of one of these insects and the fur seemd a kind of cobweb consisting of abundance of small filaments or sleaves of cobwebs in the midst of this if they were not hatchd and run away before the time of which hatching was usually about the latter end of june or beginning of july i have often found abundance of small brown eggs such as a and b in the second figure of the 36 scheme much about the bigness of mites eggs and at other times multitudes of small insects shaped exactly like that in the third figure marked with x its head large almost half the bigness of its body which is usual in the foetus of most creatures it had two small black eyes aa and two small long joynted and brisled horns bb the hinder part of its body seemd to consist of nine scales and the last ended in a forked tayl much like that of a cutio or wood louse out of which grew two long hairs they ran to and fro very swiftly and were much of the bigness of a common mite but some of them less the longest of them seemd not the hundredth part of an inch and the eggs usually not above half as much they seemed to have six legs which were not visible in this i have here delineated by reason they were drawn under its body  if these minute creatures were woodlice as indeed from their own shape and from the frame the skin or shell that grows on them one may with great probability ghess it affords us an instance whereof perhaps there are not many like in nature and that is of the prodigious increase of these creatures after they are hatchd and run about for a common woodlouse of about half an inch long is no less then a hundred and twenty five thousand times bigger then one of these which though indeed it seems very strange yet i have observed the young ones of some spiders have almost kept the same proportion to their dam  this methinks if it be so does in the next place hint a qu√¶ry which may perhaps deserve a little further examination and that is whether there be not many of those minute creatures such as mites and the like which though they are commonly thought of otherwise are only the pully or young ones of much bigger insects and not the generating or parent insect that has layd those eggs for having many times observd those eggs which usually are found in great abundance where mites are found it seems something strange that so small an animal should have an egg so big in proportion to its body though on the other side i must confess that having kept divers of those mites inclosed in a box for a good while i did not find them very much augmented beyond their usual bigness  what the husk and cobweb of this little white substance should be i cannot imagine unless it be that the old one when impregnated with eggs should there stay and fix it self on the vine and dye and all the body by degrees should rot save only the husk and the eggs in the body and the heat or fire as it were of the approaching sunbeams should vivifie those relicts of the corrupted parent and out of the ashes as twere as it is fabled of the phoenix should raise a new offspring for the perpetuation of the species nor will the cobweb as it were in which these eggs are inclosd make much against this conjecture for we may by those cobwebs that are carried up and down the air after a fog which with my microscope i have discovered to be made up of an infinite company of small filaments or threads learn that such a texture of body may be otherwise made then by the spinning of a worm                                        observ lvii of the eels in vinegar  of these small eels which are to be found in divers sorts of vinegar i have little to add besides their picture which you may find drawn in the third figure of the 25 scheme that is they were shaped much like an eel save only that their nose a which was a little more opacous then the rest of their body was a little sharper and longer in proportion to their body and the wrigling motion of their body seemd to be onely upwards and downwards whereas that of eels is onely side wayes they seemd to have a more opacous part about b which might perhaps be their gills it seeming always the same proportionate distant from their nose from which to the tip of their tail c their body seemd to taper  taking several of these out of their pond of vinegar by the net of a small piece of filtring paper and laying them on a black smooth glass plate i found that they could wriggle and winde their body as much almost as a snake which made me doubt whether they were a kind of eal or leech  i shall add no other observations made on this minute animal being prevented herein by many excellent ones already publishd by the ingenious doctor power among his microscopical observations save onely that a quantity of vinegar repleat with them being included in a small viol and stopd very close from the ambient air all the included worms in a very short time died as if they had been stifled  and that their motion seems contrary to what we may observe in the motion of all other infects exceeding slow but the reason of it seems plain for being to move to and fro after that manner which they do by waving onely or wrigling their body the tenacity or glutinousness and the density or resistance of the fluid medium becomes so exceeding sensible to their extremely minute bodies that it is to me indeed a greater wonder that they move them so fast as they do then that they move them no faster for what a vastly greater proportion have they of their superficies to their bulk then eels or other larger fishes and next the tenacity and density of the liquor being much the same to be moved both by the one and the other the resistance or impediment thence arising to the motions made through it must be almost infinitely greater to the small one then to the great this we find experimentally verifyd in the air which though a medium a thousand times more rarifyd then the water the resistance of it to motions made through it is yet so sensible to very minute bodies that a downfeather the least of whose parts seem yet bigger then these eels and many of them almost incomparably bigger such as the quill and stalk is suspended by it and carried to and fro as if it had no weight                                        observ lviii of a new property in the air and several other transparent mediums namd inflection whereby very many considerable ph√¶nomena are attempted to be solvd and divers other uses are hinted  since the invention and perfecting in some measure of telescopes it has been observd by several that the sun and moon neer the horizon are disfigurd losing that exactlysmooth terminating circular limb which they are observd to have when situated neerer the zenith and are bounded with an edge every way especially upon the right and left sides ragged and indented like a saw which inequality of their limbs i have further observd not to remain always the same but to be continually changd by a kind of fluctuating motion not unlike that of the waves of the sea so as that part of the limb which was but even now nickd or indented in is now protuberant and will presently be sinking again neither is this all but the whole body of the luminaries do in the telescope seem to be depressd and slatted the upper and more especially the under side appearing neerer to the middle then really they are and the right and left appearing more remote whence the whole area seems to be terminated by a kind of oval it is further observd that the body for the most part appears red or of some colour approaching neer unto it as some kind of yellow and this i have always markd that the more the limb is slatted or ovalled the more red does the body appear though not always the contrary it is further observable that both fixd stars and planets the neerer they appear to the horizon the more red and dull they look and the more they are observd to twinkle in so much that i have seen the dogstarr to vibrate so strong and bright a radiation of light as almost to dazle my eyes and presently almost to disappear it is also observable that those bright scintillations neer the horizon are not by much so quick and sudden in their consecutions of one another as the nimbler twinklings of stars neerer the zenith this is also notable that the starrs neer the horizon are twinkled with several colours so as sometimes to appear red sometimes more yellow and sometimes blue and this when the starr is a pretty way elevated above the horizon i have further very often seen some of the small starrs of the fifth or sixth magnitude at certain times to disappear for a small moment of time and again appear more conspicuous and with a greater luster i have several times with my naked eye seen many smaller starrs such as may be calld of the seventh or eighth magnitude to appear for a short space and then vanish which by directing a small telescope towards that part they appeard and disappeard in i could presently find to be indeed small starrs so situate as i had seen them with my naked eye and to appear twinkling like the ordinary visible stars nay in examining some very notable parts of the heaven with a three foot tube me thought i now and then in several parts of the constellation could perceive little twinklings of starrs making a very short kind of apparition and presently vanishing but noting diligently the places where they thus seemd to play at boepeep i made use of a very good twelve foot tube and with that it was not uneasie to see those and several other degrees of smaller starrs and some smaller yet that seemd again to appear and disappear and these also by giving the same objectglass a much bigger aperture i could plainly and constantly see appear in their former places so that i have observd some twelve several magnitudes of starrs less then those of the six magnitudes commonly recounted in the globes  it has been observd and confirmd by the accuratest observations of the best of our modern astronomers that all the luminous bodies appear above the horizon when they really are below it so that the sun and moon have both been seen above the horizon whilst the moon has been in an eclipse i shall not here instance in the great refractions that the tops of high mountains seen at a distance have been found to have all which seem to argue the horizontal refraction much greater then it is hitherto generally believd  i have further taken notice that not onely the sun moon and starrs and high tops of mountains have sufferd these kinds of refraction but trees and several bright objects on the ground i have often taken notice of the twinkling of the reflections of the sun from a glasswindow at a good distance and of a candle in the night but that is not so conspicuous and in observing the setting sun i have often taken notice of the tremulation of the trees and bushes as well as of the edges of the sun divers of these ph√¶nomena have been taken notice of by several who have given several reasons of them but i have not yet met with any altogether satisfactory though some of their conjectures have been partly true but partly also false setting my self therfore upon the inquiry of these ph√¶nomena i first endeavourd to be very diligent in taking notice of the several particulars and circumstances observable in them and next in making divers particular experiments that might cleer some doubts and serve to determine confirm and illustrate the true and ad√¶quate cause of each and upon the whole i find much reason to think that the true cause of all these ph√¶nomena is from the inflection or multiplicate refraction of those rays of light within the body of the atmosphere and that it does not proceed from a refraction causd by any terminating superficies of the air above nor from any such exactly defind superficies within the body of the atmosphere  this conclusion is grounded upon these two propositions  first that a medium whose parts are unequally dense and movd by various motions and transpositions as to one another will produce all these visible effects upon the rays of light without any other coefficient cause  secondly that there is in the air or atmosphere such a variety in the constituent parts of it both as to their density and rarity and as to their divers mutations and positions one to another  by density and rarity i understand a property of a transparent body that does either more or less refract a ray of light coming obliquely upon its superficies out of a third medium toward its perpendicular as i call glass a more dense body then water and water a more rare body then glass because of the refractions more or less deflecting towards the perpendicular that are made in them of a ray of light out of the air that has the same inclination upon either of their superficies  so as to the business of refraction spirit of wine is a more dense body then water it having been found by an accurate instrument that measures the angles of refractions to minutes that for the same refracted angle of 30¬∞00 in both those mediums the angle of incidence in water was but 41¬∞35 but the angle of the incidence in the trial with spirit of wine was 42¬∞45 but as to gravity water is a more dense body then spirit of wine for the proportion of the same water to the same very well rectifyd spirit of wine was as 21 to 19  so as to refraction water is more dense then ice for i have found by a most certain experiment which i exhibited before divers illustrious persons of the royal society that the refraction of water was greater then that of ice though some considerable authors have affirmd the contrary and though the ice be a very hard and the water a very fluid body  that the former of the two preceding propositions is true may be manifested by several experiments as first if you take any two liquors differing from one another in density but yet such as will readily mix as salt water or brine  fresh almost any kind of salt dissolvd in water and filtrated so that it be cleer spirit of wine and water nay spirit of wine and spirit of wine one more highly rectifyd then the other and very many other liquors if i say you take any two of these liquors and mixing them in a glass viol against one side of which you have fixd or glued a small round piece of paper and shaking them well together so that the parts of them may be somewhat disturbd and move up and down you endeavour to see that round piece of paper through the body of the liquors you shall plainly perceive the figure to wave and to be indented much after the same manner as the limb of the sun through a telescope seems to be save onely that the mutations here are much quicker and if in steed of this bigger circle you take a very small spot and fasten and view it as the former you will find it to appear much like the twinkling of the starrs though much quicker which two ph√¶nomena for i shall take notice of no more at present though i could instance in multitudes of others must necessarily be causd by an inflection of the rays within the terminating superficies of the compounded medium since the surfaces of the transparent body through which the rays pass to the eye are not at all altered or changd  this inflection if i may so call it i imagine to be nothing else but a multiplicate refraction caused by the unequal density of the constituent parts of the medium whereby the motion action or progress of the ray of light is hindred from proceeding in a streight line and inflected or deflected by a curve now that it is a curve line is manifest by this experiment i took a box such as adge in the first figure of the 37 scheme whose sides abcd and efgh were made of two smooth flat plates of glass then filling it half full with a very strong solution of salt i filled the other half with very fair fresh water then exposing the opacous side dhgc to the sun i observd both the refraction and inflection of the sun beams id  kh and marking as exactly as i could the points p n o m by which the ray kh passed through the compounded medium i found them to be in a curve line for the parts of the medium being continually more dense the neerer they were to the bottom the ray pf was continually more and more deflected downwards from the streight line  this inflection may be mechanically explained either by monsieur des cartes principles by conceiving the globuls of the third element to find less and less resistance against that side of them which is downwards or by a way which i have further explicated in the inquisition about colours to be from an obliquation of the pulse of light whence the under part is continually promoted and consequently refracted towards the perpendicular which cuts the orbs at right angles what the particular figure of the curve line describd by this way of light is i shall not now stand to examine especially since there may be so many sorts of it as there may be varieties of the positions of the intermediat degrees of density and rarity between the bottom and the top of the inflecting medium  i could produce many more examples and experiments to illustrate and prove this first proposition viz that there is such a constitution of some bodies as will cause inflection as not to mention those i have observd in horn tortoiseshell transparent gums and resinous substances the veins of glass nay of melted crystal found and much complained of by glassgrinders and others might sufficiently demonstrate the truth of it to any diligent observator  but that i presume i have by this example given proof sufficient viz ocular demonstration to evince that there is such a modulation or bending of the rayes of light as i have calld inflection differing both from reflection and refraction since they are both made in the superficies this only in the middle and likewise that this is able or sufficient to produce the effects i have ascribed to it  it remains therefore to shew that there is such a property in the air and that it is sufficient to produce all the above mentioned ph√¶nomena and therefore may be the principal if not the only cause of them  first that there is such a property may be proved from this that the parts of the air are some of them more condensd others more rarified either by the differing heat or differing pressure it sustains or by the somewhat heterogeneous vapours interspersd through it for as the air is more or less rarified so does it more or less refract a ray of light that comes out of a denser medium from the perpendicular this you may find true if you make tryal of this experiment  take a small glassbubble made in the form of that in the second figure of the 37 scheme and by heating the glass very hot and thereby very much rarifying the included air or which is better by rarifying a small quantity of water included in it into vapours which will expel the most part if not all the air and then sealing up the small neck of it and letting it cool you may find if you place it in a convenient instrument that there will be a manifest difference as to the refraction  as if in this second figure you suppose a to represent a small sight or hole through which the eye looks upon an object as c through the glassbubble b and the second sight l all which remain exactly fixt in their several places the object c being so cized and placed that it may just seem to touch the upper and under edge of the hole l and so all of it be seen through the small glassball of rarified air then by breaking off the small seald neck of the bubble without at all stirring the sights object or glass and admitting the external air you will find your self unable to see the utmost ends of the object but the terminating rayes ae and ad which were before refracted to g and f by the rarified air will proceed almost directly to i and h which alteration of the rayes seeing there is no other alteration made in the organ by which the experiment is tryed save only the admission or exclusion of the condensd air must necessarily be caused by the variation of the medium containd in the glass b the greatest difficulty in the making of which experiment is from the uneven surfaces of the bubble which will represent an uneven image of the object  now that there is such a difference of the upper and under parts of the air is clear enough evincd from the late improvement of the torricellian experiment which has been tryed at the tops and feet of mountains and may be further illustrated and inquired into by a means which some whiles since i thought of and usd for the finding by what degrees the air passes from such a degree of density to such a degree of rarity and another for the finding what pressure was requisite to make it pass from such a degree of rarefaction to a determinate density which experiments because they may be useful to illustrate the present inquiry i shall briefly describe  16 i took then a small glasspipe ab about the bigness of a swans quill and about four foot long which was very equally drawn so that as far as i could perceive no one part was bigger then another this tube being open at both ends i fitted into another small tube de that had a small bore just big enough to contain the small pipe and this was seald up at one and open at the other end about which open end i fastned a small wooden box c with cement so that filling the bigger tube and part of the box with quicksilver i could thrust the smaller tube into it till it were all covered with the quicksilver having thus done i fastned my bigger tube against the side of a wall that it might stand the steadier and plunging the small tube cleer under the mercury in the box i stopt the upper end of it very fast with cement then lifting up the small tube i drew it up by a small pully and a string that i had fastned to the top of the room and found the height of the mercurial cylinder to be about twenty nine inches  then letting down the tube again i opened the top and then thrust down the small tube till i perceived the quicksilver to rise within it to a mark that i had placd just an inch from the top and immediately clapping on a small piece of cement that i had kept warm i with a hot iron seald up the top very fast then letting it cool that both the cement might grow hard and more especially that the air might come to its temper natural for the day i tryd the experiment in i observd diligently and found the included air to be exactly an inch  here you are to take notice that after the air is seald up the top of the tube is not to be elevated above the superficies of the quicksilver in the box till the surface of that within the tube be equal to it for the quicksilver as i have elsewhere provd being more heterogeneous to the glass then the air will not naturally rise up so high within the small pipe as the superficies of the mercury in the box and therefore you are to observe how much below the outward superficies of the mercury in the box that of the same in the tube does stand when the top being open free ingress is admitted to the outward air  having thus done i permitted the cylinder or small pipe to rise out of the box till i found the surface of the quicksilver in the pipe to be two inches above that in the box and found the air to have expanded it self but one sixteenth part of an inch then drawing up the small pipe till i found the height of the quicksilver within to be four inches above that without i observed the air to be expanded only 17 of an inch more then it was at first and to take up the room of 117 inch then i raised the tube till the cylinder was six inches high and found the air to take up 129 inches of room in the pipe then to 8 10 12 c the expansion of the air that i found to each of which cylinders are set down in the following table where the first row signifies the height of the mercurial cylinder the next the expansion of the air the third the pressure of the atmosphere or the highest cylinder of mercury which was then neer thirty inches the last signifies the force of the air so expanded which is found by substracting the first row of numbers out of the third for having found that the outward air would then keep up the quicksilver to thirty inches look whatever of that height is wanting must be attributed to the elater of the air depressing and therefore having the expansion in the second row and the height of the subjacent cylinder of mercury in the first and the greatest height of the cylinder of mercury which of it self counterballances the whole pressure of the atmosphere by substracting the numbers of the first row out of the numbers of the third you will have the measure of the cylinders so deprest and consequently the force of the air in the several expansions registred    the height of the     the expansion   the height

made but it being above a twelve month since i made them and by that means having forgot many circumstances and particulars i was resolved to make them over once again which i did august the second 1661 with the very same tube which i used the year before when i first made the experiment for it being a very good one i had carefully preservd it and after having tryed it over and over again and being not well satisfied of some particulars i at last having put all things in very good order and being as attentive and observant as possibly i could of every circumstance requisite to be taken notice of did register my several observations in this following table in the making of which i did not exactly follow the method that i had used at first but having lately heard of mr townlys hypothesis i shapd my course in such sort as would be most convenient for the examination of that hypothesis the event of which you have in the latter part of the last table  the other experiment was to find what degrees of force were requisite to compress or condense the air into such or such a bulk  the manner of proceeding therein was this i took a tube about five foot long one of whose ends was sealed up and bended in the form of a syphon much like that represented in the fourth figure of the 37 scheme one side whereof ad that was open at a was about fifty inches long the other side bc shut at b was not much above seven inches long then placing it exactly perpendicular i pourd in a little quicksilver and found that the air bc was 678 inches or very near to seven then pouring in quicksilver at the longer tube i continued filling of it till the air in the shorter part of it was contracted into half the former dimensions and found the height exactly nine and twenty inches and by making several other tryals in several other degrees of condensation of the air i found them exactly answer the former hypothesis  but having by reason it was a good while since i first made forgotten many particulars and being much unsatisfied in others i made the experiment over again and from the several tryals collected the former part of the following table where in the row next the left hand 24 signifies the dimensions of the air sustaining only the pressure of the atmosphere which at that time was equal to a cylinder of mercury of nine and twenty inches the next figure above it 20 was the dimensions of the air induring the first compression made by a cylinder of mercury 5316 high to which the pressure of the atmosphere nine and twenty inches being added the elastick strength of the air so comprest will be found 34316 c  a table of the elastick power of the air both experimentally and hypothetically calculated according to its various dimensions     the dimensions   the

experiments i think we may safely conclude that the elater of the air is reciprocal to its extension or at least very neer so that to apply it to our present purpose which was indeed the chief cause of inventing these wayes of tryal we will suppose a cylinder indefinitely extended upwards i say a cylinder not a piece of a cone because as i may elsewhere shew in the explication of gravity that triplicate proportion of the shels of a sphere to their respective diameters i suppose to be removed in this case by the decrease of the power of gravity and the pressure of the air at the bottom of this cylinder to be strong enough to keep up a cylinder of mercury of thirty inches now because by the most accurate tryals of the most illustrious and incomparable mr boyle published in his deservedly famous pneumatick book the weight of quicksilver to that of the air here below is found neer about as fourteen thousand to one if we suppose the parts of the cylinder of the atmosphere to be every where of an equal density we shall as he there deduces find it extended to the height of thirty five thousand feet or seven miles but because by these experiments we have somewhat confirmd the hypothesis of the reciprocal proportion of the elaters to the extensions we shall find that by supposing this cylinder of the atmosphere divided into a thousand parts each of which being equivalent to thirty five feet or seven geometrical paces that is each of these divisions containing as much air as is supposd in a cylinder neer the earth of equal diameter and thirty five foot high we shall find the lowermost to press against the surface of the earth with the whole weight of the above mentioned thousand parts the pressure of the bottom of the second against the top of the first to be 1000  1  999 of the third against the second to be 1000  2  998 of the fourth against the third to be 1000  3  997 of the uppermost against the 999 or that next below it to be 1000  999  1 so that the extension of the lowermost next the earth will be to the extension of the next below the uppermost as 1 to 999 for as the pressure sustained by the 999 is to the pressure sustaind by the first so is the extension of the first to the extension of the 999 so that from this hypothetical calculation we shall find the air to be indefinitely extended for if we suppose the whole thickness of the air to be divided as i just now instanced into a thousand parts and each of those under differing dimensions or altitudes to contain an equall quantity of air we shall find that the first cylinder whose base is supposed to lean on the earth will be found to be extended 3535999 foot the second equal division or cylinder whose basis is supposed to lean on the top of the first shall have its top extended higher by 3570998 the third 35105997 the fourth 35140996 and so onward each equal quantity of air having its dimensions measured by 35 and some additional number exprest alwayes in the manner of a fraction whose numerator is alway the number of the place multiplid by 35 and whose denominator is alwayes the pressure of the atmosphere sustaind by that part so that by this means we may easily calculate the height of 999 divisions of those 1000 divisions i supposd whereas the uppermost may extend it self more then as high again nay perhaps indefinitely or beyond the moon for the elaters and expansions being in reciprocal proportions since we cannot yet find the plus ultra beyond which the air will not expand it self we cannot determine the height of the air for since as we have shewn the proportion will be alway as the pressure sustaind by any part is to 35 so 1000 to the expansion of that part the multiplication or product therefore of the pressure and expansion that is of the two extream proportionals being alwayes equal to the product of the means or 35000 it follows since that rectangle or product may be made up of the multiplication of infinite diversities of numbers that the height of the air is also indefinite for since as far as i have yet been able to try the air seems capable of an indefinite expansion the pressure may be decreased in infinitum and consequently its expansion upwards indefinite also  there being therefore such a difference of density and no experiment yet known to prove a saltus or skipping from one degree of rarity to another much differing from it that is that an upper part of the air should so much differ from that immediately subjacent to it as to make a distinct superficies such as we observe between the air and water c but it being more likely that there is a continual increase of rarity in the parts of the air the further they are removed from the surface of the earth it will hence necessarily follow that as in the experiment of the salt and fresh water the ray of light passing obliquely through the air also which is of very different density will be continually and infinitely inflected or bended from a streight or direct motion  this granted the reason of all the above recited ph√¶nomena concerning the appearance of the celestial bodies will very easily be deduced as  first the redness of the sun moon and stars will be found to be caused by the inflection of the rays within the atmosphere that it is not really in or near the luminous bodies will i suppose be very easily granted seeing that this redness is observable in several places differing in longitude to be at the same time different the setting and rising sun of all parts being for the most part red  and secondly that it is not meerly the colour of the air interposd will i suppose without much more difficulty be yielded seeing that we may observe a very great interstitium of air betwixt the object and the eye makes it appear of a dead blew far enough differing from a red or yellow  but thirdly that it proceeds from the refraction or inflection of the rays by the atmosphere this following experiment will i suppose sufficiently manifest  take a sph√¶rical crystalline viol such as is describd in the fifth figure abcd and having filld it with pure clear water expose it to the sun beams then taking a piece of very fine venice paper apply it against that side of the globe that is opposite to the sun as against the side bc and you shall perceive a bright red ring to appear causd by the refraction of the rays aaaa which is made by the globe in which experiment if the glass and water be very cleer so that there be no sands nor bubbles in the glass nor dirt in the water you shall not perceive any appearance of any other colour to apply which experiment we may imagine the atmosphere to be a great transparent globe which being of a substance more dense then the other or which comes to the same that has its parts more dense towards the middle the sun beams that are tangents or next within the tangents of this globe will be refracted or inflected from their direct passage towards the center of the globe whence according to the laws of refractions made in a triangular prism and the generation of colour set down in the description of muscoviglass there must necessarily appear a red colour in the transitus or passage of those tangent rays to make this more plain we will suppose in the sixth figure abcd to represent the globe of the atmosphere efgh to represent the opacous globe of the earth lying in the midst of it neer to which the parts of the air sustaining a very great pressure are thereby very much condensd from whence those rays that are by inflection made tangents to the globe of the earth and those without them that pass through the more condensd part of the atmosphere as suppose between a and e are by reason of the inequality of the medium inflected towards the center whereby there must necessarily be generated a red colour as is more plainly shewn in the former cited place hence whatsoever opacous bodies as vapours or the like shall chance to be elevated into those parts will reflect a red towards the eye and therefore those evenings and mornings appear reddest that have the most store of vapours and halituous substances exhaled to a convenient distance from the earth for thereby the inflection is made the greater and thereby the colour also the more intense and several of those exhalations being opacous reflect several of those rays which through an homogeneous transparent medium would pass unseen and therefore we see that when there chances to be any clouds situated in those regions they reflect a strong and vivid red now though one great cause of the redness may be this inflection yet i cannot wholly exclude the colour of the vapours themselves which may have something of redness in them they being partly nitrous and partly fuliginous both which steams tinge the rays that pass through them as is made evident by looking at bodies through the fumes of aqua fortis or spirit of nitre as the newly mentioned illustrious person has demonstrated and also through the smoak of a fire or chimney  having therefore made it probable at least that the morning and evening redness may partly proceed from this inflection or refraction of the rays we shall next shew how the oval figure will be likewise easily deduced  suppose we therefore efgh in the sixth figure of the 37 scheme to represent the earth abcd the atmosphere ei and el two rays coming from the sun the one from the upper the other from the neather limb these rays being by the atmosphere inflected appear to the eye at e as if they had come from the points n and o and because the ray l has a greater inclination upon the inequality of the atmosphere then i therefore must it suffer a greater inflection and consequently be further elevated above its true place then the ray i which has a less inclination will be elevated above its true place whence it will follow that the lower side appearing neerer the upper then really it is and the two lateral sides viz the right and left side suffering no sensible alteration from the inflection at least what it does suffer does rather increase the visible diameter then diminish it as i shall shew by and by the figure of the luminous body must necessarily appear somewhat elliptical  this will be more plain if in the seventh figure of the 37 scheme we suppose ab to represent the sensible horizon cdef the body of the sun really below it ghik the same appearing above it elevated by the inflection of the atmosphere for if according to the best observation we make the visible diameter of the sun to be about three or four and thirty minutes and the horizontal refraction according to ticho be thereabout or somewhat more the lower limb of the sun e will be elevated to i but because by his account the point c will be elevated but 29 minutes as having not so great an inclination upon the inequality of the air therefore ig which will be the apparent refracted perpendicular diameter of the sun will be less then cg which is but 29 minutes and consequently six or seven minutes shorter then the unrefracted apparent diameter the parts d and f will be likewise elevated to h and k whose refraction by reason of its inclination will be bigger then that of the point c though less then that of e therefore will the semidiameter il be shorter then lg and consequently the under side of the appearing sun more flat then the upper  now because the rays from the right and left sides of the sun c have been observd by ricciolo and grimaldus to appear more distant one from another then really they are though by very many observations that i have made for that purpose with a very good telescope fitted with a divided ruler i could never perceive any great alteration yet there being really some it will not be amiss to shew that this also proceeds from the refraction or inflection of the atmosphere and this will be manifest if we consider the atmosphere as a transparent globe or at least a transparent shell encompassing an opacous globe which being more dense then the medium encompassing it refracts or inflects all the entring parallel rays into a point or focus so that wheresoever the observator is placd within the atmosphere between the focus and the luminous body the lateral rays must necessarily be more convergd towards his eye by the refraction or inflection then they would have been without it and therefore the horizontal diameter of the luminous body must necessarily be augmented  this might be more plainly manifest to the eye by the sixth figure but because it would be somwhat tedious and the thing being obvious enough to be imagind by any one that attentively considers it i shall rather omit it and proceed to shew that the mass of air neer the surface of the earth consists or is made up of parcels which do very much differ from one another in point of density and rarity and consequently the rays of light that pass through them will be variously inflected here one way and there another according as they pass so or so through those differing parts and those parts being always in motion either upwards or downwards or to the right or left or in some way compounded of these they do by this their motion inflect the rays now this way and presently that way  this irregular unequal and unconstant inflection of the rays of light is the reason why the limb of the sun moon jupiter saturn mars and venus appear to wave or dance and why the body of the starrs appear to tremulate or twinkle their bodies by this means being sometimes magnifyd and sometimes diminished sometimes elevated otherwhiles depressd now thrown to the right hand and then to the left  and that there is such a property or unequal distribution of parts is manifest from the various degrees of heat and cold that are found in the air from whence will follow a differing density and rarity both as to quantity and refraction and likewise from the vapours that are interposd which by the way i imagine as to refraction or inflection to do the same thing as if they were rarifyd air and that those vapours that ascend are both lighter and less dense then the ambient air which boys them up and that those which descend are heavier and more dense the first of these may be found true if you take a good thick piece of glass and heating it pretty hot in the fire lay it upon such another piece of glass or hang it in the open air by a piece of wire then looking upon some far distant object such as a steeple or tree so as the rays from that object pass directly over the glass before they enter your eye you shall find such a tremulation and wavering of the remote object as will very much offend your eye the like tremulous motion you may observe to be causd by the ascending steams of water and the like now from the first of these it is manifest that from the rarifaction of the parts of the air by heat there is causd a differing refraction and from the ascension of the more rarifyd parts of the air which are thrust up by the colder and therefore more condensd and heavie is causd an undulation or wavering of the object for i think that there are very few will grant that glass by as gentle a heat as may be endurd by ones hand should send forth any of its parts in steams or vapours which does not seem to be much wasted by that violent fire of the green glasshouse but if yet it be doubted let experiment be further made with that body that is accounted by chymists and others the most ponderous and fixd in the world for by heating of a piece of gold and proceeding in the same manner you may find the same effects  this trembling and shaking of the rays is more sensibly causd by an actual flame or quick fire or anything else heated glowing hot as by a candle live coal redhot iron or a piece of silver and the like the same also appears very conspicuous if you look at an object betwixt which and your eye the rising smoak of some chimney is interposd which brings into my mind what i had once the opportunity to observe which was the sun rising to my eye just over a chimney that sent forth a copious steam of smoak and taking a short telescope which i had then by me i observd the body of the sun though it was but just peepd above the horizon to have its underside not onely flatted and pressd inward as it usually is when neer the earth but to appear more protuberant downwards then if it had suffered no refraction at all and besides all this the whole body of the sun appeard to tremble or dance and the edges or limb to be very ragged or indented undulating or waving much in the manner of a flag in the wind  this i have likewise often observd in a hot sunshiny summers day that looking on an object over a hot stone or dry hot earth i have found the object to be undulated or shaken much after the same manner and if you look upon any remote object through a telescope in a hot summers day especially you shall find it likewise to appear tremulous and further if there chance to blow any wind or that the air between you and the object be in a motion or current whereby the parts of it both rarifyd and condensd are swiftly removd towards the right or left if then you observe the horizontal ridge of a hill far distant through a very good telescope you shall find it to wave much like the sea and those waves will appear to pass the same way with the wind  from which and many other experiments tis cleer that the lower region of the air especially that part of it which lieth neerest to the earth has for the most part its constituent parcels variously agitated either by heat or winds by the first of which some of them are made more rare and so suffer a less refraction others are interwoven either with ascending or descending vapours the former of which being more light and so more rarifyd have likewise a less refraction the latter being more heavie and consequently more dense have a greater  now because that heat and cold are equally diffusd every way and that the further it is spread the weaker it grows hence it will follow that the most part of the under region of the air will be made up of several kinds of lentes some whereof will have the properties of convex others of concave glasses which that i may the more intelligibly make out we will suppose in the eighth figure of the 37 scheme that a represents an ascending vapour which by reason of its being somewhat heterogeneous to the ambient air is thereby thrust into a kind of globular form not any where terminated but gradually finished that is it is most rarifyd in the middle about a somewhat more condensd about bb more then that about cc yet further about dd almost of the same density with the ambient air about ee and lastly inclosed with the more dense air ff so that from a to ff there is a continual increase of density the reason of which will be manifest if we consider the rising vapour to be much warmer then the ambient heavie air for by the coldness of the ambient air the shell ee will be more refrigerated then dd and that then cc which will be yet more then bb and that more then a so that from f to a there is a continual increase of heat and consequently of rarity from whence it will necessarily follow that the rays of light will be inflected or refracted in it in the same manner as they would be in a concaveglase for the rays gki gki will be inflected by gkh gkh which will easily follow from what i before explained concerning the inflection of the atmosphere  on the other side a descending vapour or any part of the air included by an ascending vapour will exhibit the same effects with a convex lens for if we suppose in the former figure the quite contrary constitution to that last describd that is the ambient air ff being hotter then any part of that matter within any circle therefore the coldest part must necessarily be a as being farthest removd from the heat all the intermediate spaces will be gradually discriminated by the continuall mixture of heat and cold so that it will be hotter at ee then dd in dd then cc in cc then bb and in bb then a from which a like refraction and condensation will follow and consequently a lesser or greater refraction so that every included part will refract more then the including by which means the rays gki gki coming from a starr or some remote object are so inflected that they will again concurr and meet in the point m by the interposition therefore of this desending vapour the visible body of the star or other object is very much augmented as by the former it was diminished  from the quick consecutions of these two one after another between the object and your eye caused by their motion upwards or downwards proceeding from their levity or gravity or to the right or left proceeding from the wind a starr may appear now bigger now less then really it would otherwise without them and this is that property of a starr which is commonly calld twinkling or scintillation  the reason why a star will now appear of one colour now of another which for the most part happens when tis neer the horizon may very easily be deducd from its appearing now in the middle of the vapour other whiles neer the edge for if you look against the body of a starr with a telescope that has a pretty deep convex eyeglass and so order it that the star may appear sometimes in one place and sometimes in another of it you may perceive this or that particular colour to be predominant in the apparent figure of the starr according as it is more or less remote from the middle of the lens this i had here further explaind but that it does more properly belong to another place  i shall therefore onely add some few queries which the consideration of these particulars hinted and so finish this section  and the first i shall propound is whether there may not be made an artificial transparent body of an exact globular figure that shall so inflect or refract all the rays that coming from one point fall upon any hemisphere of it that every one of them may meet on the opposite side and cross one another exactly in a point and that it may do the like also with all the rays that coming from a lateral point fall upon any other hemisphere for if so there were to be hoped a perfection of dioptricks and a transmigration into heaven even whilst we remain here upon earth in the flesh and a descending or penetrating into the center and innermost recesses of the earth and all earthly bodies nay it would open not onely a cranney but a large window as i may so speak into the shop of nature whereby we might be enabled to see both the tools and operators and the very manner of the operation it self of nature this could it be effected would as farr surpass all other kind of perspectives as the vast extent of heaven does the small point of the earth which distance it would immediately remove and unite them as twere into one at least that there should appear no more distance between them then the length of the tube into the ends of which these glasses should be inserted now whether this may not be effected with parcels of glass of several densities i have sometimes proceeded so farr as to doubt though in truth as to the general i have wholly despaird of it for i have often observd in optical glasses a very great variety of the parts which are commonly called veins nay some of them round enough for they are for the most part drawn out into firings to constitute a kind of lens  this i should further proceed to hope had any one been so inquisitive as to have found out the way of making any transparent body either more dense or more rare for then it might be possible to compose a globule that should be more dense in the middle of it then in any other part and to compose the whole bulk so as that there should be a continual gradual transition from one degree of density to another such as should be found requisite for the desired inflection of the transmigrating rays but of this enough at present because i may say more of it when i set down my own trials concerning the melioration of dioptricks where i shall enumerate with how many several substances i have made both microscopes and telescopes and by what and how many ways let such as have leisure and opportunity farther consider it  the next qu√¶ry shall be whether by the same collection of a more dense body then the other or at least of the denser part of the other there might not be imagind a reason of the apparition of some new fixd stars as those in the swan cassiopes charr serpentarius piscis cetus c  thirdly whether it be possible to define the height of the atmosphere from this inflection of the rays or from the quicksilver experiment of the rarifaction or extension of the air  fourthly whether the disparity between the upper and under air be not sometimes so great as to make a reflecting superficies i have had several observations which seem to have proceeded from some such cause but it would be too long to relate and examine them an experiment also somewhat analogous to this i have made with saltwater and fresh which two liquors in most positions seemd the same and not to be separated by any determinate superficies which separating surface yet in some other positions did plainly appear  and if so whether the reason of the equal bounding or terminus of the under parts of the clouds may not proceed from this cause whether secondly the reason of the apparition of many suns may not be found out by considering how the rays of the sun may so be reflected as to describe a pretty true image of the body as we find them from any regular superficies whether also this may not be found to cause the apparition of some of those parelii of counterfeit suns which appear coloured by refracting the rays so as to make the body of the sun appear in quite another place then really it is but of this more elsewhere  5 whether the ph√¶nomena of the clouds may not be made out by this diversity of density in the upper and under parts of the air by supposing the air above them to be much lighter then they themselves are and they themselves to be yet lighter then that which is subjacent to them many of them seeming to be the same substance with the cobwebs that fly in the air after a fog  now that such a constitution of the air and clouds if such there be may be sufficient to perform this effect may be confirmd by this experiment  make as strong a solution of salt as you are able then filling a glass of some depth half full with it fill the other half with fresh water and poyse a little glassbubble so as that it may sink pretty quick in fresh water which take and put into the aforesaid glass and you shall find it to sink till it comes towards the middle where it will remain fixt without moving either upwards or downwards and by a second experiment of poising such a bubble in water whose upper part is warmer and consequently lighter then the under which is colder and heavier the manner of which follows in this next qu√¶ry which is  6 whether the rarifaction and condensation of water be not made after the same manner as those effects are producd in the air by heat for i once poisd a seald up glassbubble so exactly that never so small an addition would make it sink and as small a detraction make it swim which suffering to rest in that vessel of water for some time i alwayes found it about noon to be at the bottom of the water and at night and in the morning at the top imagining this to proceed from the rarifaction of the water causd by the heat i made tryal and found most true for i was able at any time either to depress or raise it by heat and cold for if i let the pipe stand for some time in cold water i could easily raise the bubble from the bottom whither i had a little afore detruded it by putting the same pipe into warm water and this way i have been able for a very considerable time to keep a bubble so poysd in the water as that it should remain in the middle and neither sink nor swim for gently heating the upper part of the pipe with a candle coal or hot iron till i perceived the bubble begin to descend then forbearing i have observed it to descend to such or such a station and there to remain suspended for some hours till the heat by degrees were quite vanished when it would again ascend to its former place this i have also often observed naturally performed by the heat of the air which being able to rarifie the upper parts of the water sooner then the lower by reason of its immediate contact the heat of the air has sometimes so slowly increased that i have observed the bubble to be some hours in passing between the top and bottom  7 whether the appearance of the pike of tenerif and several other high mountains at so much greater a distance then seems to agree with their respective heights be not to be attributed to the curvature of the visual ray that is made by its passing obliquely through so differingly dense a medium from the top to the eye very far distant in the horizon for since we have already i hope made it very probable that there is such an inflection of the rays by the differing density of the parts of the air and since i have found by several experiments made on places comparatively not very high and have yet found the pressure sustaind by those parts of the air at the top and bottom and also their differing expansions very considerable insomuch that i have found the pressure of the atmosphere lighter at the top of st pauls steeple in london which is about two hundred foot high then at the bottom by a sixtieth or fiftieth part and the expansion at the top greater then that at the bottom by neer about so much also for the mercurial cylinder at the bottom was about 39 inches and at the top half an inch lower the air also included in the weatherglass that at the bottom filld only 155 spaces at the top filld 158 though the heat at the top and bottom was found exactly the same with a scald thermometer i think it very rational to suppose that the greatest curvature of the rays is made nearest the earth and that the inflection of the rays above 3 or 4 miles upwards is very inconsiderable and therefore that by this means such calculations of the height of mountains as are made from the distance they are visible in the horizon from the supposal that that ray is a straight line that from the top of the mountain is as twere a tangent to the horizon whence it is seen which really is a curve is very erroneous whence i suppose proceeds the reason of the exceedingly differing opinions and assertions of several authors about the height of several very high hills  8 whether this inflection of the air will not very much alter the supposed distances of the planets which seem to have a very great dependence upon the hypothetical refraction or inflection of the air and that refraction upon the hypothetical height and density of the air for since as i hope i have here shewn the air to be quite otherwise then has been hitherto supposd by manifesting it to be both of a vast at least an uncertain height and of an unconstant and irregular density it must necessarily follow that its inflection must be varied accordingly and therefore we may hence learn upon what sure grounds all the astronomers hitherto have built who have calculated the distance of the planets from their horizontal parallax for since the refraction and parallax are so nearly allyd that the one cannot be known without the other especially by any wayes that have been yet attempted how uncertain must the parallax be when the refraction is unknown and how easie is it for astronomers to assign what distance they please to the planets and defend them when they have such a curious subterfuge as that of refraction wherein a very little variation will allow them liberty enough to place the celestial bodies at what distance they please  if therefore we would come to any certainty in this point we must go other wayes to work and as i have here examined the height and refractive property of the air by other wayes then are usual so must we find the parallax of the planets by wayes not yet practiced and to this end i cannot imagine any better way then the observations of them by two persons at very far distant parts of the earth that lye as neer as may be under the same meridian or degree of longitude but differing as much in latitude as there can be places conveniently found these two persons at certain appointed times should as near as could be both at the same time observe the way of the moon mars venus jupiter and saturn amongst the fixt stars with a good large telescope and making little iconismes or pictures of the small fixed stars that appear to each of them to lye in or near the way of the center of the planet and the exact measure of the apparent diameter from the comparing of such observations together we might certainly know the true distance or parallax of the planet and having any one true parallax of these planets we might very easily have the other by their apparent diameters which the telescope likewise affords us very accurately and thence their motions might be much better known and their theories more exactly regulated and for this purpose i know not any one place more convenient for such an observation to be made in then in the island of st helena upon the coast of africk which lyes about sixteen degrees to the southwards of the line and is very near according to the latest geographical maps in the same meridian with london for though they may not perhaps lye exactly in the same yet their observations being ordered according to what i shall anon shew it will not be difficult to find the true distance of the planet but were they both under the same meridian it would be much better  and because observations may be much easier and more accurately made with good telescopes then with any other instruments it will not i suppose seem impertinent to explain a little what wayes i judge most fit and convenient for that particular such therefore as shall be the observators for this purpose should be furnished with the best telescopes that can be had the longer the better and more exact will their observations be though they are somewhat the more difficultly managd these should be fitted with a rete or divided scale placd at such a distance within the eyeglass that they may be distinctly seen which should be the measures of minutes and seconds by this instrument each observator should at certain prefixt times observe the moon or other planet in or very near the meridian and because it may be very difficult to find two convenient stations that will happen to be just under the same meridian they shall each of them observe the way of the planet both for an hour before and an hour after it arrive at the meridian and by a line or stroke amongst the small fixed stars they shall denote out the way that each of them observd the center of the planet to be movd in for those two hours these observations each of them shall repeat for many dayes together that both it may happen that both of them may sometimes make their observations together and that from divers experiments we may be the better assured of what certainty and exactness such kind of observations are like to prove and because many of the stars which may happen to come within the compass of such an iconism or map may be such as are only visible through a good telescope whose positions perhaps have not been noted nor their longitudes or latitudes any where remarked therefore each observator should indeavour to insert some fixt star whose longitude and latitude is known or with his telescope he shall find the position of some notable telescopical star inserted in his map to some known fixt star whose place in the zodiack is well defind  having by this means found the true distance of the moon and having observed well the apparent diameter of it at that time with a good telescope it is easie enough by one single observation of the apparent diameter of the moon with a good glass to determine her distances in any other part of her orbit or dragon and consequently some few observations will tell us whether she be movd in an ellipsis which by the way may also be found even now though i think we are yet ignorant of her true distance and next which without such observations i think we shall not be sure of we may know exactly the bigness of that ellipsis or circle and her true velocity in each part and thereby be much the better inabled to find out the true cause of all her motions and though even now also we may by such observations in one station as here at london observe the apparent diameter and motion of the moon in her dragon and consequently be inabled to make a better ghess at the species or kind of curve in which she is movd that is whether it be sph√¶rical or elliptical or neither and with what proportional velocities she is carried in that curve yet till her true parallax be known we cannot determine either  next for the true distance of the sun the best way will be by accurate observations made in both these forementioned stations of some convenient eclipse of the sun many of which may so happen as to be seen by both for the penumbra of the moon may if she be sixty semidiameters distant from the earth and the sun above seven thousand extend to about seventy degrees on the earth and consequently be seen by observators as far distant as london and st helena which are not full sixty nine degrees distant and this would much more accurately then any way that has been yet used determine the parallax and distance of the sun for as for the horizontal parallax i have already shewn it sufficiently uncertain nor is the way of finding it by the eclipse of the moon any other then hypothetical and that by the difference of the true and apparent quadrature of the moon is not less uncertain witness their deductions from it who have made use of it for vendeline puts that difference to be but 430 whence he deduces a vast distance of the sun as i have before shewn ricciolo makes it full 3000 but reinoldus and kircher no less then three degrees and no wonder for if we examine the theory we shall find it so complicated with uncertainties  first from the irregular surface of the moon and from several parallaxes that unless the dichotomy happen in the nonagesimus of the ecliptick and that in the meridian c all which happen so very seldom that it is almost impossible to make them otherwise then uncertainly besides we are not yet certain but that there may be somewhat about the moon analogus to the air about the earth which may cause a refraction of the light of the sun and consequently make a great difference in the apparent dichotomy of the moon their way indeed is very rational and ingenious and such as is much to be preferred before the way by the horizontal parallax could all the uncertainties be removd and were the true distance of the moon known  but because we find by the experiments of vendiline reinoldus c that observations of this kind are very uncertain also it were to be wisht that such kind of observations made at two very distant stations were promoted and it is so much the more desirable because from what i have now shewn of the nature of the air it is evident that the refraction may be very much greater then all the astronomers hitherto have imagined it and consequently that the distance of the moon and other planets may be much lesse then what they have hitherto made it  for first this inflection i have here propounded will allow the shadow of the earth to be much shorter then it can be made by the other hypothesis of refraction and consequently the moon will not suffer an eclipse unless it comes very much nearer the earth then the astronomers hitherto have supposed it  secondly there will not in this hypothesis be any other shadow of the earth such as kepler supposes and calls the penumbra which is the shadow of the refracting atmosphere for the bending of the rays being altogether causd by inflection as i have already shewn all that part which is ascribed by kepler and others after him to the penumbra or dark part which is without the umbra terr√¶ does clear vanish for in this hypothesis there is no refracting surface of the air and consequently there can be no shadows such as appear in the ninth figure of the 37 scheme where let abcd represent the earth and efgh the atmosphere which according to keplers supposition is like a sph√¶re of water terminated with an exact surface efgh let the lines mf lb id kh represent the rays of the sun tis manifest that all the rayes between lb and id will be reflected by the surface of the earth bad and consequently the conical space bod would be dark and obscure but say the followers of kepler the rays between mf and lb and between id and kh falling on the atmosphere are refracted both at their ingress and egress out of the atmosphere nearer towards the axis of the sph√¶rical shadow co and consequently inlighten a great part of that former dark cone and shorten and contract its top to n and because of this reflection of these rays say they there is superinducd another shell of a dark cone fph whose apex p is yet further distant from the earth by this penumbra say they the moon is eclipsed for it alwayes passes between the lines 12 and 34  to which i say that if the air be such as i have newly shewn it to be and consequently cause such an inflection of the rays that fall into it those dark penumbras fyzq hxvt and orps will all vanish for if we suppose the air indefinitely extended and to be no where bounded with a determinate refracting surface as i have shewn it uncapable of having from the nature of it it will follow that the moon will no where be totally obscured but when it is below the apex n of the dark blunt cone of the earths shadow now from the supposition that the sun is distant about seven thousand diameters the point n according to calculation being not above twenty five terrestrial semidiameters from the center of the earth it follows that whensoever the moon eclipsed is totally darkned without affording any kind of light it must be within twenty five semidiameters of the earth and consequently much lower then any astronomers have hitherto put it  this will seem much more consonant to the rest of the secundary planets for the highest of jupiters moons is between twenty and thirty jovial semidiameters distant from the center of jupiter and the moons of saturn much about the same number of saturnial semidiameters from the center of that planet  but these are but conjectures also and must be determind by such kind of observations as i have newly mentiond  nor will it be difficult by this hypothesis to salve all the appearances of eclipses of the moon for in this hypothesis also there will be on each side of the shadow of the earth a penumbra not causd by the refraction of the air as in the hypothesis of kepler but by the faint inlightning of it by the sun for if in the sixth figure we suppose esq and gsr to be the rays that terminate the shadow from either side of the earth esq coming from the upper limb of the sun and gsr from the under it will follow that the shadow of the earth within those rays that is the cone gse will be totally dark but the sun being not a point but a large area of light there will be a secondary dark cone of shadow epg which will be causd by the earths hindring part of the rays of the sun from falling on the parts gpr and epq of which halved shadow or penumbra that part will appear brightest which lyes nearest the terminating rayes gp and ep and those darker that lye nearest to gs and es when therefore the moon appears quite dark in the middle of the eclipse she must be below s that is between s and f when she appears lighter near the middle of the eclipse she must pass some where between rq and s and when she is alike light through the whole eclypse she must pass between rq and p                                        observ lix of multitudes of small stars discoverable by the telescope  having in the last observation premisd some particulars observable in the medium through which we must look upon coelestial objects i shall here add one observation of the bodies themselves and for a specimen i have made choice of the pleiades or seven stars commonly so called though in our time and climate there appear no more then six to the naked eye and this i did the rather because the deservedly famous galileo having publisht a picture of this asterisme was able it seems with his glass to discover no more then thirty six whereas with a pretty good twelve foot telescope by which i drew this 38 iconism i could very plainly discover seventy eight placed in the order they are ranged in the figure and of as many differing magnitudes as the asterisks wherewith they are marked do specifie there being no less then fourteen several magnitudes of those stars which are comprisd within the draught the biggest whereof is not accounted greater then one of the third magnitude and indeed that account is much too big if it be compared with other stars of the third magnitude especially by the help of a telescope for then by it may be perceivd that its splendor to the naked eye may be somewhat augmented by the three little stars immediately above it which are near adjoyning to it the telescope also discovers a great variety even in the bigness of those commonly reckond of the first second third fourth fifth and sixth magnitude so that should they be distinguishd thereby those six magnitudes would at least afford no less then thrice that number of magnitudes plainly enough distinguishable by their magnitude and brightness so that a good twelve foot glass would afford us no less then twenty five several magnitudes nor are these all but a longer glass does yet further both more nicely distinguish the magnitudes of those already noted and also discover several other of smaller magnitudes not discernable by the twelve foot glass thus have i been able with a good thirty six foot glass to discover many more stars in the pleiades then are here delineated and those of three or four distinct magnitudes less then any of those spots of the fourteenth magnitude and by the twinkling of divers other places of this asterisme when the sky was very clear i am apt to think that with longer glasses or such as would bear a bigger aperture there might be discovered multitudes of other small stars yet inconspicuous and indeed for the discovery of small stars the bigger the aperture be the better adapted is the glass for though perhaps it does make the several specks more radiant and glaring yet by that means uniting more rays very near to one point it does make many of those radiant points conspicuous which by putting on a less aperture may be found to vanish and therefore both for the discovery of the fixt star and for finding the satellites of jupiter before it be out of the day or twilight i alwayes leave the objectglass as clear without any aperture as i can and have thereby been able to discover the satellites a long while before i was able to discern them when the smaller apertures were put on and at other times to see multitudes of other smaller stars which a smaller aperture makes to disappear  in that notable asterism also of the sword of orion where the ingenious monsieur hugens van zulichem has discovered only three little stars in a cluster i have with a thirty six foot glass without any aperture the breadth of the glass being about some three inches and a half discoverd five and the twinkling of divers others up and down in divers parts of that small milky cloud  so that tis not unlikely but that the meliorating of telescopes will afford as great a variety of new discoveries in the heavens as better microscopes would among small terrestrial bodies and both would give us infinite cause more and more to admire the omnipotence of the creator                                        observ lx of the moon  having a pretty large corner of the plate for the seven starrs void for the filling it up i have added one small specimen of the appearance of the parts of the moon by describing a small spot of it which though taken notice of both by the excellent hevelius and called mons olympus though i think somewhat improperly being rather a vale and represented by the figure x of the 38 scheme and also by the learnd ricciolus who calls it hipparchus and describes it by the figure y yet how far short both of them come of the truth may be somewhat perceivd by the draught which i have here added of it in the figure z which i drew by a thirty foot glass in october 1664 just before the moon was half inlightned but much better by the readers diligently observing it himself at a convenient time with a glass of that length and much better yet with one of threescore foot long for through these it appears a very spacious vale incompassed with a ridge of hills not very high in comparison of many other in the moon nor yet very steep the vale it self abcd is much of the figure of a pear and from several appearances of it seems to be some very fruitful place that is to have its surface all covered over with some kinds of vegetable substances for in all positions of the light on it it seems to give a much fainter reflection then the more barren tops of the incompassing hills and those a much fainter then divers other cragged chalky or rocky mountains of the moon so that i am not unapt to think that the vale may have vegetables analogus to our grass shrubs and trees and most of these incompassing hills may be covered with so thin a vegetable coat as we may observe the hills with us to be such as the short sheep pasture which covers the hills of salisbury plains  up and down in several parts of this place here describd as there are multitudes in other places all over the surface of the moon may be perceived several kinds of pits which are shapd almost like a dish some bigger some less some shallower some deeper that is they seem to be a hollow hemisphere incompassed with a round rising bank as if the substance in the middle had been diggd up and thrown on either side these seem to me to have been the effects of some motions within the body of the moon analogus to our earthquakes by the eruption of which as it has thrown up a brim or ridge round about higher then the ambient surface of the moon so has it left a hole or depression in the middle proportionably lower divers places resembling some of these i have observd here in england on the tops of some hills which might have been causd by some earthquake in the younger dayes of the world but that which does most incline me to this belief is first the generality and diversity of the magnitude of these pits all over the body of the moon next the two experimental wayes by which i have made a representation of them  the first was with a very soft and well temperd mixture of tobaccopipe clay and water into which if i let fall any heavy body as a bullet it would throw up the mixture round the place which for a while would make a representation not unlike these of the moon but considering the state and condition of the moon there seems not any probability to imagine that it should proceed from any cause analogus to this for it would be difficult to imagine whence those bodies should come and next how the substance of the moon should be so soft but if a bubble be blown under the surface of it and sufferd to rise and break or if a bullet or other body sunk in it be pulld out from it these departing bodies leave an impression on the surface of the mixture exactly like these of the moon save that these also quickly subside and vanish but the second and most notable representation was what i observd in a pot of boyling alabaster for there that powder being by the eruption of vapours reducd to a kind of fluid consistence if whilst it boyls it be gently removd besides the fire the alabaster presently ceasing to boyl the whole surface especially that where some of the last bubbles have risen will appear all over covered with small pits exactly shapd like these of the moon and by holding a lighted candle in a large dark room in divers positions to this surface you may exactly represent all the ph√¶nomena of these pits in the moon according as they are more or less inlightned by the sun  and that there may have been in the moon some such motion as this which may have made these pits will seem the more probable if we suppose it like our earth for the earthquakes here with us seem to proceed from some such cause as the boyling of the pot of alabaster there seeming to be generated in the earth from some subterraneous fires or heat great quantities of vapours that is of expanded aerial substances which not presently finding a passage through the ambient parts of the earth do as they are increased by the supplying and generating principles and thereby having not sufficient room to expand themselves extreamly condensd at last overpower with their elastick properties the resistence of the incompassing earth and lifting it up or cleaving it and so shattering of the parts of the earth above it do at length where they find the parts of the earth above them more loose make their way upwards and carrying a great part of the earth before them not only raise a small brim round about the place out of which they break but for the most part considerable high hills and mountains and when they break from under the sea divers times mountainous islands this seems confirmd by the vulcans in several places of the earth the mouths of which for the most part are incompassed with a hill of a considerable height and the tops of those hills or mountains are usually shapd very much like these pits or dishes of the moon instances of this we have in the descriptions of √Ütna in sicily of hecla in iceland of tenerif in the canaries of the several vulcans in newspain describd by gage and more especially in the eruption of late years in one of the canary islands in all of which there is not only a considerable high hill raised about the mouth of the vulcan but like the spots of the moon the top of those hills are like a dish or bason and indeed if one attentively consider the nature of the thing one may find sufficient reason to judge that it cannot be otherwise for these eruptions whether of fire or smoak alwayes raysing great quantities of earth before them must necessarily by the fall of those parts on either side raise very considerable heaps  now both from the figures of them and from several other circumstances these pits in the moon seem to have been generated much after the same manner that the holes in alabaster and the vulcans of the earth are made for first it is not improbable but that the substance of the moon may be very much like that of our earth that is may consist of an earthy sandy or rocky substance in several of its superficial parts which parts being agitated undermind or heavd up by eruptions of vapours may naturally be thrown into the same kind of figured holes as the small dust or powder of alabaster next it is not improbable but that there may be generated within the body of the moon divers such kind of internal fires and heats as may produce such exhalations for since we can plainly enough discover with a telescope that there are multitudes of such kind of eruptions in the body of the sun it self which is accounted the most noble √Ütherial body certainly we need not be much scandalizd at such kind of alterations or corruptions in the body of this lower and less considerable part of the universe the moon which is only secundary or attendant on the bigger and more considerable body of the earth thirdly tis not unlikely but that supposing such a sandy or mouldring substance to be there found and supposing also a possibility of the generation of the internal elastical body whether you will call it air or vapours tis not unlikely i say but that there is in the moon a principle of gravitation such as in the earth and to make this probable i think we need no better argument then the roundness or globular figure of the body of the moon it self which we may perceive very plainly by the telescope to be bating the small inequality of the hills and vales in it which are all of them likewise shapd or levelled as it were to answer to the center of the moons body perfectly of a sph√¶rical figure that is all the parts of it are so rangd bating the comparitively small ruggedness of the hills and dales that the outmost bounds of them are equally distant from the center of the moon and consequently it is exceedingly probable also that they are equidistant from the center of gravitation and indeed the figure of the superficial parts of the moon are so exactly shapd according as they should be supposing it had a gravitating principle as the earth has that even the figure of those parts themselves is of sufficient efficacy to make the gravitation and the other two suppositions probable so that the other suppositions may be rather provd by this considerable circumstance or observation then this supposd explication can by them for he that shall attentively observe with an excellent telescope how all the circumstances notable in the shape of the superficial parts are as it were exactly adapted to suit with such a principle will if he well considers the usual method of nature in its other proceedings find abundant argument to believe it to have really there also such a principle for i could never observe among all the mountainous or prominent parts of the moon whereof there is a huge variety that any one part of it was placd in such a manner that if there should be a gravitating or attracting principle in the body of the moon it would make that part to fall or be movd out of its visible posture next the shape and position of the parts is such that they all seem put into those very shapes they are in by a gravitating power for first there are but very few clifts or very steep declivities in the ascent of these mountains for besides those mountains which are by hevelius calld the apennine mountains and some other which seem to border on the seas of the moon and those only upon one side as is common also in those hills that are here on the earth there are very few that seem to have very steep ascents but for the most part they are made very round and much resemble the make of the hills and mountains also of the earth this may be partly perceived by the hills incompassing this vale which i have here describd and as on the earth also the middlemost of these hills seems the highest so is it obvious also through a good telescope in those of the moon the vales also in many are much shapd like those of the earth and i am apt to think that could we look upon the earth from the moon with a good telescope we might easily enough perceive its surface to be very much like that of the moon  now whereas in this small draught as there would be multitudes if the whole moon were drawn after this manner there are several little ebullitions or dishes even in the vales themselves and in the incompassing hills also this will from this supposition which i have i think upon very good reason taken be exceeding easily explicable for as i have several times also observd in the surface of alabaster so ordered as i before describd so may the later eruptions of vapours be even in the middle or on the edges of the former and other succeeding these also in time may be in the middle or edges of these c of which there are instances enough in divers parts of the body of the moon and by a boyling pot of alabaster will be sufficiently exemplifid  to conclude therefore it being very probable that the moon has a principle of gravitation it affords an excellent distinguishing instance in the search after the cause of gravitation or attraction to hint that it does not depend upon the diurnal or turbinated motion of the earth as some have somewhat inconsiderately supposed and affirmed it to do for if the moon has an attractive principle whereby it is not only shapd round but does firmly contain and hold all its parts united though many of them seem as loose as the sand on the earth and that the moon is not movd about its center then certainly the turbination cannot be the cause of the attraction of the earth and therefore some other principle must be thought of that will agree with all the secundary as well as primary planets but this i confess is but a probability and not a demonstration which from any observation yet made it seems hardly capable of though how successful future indeavours promoted by the meliorating of glasses and observing particular circumstances may be in this or any other kind must be with patience expected

the refraction of ice an experiment of making an undulation of the rays by the mixing of liquors of differing density the explication of inflection mechanically and hypothetically what bodies have such an inflection several experiments to shew that the air has this propriety that it proceeds from the differing density of the air that the upper and under part of the air are of differing density some experiments to prove this a table of the strength of the spring of the air answering to each degree of extension when first made and when repeated another experiment of compressing the air a table of the strength of the air answering to each compression and expansion from which the height of the air may be supposd indefinite to what degree the air is rarifid at any distance above the surface of the earth how from this inflection is inferrd and several ph√¶nomena explaind that the air near the earth is composd of parts of differing density made probable by several experiments and observations how this propriety produces the effects of the waving and dancing of bodies and of the twinkling of the stars several ph√¶nomena explicated some qu√¶ries added  1 whether this principle

surface of boyld alabaster dust seeming the most likely to be resembled by eruptions of vapours out of the body of the moon that earthquakes seem to be generated much the same way and their effects seem very similar an argument that there may be such variations in the moon because greater have been observd in the sun because substance of the moon and earth seem much alike and because tis probable the moon has a gravitating principle this is argued from several particulars the reason why several pits are one within another the use that may be made of this instance of a gravity in the
