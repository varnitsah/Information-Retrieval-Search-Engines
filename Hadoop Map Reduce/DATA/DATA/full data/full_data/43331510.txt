that year a large part of it was published in covers with the title the cynics word book a name which the author had not the power to reject or happiness to approve  to quote the publishers of the present work  this more reverent title had previously been forced upon him by the religious scruples of the last newspaper in which a part of the work had appeared with the natural consequence that when it came out in covers the country already had been flooded by its imitators with a score of cynic booksthe cynics this the cynics that and the cynics tother  most of these books were merely stupid though some of them added the distinction of silliness  among them they brought the word cynic into disfavor so deep that any book bearing it was discredited in advance of publication  meantime too some of the enterprising humorists of the country had helped themselves to such parts of the work as served their needs and many of its definitions anecdotes phrases and so forth had become more or less current in popular speech  this explanation is made not with any pride of priority in trifles but in simple denial of possible charges of plagiarism which is no trifle  in merely resuming his

said of certain kinds of testimony which juries are supposed to be unfit to be entrusted with and which judges therefore rule out even of proceedings before themselves alone  hearsay evidence is inadmissible because the person quoted was unsworn and is not before the court for examination yet most momentous actions military political commercial and of every other kind are daily undertaken on

men long dead whose identity is not clearly established and who are not known to have been sworn in any sense  under the rules of evidence as they now exist in this country no single assertion in the bible has in its support any evidence admissible in a court of law  it cannot be proved that the battle of blenheim ever was fought that there was such as person as julius caesar such an empire as assyria  but as records of courts of justice are admissible it can easily be proved that powerful and malevolent magicians once existed and were a scourge to mankind  the evidence including confession upon which certain women were convicted of witchcraft and executed was without a flaw it is still unimpeachable  the judges decisions based on it were sound in logic and in law  nothing in any existing court was ever more thoroughly proved than the charges of witchcraft and sorcery for which so many suffered death  if there were no witches human testimony and human reason are alike

neighbor keep it wholly  to the creator it seemed fit and expedient that the sabbath should be the last day of the week but the early fathers of the church held other views  so great is the sanctity of the day that even where the lord holds a doubtful and precarious jurisdiction over those who go down to and down into the sea it is reverently recognized as is manifest in the following deepwater

acceptably if the penitent spared himself no pain nor harmless disfigurement  scarification with other crude penances has now been superseded by benefaction the founding of a library or endowment of a university is said to yield to the penitent a sharper and more lasting pain than is conferred by the knife or iron and is therefore a surer means of grace  there are however two grave objections to it

approaching the throne the man   who should have been at that time ten minutes dead       seventeen hundred impossible dragons shouted the enraged   monarch  did i not sentence you to stand in the marketplace and   have your head struck off by the public executioner at three   oclock  and is it not now 310       son of a thousand illustrious deities answered the   condemned minister all that you say is so true that the truth is   a lie in comparison  but your heavenly majestys sunny and   vitalizing wishes have been pestilently disregarded  with joy i   ran and placed my unworthy body in the marketplace  the   executioner appeared with his bare scimetar ostentatiously   whirled it in air and then tapping me lightly upon the neck   strode away pelted by the populace with whom i was ever a   favorite  i am come to pray for justice upon his own dishonorable   and treasonous head       to what regiment of executioners does the blackboweled   caitiff belong asked the mikado       to

lord of cranes of cherry blooms replied the executioner   unmoved command him to blow his nose with his fingers       being commanded jijiji ri laid hold of his nose and trumpeted   like an elephant all expecting to see the severed head flung   violently from him  nothing occurred  the performance prospered   peacefully to the close without incident       all eyes were now turned on the executioner who had grown as   white as the snows on the summit of fujiama  his legs trembled   and his breath came in gasps of terror       several kinds of spiketailed brass lions he cried i am a

antagonistic to ones own  scriptures n  the sacred books of our holy religion as distinguished from the false and profane writings on which all other faiths are based  seal n  a mark impressed upon certain kinds of documents to attest their authenticity and authority  sometimes it is stamped upon wax and attached to the paper sometimes into the paper itself  sealing in this sense is a survival of an ancient custom of inscribing important papers with cabalistic words or signs to give them a magical efficacy independent of the authority that they represent  in the british museum are preserved many ancient papers mostly of a sacerdotal character validated by necromantic pentagrams and other devices frequently initial letters of words to conjure with and in many instances these are attached in the same way that seals are appended now  as nearly every reasonless and apparently meaningless custom rite or observance of modern times had origin in some remote utility it is pleasing to note an example of ancient nonsense evolving in the process of ages into something really useful  our word sincere is derived from sine cero without wax but the learned are not in agreement as to whether this refers to the absence of the cabalistic signs or to that of the wax with which letters were formerly closed from public scrutiny  either view of the matter will serve one in immediate need of an hypothesis  the initials ls commonly appended to signatures of legal documents mean locum sigillis the place of the seal although the seal is no longer used an admirable example of conservatism

respectable and sometimes was punished by torture and death  augustine nicholas relates that a poor peasant who had been accused of sorcery was put to the torture to compel a confession  after enduring a few gentle agonies the suffering simpleton admitted his guilt but naively asked his tormentors if it were not possible to be a sorcerer without knowing it  soul n  a spiritual entity concerning which there hath been brave disputation  plato held that those souls which in a previous state of existence antedating athens had obtained the clearest glimpses of eternal truth entered into the bodies of persons who became philosophers  plato himself was a philosopher  the souls that had least contemplated divine truth animated the bodies of usurpers and despots  dionysius i who had threatened to decapitate the broadbrowed philosopher was a usurper and a despot  plato doubtless was not the first to construct a system of philosophy that could be quoted against his enemies certainly he was not the last  concerning the nature of the soul saith the renowned author of diversiones sanctorum there hath been hardly more argument than that of its place in the body  mine own belief is that the soul hath her seat in the abdomenin which faith we may discern and interpret a truth hitherto unintelligible namely that the glutton is of all men most devout  he is said in the scripture to make a god of his belly why then should he not be pious having ever his deity with him to freshen his faith  who so well as he can know the might and majesty that he shrines  truly and soberly the soul and the stomach are one divine entity and such was the belief of promasius who nevertheless erred in denying it immortality  he had observed that its visible and material substance failed and decayed with the rest of the body after death but of its immaterial essence he knew nothing this is what we call the appetite and it survives the wreck and reek of mortality to be rewarded or punished in another world according to what it hath demanded in the flesh  the appetite whose coarse clamoring was for the unwholesome viands of the general market and the public refectory shall be cast into eternal famine whilst that which firmly through civilly insisted on ortolans caviare terrapin anchovies pates de foie gras and all such christian comestibles shall flesh its spiritual tooth

authorship  yet in reviewing it you speak of it as the work of the idiot of the century  do you think that fair criticism  i am very sorry sir replied the critic amiably but it did not occur to me that you really might not wish the public to know who wrote it  mr wc morrow who used to live in san jose california was addicted to writing ghost stories which made the reader feel as if a stream of lizards fresh from the ice were streaking it up his back and hiding in his hair  san jose was at that time believed to be haunted by the visible spirit of a noted bandit named vasquez who had been hanged there  the town was not very well lighted and it is putting it mildly to say that san jose was reluctant to be out o nights  one particularly dark night two gentlemen were abroad in the loneliest spot within the city limits talking loudly to keep up their courage when they came upon mr jj owen a wellknown journalist  why owen said one what brings you here on such a night as this  you

way as a brass band  one has to scrutinize ones impressions pretty closely or one will mistake their origin  while the admiral was digesting this hasty meal of philosophy general miles passed in review a spectacle of impressive dignity when the tail of the seeming procession had passed and the two observers had recovered from the transient blindness caused by its effulgence  he seems to be enjoying himself said the admiral  there is nothing assented joy thoughtfully that he enjoys onehalf so well   the illustrious statesman champ clark once lived about a mile from the village of jebigue in missouri  one day he rode into town on a favorite mule and hitching the beast on the sunny side of a street in front of a saloon he went inside in his character of teetotaler to apprise the barkeeper that wine is a mocker  it was a dreadfully hot day  pretty soon a neighbor came in and seeing clark said  champ it is not right to leave that mule out there in the sun hell roast surehe was smoking as i passed him  o hes all right said clark lightly hes an inveterate smoker  the neighbor took a lemonade but shook his head and repeated that it was not right  he was a conspirator  there had been a fire the night before  a stable just around the corner had burned and a number of horses had put on their immortality among them a young colt which was roasted to a rich nutbrown  some of the boys had turned mr clarks mule loose and substituted the mortal part of the colt  presently another man entered the saloon  for mercys sake he said taking it with sugar do remove that mule barkeeper  it smells  yes interposed clark that animal has the best nose in missouri  but if he doesnt mind you shouldnt  in the course of human events mr clark went out and there apparently lay the incinerated and shrunken remains of his charger the boys did not have any fun out of mr clarke who looked at the body and with the noncommittal expression to which he owes so much of his political preferment went away  but walking home late that night he saw his mule standing silent and solemn by the wayside in the misty moonlight  mentioning the name of helen blazes with uncommon emphasis mr

commonly interpreted the right to vote for the man of another mans choice and is highly prized  refusal to do so has the bad name of incivism  the incivilian however cannot be properly arraigned for his crime for there is no legitimate accuser  if the accuser is himself guilty he has no standing in the court of opinion if not he profits by the crime for as abstention from voting gives greater

attention was once somewhat diverted from this garment to miss lillian russells refusal to wear it and many were the conjectures as to her motive the guess of miss pauline hall showing a high order of ingenuity and sustained reflection  it was miss halls belief that nature had not endowed miss russell with beautiful legs  this theory was impossible of acceptance by the male understanding but the conception of a faulty female leg was of so prodigious originality as to rank among the most brilliant feats of philosophical speculation it is strange that in all the controversy regarding miss russells aversion to tights no one seems to have thought to ascribe it to what was known among the ancients as modesty  the nature of that sentiment is now imperfectly understood and possibly incapable of exposition with the vocabulary that remains to us  the study of lost arts has however been recently revived and some of the arts themselves recovered  this is an epoch of renaissances and

animals fishes reptiles and insects were brought to trial  a beast that had taken human life or practiced sorcery was duly arrested tried and if condemned put to death by the public executioner
