78282031	the scarecrow of oz   by  l frank baum       dedicated to    the uplifters of los angeles california in   grateful appreciation of the pleasure i have derived   from association with them and in recognition of   their sincere endeavor to uplift humanity through   kindness consideration and goodfellowship they are   big menall of themand all with the generous   hearts of little children    l frank baum      twixt you and me  the army of children which besieged the postoffice conquered the postmen and delivered to me its imperious commands insisted that trot and capn bill be admitted to the land of oz where trot could enjoy the society of dorothy betsy bobbin and ozma while the onelegged sailorman might become a comrade of the tin woodman the shaggy man tiktok and all the other quaint people who inhabit this wonderful fairyland  it was no easy task to obey this order and land trot and capn bill safely in oz as you will discover by reading this book indeed it required the best efforts of our dear old friend the scarecrow to save them from a dreadful fate on the journey but the story leaves them happily located in ozmas splendid palace and dorothy has promised me that buttonbright and the three girls are sure to encounter in the near future some marvelous adventures in the land of oz which i hope to be permitted to relate to you in the next oz book  meantime i am deeply grateful to my little readers for their continued enthusiasm over the oz stories as evinced in the many letters they send me all of which are lovingly cherished it takes more and more oz books every year to satisfy the demands of old and new readers and there have been formed many oz reading societies where the oz books owned by different members are read aloud  all this is very gratifying to me and encourages me to write more stories when the children have had enough of them i hope they will let me know and then ill try to write something different  l frank baum   royal historian of oz

chapter one  the great whirlpool   seems to me said capn bill as he sat beside trot under the big acacia tree looking out over the blue ocean seems to me trot as how the more we know the more we find we dont know  i cant quite make that out capn bill answered the little girl in a serious voice after a moments thought during which her eyes followed those of the old sailorman across the glassy surface of the sea seems to me that all we learn is jus so much gained  i know it looks that way at first sight said the sailor nodding his head but those as knows the least have a habit of thinkin they know all there is to know while them as knows the most admits what a turrble big world this is its the knowing ones that realize one lifetime aint long enough to git moren a few dips o the oars of knowledge  trot didnt answer she was a very little girl with big solemn eyes and an earnest simple manner capn bill had been her faithful companion for years and had taught her almost everything she knew  he was a wonderful man this capn bill not so very old although his hair was grizzledwhat there was of it most of his head was bald as an egg and as shiny as oilcloth and this made his big ears stick out in a funny way his eyes had a gentle look and were pale blue in color and his round face was rugged and bronzed capn bills left leg was missing from the knee down and that was why the sailor no longer sailed the seas the wooden leg he wore was good enough to stump around with on land or even to take trot out for a row or a sail on the ocean but when it came to runnin up aloft or performing active duties on shipboard the old sailor was not equal to the task the loss of his leg had ruined his career and the old sailor found comfort in devoting himself to the education and companionship of the little girl  the accident to capn bills leg bad happened at about the time trot was born and ever since that he had lived with trots mother as a star boarder having enough money saved up to pay for his weekly keep  he loved the baby and often held her on his lap her first ride was on capn bills shoulders for she had no babycarriage and when she began to toddle around the child and the sailor became close comrades and enjoyed many strange adventures together it is said the fairies had been present at trots birth and had marked her forehead with their invisible mystic signs so that she was able to see and do many wonderful things  the acacia tree was on top of a high bluff but a path ran down the bank in a zigzag way to the waters edge where capn bills boat was moored to a rock by means of a stout cable it had been a hot sultry afternoon with scarcely a breath of air stirring so capn bill and trot had been quietly sitting beneath the shade of the tree waiting for the sun to get low enough for them to take a row  they had decided to visit one of the great caves which the waves had washed out of the rocky coast during many years of steady effort the caves were a source of continual delight to both the girl and the sailor who loved to explore their awesome depths  i blieve capn remarked trot at last that its time for us to start  the old man cast a shrewd glance at the sky the sea and the motionless boat then he shook his head  mebbe its time trot he answered but i dont jes like the looks o things this afternoon  whats wrong she asked wonderingly  cant say as to that things is too quiet to suit me thats all no breeze not a ripple atop the water nary a gull aflyin anywhere an the end o the hottest day o the year i aint no weatherprophet trot but any sailor would know the signs is ominous  theres nothing wrong that i can see said trot  if there was a cloud in the sky even as big as my thumb we might worry about it butlook capnthe sky is as clear as can be  he looked again and nodded  praps we can make the cave all right he agreed not wishing to disappoint her  its only a little way out an well be on the watch so come along trot  together they descended the winding path to the beach it was no trouble for the girl to keep her footing on the steep way but capn bill because of his wooden leg had to hold on to rocks and roots now and then to save himself from tumbling on a level path he was as spry as anyone but to climb up hill or down required some care  they reached the boat safely and while trot was untying the rope capn bill reached into a crevice of the rock and drew out several tallow candles and a box of wax matches which he thrust into the capacious pockets of his souwester  this souwester was a short coat of oilskin which the old sailor wore on all occasionswhen he wore a coat at alland the pockets always contained a variety of objects useful and ornamental which made even trot wonder where they all came from and why capn bill should treasure them the jackknivesa big one and a little onethe bits of cord the fishhooks the nails these were handy to have on certain occasions but bits of shell and tin boxes with unknown contents buttons pincers bottles of curious stones and the like seemed quite unnecessary to carry around that was capn bills business however and now that he added the candles and the matches to his collection trot made no comment for she knew these last were to light their way through the caves the sailor always rowed the boat for he handled the oars with strength and skill trot sat in the stern and steered the place where they embarked was a little bight or circular bay and the boat cut across a much larger bay toward a distant headland where the caves were located right at the waters edge they were nearly a mile from shore and about halfway across the bay when trot suddenly sat up straight and exclaimed whats that capn  he stopped rowing and turned half around to look  that trot he slowly replied looks to me mighty like a whirlpool  what makes it capn  a whirl in the air makes the whirl in the water i was afraid as wed meet with trouble trot things didnt look right the air was too still  its coming closer said the girl  the old man grabbed the oars and began rowing with all his strength  taint comin closer to us trot he gasped its we that are comin closer to the whirlpool the thing is drawin us to it like a magnet  trots sunbronzed face was a little paler as she grasped the tiller firmly and tried to steer the boat away but she said not a word to indicate fear  the swirl of the water as they came nearer made a roaring sound that was fearful to listen to so fierce and powerful was the whirlpool that it drew the surface of the sea into the form of a great basin slanting downward toward the center where a big hole had been made in the oceana hole with walls of water that were kept in place by the rapid whirling of the air  the boat in which trot and capn bill were riding was just on the outer edge of this saucerlike slant and the old sailor knew very well that unless he could quickly force the little craft away from the rushing current they would soon be drawn into the great black hole that yawned in the middle so he exerted all his might and pulled as he had never pulled before he pulled so hard that the left oar snapped in two and sent capn bill sprawling upon the bottom of the boat  he scrambled up quickly enough and glanced over the side then he looked at trot who sat quite still with a serious faraway look in her sweet eyes the boat was now speeding swiftly of its own accord following the line of the circular basin round and round and gradually drawing nearer to the great hole in the center any further effort to escape the whirlpool was useless and realizing this fact capn bill turned toward trot and put an arm around her as if to shield her from the awful fate before them  he did not try to speak because the roar of the waters would have drowned the sound of his voice  these two faithful comrades had faced dangers before but nothing to equal that which now faced them yet capn bill noting the look in trots eyes and remembering how often she had been protected by unseen powers did not quite give way to despair  the great hole in the dark waternow growing nearer and nearerlooked very terrifying but they were both brave enough to face it and await the result of the adventure     chapter two  the cavern under the sea   the circles were so much smaller at the bottom of the basin and the boat moved so much more swiftly that trot was beginning to get dizzy with the motion when suddenly the boat made a leap and dived headlong into the murky depths of the hole whirling like tops but still clinging together the sailor and the girl were separated from their boat and plunged downdowndowninto the farthermost recesses of the great ocean  at first their fall was swift as an arrow but presently they seemed to be going more moderately and trot was almost sure that unseen arms were about her supporting her and protecting her she could see nothing because the water filled her eyes and blurred her vision but she clung fast to capn bills souwester while other arms clung fast to her and so they gradually sank down and down until a full stop was made when they began to ascend again  but it seemed to trot that they were not rising straight to the surface from where they had come the water was no longer whirling them and they seemed to be drawn in a slanting direction through still cool ocean depths and thenin much quicker time than i have told itup they popped to the surface and were cast at full length upon a sandy beach where they lay choking and gasping for breath and wondering what had happened to them  trot was the first to recover disengaging herself from capn bills wet embrace and sitting up she rubbed the water from her eyes and then looked around her  a soft bluishgreen glow lighted the place which seemed to be a sort of cavern for above and on either side of her were rugged rocks they had been cast upon a beach of clear sand which slanted upward from the pool of water at their feeta pool which doubtless led into the big ocean that fed it above the reach of the waves of the pool were more rocks and still more and more into the dim windings and recesses of which the glowing light from the water did not penetrate  the place looked grim and lonely but trot was thankful that she was still alive and had suffered no severe injury during her trying adventure under water at her side capn bill was sputtering and coughing trying to get rid of the water he had swallowed both of them were soaked through yet the cavern was warm and comfortable and a wetting did not dismay the little girl in the least  she crawled up the slant of sand and gathered in her hand a bunch of dried seaweed with which she mopped the face of capn bill and cleared the water from his eyes and ears presently the old man sat up and stared at her intently then he nodded his bald head three times and said in a gurgling voice  mighty good trot mighty good we didnt reach davy joness locker that time did we though why we didnt an why were here is moren i kin make out  take it easy capn she replied were safe enough i guess at least for the time being  he squeezed the water out of the bottoms of his loose trousers and felt of his wooden leg and arms and head and finding he had brought all of his person with him he gathered courage to examine closely their surroundings  where dye think we are trot he presently asked  cant say capn praps in one of our caves  he shook his head no said he i dont think that at all  the distance we came up didnt seem half as far as the distance we went down an youll notice there aint any outside entrance to this cavern whatever its a reglar dome over this pool o water and unless theres some passage at the back up yonder were fast prisners  trot looked thoughtfully over her shoulder  when were rested she said we will crawl up there and see if theres a way to get out  capn bill reached in the pocket of his oilskin coat and took out his pipe it was still dry for he kept it in an oilskin pouch with his tobacco his matches were in a tight tin box so in a few moments the old sailor was smoking contentedly trot knew it helped him to think when he was in any difficulty also the pipe did much to restore the old sailors composure after his long ducking and his terrible frighta fright that was more on trots account than his own  the sand was dry where they sat and soaked up the water that dripped from their clothing when trot had squeezed the wet out of her hair she began to feel much like her old self again by and by they got upon their feet and crept up the incline to the scattered boulders above some of these were of huge size but by passing between some and around others they were able to reach the extreme rear of the cavern  yes said trot with interest heres a round hole  and its black as night inside it remarked capn bill  just the same answered the girl we ought to explore it and see where it goes cause its the only possble way we can get out of this place  capn bill eyed the hole doubtfully  it may be a way out o here trot he said but it may be a way into a far worse place than this im not sure but our best plan is to stay right here  trot wasnt sure either when she thought of it in that light after awhile she made her way back to the sands again and capn bill followed her as they sat down the child looked thoughtfully at the sailors bulging pockets  how much food have we got capn she asked  half a dozen ships biscuits an a hunk o cheese he replied want some now trot  she shook her head saying  that ought to keep us alive bout three days if were careful of it  longern that trot said capn bill but his voice was a little troubled and unsteady  but if we stay here were bound to starve in time continued the girl while if we go into the dark hole  some things are more hard to face than starvation said the sailorman gravely we dont know whats inside that dark hole trot nor where it might lead us to  theres a way to find that out she persisted  instead of replying capn bill began searching in his pockets he soon drew out a little package of fishhooks and a long line trot watched him join them together then he crept a little way up the slope and turned over a big rock two or three small crabs began scurrying away over the sands and the old sailor caught them and put one on his hook and the others in his pocket coming back to the pool he swung the hook over his shoulder and circled it around his head and cast it nearly into the center of the water where he allowed it to sink gradually paying out the line as far as it would go when the end was reached he began drawing it in again until the crab bait was floating on the surface  trot watched him cast the line a second time and a third she decided that either there were no fishes in the pool or they would not bite the crab bait but capn bill was an old fisherman and not easily discouraged when the crab got away he put another on the hook when the crabs were all gone he climbed up the rocks and found some more  meantime trot tired of watching him and lay down upon the sands where she fell fast asleep during the next two hours her clothing dried completely as did that of the old sailor they were both so used to salt water that there was no danger of taking cold  finally the little girl was wakened by a splash beside her and a grunt of satisfaction from capn bill she opened her eyes to find that the capn had landed a silverscaled fish weighing about two pounds this cheered her considerably and she hurried to scrape together a heap of seaweed while capn bill cut up the fish with his jackknife and got it ready for cooking  they had cooked fish with seaweed before capn bill wrapped his fish in some of the weed and dipped it in the water to dampen it then he lighted a match and set fire to trots heap which speedily burned down to a glowing bed of ashes then they laid the wrapped fish on the ashes covered it with more seaweed and allowed this to catch fire and burn to embers after feeding the fire with seaweed for some time the sailor finally decided that their supper was ready so he scattered the ashes and drew out the bits of fish still encased in their smoking wrappings  when these wrappings were removed the fish was found thoroughly cooked and both trot and capn bill ate of it freely it had a slight flavor of seaweed and would have been better with a sprinkling of salt  the soft glow which until now had lighted the cavern began to grow dim but there was a great quantity of seaweed in the place so after they had eaten their fish they kept the fire alive for a time by giving it a handful of fuel now and then  from an inner pocket the sailor drew a small flask of battered metal and unscrewing the cap handed it to trot  she took but one swallow of the water although she wanted more and she noticed that capn bill merely wet his lips with it  spose said she staring at the glowing seaweed fire and speaking slowly that we can catch all the fish we need how bout the drinkingwater capn  he moved uneasily but did not reply both of them were thinking about the dark hole but while trot had little fear of it the old man could not overcome his dislike to enter the place he knew that trot was right though to remain in the cavern where they now were could only result in slow but sure death  it was nighttime up on the earths surface so the little girl became drowsy and soon fell asleep after a time the old sailor slumbered on the sands beside her it was very still and nothing disturbed them for hours when at last they awoke the cavern was light again  they had divided one of the biscuits and were munching it for breakfast when they were startled by a sudden splash in the pool looking toward it they saw emerging from the water the most curious creature either of them had ever beheld it wasnt a fish trot decided nor was it a beast it had wings though and queer wings they were shaped like an inverted choppingbowl and covered with tough skin instead of feathers it had four legsmuch like the legs of a stork only double the numberand its head was shaped a good deal like that of a poll parrot with a beak that curved downward in front and upward at the edges and was half bill and half mouth but to call it a bird was out of the question because it had no feathers whatever except a crest of wavy plumes of a scarlet color on the very top of its head the strange creature must have weighed as much as capn bill and as it floundered and struggled to get out of the water to the sandy beach it was so big and unusual that both trot and her companion stared at it in wonderin wonder that was not unmixed with fear     chapter three  the ork   the eyes that regarded them as the creature stood dripping before them were bright and mild in expression and the queer addition to their party made no attempt to attack them and seemed quite as surprised by the meeting as they were  i wonder whispered trot what it is  who me exclaimed the creature in a shrill highpitched voice why im an ork  oh said the girl but what is an ork  i am he repeated a little proudly as he shook the water from his funny wings and if ever an ork was glad to be out of the water and on dry land again you can be mighty sure that im that especial individual ork  have you been in the water long inquired capn bill thinking it only polite to show an interest in the strange creature  why this last ducking was about ten minutes i believe and thats about nine minutes and sixty seconds too long for comfort was the reply but last night i was in an awful pickle i assure you the whirlpool caught me and  oh were you in the whirlpool too asked trot eagerly  he gave her a glance that was somewhat reproachful  i believe i was mentioning the fact young lady when your desire to talk interrupted me said the ork i am not usually careless in my actions but that whirlpool was so busy yesterday that i thought id see what mischief it was up to so i flew a little too near it and the suction of the air drew me down into the depths of the ocean water and i are natural enemies and it would have conquered me this time had not a bevy of pretty mermaids come to my assistance and dragged me away from the whirling water and far up into a cavern where they deserted me  why thats about the same thing that happened to us cried trot was your cavern like this one  i havent examined this one yet answered the ork but if they happen to be alike i shudder at our fate for the other one was a prison with no outlet except by means of the water  i stayed there all night however and this morning i plunged into the pool as far down as i could go and then swam as hard and as far as i could the rocks scraped my back now and then and i barely escaped the clutches of an ugly seamonster but by and by i came to the surface to catch my breath and found myself here thats the whole story and as i see you have something to eat i entreat you to give me a share of it the truth is im half starved  with these words the ork squatted down beside them very reluctantly capn bill drew another biscuit from his pocket and held it out the ork promptly seized it in one of its front claws and began to nibble the biscuit in much the same manner a parrot might have done  we havent much grub said the sailorman but were willin to share it with a comrade in distress  thats right returned the ork cocking its head sidewise in a cheerful manner and then for a few minutes there was silence while they all ate of the biscuits after a while trot said  ive never seen or heard of an ork before are there many of you  we are rather few and exclusive i believe was the reply in the country where i was born we are the absolute rulers of all living things from ants to elephants  what country is that asked capn bill  orkland  where does it lie  i dont know exactly you see i have a restless nature for some reason while all the rest of my race are quiet and contented orks and seldom stray far from home from childhood days i loved to fly long distances away although father often warned me that i would get into trouble by so doing  its a big world flipper my son he would say and ive heard that in parts of it live queer twolegged creatures called men who war upon all other living things and would have little respect for even an ork  this naturally aroused my curiosity and after i had completed my education and left school i decided to fly out into the world and try to get a glimpse of the creatures called men so i left home without saying goodbye an act i shall always regret adventures were many i found i sighted men several times but have never before been so close to them as now also i had to fight my way through the air for i met gigantic birds with fluffy feathers all over them which attacked me fiercely besides it kept me busy escaping from floating airships in my rambling i had lost all track of distance or direction so that when i wanted to go home i had no idea where my country was located ive now been trying to find it for several months and it was during one of my flights over the ocean that i met the whirlpool and became its victim  trot and capn bill listened to this recital with much interest and from the friendly tone and harmless appearance of the ork they judged he was not likely to prove so disagreeable a companion as at first they had feared he might be  the ork sat upon its haunches much as a cat does but used the fingerlike claws of its front legs almost as cleverly as if they were hands perhaps the most curious thing about the creature was its tail or what ought to have been its tail this queer arrangement of skin bones and muscle was shaped like the propellers used on boats and airships having fanlike surfaces and being pivoted to its body capn bill knew something of mechanics and observing the propellerlike tail of the ork he said  i spose youre a pretty swift flyer  yes indeed the orks are admitted to be kings of the air  your wings dont seem to amount to much remarked trot  well they are not very big admitted the ork waving the four hollow skins gently to and fro but they serve to support my body in the air while i speed along by means of my tail still taken altogether im very handsomely formed dont you think  trot did not like to reply but capn bill nodded gravely for an ork said he youre a wonder ive never seen one afore but i can imagine youre as good as any  that seemed to please the creature and it began walking around the cavern making its way easily up the slope while it was gone trot and capn bill each took another sip from the waterflask to wash down their breakfast  why heres a holean exitan outlet exclaimed the ork from above  we know said trot we found it last night  well then lets be off continued the ork after sticking its head into the black hole and sniffing once or twice the air seems fresh and sweet and it cant lead us to any worse place than this  the girl and the sailorman got up and climbed to the side of the ork  wed about decided to explore this hole before you came explained capn bill but its a dangerous place to navigate in the dark so wait till i light a candle  what is a candle inquired the ork  youll see in a minute said trot  the old sailor drew one of the candles from his rightside pocket and the tin matchbox from his leftside pocket when he lighted the match the ork gave a startled jump and eyed the flame suspiciously but capn bill proceeded to light the candle and the action interested the ork very much  light it said somewhat nervously is valuable in a hole of this sort the candle is not dangerous i hope  sometimes it burns your fingers answered trot but thats about the worst it can docept to blow out when you dont want it to  capn bill shielded the flame with his hand and crept into the hole it wasnt any too big for a grown man but after he had crawled a few feet it grew larger  trot came close behind him and then the ork followed  seems like a reglar tunnel muttered the sailorman who was creeping along awkwardly because of his wooden leg the rocks too hurt his knees  for nearly half an hour the three moved slowly along the tunnel which made many twists and turns and sometimes slanted downward and sometimes upward finally capn bill stopped short with an exclamation of disappointment and held the flickering candle far ahead to light the scene  whats wrong demanded trot who could see nothing because the sailors form completely filled the hole  why weve come to the end of our travels i guess he replied  is the hole blocked inquired the ork  no its wuss nor that replied capn bill sadly im on the edge of a precipice wait a minute an ill move along and let you see for yourselves be careful trot not to fall  then he crept forward a little and moved to one side holding the candle so that the girl could see to follow him the ork came next and now all three knelt on a narrow ledge of rock which dropped straight away and left a huge black space which the tiny flame of the candle could not illuminate  hm said the ork peering over the edge this doesnt look very promising ill admit but let me take your candle and ill fly down and see whats below us  arent you afraid asked trot  certainly im afraid responded the ork but if we intend to escape we cant stay on this shelf forever so as i notice you poor creatures cannot fly it is my duty to explore the place for you  capn bill handed the ork the candle which had now burned to about half its length the ork took it in one claw rather cautiously and then tipped its body forward and slipped over the edge they heard a queer buzzing sound as the tail revolved and a brisk flapping of the peculiar wings but they were more interested just then in following with their eyes the tiny speck of light which marked the location of the candle this light first made a great circle then dropped slowly downward and suddenly was extinguished leaving everything before them black as ink  hi there how did that happen cried the ork  it blew out i guess shouted capn bill fetch it here  i cant see where you are said the ork  so capn bill got out another candle and lighted it and its flame enabled the ork to fly back to them it alighted on the edge and held out the bit of candle  what made it stop burning asked the creature  the wind said trot you must be more careful this time  whats the place like inquired capn bill  i dont know yet but there must be a bottom to it so ill try to find it  with this the ork started out again and this time sank downward more slowly down down down it went till the candle was a mere spark and then it headed away to the left and trot and capn bill lost all sight of it  in a few minutes however they saw the spark of light again and as the sailor still held the second lighted candle the ork made straight toward them it was only a few yards distant when suddenly it dropped the candle with a cry of pain and next moment alighted fluttering wildly upon the rocky ledge  whats the matter asked trot  it bit me wailed the ork i dont like your candles the thing began to disappear slowly as soon as i took it in my claw and it grew smaller and smaller until just now it turned and bit mea most unfriendly thing to do ohoh ouch what a bite  thats the nature of candles im sorry to say explained capn bill with a grin you have to handle em mighty keerful but tell us what did you find down there  i found a way to continue our journey said the ork nursing tenderly the claw which had been burned just below us is a great lake of black water which looked so cold and wicked that it made me shudder but away at the left theres a big tunnel which we can easily walk through i dont know where it leads to of course but we must follow it and find out why we cant get to it protested the little girl we cant fly as you do you must remember  no thats true replied the ork musingly your bodies are built very poorly it seems to me since all you can do is crawl upon the earths surface but you may ride upon my back and in that way i can promise you a safe journey to the tunnel  are you strong enough to carry us asked capn bill doubtfully  yes indeed im strong enough to carry a dozen of you if you could find a place to sit was the reply but theres only room between my wings for one at a time so ill have to make two trips  all right ill go first decided capn bill  he lit another candle for trot to hold while they were gone and to light the ork on his return to her and then the old sailor got upon the orks back where he sat with his wooden leg sticking straight out sidewise  if you start to fall clasp your arms around my neck advised the creature  if i start to fall its good night an pleasant dreams said capn bill  all ready asked the ork  start the buzztail said capn bill with a tremble in his voice but the ork flew away so gently that the old man never even tottered in his seat trot watched the light of capn bills candle till it disappeared in the far distance she didnt like to be left alone on this dangerous ledge with a lake of black water hundreds of feet below her but she was a brave little girl and waited patiently for the return of the ork it came even sooner than she had expected and the creature said to her  your friend is safe in the tunnel now then get aboard and ill carry you to him in a jiffy  im sure not many little girls would have cared to take that awful ride through the huge black cavern on the back of a skinny ork trot didnt care for it herself but it just had to be done and so she did it as courageously as possible her heart beat fast and she was so nervous she could scarcely hold the candle in her fingers as the ork sped swiftly through the darkness  it seemed like a long ride to her yet in reality the ork covered the distance in a wonderfully brief period of time and soon trot stood safely beside capn bill on the level floor of a big arched tunnel the sailorman was very glad to greet his little comrade again and both were grateful to the ork for his assistance  i dunno where this tunnel leads to remarked capn bill but it surely looks more promisin than that other hole we crept through  when the ork is rested said trot well travel on and see what happens  rested cried the ork as scornfully as his shrill voice would allow that bit of flying didnt tire me at all im used to flying days at a time without ever once stopping  then lets move on proposed capn bill he still held in his hand one lighted candle so trot blew out the other flame and placed her candle in the sailors big pocket she knew it was not wise to burn two candles at once  the tunnel was straight and smooth and very easy to walk through so they made good progress trot thought that the tunnel began about two miles from the cavern where they had been cast by the whirlpool but now it was impossible to guess the miles traveled for they walked steadily for hours and hours without any change in their surroundings  finally capn bill stopped to rest  theres somethin queer about this ere tunnel im certain he declared wagging his head dolefully heres three candles gone aready an only three more left us yet the tunnels the same as it was when we started an how long its goin to keep up no one knows  couldnt we walk without a light asked trot the way seems safe enough  it does right now was the reply but we cant tell when we are likely to come to another gulf or somethin jes as dangerous in that case wed be killed afore we knew it  suppose i go ahead suggested the ork  i dont fear a fall you know and if anything happens ill call out and warn you  thats a good idea declared trot and capn bill thought so too so the ork started off ahead quite in the dark and hand in band the two followed him  when they had walked in this way for a good long time the ork halted and demanded food capn bill had not mentioned food because there was so little leftonly three biscuits and a lump of cheese about as big as his two fingersbut he gave the ork half of a biscuit sighing as he did so the creature didnt care for the cheese so the sailor divided it between himself and trot they lighted a candle and sat down in the tunnel while they ate  my feet hurt me grumbled the ork  im not used to walking and this rocky passage is so uneven and lumpy that it hurts me to walk upon it  cant you fly along asked trot  no the roof is too low said the ork  after the meal they resumed their journey which trot began to fear would never end when capn bill noticed how tired the little girl was he paused and lighted a match and looked at his big silver watch  why its night he exclaimed weve tramped all day an still were in this awful passage which mebbe goes straight through the middle of the world an mebbe is a circlein which case we can keep walkin till doomsday not knowin whats before us so well as we know whats behind us i propose we make a stop now an try to sleep till mornin  that will suit me asserted the ork with a groan my feet are hurting me dreadfully and for the last few miles ive been limping with pain  my foot hurts too said the sailor looking for a smooth place on the rocky floor to sit down  your foot cried the ork why youve only one to hurt you while i have four so i suffer four times as much as you possibly can here hold the candle while i look at the bottoms of my claws i declare he said examining them by the flickering light there are bunches of pain all over them  praps said trot who was very glad to sit down beside her companions youve got corns  corns nonsense orks never have corns protested the creature rubbing its sore feet tenderly  then mebbe theyretheyre what do you call em capn bill something bout the pilgrims progress you know  bunions said capn bill  oh yes mebbe youve got bunions  it is possible moaned the ork  but whatever they are another day of such walking on them would drive me crazy  im sure theyll feel better by mornin said capn bill encouragingly go to sleep an try to forget your sore feet  the ork cast a reproachful look at the sailorman who didnt see it then the creature asked plaintively do we eat now or do we starve  theres only half a biscuit left for you answered capn bill no one knows how long well have to stay in this dark tunnel where theres nothing whatever to eat so i advise you to save that morsel o food till later  give it me now demanded the ork if im going to starve ill do it all at oncenot by degrees  capn bill produced the biscuit and the creature ate it in a trice trot was rather hungry and whispered to capn bill that shed take part of her share but the old man secretly broke his own halfbiscuit in two saving trots share for a time of greater need  he was beginning to be worried over the little girls plight and long after she was asleep and the ork was snoring in a rather disagreeable manner capn bill sat with his back to a rock and smoked his pipe and tried to think of some way to escape from this seemingly endless tunnel but after a time he also slept for hobbling on a wooden leg all day was tiresome and there in the dark slumbered the three adventurers for many hours until the ork roused itself and kicked the old sailor with one foot  it must be another day said he     chapter four  daylight at last   capn bill rubbed his eyes lit a match and consulted his watch  nine oclock  yes i guess its another day sure enough shall we go on he asked  of course replied the ork unless this tunnel is different from everything else in the world and has no end well find a way out of it sooner or later  the sailor gently wakened trot she felt much rested by her long sleep and sprang to her feet eagerly  lets start capn was all she said  they resumed the journey and had only taken a few steps when the ork cried wow and made a great fluttering of its wings and whirling of its tail the others who were following a short distance behind stopped abruptly  whats the matter asked capn bill  give us a light was the reply i think weve come to the end of the tunnel then while capn bill lighted a candle the creature added if that is true we neednt have wakened so soon for we were almost at the end of this place when we went to sleep  the sailorman and trot came forward with a light a wall of rock really faced the tunnel but now they saw that the opening made a sharp turn to the left so they followed on by a narrower passage and then made another sharp turn this time to the right  blow out the light capn said the ork in a pleased voice weve struck daylight  daylight at last a shaft of mellow light fell almost at their feet as trot and the sailor turned the corner of the passage but it came from above and raising their eyes they found they were at the bottom of a deep rocky well with the top far far above their heads and here the passage ended  for a while they gazed in silence at least two of them being filled with dismay at the sight but the ork merely whistled softly and said cheerfully  that was the toughest journey i ever had the misfortune to undertake and im glad its over yet unless i can manage to fly to the top of this pit we are entombed here forever  do you think there is room enough for you to fly in asked the little girl anxiously and capn bill added  its a straightup shaft so i dont see how youll ever manage it  were i an ordinary birdone of those horrid feathered thingsi wouldnt even make the attempt to fly out said the ork  but my mechanical propeller tail can accomplish wonders and whenever youre ready ill show you a trick that is worth while  oh exclaimed trot do you intend to take us up too  why not  i thought said capn bill as youd go first an then send somebody to help us by lettin down a rope  ropes are dangerous replied the ork and i might not be able to find one to reach all this distance besides it stands to reason that if i can get out myself i can also carry you two with me  well im not afraid said trot who longed to be on the earths surface again  spose we fall suggested capn bill doubtfully  why in that case we would all fall together returned the ork get aboard little girl sit across my shoulders and put both your arms around my neck  trot obeyed and when she was seated on the ork capn bill inquired  how bout me mr ork  why i think youd best grab hold of my rear legs and let me carry you up in that manner was the reply  capn bill looked way up at the top of the well and then he looked at the orks slender skinny legs and heaved a deep sigh  its goin to be some dangle i guess but if you dont waste too much time on the way up i may be able to hang on said he  all ready then cried the ork and at once his whirling tail began to revolve trot felt herself rising into the air when the creatures legs left the ground capn bill grasped two of them firmly and held on for dear life  the orks body was tipped straight upward and trot had to embrace the neck very tightly to keep from sliding off even in this position the ork had trouble in escaping the rough sides of the well several times it exclaimed wow as it bumped its back or a wing hit against some jagged projection but the tail kept whirling with remarkable swiftness and the daylight grew brighter and brighter it was indeed a long journey from the bottom to the top yet almost before trot realized they had come so far they popped out of the hole into the clear air and sunshine and a moment later the ork alighted gently upon the ground  the release was so sudden that even with the creatures care for its passengers capn bill struck the earth with a shock that sent him rolling heel over head but by the time trot had slid down from her seat the old sailorman was sitting up and looking around him with much satisfaction  its sort o pretty here said he  earth is a beautiful place cried trot  i wonder where on earth we are pondered the ork turning first one bright eye and then the other to this side and that trees there were in plenty and shrubs and flowers and green turf but there were no houses there were no paths there was no sign of civilization whatever  just before i settled down on the ground i thought i caught a view of the ocean said the ork lets see if i was right then he flew to a little hill near by and trot and capn bill followed him more slowly when they stood on the top of the hill they could see the blue waves of the ocean in front of them to the right of them and at the left of them behind the hill was a forest that shut out the view  i hope it aint an island trot said capn bill gravely  if it is i spose were prisoners she replied  ezzackly so trot  but even so its better than those terrble underground tunnels and caverns declared the girl  you are right little one agreed the ork anything above ground is better than the best that lies under ground so lets not quarrel with our fate but be thankful weve escaped  we are indeed she replied but i wonder if we can find something to eat in this place  lets explore an find out proposed capn bill those trees over at the left look like cherrytrees  on the way to them the explorers had to walk through a tangle of vines and capn bill who went first stumbled and pitched forward on his face  why its a melon cried trot delightedly as she saw what had caused the sailor to fall  capn bill rose to his foot for he was not at all hurt and examined the melon then he took his big jackknife from his pocket and cut the melon open it was quite ripe and looked delicious but the old man tasted it before he permitted trot to eat any deciding it was good he gave her a big slice and then offered the ork some the creature looked at the fruit somewhat disdainfully at first but once he had tasted its flavor he ate of it as heartily as did the others among the vines they discovered many other melons and trot said gratefully well theres no danger of our starving even if this is an island  melons remarked capn bill are both food an water we couldnt have struck anything better  farther on they came to the cherry trees where they obtained some of the fruit and at the edge of the little forest were wild plums the forest itself consisted entirely of nut treeswalnuts filberts almonds and chestnutsso there would be plenty of wholesome food for them while they remained there  capn bill and trot decided to walk through the forest to discover what was on the other side of it but the orks feet were still so sore and lumpy from walking on the rocks that the creature said he preferred to fly over the treetops and meet them on the other side the forest was not large so by walking briskly for fifteen minutes they reached its farthest edge and saw before them the shore of the ocean  its an island all right said trot with a sigh  yes and a pretty island too said capn bill trying to conceal his disappointment on trots account i guess partner if the wuss comes to the wuss i could build a raftor even a boatfrom those trees sos we could sail away in it  the little girl brightened at this suggestion i dont see the ork anywhere she remarked looking around then her eyes lighted upon something and she exclaimed oh capn bill isnt that a house over there to the left  capn bill looking closely saw a shedlike structure built at one edge of the forest  seems like it trot not that id call it much of a house but its a buildin all right lets go over an see if its occypied     chapter five  the little old man of the island   a few steps brought them to the shed which was merely a roof of boughs built over a square space with some branches of trees fastened to the sides to keep off the wind the front was quite open and faced the sea and as our friends came nearer they observed a little man with a long pointed beard sitting motionless on a stool and staring thoughtfully out over the water  get out of the way please he called in a fretful voice cant you see you are obstructing my view  good morning said capn bill politely  it isnt a good morning snapped the little man ive seen plenty of mornings better than this  do you call it a good morning when im pestered with such a crowd as you  trot was astonished to hear such words from a stranger whom they had greeted quite properly and capn bill grew red at the little mans rudeness but the sailor said in a quiet tone of voice  are you the only one as lives on this ere island  your grammars bad was the reply but this is my own exclusive island and ill thank you to get off it as soon as possible  wed like to do that said trot and then she and capn bill turned away and walked down to the shore to see if any other land was in sight  the little man rose and followed them although both were now too provoked to pay any attention to him  nothin in sight partner reported capn bill shading his eyes with his hand so well have to stay here for a time anyhow it isnt a bad place trot by any means  thats all you know about it broke in the little man the trees are altogether too green and the rocks are harder than they ought to be i find the sand very grainy and the water dreadfully wet every breeze makes a draught and the sun shines in the daytime when theres no need of it and disappears just as soon as it begins to get dark if you remain here youll find the island very unsatisfactory  trot turned to look at him and her sweet face was grave and curious  i wonder who you are she said  my name is pessim said he with an air of pride im called the observer  oh what do you observe asked the little girl  everything i see was the reply in a more surly tone then pessim drew back with a startled exclamation and looked at some footprints in the sand why good gracious me he cried in distress  whats the matter now asked capn bill  someone has pushed the earth in  dont you see it  it isnt pushed in far enough to hurt anything said trot examining the footprints  everything hurts that isnt right insisted the man if the earth were pushed in a mile it would be a great calamity wouldnt it  i spose so admitted the little girl  well here it is pushed in a full inch  thats a twelfth of a foot or a little more than a millionth part of a mile  therefore it is onemillionth part of a calamityoh dear how dreadful said pessim in a wailing voice  try to forget it sir advised capn bill soothingly its beginning to rain lets get under your shed and keep dry  raining  is it really raining asked pessim beginning to weep  it is answered capn bill as the drops began to descend and i dont see any way to stop italthough im some observer myself  no we cant stop it i fear said the man are you very busy just now  i wont be after i get to the shed replied the sailorman  then do me a favor please begged pessim walking briskly along behind them for they were hastening to the shed  depends on what it is said capn bill  i wish you would take my umbrella down to the shore and hold it over the poor fishes till it stops raining im afraid theyll get wet said pessim  trot laughed but capn bill thought the little man was poking fun at him and so he scowled upon pessim in a way that showed he was angry  they reached the shed before getting very wet although the rain was now coming down in big drops the roof of the shed protected them and while they stood watching the rainstorm something buzzed in and circled around pessims head at once the observer began beating it away with his hands crying out  a bumblebee a bumblebee the queerest bumblebee i ever saw  capn bill and trot both looked at it and the little girl said in surprise  dear me its a wee little ork  thats what it is sure enough exclaimed capn bill  really it wasnt much bigger than a big bumblebee and when it came toward trot she allowed it to alight on her shoulder  its me all right said a very small voice in her ear but im in an awful pickle just the same  what are you our ork then demanded the girl much amazed  no im my own ork but im the only ork you know replied the tiny creature  whats happened to you asked the sailor putting his head close to trots shoulder in order to hear the reply better pessim also put his head close and the ork said  you will remember that when i left you i started to fly over the trees and just as i got to this side of the forest i saw a bush that was loaded down with the most luscious fruit you can imagine  the fruit was about the size of a gooseberry and of a lovely lavender color so i swooped down and picked off one in my bill and ate it at once i began to grow small i could feel myself shrinking shrinking away and it frightened me terribly so that i lighted on the ground to think over what was happening in a few seconds i had shrunk to the size you now see me but there i remained getting no smaller indeed but no larger it is certainly a dreadful affliction after i had recovered somewhat from the shock i began to search for you it is not so easy to find ones way when a creature is so small but fortunately i spied you here in this shed and came to you at once  capn bill and trot were much astonished at this story and felt grieved for the poor ork but the little man pessim seemed to think it a good joke he began laughing when he heard the story and laughed until he choked after which he lay down on the ground and rolled and laughed again while the tears of merriment coursed down his wrinkled cheeks  oh dear oh dear he finally gasped sitting up and wiping his eyes this is too rich its almost too joyful to be true  i dont see anything funny about it remarked trot indignantly  you would if youd had my experience said pessim getting upon his feet and gradually resuming his solemn and dissatisfied expression of countenance the same thing happened to me  oh did it  and how did you happen to come to this island asked the girl  i didnt come the neighbors brought me replied the little man with a frown at the recollection they said i was quarrelsome and faultfinding and blamed me because i told them all the things that went wrong or never were right and because i told them how things ought to be so they brought me here and left me all alone saying that if i quarreled with myself no one else would be made unhappy absurd wasnt it  seems to me said capn bill those neighbors did the proper thing  well resumed pessim when i found myself king of this island i was obliged to live upon fruits and i found many fruits growing here that i had never seen before i tasted several and found them good and wholesome but one day i ate a lavender berryas the ork didand immediately i grew so small that i was scarcely two inches high it was a very unpleasant condition and like the ork i became frightened i could not walk very well nor very far for every lump of earth in my way seemed a mountain every blade of grass a tree and every grain of sand a rocky boulder for several days i stumbled around in an agony of fear once a tree toad nearly gobbled me up and if i ran out from the shelter of the bushes the gulls and cormorants swooped down upon me finally i decided to eat another berry and become nothing at all since life to one as small as i was had become a dreary nightmare  at last i found a small tree that i thought bore the same fruit as that i had eaten the berry was dark purple instead of light lavender but otherwise it was quite similar being unable to climb the tree i was obliged to wait underneath it until a sharp breeze arose and shook the limbs so that a berry fell instantly i seized it and taking a last view of the worldas i then thoughti ate the berry in a twinkling then to my surprise i began to grow big again until i became of my former stature and so i have since remained needless to say i have never eaten again of the lavender fruit nor do any of the beasts or birds that live upon this island eat it  they had all three listened eagerly to this amazing tale and when it was finished the ork exclaimed  do you think then that the deep purple berry is the antidote for the lavender one  im sure of it answered pessim  then lead me to the tree at once begged the ork for this tiny form i now have terrifies me greatly  pessim examined the ork closely  you are ugly enough as you are said he were you any larger you might be dangerous  oh no trot assured him the ork has been our good friend please take us to the tree  then pessim consented although rather reluctantly he led them to the right which was the east side of the island and in a few minutes brought them near to the edge of the grove which faced the shore of the ocean here stood a small tree bearing berries of a deep purple color the fruit looked very enticing and capn bill reached up and selected one that seemed especially plump and ripe  the ork had remained perched upon trots shoulder but now it flew down to the ground it was so difficult for capn bill to kneel down with his wooden leg that the little girl took the berry from him and held it close to the orks head  its too big to go into my mouth said the little creature looking at the fruit sidewise  youll have to make sevral mouthfuls of it i guess said trot and that is what the ork did he pecked at the soft ripe fruit with his bill and ate it up very quickly because it was good  even before he had finished the berry they could see the ork begin to grow in a few minutes he had regained his natural size and was strutting before them quite delighted with his transformation  well well what do you think of me now he asked proudly  you are very skinny and remarkably ugly declared pessim  you are a poor judge of orks was the reply anyone can see that im much handsomer than those dreadful things called birds which are all fluff and feathers  their feathers make soft beds asserted pessim and my skin would make excellent drumheads retorted the ork nevertheless a plucked bird or a skinned ork would be of no value to himself so we neednt brag of our usefulness after we are dead but for the sake of argument friend pessim id like to know what good you would be were you not alive  never mind that said capn bill he isnt much good as he is  i am king of this island allow me to say and youre intruding on my property declared the little man scowling upon them if you dont like meand im sure you dont for no one else doeswhy dont you go away and leave me to myself  well the ork can fly but we cant explained trot in answer we dont want to stay here a bit but i dont see how we can get away  you can go back into the hole you came from  capn bill shook his head trot shuddered at the thought the ork laughed aloud  you may be king here the creature said to pessim but we intend to run this island to suit ourselves for we are three and you are one and the balance of power lies with us  the little man made no reply to this although as they walked back to the shed his face wore its fiercest scowl capn bill gathered a lot of leaves and assisted by trot prepared two nice beds in opposite corners of the shed pessim slept in a hammock which he swung between two trees  they required no dishes as all their food consisted of fruits and nuts picked from the trees they made no fire for the weather was warm and there was nothing to cook the shed had no furniture other than the rude stool which the little man was accustomed to sit upon he called it his throne and they let him keep it  so they lived upon the island for three days and rested and ate to their hearts content still they were not at all happy in this life because of pessim he continually found fault with them and all that they did and all their surroundings he could see nothing good or admirable in all the world and trot soon came to understand why the little mans former neighbors had brought him to this island and left him there all alone so he could not annoy anyone it was their misfortune that they had been led to this place by their adventures for often they would have preferred the company of a wild beast to that of pessim  on the fourth day a happy thought came to the ork they had all been racking their brains for a possible way to leave the island and discussing this or that method without finding a plan that was practical capn bill had said he could make a raft of the trees big enough to float them all but he had no tools except those two pocketknives and it was not possible to chop down tree with such small blades  and spose we got afloat on the ocean said trot where would we drift to and how long would it take us to get there  capn bill was forced to admit he didnt know the ork could fly away from the island any time it wished to but the queer creature was loyal to his new friends and refused to leave them in such a lonely forsaken place  it was when trot urged him to go on this fourth morning that the ork had his happy thought  i will go said he if you two will agree to ride upon my back  we are too heavy you might drop us objected capn bill  yes you are rather heavy for a long journey acknowledged the ork but you might eat of those lavender berries and become so small that i could carry you with ease  this quaint suggestion startled trot and she looked gravely at the speaker while she considered it but capn bill gave a scornful snort and asked  what would become of us afterward we wouldnt be much good if we were some two or three inches high no mr ork id rather stay here as i am than be a hopomythumb somewhere else  why couldnt you take some of the dark purple berries along with you to eat after we had reached our destination inquired the ork then you could grow big again whenever you pleased  trot clapped her hands with delight  thats it she exclaimed lets do it capn bill  the old sailor did not like the idea at first but he thought it over carefully and the more he thought the better it seemed  how could you manage to carry us if we were so small he asked  i could put you in a paper bag and tie the bag around my neck  but we havent a paper bag objected trot  the ork looked at her  theres your sunbonnet it said presently which is hollow in the middle and has two strings that you could tie around my neck  trot took off her sunbonnet and regarded it critically yes it might easily hold both her and capn bill after they had eaten the lavender berries and been reduced in size she tied the strings around the orks neck and the sunbonnet made a bag in which two tiny people might ride without danger of falling out so she said  i blieve well do it that way capn  capn bill groaned but could make no logical objection except that the plan seemed to him quite dangerousand dangerous in more ways than one  i think so myself said trot soberly but nobody can stay alive without getting into danger sometimes and danger doesnt mean getting hurt capn it only means we might get hurt so i guess well have to take the risk  lets go and find the berries said the ork  they said nothing to pessim who was sitting on his stool and scowling dismally as he stared at the ocean but started at once to seek the trees that bore the magic fruits the ork remembered very well where the lavender berries grew and led his companions quickly to the spot  capn bill gathered two berries and placed them carefully in his pocket then they went around to the east side of the island and found the tree that bore the dark purple berries  i guess ill take four of these said the sailorman so in case one doesnt make us grow big we can eat another  better take six advised the ork its well to be on the safe side and im sure these trees grow nowhere else in all the world  so capn bill gathered six of the purple berries and with their precious fruit they returned to the shed to big goodbye to pessim perhaps they would not have granted the surly little man this courtesy had they not wished to use him to tie the sunbonnet around the orks neck  when pessim learned they were about to leave him he at first looked greatly pleased but he suddenly recollected that nothing ought to please him and so began to grumble about being left alone  we knew it wouldnt suit you remarked capn bill it didnt suit you to have us here and it wont suit you to have us go away  that is quite true admitted pessim i havent been suited since i can remember so it doesnt matter to me in the least whether you go or stay  he was interested in their experiment however and willingly agreed to assist although he prophesied they would fall out of the sunbonnet on their way and be either drowned in the ocean or crushed upon some rocky shore this uncheerful prospect did not daunt trot but it made capn bill quite nervous  i will eat my berry first said trot as she placed her sunbonnet on the ground in such manner that they could get into it  then she ate the lavender berry and in a few seconds became so small that capn bill picked her up gently with his thumb and one finger and placed her in the middle of the sunbonnet then he placed beside her the six purple berrieseach one being about as big as the tiny trots headand all preparations being now made the old sailor ate his lavender berry and became very smallwooden leg and all  capn bill stumbled sadly in trying to climb over the edge of the sunbonnet and pitched in beside trot headfirst which caused the unhappy pessim to laugh with glee then the king of the island picked up the sunbonnetso rudely that he shook its occupants like peas in a podand tied it by means of its strings securely around the orks neck  i hope trot you sewed those strings on tight said capn bill anxiously  why we are not very heavy you know she replied so i think the stitches will hold but be careful and not crush the berries capn  one is jammed already he said looking at them  all ready asked the ork  yes they cried together and pessim came close to the sunbonnet and called out to them youll be smashed or drowned im sure you will but farewell and good riddance to you  the ork was provoked by this unkind speech so he turned his tail toward the little man and made it revolve so fast that the rush of air tumbled pessim over backward and he rolled several times upon the ground before he could stop himself and sit up by that time the ork was high in the air and speeding swiftly over the ocean     chapter six  the flight of the midgets   capn bill and trot rode very comfortably in the sunbonnet  the motion was quite steady for they weighed so little that the ork flew without effort yet they were both somewhat nervous about their future fate and could not help wishing they were safe on land and their natural size again  youre terrble small trot remarked capn bill looking at his companion  same to you capn she said with a laugh but as long as we have the purple berries we neednt worry about our size  in a circus mused the old man wed be curiosities but in a sunbonnethigh up in the airsailin over a big unknown oceanthey aint no word in any booktionary to describe us  why were midgets thats all said the little girl the ork flew silently for a long time the slight swaying of the sunbonnet made capn bill drowsy and he began to doze trot however was wide awake and after enduring the monotonous journey as long as she was able she called out  dont you see land anywhere mr ork  not yet he answered this is a big ocean and ive no idea in which direction the nearest land to that island lies but if i keep flying in a straight line im sure to reach some place some time  that seemed reasonable so the little people in the sunbonnet remained as patient as possible that is capn bill dozed and trot tried to remember her geography lessons so she could figure out what land they were likely to arrive at  for hours and hours the ork flew steadily keeping to the straight line and searching with his eyes the horizon of the ocean for land capn bill was fast asleep and snoring and trot had laid her head on his shoulder to rest it when suddenly the ork exclaimed  there ive caught a glimpse of land at last  at this announcement they roused themselves capn bill stood up and tried to peek over the edge of the sunbonnet  what does it look like he inquired  looks like another island said the ork but i can judge it better in a minute or two  i dont care much for islands since we visited that other one declared trot  soon the ork made another announcement  it is surely an island and a little one too said he but i wont stop because i see a much bigger land straight ahead of it  thats right approved capn bill the bigger the land the better it will suit us  its almost a continent continued the ork after a brief silence during which he did not decrease the speed of his flight i wonder if it can be orkland the place i have been seeking so long  i hope not whispered trot to capn billso softly that the ork could not hear herfor i shouldnt like to be in a country where only orks live this one ork isnt a bad companion but a lot of him wouldnt be much fun  after a few more minutes of flying the ork called out in a sad voice  no this is not my country its a place i have never seen before although i have wandered far and wide it seems to be all mountains and deserts and green valleys and queer cities and lakes and riversmixed up in a very puzzling way  most countries are like that commented capn bill are you going to land  pretty soon was the reply there is a mountain peak just ahead of me what do you say to our landing on that  all right agreed the sailorman for both he and trot were getting tired of riding in the sunbonnet and longed to set foot on solid ground again  so in a few minutes the ork slowed down his speed and then came to a stop so easily that they were scarcely jarred at all then the creature squatted down until the sunbonnet rested on the ground and began trying to unfasten with its claws the knotted strings  this proved a very clumsy task because the strings were tied at the back of the orks neck just where his claws would not easily reach after much fumbling he said  im afraid i cant let you out and there is no one near to help me  this was at first discouraging but after a little thought capn bill said  if you dont mind trot i can cut a slit in your sunbonnet with my knife  do she replied the slit wont matter cause i can sew it up again afterward when i am big  so capn bill got out his knife which was just as small in proportion as he was and after considerable trouble managed to cut a long slit in the sunbonnet first he squeezed through the opening himself and then helped trot to get out  when they stood on firm ground again their first act was to begin eating the dark purple berries which they had brought with them two of these trot had guarded carefully during the long journey by holding them in her lap for their safety meant much to the tiny people  im not very hungry said the little girl as she handed a berry to capn bill but hunger doesnt count in this case its like taking medicine to make you well so we must manage to eat em somehow or other  but the berries proved quite pleasant to taste and as capn bill and trot nibbled at their edges their forms began to grow in sizeslowly but steadily the bigger they grew the easier it was for them to eat the berries which of course became smaller to them and by the time the fruit was eaten our friends had regained their natural size  the little girl was greatly relieved when she found herself as large as she had ever been and capn bill shared her satisfaction for although they had seen the effect of the berries on the ork they had not been sure the magic fruit would have the same effect on human beings or that the magic would work in any other country than that in which the berries grew  what shall we do with the other four berries asked trot as she picked up her sunbonnet marveling that she had ever been small enough to ride in it theyre no good to us now are they capn  im not sure as to that he replied if they were eaten by one who had never eaten the lavender berries they might have no effect at all but then contrarywise they might one of em has got badly jammed so ill throw it away but the other three i blieve ill carry with me theyre magic things you know and may come handy to us some time  he now searched in his big pockets and drew out a small wooden box with a sliding cover  the sailor had kept an assortment of nails of various sizes in this box but those he now dumped loosely into his pocket and in the box placed the three sound purple berries  when this important matter was attended to they found time to look about them and see what sort of place the ork had landed them in     chapter seven  the bumpy man   the mountain on which they had alighted was not a barren waste but had on its sides patches of green grass some bushes a few slender trees and here and there masses of tumbled rocks the sides of the slope seemed rather steep but with care one could climb up or down them with ease and safety the view from where they now stood showed pleasant valleys and fertile hills lying below the heights trot thought she saw some houses of queer shapes scattered about the lower landscape and there were moving dots that might be people or animals yet were too far away for her to see them clearly  not far from the place where they stood was the top of the mountain which seemed to be flat so the ork proposed to his companions that he would fly up and see what was there  thats a good idea said trot cause its getting toward evening and well have to find a place to sleep  the ork had not been gone more than a few minutes when they saw him appear on the edge of the top which was nearest them  come on up he called  so trot and capn bill began to ascend the steep slope and it did not take them long to reach the place where the ork awaited them  their first view of the mountain top pleased them very much it was a level space of wider extent than they had guessed and upon it grew grass of a brilliant green color in the very center stood a house built of stone and very neatly constructed no one was in sight but smoke was coming from the chimney so with one accord all three began walking toward the house  i wonder said trot in what country we are and if its very far from my home in california  cant say as to that partner answered capn bill but im mighty certain weve come a long way since we struck that whirlpool  yes she agreed with a sigh it must be miles and miles  distance means nothing said the ork i have flown pretty much all over the world trying to find my home and it is astonishing how many little countries there are hidden away in the cracks and corners of this big globe of earth if one travels he may find some new country at every turn and a good many of them have never yet been put upon the maps  praps this is one of them suggested trot  they reached the house after a brisk walk and capn bill knocked upon the door it was at once opened by a rugged looking man who had bumps all over him as trot afterward declared there were bumps on his head bumps on his body and bumps on his arms and legs and hands even his fingers had bumps on the ends of them for dress he wore an old gray suit of fantastic design which fitted him very badly because of the bumps it covered but could not conceal  but the bumpy mans eyes were kind and twinkling in expression and as soon as he saw his visitors he bowed low and said in a rather bumpy voice  happy day  come in and shut the door for it grows cool when the sun goes down winter is now upon us  why it isnt cold a bit outside said trot so it cant be winter yet  you will change your mind about that in a little while declared the bumpy man my bumps always tell me the state of the weather and they feel just now as if a snowstorm was coming this way but make yourselves at home strangers supper is nearly ready and there is food enough for all  inside the house there was but one large room simply but comfortably furnished it had benches a table and a fireplace all made of stone on the hearth a pot was bubbling and steaming and trot thought it had a rather nice smell the visitors seated themselves upon the benchesexcept the ork which squatted by the fireplaceand the bumpy man began stirring the kettle briskly  may i ask what country this is sir inquired capn bill  goodness mefruitcake and applesaucedont you know where you are asked the bumpy man as he stopped stirring and looked at the speaker in surprise  no admitted capn bill weve just arrived  lost your way questioned the bumpy man  not exactly said capn bill we didnt have any way to lose  ah said the bumpy man nodding his bumpy head this he announced in a solemn impressive voice is the famous land of mo  oh exclaimed the sailor and the girl both in one breath but never having heard of the land of mo they were no wiser than before  i thought that would startle you remarked the bumpy man well pleased as he resumed his stirring the ork watched him a while in silence and then asked  who may you be  me answered the bumpy man havent you heard of me gingerbread and lemonjuice im known far and wide as the mountain ear  they all received this information in silence at first for they were trying to think what he could mean finally trot mustered up courage to ask  what is a mountain ear please  for answer the man turned around and faced them waving the spoon with which he had been stirring the kettle as he recited the following verses in a singsong tone of voice    heres a mountain hard of hearing   thats sadhearted and needs cheering   so my duty is to listen to all sounds that nature makes   so the hill wont get uneasy   get to coughing or get sneezy   for this monster bump when frightened is quite liable to quakes    you can hear a bell thats ringing   i can feel some peoples singing   but a mountain isnt sensible of what goes on and so   when i hear a blizzard blowing   or its raining hard or snowing   i tell it to the mountain and the mountain seems to know    thus i benefit all people   while im living on this steeple   for i keep the mountain steady so my neighbors all may thrive   with my listning and my shouting   i prevent this mount from spouting   and that makes me so important that im glad that im alive   when he had finished these lines of verse the bumpy man turned again to resume his stirring the ork laughed softly and capn bill whistled to himself and trot made up her mind that the mountain ear must be a little crazy but the bumpy man seemed satisfied that he had explained his position fully and presently he placed four stone plates upon the table and then lifted the kettle from the fire and poured some of its contents on each of the plates capn bill and trot at once approached the table for they were hungry but when she examined her plate the little girl exclaimed  why its molasses candy  to be sure returned the bumpy man with a pleasant smile eat it quick while its hot for it cools very quickly this winter weather  with this he seized a stone spoon and began putting the hot molasses candy into his mouth while the others watched him in astonishment  doesnt it burn you asked the girl  no indeed said he why dont you eat arent you hungry  yes she replied i am hungry but we usually eat our candy when it is cold and hard we always pull molasses candy before we eat it  ha ha ha laughed the mountain ear what a funny idea where in the world did you come from  california she said  california pooh there isnt any such place ive heard of every place in the land of mo but i never before heard of california  it isnt in the land of mo she explained  then it isnt worth talking about declared the bumpy man helping himself again from the steaming kettle for he had been eating all the time he talked  for my part sighed capn bill id like a decent square meal once more just by way of variety in the last place there was nothing but fruit to eat and here its worse for theres nothing but candy  molasses candy isnt so bad said trot mines nearly cool enough to pull already wait a bit capn and you can eat it  a little later she was able to gather the candy from the stone plate and begin to work it back and forth with her hands the mountain ear was greatly amazed at this and watched her closely it was really good candy and pulled beautifully so that trot was soon ready to cut it into chunks for eating  capn bill condescended to eat one or two pieces and the ork ate several but the bumpy man refused to try it trot finished the plate of candy herself and then asked for a drink of water  water said the mountain ear wonderingly what is that  something to drink dont you have water in mo  none that ever i heard of said he but i can give you some fresh lemonade i caught it in a jar the last time it rained which was only day before yesterday  oh does it rain lemonade here she inquired  always and it is very refreshing and healthful  with this he brought from a cupboard a stone jar and a dipper and the girl found it very nice lemonade indeed capn bill liked it too but the ork would not touch it  if there is no water in this country i cannot stay here for long the creature declared water means life to man and beast and bird  there must be water in lemonade said trot  yes answered the ork i suppose so but there are other things in it too and they spoil the good water  the days adventures had made our wanderers tired so the bumpy man brought them some blankets in which they rolled themselves and then lay down before the fire which their host kept alive with fuel all through the night trot wakened several times and found the mountain ear always alert and listening intently for the slightest sound but the little girl could hear no sound at all except the snores of capn bill     chapter eight  buttonbright is lost and found again   wake upwake up called the voice of the bumpy man didnt i tell you winter was coming i could hear it coming with my left ear and the proof is that it is now snowing hard outside  is it said trot rubbing her eyes and creeping out of her blanket where i live in california i have never seen snow except far away on the tops of high mountains  well this is the top of a high mountain returned the bumpy one and for that reason we get our heaviest snowfalls right here  the little girl went to  the window and looked out the air was filled with falling white flakes so large in size and so queer in form that she was puzzled  are you certain this is snow she asked  to be sure i must get my snowshovel and turn out to shovel a path would you like to come with me  yes she said and followed the bumpy man out when he opened the door then she exclaimed why it isnt cold a bit  of course not replied the man it was cold last night before the snowstorm but snow when it falls is always crisp and warm  trot gathered a handful of it  why its popcorn she cried  certainly all snow is popcorn what did you expect it to be  popcorn is not snow in my country  well it is the only snow we have in the land of mo so you may as well make the best of it said he a little impatiently im not responsible for the absurd things that happen in your country and when youre in mo you must do as the momen do eat some of our snow and you will find it is good the only fault i find with our snow is that we get too much of it at times  with this the bumpy man set to work shoveling a path and he was so quick and industrious that he piled up the popcorn in great banks on either side of the trail that led to the mountaintop from the plains below while he worked trot ate popcorn and found it crisp and slightly warm as well as nicely salted and buttered presently capn bill came out of the house and joined her  whats this he asked  mo snow said she but it isnt real snow although it falls from the sky its popcorn  capn bill tasted it then he sat down in the path and began to eat the ork came out and pecked away with its bill as fast as it could they all liked popcorn and they all were hungry this morning  meantime the flakes of mo snow came down so fast that the number of them almost darkened the air the bumpy man was now shoveling quite a distance down the mountainside while the path behind him rapidly filled up with freshfallen popcorn suddenly trot heard him call out  goodness graciousmince pie and pancakeshere is some one buried in the snow  she ran toward him at once and the others followed wading through the corn and crunching it underneath their feet the mo snow was pretty deep where the bumpy man was shoveling and from beneath a great bank of it he had uncovered a pair of feet  dear me  someone has been lost in the storm said capn bill i hope he is still alive lets pull him out and see  he took hold of one foot and the bumpy man took hold of the other then they both pulled and out from the heap of popcorn came a little boy he was dressed in a brown velvet jacket and knickerbockers with brown stockings buckled shoes and a blue shirtwaist that had frills down its front when drawn from the heap the boy was chewing a mouthful of popcorn and both his hands were full of it so at first he couldnt speak to his rescuers but lay quite still and eyed them calmly until he had swallowed his mouthful then he said  get my cap and stuffed more popcorn into his mouth  while the bumpy man began shoveling into the cornbank to find the boys cap trot was laughing joyfully and capn bill had a broad grin on his face the ork looked from one to another and asked  who is this stranger  why its buttonbright of course answered trot if anyone ever finds a lost boy he can make up his mind its buttonbright but how he ever came to be lost in this faraway country is moren i can make out  where does he belong inquired the ork  his home used to be in philadelphia i think but im quite sure buttonbright doesnt belong anywhere  thats right said the boy nodding his head as he swallowed the second mouthful  everyone belongs somewhere remarked the ork  not me insisted buttonbright im half way round the world from philadelphia and ive lost my magic umbrella that used to carry me anywhere stands to reason that if i cant get back i havent any home but i dont care much this is a pretty good country trot ive had lots of fun here  by this time the mountain ear had secured the boys cap and was listening to the conversation with much interest  it seems you know this poor snowcovered castaway he said  yes indeed answered trot  we made a journey together to sky island once and were good friends  well then im glad i saved his life said the bumpy man  much obliged mr knobs said buttonbright sitting up and staring at him but i dont believe youve saved anything except some popcorn that i might have eaten had you not disturbed me it was nice and warm in that bank of popcorn and there was plenty to eat what made you dig me out and what makes you so bumpy everywhere  as for the bumps replied the man looking at himself with much pride i was born with them and i suspect they were a gift from the fairies they make me look rugged and big like the mountain i serve  all right said buttonbright and began eating popcorn again  it had stopped snowing now and great flocks of birds were gathering around the mountainside eating the popcorn with much eagerness and scarcely noticing the people at all there were birds of every size and color most of them having gorgeous feathers and plumes  just look at them exclaimed the ork scornfully arent they dreadful creatures all covered with feathers  i think theyre beautiful said trot and this made the ork so indignant that he went back into the house and sulked  buttonbright reached out his hand and caught a big bird by the leg at once it rose into the air and it was so strong that it nearly carried the little boy with it he let go the leg in a hurry and the bird flew down again and began to eat of the popcorn not being frightened in the least  this gave capn bill an idea he felt in his pocket and drew out several pieces of stout string moving very quietly so as to not alarm the birds he crept up to several of the biggest ones and tied cords around their legs thus making them prisoners  the birds were so intent on their eating that they did not notice what had happened to them and when about twenty had been captured in this manner capn bill tied the ends of all the strings together and fastened them to a huge stone so they could not escape  the bumpy man watched the old sailors actions with much curiosity  the birds will be quiet until theyve eaten up all the snow he said but then they will want to fly away to their homes tell me sir what will the poor things do when they find they cant fly  it may worry em a little replied capn bill but theyre not going to be hurt if they take it easy and behave themselves  our friends had all made a good breakfast of the delicious popcorn and now they walked toward the house again buttonbright walked beside trot and held her hand in his because they were old friends and he liked the little girl very much the boy was not so old as trot and small as she was he was half a head shorter in height the most remarkable thing about buttonbright was that he was always quiet and composed whatever happened and nothing was ever able to astonish him trot liked him because he was not rude and never tried to plague her capn bill liked him because he had found the boy cheerful and brave at all times and willing to do anything he was asked to do  when they came to the house trot sniffed the air and asked dont i smell perfume  i think you do said the bumpy man you smell violets and that proves there is a breeze springing up from the south all our winds and breezes are perfumed and for that reason we are glad to have them blow in our direction the south breeze always has a violet odor the north breeze has the fragrance of wild roses the east breeze is perfumed with liliesofthevalley and the west wind with lilac blossoms so we need no weathervane to tell us which way the wind is blowing we have only to smell the perfume and it informs us at once  inside the house they found the ork and buttonbright regarded the strange birdlike creature with curious interest after examining it closely for a time he asked  which way does your tail whirl  either way said the ork  buttonbright put out his hand and tried to spin it  dont do that exclaimed the ork  why not inquired the boy  because it happens to be my tail and i reserve the right to whirl it myself explained the ork  lets go out and fly somewhere proposed buttonbright i want to see how the tail works  not now said the ork i appreciate your interest in me which i fully deserve but i only fly when i am going somewhere and if i got started i might not stop  that reminds me remarked capn bill to ask you friend ork how we are going to get away from here  get away exclaimed the bumpy man why dont you stay here you wont find any nicer place than mo  have you been anywhere else sir  no i cant say that i have admitted the mountain ear  then permit me to say youre no judge declared capn bill but you havent answered my question friend ork how are we to get away from this mountain  the ork reflected a while before he answered  i might carry one of youthe boy or the girlupon my back said he but three big people are more than i can manage although i have carried two of you for a short distance you ought not to have eaten those purple berries so soon  praps we did make a mistake capn bill acknowledged  or we might have brought some of those lavender berries with us instead of so many purple ones suggested trot regretfully  capn bill made no reply to this statement which showed he did not fully agree with the little girl but he fell into deep thought with wrinkled brows and finally he said  if those purple berries would make anything grow bigger whether itd eaten the lavender ones or not i could find a way out of our troubles  they did not understand this speech and looked at the old sailor as if expecting him to explain what he meant but just then a chorus of shrill cries rose from outside  here let me golet me go the voices seemed to say why are we insulted in this way mountain ear come and help us  trot ran to the window and looked out  its the birds you caught capn she said i didnt know they could talk  oh yes all the birds in mo are educated to talk said the bumpy man then he looked at capn bill uneasily and added wont you let the poor things go  ill see replied the sailor and walked out to where the birds were fluttering and complaining because the strings would not allow them to fly away  listen to me he cried and at once they became still we three people who are strangers in your land want to go to some other country and we want three of you birds to carry us there we know we are asking a great favor but its the only way we can think ofexcep walkin an im not much good at that because ive a wooden leg besides trot an buttonbright are too small to undertake a long and tiresome journey now tell me which three of you birds will consent to carry us  the birds looked at one another as if greatly astonished then one of them replied you must be crazy old man not one of us is big enough to fly with even the smallest of your party  ill fix the matter of size promised capn bill if three of you will agree to carry us ill make you big an strong enough to do it so it wont worry you a bit  the birds considered this gravely  living in a magic country they had no doubt but that the strange onelegged man could do what he said after a little one of them asked  if you make us big would we stay big always  i think so replied capn bill  they chattered a while among themselves and then the bird that had first spoken said ill go for one  so will i said another and after a pause a third said ill go too  perhaps more would have volunteered for it seemed that for some reason they all longed to be bigger than they were but three were enough for capn bills purpose and so he promptly released all the others who immediately flew away  the three that remained were cousins and all were of the same brilliant plumage and in size about as large as eagles when trot questioned them she found they were quite young having only abandoned their nests a few weeks before they were strong young birds with clear brave eyes and the little girl decided they were the most beautiful of all the feathered creatures she had ever seen  capn bill now took from his pocket the wooden box with the sliding cover and removed the three purple berries which were still in good condition  eat these he said and gave one to each of the birds they obeyed finding the fruit very pleasant to taste in a few seconds they began to grow in size and grew so fast that trot feared they would never stop but they finally did stop growing and then they were much larger than the ork and nearly the size of fullgrown ostriches  capn bill was much pleased by this result  you can carry us now all right said he  the birds strutted around with pride highly pleased with their immense size  i dont see though said trot doubtfully how were going to ride on their backs without falling off  were not going to ride on their backs answered capn bill im going to make swings for us to ride in  he then asked the bumpy man for some rope but the man had no rope he had however an old suit of gray clothes which he gladly presented to capn bill who cut the cloth into strips and twisted it so that it was almost as strong as rope with this material he attached to each bird a swing that dangled below its feet and buttonbright made a trial flight in one of them to prove that it was safe and comfortable when all this had been arranged one of the birds asked  where do you wish us to take you  why just follow the ork said capn bill he will be our leader and wherever the ork flies you are to fly and wherever the ork lands you are to land is that satisfactory  the birds declared it was quite satisfactory so capn bill took counsel with the ork  on our way here said that peculiar creature i noticed a broad sandy desert at the left of me on which was no living thing  then wed better keep away from it replied the sailor  not so insisted the ork i have found on my travels that the most pleasant countries often lie in the midst of deserts so i think it would be wise for us to fly over this desert and discover what lies beyond it for in the direction we came from lies the ocean as we well know and beyond here is this strange land of mo which we do not care to explore on one side as we can see from this mountain is a broad expanse of plain and on the other the desert  for my part i vote for the desert  what do you say trot inquired capn bill  its all the same to me she replied  no one thought of asking buttonbrights opinion so it was decided to fly over the desert they bade goodbye to the bumpy man and thanked him for his kindness and hospitality then they seated themselves in the swingsone for each birdand told the ork to start away and they would follow  the whirl of the orks tail astonished the birds at first but after he had gone a short distance they rose in the air carrying their passengers easily and flew with strong regular strokes of their great wings in the wake of their leader     chapter nine  the kingdom of jinxland   trot rode with more comfort than she had expected although the swing swayed so much that she had to hold on tight with both hands capn bills bird followed the ork and trot came next with buttonbright trailing behind her it was quite an imposing procession but unfortunately there was no one to see it for the ork had headed straight for the great sandy desert and in a few minutes after starting they were flying high over the broad waste where no living thing could exist  the little girl thought this would be a bad place for the birds to lose strength or for the cloth ropes to give way but although she could not help feeling a trifle nervous and fidgety she had confidence in the huge and brilliantly plumaged bird that bore her as well as in capn bills knowledge of how to twist and fasten a rope so it would hold  that was a remarkably big desert there was nothing to relieve the monotony of view and every minute seemed an hour and every hour a day disagreeable fumes and gases rose from the sands which would have been deadly to the travelers had they not been so high in the air as it was trot was beginning to feel sick when a breath of fresher air filled her nostrils and on looking ahead she saw a great cloud of pinktinted mist even while she wondered what it could be the ork plunged boldly into the mist and the other birds followed she could see nothing for a time nor could the bird which carried her see where the ork had gone but it kept flying as sturdily as ever and in a few moments the mist was passed and the girl saw a most beautiful landscape spread out below her extending as far as her eye could reach  she saw bits of forest verdure clothed hills fields of waving grain fountains rivers and lakes and throughout the scene were scattered groups of pretty houses and a few grand castles and palaces  over all this delightful landscapewhich from trots high perch seemed like a magnificent painted picturewas a rosy glow such as we sometimes see in the west at sunset in this case however it was not in the west only but everywhere  no wonder the ork paused to circle slowly over this lovely country the other birds followed his action all eyeing the place with equal delight then as with one accord the four formed a group and slowly sailed downward this brought them to that part of the newlydiscovered land which bordered on the deserts edge but it was just as pretty here as anywhere so the ork and the birds alighted and the three passengers at once got out of their swings  oh capn bill isnt this fine an dandy exclaimed trot rapturously how lucky we were to discover this beautiful country  the country seems rather high class ill admit trot replied the old sailorman looking around him but we dont know as yet what its people are like  no one could live in such a country without being happy and goodim sure of that she said earnestly dont you think so buttonbright  im not thinking just now answered the little boy it tires me to think and i never seem to gain anything by it when we see the people who live here we will know what they are like and no mount of thinking will make them any different  thats true enough said the ork but now i want to make a proposal while you are getting acquainted with this new country which looks as if it contains everything to make one happy i would like to fly alongall by myselfand see if i can find my home on the other side of the great desert if i do i will stay there of course but if i fail to find orkland i will return to you in a week to see if i can do anything more to assist you  they were sorry to lose their queer companion but could offer no objection to the plan so the ork bade them goodbye and rising swiftly in the air he flew over the country and was soon lost to view in the distance  the three birds which had carried our friends now begged permission to return by the way they had come to their own homes saying they were anxious to show their families how big they had become so capn bill and trot and buttonbright all thanked them gratefully for their assistance and soon the birds began their long flight toward the land of mo being now left to themselves in this strange land the three comrades selected a pretty pathway and began walking along it they believed this path would lead them to a splendid castle which they espied in the distance the turrets of which towered far above the tops of the trees which surrounded it it did not seem very far away so they sauntered on slowly admiring the beautiful ferns and flowers that lined the pathway and listening to the singing of the birds and the soft chirping of the grasshoppers  presently the path wound over a little hill in a valley that lay beyond the hill was a tiny cottage surrounded by flower beds and fruit trees on the shady porch of the cottage they saw as they approached a pleasant faced woman sitting amidst a group of children to whom she was telling stories the children quickly discovered the strangers and ran toward them with exclamations of astonishment so that trot and her friends became the center of a curious group all chattering excitedly capn bills wooden leg seemed to arouse the wonder of the children as they could not understand why he had not two meat legs this attention seemed to please the old sailor who patted the heads of the children kindly and then raising his hat to the woman he inquired  can you tell us madam just what country this is  she stared hard at all three of the strangers as she replied briefly jinxland  oh exclaimed capn bill with a puzzled look and where is jinxland please  in the quadling country said she  what cried trot in sudden excitement do you mean to say this is the quadling country of the land of oz  to be sure i do the woman answered every bit of land that is surrounded by the great desert is the land of oz as you ought to know as well as i do but im sorry to say that jinxland is separated from the rest of the quadling country by that row of high mountains you see yonder which have such steep sides that no one can cross them so we live here all by ourselves and are ruled by our own king instead of by ozma of oz  ive been to the land of oz before said buttonbright but ive never been here  did you ever hear of jinxland before asked trot  no said buttonbright  it is on the map of oz though asserted the woman and its a fine country i assure you if only she added and then paused to look around her with a frightened expression if only here she stopped again as if not daring to go on with her speech  if only what maam asked capn bill  the woman sent the children into the house then she came closer to the strangers and whispered if only we had a different king we would be very happy and contented  whats the matter with your king asked trot curiously but the woman seemed frightened to have said so much she retreated to her porch merely saying  the king punishes severely any treason on the part of his subjects  whats treason asked buttonbright  in this case replied capn bill treason seems to consist of knockin the king but i guess we know his disposition now as well as if the lady had said more  i wonder said trot going up to the woman if you could spare us something to eat we havent had anything but popcorn and lemonade for a long time  bless your heart of course i can spare you some food the woman answered and entering her cottage she soon returned with a tray loaded with sandwiches cakes and cheese one of the children drew a bucket of clear cold water from a spring and the three wanderers ate heartily and enjoyed the good things immensely  when buttonbright could eat no more he filled the pockets of his jacket with cakes and cheese and not even the children objected to this indeed they all seemed pleased to see the strangers eat so capn bill decided that no matter what the king of jinxland was like the people would prove friendly and hospitable  whose castle is that yonder maam he asked waving his hand toward the towers that rose above the trees  it belongs to his majesty king krewl she said  oh indeed and does he live there  when he is not out hunting with his fierce courtiers and war captains she replied  is he hunting now trot inquired  i do not know my dear the less we know about the kings actions the safer we are  it was evident the woman did not like to talk about king krewl and so having finished their meal they said goodbye and continued along the pathway  dont you think wed better keep away from that kings castle capn asked trot  well said he king krewl would find out sooner or later that we are in his country so we may as well face the music now perhaps he isnt quite so bad as that woman thinks he is kings arent always popular with their people you know even if they do the best they know how  ozma is poplar said buttonbright  ozma is diffrent from any other ruler from all ive heard remarked trot musingly as she walked beside the boy and after all we are really in the land of oz where ozma rules evry king and evrybody else i never heard of anybody getting hurt in her dominions did you buttonbright  not when she knows about it he replied but those birds landed us in just the wrong place seems to me they might have carried us right on over that row of mountains to the emrald city  true enough said capn bill but they didnt an so we must make the best of jinxland lets try not to be afraid  oh im not very scared said buttonbright pausing to look at a pink rabbit that popped its head out of a hole in the field near by  nor am i added trot really capn im so glad to be anywhere at all in the wonderful fairyland of oz that i think im the luckiest girl in all the world dorothy lives in the emrald city you know and so does the scarecrow and the tin woodman and tiktok and the shaggy manand all the rest of em that weve heard so much aboutnot to mention ozma who must be the sweetest and loveliest girl in all the world  take your time trot advised buttonbright you dont have to say it all in one breath you know and you havent mentioned half of the curious people in the emrald city  that ere emrald city said capn bill impressively happens to be on the other side o those mountains that were told no one is able to cross i dont want to discourage of you trot but were amost as much separated from your ozma an dorothy as we were when we lived in californy  there was so much truth in this statement that they all walked on in silence for some time finally they reached the grove of stately trees that bordered the grounds of the kings castle they had gone halfway through it when the sound of sobbing as of someone in bitter distress reached their ears and caused them to halt abruptly     chapter ten  pon the gardeners boy   it was buttonbright who first discovered lying on his face beneath a broad spreading tree near the pathway a young man whose body shook with the force of his sobs he was dressed in a long brown smock and had sandals on his feet betokening one in humble life his head was bare and showed a shock of brown curly hair buttonbright looked down on the young man and said  who cares anyhow  i do cried the young man interrupting his sobs to roll over face upward that he might see who had spoken i care for my heart is broken  cant you get another one asked the little boy  i dont want another wailed the young man  by this time trot and capn bill arrived at the spot and the girl leaned over and said in a sympathetic voice  tell us your troubles and perhaps we may help you  the youth sat up then and bowed politely afterward he got upon his feet but still kept wringing his hands as he tried to choke down his sobs trot thought he was very brave to control such awful agony so well  my name is pon he began im the gardeners boy  then the gardener of the king is your father i suppose said trot  not my father but my master was the reply  i do the work and the gardener gives the orders and it was not my fault in the least that the princess gloria fell in love with me  did she really asked the little girl  i dont see why remarked buttonbright staring at the youth  and who may the princess gloria be inquired capn bill  she is the niece of king krewl who is her guardian the princess lives in the castle and is the loveliest and sweetest maiden in all jinxland she is fond of flowers and used to walk in the gardens with her attendants at such times if i was working at my tasks i used to cast down my eyes as gloria passed me but one day i glanced up and found her gazing at me with a very tender look in her eyes the next day she dismissed her attendants and coming to my side began to talk with me she said i had touched her heart as no other young man had ever done i kissed her hand just then the king came around a bend in the walk he struck me with his fist and kicked me with his foot then he seized the arm of the princess and rudely dragged her into the castle  wasnt he awful gasped trot indignantly  he is a very abrupt king said pon so it was the least i could expect up to that time i had not thought of loving princess gloria but realizing it would be impolite not to return her love i did so we met at evening now and then and she told me the king wanted her to marry a rich courtier named googlygoo who is old enough to be glorias father she has refused googlygoo thirtynine times but he still persists and has brought many rich presents to bribe the king on that account king krewl has commanded his niece to marry the old man but the princess has assured me time and again that she will wed only me this morning we happened to meet in the grape arbor and as i was respectfully saluting the cheek of the princess two of the kings guards seized me and beat me terribly before the very eyes of gloria whom the king himself held back so she could not interfere  why this king must be a monster cried trot  he is far worse than that said pon mournfully  but see here interrupted capn bill who had listened carefully to pon this king may not be so much to blame after all kings are proud folks because theyre so high an mighty an it isnt reasonable for a royal princess to marry a common gardeners boy  it isnt right declared buttonbright a princess should marry a prince  im not a common gardeners boy protested pon if i had my rights i would be the king instead of krewl as it is im a prince and as royal as any man in jinxland  how does that come asked capn bill  my father used to be the king and krewl was his prime minister but one day while out hunting king phearsethat was my fathers namehad a quarrel with krewl and tapped him gently on the nose with the knuckles of his closed hand this so provoked the wicked krewl that he tripped my father backward so that he fell into a deep pond at once krewl threw in a mass of heavy stones which so weighted down my poor father that his body could not rise again to the surface it is impossible to kill anyone in this land as perhaps you know but when my father was pressed down into the mud at the bottom of the deep pool and the stones held him so he could never escape he was of no more use to himself or the world than if he had died knowing this krewl proclaimed himself king taking possession of the royal castle and driving all my fathers people out i was a small boy then but when i grew up i became a gardener i have served king krewl without his knowing that i am the son of the same king phearse whom he so cruelly made away with  my but thats a terrbly exciting story said trot drawing a long breath but tell us pon who was glorias father  oh he was the king before my father replied pon father was prime minister for king kynd who was glorias father she was only a baby when king kynd fell into the great gulf that lies just this side of the mountainsthe same mountains that separate jinxland from the rest of the land of oz it is said the great gulf has no bottom but however that may be king kynd has never been seen again and my father became king in his place  seems to me said trot that if gloria had her rights she would be queen of jinxland  well her father was a king admitted pon and so was my father so we are of equal rank although shes a great lady and im a humble gardeners boy i cant see why we should not marry if we want to except that king krewl wont let us  its a sort of mixedup mess taken altogether remarked capn bill but we are on our way to visit king krewl and if we get a chance young man well put in a good word for you  do please begged pon  was it the flogging you got that broke your heart inquired buttonbright  why it helped to break it of course said pon  id get it fixed up if i were you advised the boy tossing a pebble at a chipmunk in a tree you ought to give gloria just as good a heart as she gives you  thats common sense agreed capn bill so they left the gardeners boy standing beside the path and resumed their journey toward the castle     chapter eleven  the wicked king and googlygoo   when our friends approached the great doorway of the castle they found it guarded by several soldiers dressed in splendid uniforms they were armed with swords and lances capn bill walked straight up to them and asked  does the king happen to be at home  his magnificent and glorious majesty king krewl is at present inhabiting his royal castle was the stiff reply  then i guess well go in an say howdyedo continued capn bill attempting to enter the doorway but a soldier barred his way with a lance  who are you what are your names and where do you come from demanded the soldier  you wouldnt know if we told you returned the sailor seein as were strangers in a strange land  oh if you are strangers you will be permitted to enter said the soldier lowering his lance his majesty is very fond of strangers  do many strangers come here asked trot  you are the first that ever came to our country said the man but his majesty has often said that if strangers ever arrived in jinxland he would see that they had a very exciting time  capn bill scratched his chin thoughtfully he wasnt very favorably impressed by this last remark but he decided that as there was no way of escape from jinxland it would be wise to confront the king boldly and try to win his favor so they entered the castle escorted by one of the soldiers  it was certainly a fine castle with many large rooms all beautifully furnished the passages were winding and handsomely decorated and after following several of these the soldier led them into an open court that occupied the very center of the huge building it was surrounded on every side by high turreted walls and contained beds of flowers fountains and walks of many colored marbles which were matched together in quaint designs in an open space near the middle of the court they saw a group of courtiers and their ladies who surrounded a lean man who wore upon his head a jeweled crown his face was hard and sullen and through the slits of his halfclosed eyelids the eyes glowed like coals of fire he was dressed in brilliant satins and velvets and was seated in a golden thronechair  this personage was king krewl and as soon as capn bill saw him the old sailor knew at once that he was not going to like the king of jinxland  hello whos here said his majesty with a deep scowl  strangers sire answered the soldier bowing so low that his forehead touched the marble tiles  strangers eh well well what an unexpected visit advance strangers and give an account of yourselves  the kings voice was as harsh as his features trot shuddered a little but capn bill calmly replied  there aint much for us to say cept as weve arrived to look over your country an see how we like it judgin from the way you speak you dont know who we are or youd be jumpin up to shake hands an offer us seats kings usually treat us pretty well in the great big outside world where we come from but in this little kingdomwhich dont amount to much anyhowfolks dont seem to a got much culchure  the king listened with amazement to this bold speech first with a frown and then gazing at the two children and the old sailor with evident curiosity the courtiers were dumb with fear for no one had ever dared speak in such a manner to their selfwilled cruel king before his majesty however was somewhat frightened for cruel people are always cowards and he feared these mysterious strangers might possess magic powers that would destroy him unless he treated them well so he commanded his people to give the new arrivals seats and they obeyed with trembling haste  after being seated capn bill lighted his pipe and began puffing smoke from it a sight so strange to them that it filled them all with wonder presently the king asked  how did you penetrate to this hidden country did you cross the desert or the mountains  desert answered capn bill as if the task were too easy to be worth talking about  indeed no one has ever been able to do that before said the king  well its easy enough if you know how asserted capn bill so carelessly that it greatly impressed his hearers the king shifted in his throne uneasily he was more afraid of these strangers than before  do you intend to stay long in jinxland was his next anxious question  depends on how we like it said capn bill just now i might suggest to your majesty to order some rooms got ready for us in your dinky little castle here and a royal banquet with some fried onions an pickled tripe would set easy on our stomicks an make us a bit happier than we are now  your wishes shall be attended to said king krewl but his eyes flashed from between their slits in a wicked way that made trot hope the food wouldnt be poisoned at the kings command several of his attendants hastened away to give the proper orders to the castle servants and no sooner were they gone than a skinny old man entered the courtyard and bowed before the king  this disagreeable person was dressed in rich velvets with many furbelows and laces he was covered with golden chains finely wrought rings and jeweled ornaments he walked with mincing steps and glared at all the courtiers as if he considered himself far superior to any or all of them  well well your majesty what newswhat news he demanded in a shrill cracked voice  the king gave him a surly look  no news lord googlygoo except that strangers have arrived he said  googlygoo cast a contemptuous glance at capn bill and a disdainful one at trot and buttonbright then he said  strangers do not interest me your majesty but the princess gloria is very interestingvery interesting indeed  what does she say sire will she marry me  ask her retorted the king  i have many times and every time she has refused  well said the king harshly  well said googlygoo in a jaunty tone a bird that can sing and wont sing must be made to sing  huh sneered the king thats easy with a bird but a girl is harder to manage  still persisted googlygoo we must overcome difficulties the chief trouble is that gloria fancies she loves that miserable gardeners boy pon suppose we throw pon into the great gulf your majesty  it would do you no good returned the king she would still love him  too bad too bad sighed googlygoo i have laid aside more than a bushel of precious gemseach worth a kings ransomto present to your majesty on the day i wed gloria  the kings eyes sparkled for he loved wealth above everything but the next moment he frowned deeply again  it wont help us to kill pon he muttered what we must do is kill glorias love for pon  that is better if you can find a way to do it agreed googlygoo everything would come right if you could kill glorias love for that gardeners boy really sire now that i come to think of it there must be fully a bushel and a half of those jewels  just then a messenger entered the court to say that the banquet was prepared for the strangers so capn bill trot and buttonbright entered the castle and were taken to a room where a fine feast was spread upon the table  i dont like that lord googlygoo remarked trot as she was busily eating  nor i said capn bill but from the talk we heard i guess the gardeners boy wont get the princess  perhaps not returned the girl but i hope old googly doesnt get her either  the king means to sell her for all those jewels observed buttonbright his mouth half full of cake and jam  poor princess sighed trot im sorry for her although ive never seen her but if she says no to googlygoo and means it what can they do  dont let us worry about a strange princess advised capn bill ive a notion were not too safe ourselves with this cruel king  the two children felt the same way and all three were rather solemn during the remainder of the meal  when they had eaten the servants escorted them to their rooms capn bills room was way to one end of the castle very high up and trots room was at the opposite end rather low down as for buttonbright they placed him in the middle so that all were as far apart as they could possibly be they didnt like this arrangement very well but all the rooms were handsomely furnished and being guests of the king they dared not complain  after the strangers had left the courtyard the king and googlygoo had a long talk together and the king said  i cannot force gloria to marry you just now because those strangers may interfere i suspect that the woodenlegged man possesses great magical powers or he would never have been able to carry himself and those children across the deadly desert  i dont like him he looks dangerous answered googlygoo but perhaps you are mistaken about his being a wizard why dont you test his powers  how asked the king  send for the wicked witch she will tell you in a moment whether that woodenlegged person is a common man or a magician  ha thats a good idea cried the king why didnt i think of the wicked witch before but the woman demands rich rewards for her services  never mind i will pay her promised the wealthy googlygoo  so a servant was dispatched to summon the wicked witch who lived but a few leagues from king krewls castle while they awaited her the withered old courtier proposed that they pay a visit to princess gloria and see if she was not now in a more complaisant mood so the two started away together and searched the castle over without finding gloria  at last googlygoo suggested she might be in the rear garden which was a large park filled with bushes and trees and surrounded by a high wall and what was their anger when they turned a corner of the path to find in a quiet nook the beautiful princess and kneeling before her pon the gardeners boy with a roar of rage the king dashed forward but pon had scaled the wall by means of a ladder which still stood in its place and when he saw the king coming he ran up the ladder and made good his escape but this left gloria confronted by her angry guardian the king and by old googlygoo who was trembling with a fury he could not express in words  seizing the princess by her arm the king dragged her back to the castle pushing her into a room on the lower floor he locked the door upon the unhappy girl and at that moment the arrival of the wicked witch was announced  hearing this the king smiled as a tiger smiles showing his teeth and googlygoo smiled as a serpent smiles for he had no teeth except a couple of fangs and having frightened each other with these smiles the two dreadful men went away to the royal council chamber to meet the wicked witch     chapter twelve  the woodenlegged grasshopper   now it so happened that trot from the window of her room had witnessed the meeting of the lovers in the garden and had seen the king come and drag gloria away the little girls heart went out in sympathy for the poor princess who seemed to her to be one of the sweetest and loveliest young ladies she had ever seen so she crept along the passages and from a hidden niche saw gloria locked in her room  the key was still in the lock so when the king had gone away followed by googlygoo trot stole up to the door turned the key and entered the princess lay prone upon a couch sobbing bitterly trot went up to her and smoothed her hair and tried to comfort her  dont cry she said ive unlocked the door so you can go away any time you want to  it isnt that sobbed the princess i am unhappy because they will not let me love pon the gardeners boy  well never mind pon isnt any great shakes anyhow seems to me said trot soothingly there are lots of other people you can love  gloria rolled over on the couch and looked at the little girl reproachfully  pon has won my heart and i cant help loving him she explained then with sudden indignation she added but ill never love googlygoonever as long as i live  i should say not replied trot pon may not be much good but old googly is very very bad hunt around and im sure youll find someone worth your love youre very pretty you know and almost anyone ought to love you  you dont understand my dear said gloria as she wiped the tears from her eyes with a dainty lace handkerchief bordered with pearls when you are older you will realize that a young lady cannot decide whom she will love or choose the most worthy her heart alone decides for her and whomsoever her heart selects she must love whether he amounts to much or not  trot was a little puzzled by this speech which seemed to her unreasonable but she made no reply and presently glorias grief softened and she began to question the little girl about herself and her adventures trot told her how they had happened to come to jinxland and all about capn bill and the ork and pessim and the bumpy man  while they were thus conversing together getting more and more friendly as they became better acquainted in the council chamber the king and googlygoo were talking with the wicked witch  this evil creature was old and ugly she had lost one eye and wore a black patch over it so the people of jinxland had named her blinkie of course witches are forbidden to exist in the land of oz but jinxland was so far removed from the center of ozmas dominions and so absolutely cut off from it by the steep mountains and the bottomless gulf that the laws of oz were not obeyed very well in that country so there were several witches in jinxland who were the terror of the people but king krewl favored them and permitted them to exercise their evil sorcery  blinkie was the leader of all the other witches and therefore the most hated and feared the king used her witchcraft at times to assist him in carrying out his cruelties and revenge but he was always obliged to pay blinkie large sums of money or heaps of precious jewels before she would undertake an enchantment this made him hate the old woman almost as much as his subjects did but today lord googlygoo had agreed to pay the witchs price so the king greeted her with gracious favor  can you destroy the love of princess gloria for the gardeners boy inquired his majesty  the wicked witch thought about it before she replied  thats a hard question to answer i can do lots of clever magic but love is a stubborn thing to conquer when you think youve killed it its liable to bob up again as strong as ever i believe love and cats have nine lives in other words killing love is a hard job even for a skillful witch but i believe i can do something that will answer your purpose just as well  what is that asked the king  i can freeze the girls heart ive got a special incantation for that and when glorias heart is thoroughly frozen she can no longer love pon  just the thing exclaimed googlygoo and the king was likewise much pleased  they bargained a long time as to the price but finally the old courtier agreed to pay the wicked witchs demands it was arranged that they should take gloria to blinkies house the next day to have her heart frozen  then king krewl mentioned to the old hag the strangers who had that day arrived in jinxland and said to her  i think the two childrenthe boy and the girlare unable to harm me but i have a suspicion that the woodenlegged man is a powerful wizard  the witchs face wore a troubled look when she heard this  if you are right she said this wizard might spoil my incantation and interfere with me in other ways so it will be best for me to meet this stranger at once and match my magic against his to decide which is the stronger  all right said the king come with me and i will lead you to the mans room  googlygoo did not accompany them as he was obliged to go home to get the money and jewels he had promised to pay old blinkie so the other two climbed several flights of stairs and went through many passages until they came to the room occupied by capn bill  the sailorman finding his bed soft and inviting and being tired with the adventures he had experienced had decided to take a nap when the wicked witch and the king softly opened his door and entered capn bill was snoring with such vigor that he did not hear them at all  blinkie approached the bed and with her one eye anxiously stared at the sleeping stranger  ah she said in a soft whisper i believe you are right king krewl the man looks to me like a very powerful wizard but by good luck i have caught him asleep so i shall transform him before he wakes up giving him such a form that he will be unable to oppose me  careful cautioned the king also speaking low if he discovers what you are doing he may destroy you and that would annoy me because i need you to attend to gloria  but the wicked witch realized as well as he did that she must be careful she carried over her arm a black bag from which she now drew several packets carefully wrapped in paper three of these she selected replacing the others in the bag two of the packets she mixed together and then she cautiously opened the third  better stand back your majesty she advised for if this powder falls on you you might be transformed yourself  the king hastily retreated to the end of the room as blinkie mixed the third powder with the others she waved her hands over it mumbled a few words and then backed away as quickly as she could  capn bill was slumbering peacefully all unconscious of what was going on puff a great cloud of smoke rolled over the bed and completely hid him from view when the smoke rolled away both blinkie and the king saw that the body of the stranger had quite disappeared while in his place crouching in the middle of the bed was a little gray grasshopper  one curious thing about this grasshopper was that the last joint of its left leg was made of wood another curious thingconsidering it was a grasshopperwas that it began talking crying out in a tiny but sharp voice  hereyou people what do you mean by treating me so put me back where i belong at once or youll be sorry  the cruel king turned pale at hearing the grasshoppers threats but the wicked witch merely laughed in derision then she raised her stick and aimed a vicious blow at the grasshopper but before the stick struck the bed the tiny hopper made a marvelous jumpmarvelous indeed when we consider that it had a wooden leg it rose in the air and sailed across the room and passed right through the open window where it disappeared from their view  good shouted the king we are well rid of this desperate wizard and then they both laughed heartily at the success of the incantation and went away to complete their horrid plans  after trot had visited a time with princess gloria the little girl went to buttonbrights room but did not find him there then she went to capn bills room but he was not there because the witch and the king had been there before her so she made her way downstairs and questioned the servants they said they had seen the little boy go out into the garden some time ago but the old man with the wooden leg they had not seen at all  therefore trot not knowing what else to do rambled through the great gardens seeking for buttonbright or capn bill and not finding either of them this part of the garden which lay before the castle was not walled in but extended to the roadway and the paths were open to the edge of the forest so after two hours of vain search for her friends the little girl returned to the castle  but at the doorway a soldier stopped her  i live here said trot so its all right to let me in the king has given me a room  well he has taken it back again was the soldiers reply his majestys orders are to turn you away if you attempt to enter i am also ordered to forbid the boy your companion to again enter the kings castle  how bout capn bill she inquired  why it seems he has mysteriously disappeared replied the soldier shaking his head ominously where he has gone to i cant make out but i can assure you he is no longer in this castle im sorry little girl to disappoint you dont blame me i must obey my masters orders  now all her life trot had been accustomed to depend on capn bill so when this good friend was suddenly taken from her she felt very miserable and forlorn indeed she was brave enough not to cry before the soldier or even to let him see her grief and anxiety but after she was turned away from the castle she sought a quiet bench in the garden and for a time sobbed as if her heart would break  it was buttonbright who found her at last just as the sun had set and the shades of evening were falling he also had been turned away from the kings castle when he tried to enter it and in the park he came across trot  never mind said the boy we can find a place to sleep  i want capn bill wailed the girl  well so do i was the reply but we havent got him where do you spose he is trot  i dont spose anything hes gone an thats all i know bout it  buttonbright sat on the bench beside her and thrust his hands in the pockets of his knickerbockers then he reflected somewhat gravely for him  capn bill isnt around here he said letting his eyes wander over the dim garden so we must go somewhere else if we want to find him besides its fast getting dark and if we want to find a place to sleep we must get busy while we can see where to go  he rose from the bench as he said this and trot also jumped up drying her eyes on her apron then she walked beside him out of the grounds of the kings castle they did not go by the main path but passed through an opening in a hedge and found themselves in a small but wellworn roadway following this for some distance along a winding way they came upon no house or building that would afford them refuge for the night it became so dark that they could scarcely see their way and finally trot stopped and suggested that they camp under a tree  all right said buttonbright ive often found that leaves make a good warm blanket butlook there trotisnt that a light flashing over yonder  it certainly is buttonbright lets go over and see if its a house whoever lives there couldnt treat us worse than the king did  to reach the light they had to leave the road so they stumbled over hillocks and brushwood hand in hand keeping the tiny speck of light always in sight  they were rather forlorn little waifs outcasts in a strange country and forsaken by their only friend and guardian capn bill so they were very glad when finally they reached a small cottage and looking in through its one window saw pon the gardeners boy sitting by a fire of twigs  as trot opened the door and walked boldly in pon sprang up to greet them they told him of capn bills disappearance and how they had been turned out of the kings castle as they finished the story pon shook his head sadly  king krewl is plotting mischief i fear said he for today he sent for old blinkie the wicked witch and with my own eyes i saw her come from the castle and hobble away toward her hut she had been with the king and googlygoo and i was afraid they were going to work some enchantment on gloria so she would no longer love me but perhaps the witch was only called to the castle to enchant your friend capn bill  could she do that asked trot horrified by the suggestion  i suppose so for old blinkie can do a lot of wicked magical things  what sort of an enchantment could she put on capn bill  i dont know but he has disappeared so im pretty certain she has done something dreadful to him but dont worry if it has happened it cant be helped and if it hasnt happened we may be able to find him in the morning  with this pon went to the cupboard and brought food for them trot was far too worried to eat but buttonbright made a good supper from the simple food and then lay down before the fire and went to sleep the little girl and the gardeners boy however sat for a long time staring into the fire busy with their thoughts but at last trot too became sleepy and pon gently covered her with the one blanket he possessed then he threw more wood on the fire and laid himself down before it next to buttonbright soon all three were fast asleep they were in a good deal of trouble but they were young and sleep was good to them because for a time it made them forget     chapter thirteen  glinda the good and the scarecrow of oz   that country south of the emerald city in the land of oz is known as the quadling country and in the very southernmost part of it stands a splendid palace in which lives glinda the good  glinda is the royal sorceress of oz she has wonderful magical powers and uses them only to benefit the subjects of ozmas kingdom even the famous wizard of oz pays tribute to her for glinda taught him all the real magic he knows and she is his superior in all sorts of sorcery everyone loves glinda from the dainty and exquisite ruler ozma down to the humblest inhabitant of oz for she is always kindly and helpful and willing to listen to their troubles however busy she may be no one knows her age but all can see how beautiful and stately she is her hair is like red gold and finer than the finest silken strands her eyes are blue as the sky and always frank and smiling her cheeks are the envy of peachblows and her mouth is enticing as a rosebud glinda is tall and wears splendid gowns that trail behind her as she walks she wears no jewels for her beauty would shame them  for attendants glinda has half a hundred of the loveliest girls in oz they are gathered from all over oz from among the winkies the munchkins the gillikins and the quadlings as well as from ozmas magnificent emerald city and it is considered a great favor to be allowed to serve the royal sorceress  among the many wonderful things in glindas palace is the great book of records in this book is inscribed everything that takes place in all the world just the instant it happens so that by referring to its pages glinda knows what is taking place far and near in every country that exists in this way she learns when and where she can help any in distress or danger and although her duties are confined to assisting those who inhabit the land of oz she is always interested in what takes place in the unprotected outside world  so it was that on a certain evening glinda sat in her library surrounded by a bevy of her maids who were engaged in spinning weaving and embroidery when an attendant announced the arrival at the palace of the scarecrow  this personage was one of the most famous and popular in all the land of oz his body was merely a suit of munchkin clothes stuffed with straw but his head was a round sack filled with bran with which the wizard of oz had mixed some magic brains of a very superior sort the eyes nose and mouth of the scarecrow were painted upon the front of the sack as were his ears and since this quaint being had been endowed with life the expression of his face was very interesting if somewhat comical  the scarecrow was good all through even to his brains and while he was naturally awkward in his movements and lacked the neat symmetry of other people his disposition was so kind and considerate and he was so obliging and honest that all who knew him loved him and there were few people in oz who had not met our scarecrow and made his acquaintance he lived part of the time in ozmas palace at the emerald city part of the time in his own corncob castle in the winkie country and part of the time he traveled over all oz visiting with the people and playing with the children whom he dearly loved  it was on one of his wandering journeys that the scarecrow had arrived at glindas palace and the sorceress at once made him welcome as he sat beside her talking of his adventures he asked  whats new in the way of news  glinda opened her great book of records and read some of the last pages  here is an item quite curious and interesting she announced an accent of surprise in her voice three people from the big outside world have arrived in jinxland  where is jinxland inquired the scarecrow  very near here a little to the east of us she said in fact jinxland is a little slice taken off the quadling country but separated from it by a range of high mountains at the foot of which lies a wide deep gulf that is supposed to be impassable  then jinxland is really a part of the land of oz said he  yes returned glinda but oz people know nothing of it except what is recorded here in my book  what does the book say about it asked the scarecrow  it is ruled by a wicked man called king krewl although he has no right to the title most of the people are good but they are very timid and live in constant fear of their fierce ruler there are also several wicked witches who keep the inhabitants of jinxland in a state of terror  do those witches have any magical powers inquired the scarecrow  yes they seem to understand witchcraft in its most evil form for one of them has just transformed a respectable and honest old sailorone of the strangers who arrived thereinto a grasshopper this same witch blinkie by name is also planning to freeze the heart of a beautiful jinxland girl named princess gloria  why thats a dreadful thing to do exclaimed the scarecrow  glindas face was very grave she read in her book how trot and buttonbright were turned out of the kings castle and how they found refuge in the hut of pon the gardeners boy  im afraid those helpless earth people will endure much suffering in jinxland even if the wicked king and the witches permit them to live said the good sorceress thoughtfully i wish i might help them  can i do anything asked the scarecrow anxiously if so tell me what to do and ill do it  for a few moments glinda did not reply but sat musing over the records then she said i am going to send you to jinxland to protect trot and buttonbright and capn bill  all right answered the scarecrow in a cheerful voice i know buttonbright already for he has been in the land of oz before you remember he went away from the land of oz in one of our wizards big bubbles  yes said glinda i remember that then she carefully instructed the scarecrow what to do and gave him certain magical things which he placed in the pockets of his ragged munchkin coat  as you have no need to sleep said she you may as well start at once  the night is the same as day to me he replied except that i cannot see my way so well in the dark  i will furnish a light to guide you promised the sorceress  so the scarecrow bade her goodbye and at once started on his journey by morning he had reached the mountains that separated the quadling country from jinxland the sides of these mountains were too steep to climb but the scarecrow took a small rope from his pocket and tossed one end upward into the air the rope unwound itself for hundreds of feet until it caught upon a peak of rock at the very top of a mountain for it was a magic rope furnished him by glinda the scarecrow climbed the rope and after pulling it up let it down on the other side of the mountain range when he descended the rope on this side he found himself in jinxland but at his feet yawned the great gulf which must be crossed before he could proceed any farther  the scarecrow knelt down and examined the ground carefully and in a moment he discovered a fuzzy brown spider that had rolled itself into a ball so he took two tiny pills from his pocket and laid them beside the spider which unrolled itself and quickly ate up the pills then the scarecrow said in a voice of command  spin and the spider obeyed instantly  in a few moments the little creature had spun two slender but strong strands that reached way across the gulf one being five or six feet above the other when these were completed the scarecrow started across the tiny bridge walking upon one strand as a person walks upon a rope and holding to the upper strand with his hands to prevent him from losing his balance and toppling over into the gulf the tiny threads held him safely thanks to the strength given them by the magic pills  presently he was safe across and standing on the plains of jinxland far away he could see the towers of the kings castle and toward this he at once began to walk     chapter fourteen  the frozen heart   in the hut of pon the gardeners boy buttonbright was the first to waken in the morning leaving his companions still asleep he went out into the fresh morning air and saw some blackberries growing on bushes in a field not far away going to the bushes he found the berries ripe and sweet so he began eating them more bushes were scattered over the fields so the boy wandered on from bush to bush without paying any heed to where he was wandering then a butterfly fluttered by he gave chase to it and followed it a long way when finally he paused to look around him buttonbright could see no sign of pons house nor had he the slightest idea in which direction it lay  well im lost again he remarked to himself but never mind ive been lost lots of times someone is sure to find me  trot was a little worried about buttonbright when she awoke and found him gone knowing how careless he was she believed that he had strayed away but felt that he would come back in time because he had a habit of not staying lost pon got the little girl some food for her breakfast and then together they went out of the hut and stood in the sunshine  pons house was some distance off the road but they could see it from where they stood and both gave a start of surprise when they discovered two soldiers walking along the roadway and escorting princess gloria between them the poor girl had her hands bound together to prevent her from struggling and the soldiers rudely dragged her forward when her steps seemed to lag  behind this group came king krewl wearing his jeweled crown and swinging in his hand a slender golden staff with a ball of clustered gems at one end  where are they going asked trot to the house of the wicked witch i fear pon replied come let us follow them for i am sure they intend to harm my dear gloria  wont they see us she asked timidly  we wont let them i know a short cut through the trees to blinkies house said he  so they hurried away through the trees and reached the house of the witch ahead of the king and his soldiers hiding themselves in the shrubbery they watched the approach of poor gloria and her escort all of whom passed so near to them that pon could have put out a hand and touched his sweetheart had he dared to  blinkies house had eight sides with a door and a window in each side smoke was coming out of the chimney and as the guards brought gloria to one of the doors it was opened by the old witch in person she chuckled with evil glee and rubbed her skinny hands together to show the delight with which she greeted her victim for blinkie was pleased to be able to perform her wicked rites on one so fair and sweet as the princess  gloria struggled to resist when they bade her enter the house so the soldiers forced her through the doorway and even the king gave her a shove as he followed close behind pon was so incensed at the cruelty shown gloria that he forgot all caution and rushed forward to enter the house also but one of the soldiers prevented him pushing the gardeners boy away with violence and slamming the door in his face  never mind said trot soothingly as pon rose from where he had fallen you couldnt do much to help the poor princess if you were inside how unfortunate it is that you are in love with her  true he answered sadly it is indeed my misfortune if i did not love her it would be none of my business what the king did to his niece gloria but the unlucky circumstance of my loving her makes it my duty to defend her  i dont see how you can duty or no duty observed trot  no i am powerless for they are stronger than i but we might peek in through the window and see what they are doing  trot was somewhat curious too so they crept up to one of the windows and looked in and it so happened that those inside the witchs house were so busy they did not notice that pon and trot were watching them  gloria had been tied to a stout post in the center of the room and the king was giving the wicked witch a quantity of money and jewels which googlygoo had provided in payment when this had been done the king said to her  are you perfectly sure you can freeze this maidens heart so that she will no longer love that low gardeners boy  sure as witchcraft your majesty the creature replied  then get to work said the king there may be some unpleasant features about the ceremony that would annoy me so ill bid you good day and leave you to carry out your contract one word however if you fail i shall burn you at the stake then he beckoned to his soldiers to follow him and throwing wide the door of the house walked out  this action was so sudden that king krewl almost caught trot and pon eavesdropping but they managed to run around the house before he saw them away he marched up the road followed by his men heartlessly leaving gloria to the mercies of old blinkie  when they again crept up to the window trot and pon saw blinkie gloating over her victim although nearly fainting from fear the proud princess gazed with haughty defiance into the face of the wicked creature but she was bound so tightly to the post that she could do no more to express her loathing  pretty soon blinkie went to a kettle that was swinging by a chain over the fire and tossed into it several magical compounds the kettle gave three flashes and at every flash another witch appeared in the room  these hags were very ugly but when oneeyed blinkie whispered her orders to them they grinned with joy as they began dancing around gloria first one and then another cast something into the kettle when to the astonishment of the watchers at the window all three of the old women were instantly transformed into maidens of exquisite beauty dressed in the daintiest costumes imaginable only their eyes could not be disguised and an evil glare still shone in their depths but if the eyes were cast down or hidden one could not help but admire these beautiful creatures even with the knowledge that they were mere illusions of witchcraft  trot certainly admired them for she had never seen anything so dainty and bewitching but her attention was quickly drawn to their deeds instead of their persons and then horror replaced admiration into the kettle old blinkie poured another mess from a big brass bottle she took from a chest and this made the kettle begin to bubble and smoke violently one by one the beautiful witches approached to stir the contents of the kettle and to mutter a magic charm their movements were graceful and rhythmic and the wicked witch who had called them to her aid watched them with an evil grin upon her wrinkled face  finally the incantation was complete the kettle ceased bubbling and together the witches lifted it from the fire then blinkie brought a wooden ladle and filled it from the contents of the kettle going with the spoon to princess gloria she cried  love no more magic art now will freeze your mortal heart  with this she dashed the contents of the ladle full upon glorias breast  trot saw the body of the princess become transparent so that her beating heart showed plainly but now the heart turned from a vivid red to gray and then to white a layer of frost formed about it and tiny icicles clung to its surface then slowly the body of the girl became visible again and the heart was hidden from view gloria seemed to have fainted but now she recovered and opening her beautiful eyes stared coldly and without emotion at the group of witches confronting her  blinkie and the others knew by that one cold look that their charm had been successful they burst into a chorus of wild laughter and the three beautiful ones began dancing again while blinkie unbound the princess and set her free  trot rubbed her eyes to prove that she was wide awake and seeing clearly for her astonishment was great when the three lovely maidens turned into ugly crooked hags again leaning on broomsticks and canes they jeered at gloria but the princess regarded them with cold disdain being now free she walked to a door opened it and passed out and the witches let her go  trot and pon had been so intent upon this scene that in their eagerness they had pressed quite hard against the window just as gloria went out of the house the windowsash broke loose from its fastenings and fell with a crash into the room the witches uttered a chorus of screams and then seeing that their magical incantation had been observed they rushed for the open window with uplifted broomsticks and canes but pon was off like the wind and trot followed at his heels fear lent them strength to run to leap across ditches to speed up the hills and to vault the low fences as a deer would  the band of witches had dashed through the window in pursuit but blinkie was so old and the others so crooked and awkward that they soon realized they would be unable to overtake the fugitives so the three who had been summoned by the wicked witch put their canes or broomsticks between their legs and flew away through the air quickly disappearing against the blue sky blinkie however was so enraged at pon and trot that she hobbled on in the direction they had taken fully determined to catch them in time and to punish them terribly for spying upon her witchcraft  when pon and trot had run so far that they were confident they had made good their escape they sat down near the edge of a forest to get their breath again for both were panting hard from their exertions trot was the first to recover speech and she said to her companion  my wasnt it terrble  the most terrible thing i ever saw pon agreed  and they froze glorias heart so now she cant love you any more  well they froze her heart to be sure admitted pon but im in hopes i can melt it with my love  where do you spose gloria is asked the girl after a pause  she left the witchs house just before we did perhaps she has gone back to the kings castle he said  im pretty sure she started off in a diffrent direction declared trot i looked over my shoulder as i ran to see how close the witches were and im sure i saw gloria walking slowly away toward the north  then let us circle around that way proposed pon and perhaps we shall meet her  trot agreed to this and they left the grove and began to circle around toward the north thus drawing nearer and nearer to old blinkies house again the wicked witch did not suspect this change of direction so when she came to the grove she passed through it and continued on  pon and trot had reached a place less than half a mile from the witchs house when they saw gloria walking toward them the princess moved with great dignity and with no show of haste whatever holding her head high and looking neither to right nor left  pon rushed forward holding out his arms as if to embrace her and calling her sweet names but gloria gazed upon him coldly and repelled him with a haughty gesture at this the poor gardeners boy sank upon his knees and hid his face in his arms weeping bitter tears but the princess was not at all moved by his distress passing him by she drew her skirts aside as if unwilling they should touch him and then she walked up the path a way and hesitated as if uncertain where to go next  trot was grieved by pons sobs and indignant because gloria treated him so badly but she remembered why  i guess your heart is frozen all right she said to the princess gloria nodded gravely in reply and then turned her back upon the little girl cant you like even me asked trot half pleadingly  no said gloria  your voice sounds like a refrigrator sighed the little girl im awful sorry for you cause you were sweet an nice to me before this happened you cant help it of course but its a dreadful thing jus the same  my heart is frozen to all mortal loves announced gloria calmly i do not love even myself  thats too bad said trot for if you cant love anybody you cant expect anybody to love you  i do cried pon i shall always love her  well youre just a gardeners boy replied trot and i didnt think you mounted to much from the first i can love the old princess gloria with a warm heart an nice manners but this one gives me the shivers  its her icy heart thats all said pon  thats enough insisted trot seeing her heart isnt big enough to skate on i cant see that shes of any use to anyone for my part im goin to try to find buttonbright an capn bill  i will go with you decided pon it is evident that gloria no longer loves me and that her heart is frozen too stiff for me to melt it with my own love therefore i may as well help you to find your friends  as trot started off pon cast one more imploring look at the princess who returned it with a chilly stare so he followed after the little girl  as for the princess she hesitated a moment and then turned in the same direction the others had taken but going far more slowly soon she heard footsteps pattering behind her and up came googlygoo a little out of breath with running  stop gloria he cried i have come to take you back to my mansion where we are to be married  she looked at him wonderingly a moment then tossed her head disdainfully and walked on but googlygoo kept beside her  what does this mean he demanded havent you discovered that you no longer love that gardeners boy who stood in my way  yes i have discovered it she replied my heart is frozen to all mortal loves i cannot love you or pon or the cruel king my uncle or even myself go your way googlygoo for i will wed no one at all  he stopped in dismay when he heard this but in another minute he exclaimed angrily  you must wed me princess gloria whether you want to or not i paid to have your heart frozen i also paid the king to permit our marriage if you now refuse me it will mean that i have been robbedrobbedrobbed of my precious money and jewels  he almost wept with despair but she laughed a cold bitter laugh and passed on googlygoo caught at her arm as if to restrain her but she whirled and dealt him a blow that sent him reeling into a ditch beside the path here he lay for a long time half covered by muddy water dazed with surprise  finally the old courtier arose dripping and climbed from the ditch the princess had gone so muttering threats of vengeance upon her upon the king and upon blinkie old googlygoo hobbled back to his mansion to have the mud removed from his costly velvet clothes     chapter fifteen  trot meets the scarecrow   trot and pon covered many leagues of ground searching through forests in fields and in many of the little villages of jinxland but could find no trace of either capn bill or buttonbright finally they paused beside a cornfield and sat upon a stile to rest pon took some apples from his pocket and gave one to trot then he began eating another himself for this was their time for luncheon when his apple was finished pon tossed the core into the field  tchuktchuk said a strange voice what do you mean by hitting me in the eye with an applecore  then rose up the form of the scarecrow who had hidden himself in the cornfield while he examined pon and trot and decided whether they were worthy to be helped  excuse me said pon i didnt know you were there  how did you happen to be there anyhow asked trot  the scarecrow came forward with awkward steps and stood beside them  ah you are the gardeners boy he said to pon then he turned to trot and you are the little girl who came to jinxland riding on a big bird and who has had the misfortune to lose her friend capn bill and her chum buttonbright  why how did you know all that she inquired  i know a lot of things replied the scarecrow winking at her comically my brains are the carefullyassorted doubledistilled highefficiency sort that the wizard of oz makes he admits himself that my brains are the best he ever manufactured  i think ive heard of you said trot slowly as she looked the scarecrow over with much interest but you used to live in the land of oz  oh i do now he replied cheerfully ive just come over the mountains from the quadling country to see if i can be of any help to you  who me asked pon  no the strangers from the big world it seems they need looking after  im doing that myself said pon a little ungraciously if you will pardon me for saying so i dont see how a scarecrow with painted eyes can look after anyone  if you dont see that you are more blind than the scarecrow asserted trot hes a fairy man pon and comes from the fairyland of oz so he can do most anything i hope she added turning to the scarecrow you can find capn bill for me  i will try anyhow he promised but who is that old woman who is running toward us and shaking her stick at us  trot and pon turned around and both uttered an exclamation of fear the next instant they took to their heels and ran fast up the path for it was old blinkie the wicked witch who had at last traced them to this place her anger was so great that she was determined not to abandon the chase of pon and trot until she had caught and punished them the scarecrow understood at once that the old woman meant harm to his new friends so as she drew near he stepped before her his appearance was so sudden and unexpected that blinkie ran into him and toppled him over but she tripped on his straw body and went rolling in the path beside him  the scarecrow sat up and said i beg your pardon but she whacked him with her stick and knocked him flat again then furious with rage the old witch sprang upon her victim and began pulling the straw out of his body the poor scarecrow was helpless to resist and in a few moments all that was left of him was an empty suit of clothes and a heap of straw beside it fortunately blinkie did not harm his head for it rolled into a little hollow and escaped her notice fearing that pon and trot would escape her she quickly resumed the chase and disappeared over the brow of a hill following the direction in which she had seen them go  only a short time elapsed before a gray grasshopper with a wooden leg came hopping along and lit directly on the upturned face of the scarecrows head  pardon me but you are resting yourself upon my nose remarked the scarecrow  oh are you alive asked the grasshopper  that is a question i have never been able to decide said the scarecrows head when my body is properly stuffed i have animation and can move around as well as any live person the brains in the head you are now occupying as a throne are of very superior quality and do a lot of very clever thinking but whether that is being alive or not i cannot prove to you for one who lives is liable to death while i am only liable to destruction  seems to me said the grasshopper rubbing his nose with his front legs that in your case it doesnt matterunless youre destroyed already  i am not all i need is restuffing declared the scarecrow and if pon and trot escape the witch and come back here i am sure they will do me that favor  tell me are trot and pon around here inquired the grasshopper its small voice trembling with excitement  the scarecrow did not answer at once for both his eyes were staring straight upward at a beautiful face that was slightly bent over his head it was indeed princess gloria who had wandered to this spot very much surprised when she heard the scarecrows head talk and the tiny gray grasshopper answer it  this said the scarecrow still staring at her must be the princess who loves pon the gardeners boy  oh indeed exclaimed the grasshopperwho of course was capn billas he examined the young lady curiously  no said gloria frigidly i do not love pon or anyone else for the wicked witch has frozen my heart  what a shame cried the scarecrow one so lovely should be able to love but would you mind my dear stuffing that straw into my body again  the dainty princess glanced at the straw and at the wellworn blue munchkin clothes and shrank back in disdain but she was spared from refusing the scarecrows request by the appearance of trot and pon who had hidden in some bushes just over the brow of the hill and waited until old blinkie had passed them by their hiding place was on the same side as the witchs blind eye and she rushed on in the chase of the girl and the youth without being aware that they had tricked her  trot was shocked at the scarecrows sad condition and at once began putting the straw back into his body pon at sight of gloria again appealed to her to take pity on him but the frozenhearted princess turned coldly away and with a sigh the gardeners boy began to assist trot  neither of them at first noticed the small grasshopper which at their appearance had skipped off the scarecrows nose and was now clinging to a wisp of grass beside the path where he was not likely to be stepped upon not until the scarecrow had been neatly restuffed and set upon his feet againwhen he bowed to his restorers and expressed his thanksdid the grasshopper move from his perch then he leaped lightly into the path and called out  trottrot look at me im capn bill see what the wicked witch has done to me  the voice was small to be sure but it reached trots ears and startled her greatly she looked intently at the grasshopper her eyes wide with fear at first then she knelt down and noticing the wooden leg she began to weep sorrowfully  oh capn billdear capn bill what a cruel thing to do she sobbed  dont cry trot begged the grasshopper it didnt hurt any and it doesnt hurt now but its mighty inconvenient an humiliatin to say the least  i wish said the girl indignantly while trying hard to restrain her tears that i was big nough an strong nough to give that horrid witch a good beating she ought to be turned into a toad for doing this to you capn bill  never mind urged the scarecrow in a comforting voice such a transformation doesnt last always and as a general thing theres some way to break the enchantment im sure glinda could do it in a jiffy  who is glinda inquired capn bill  then the scarecrow told them all about glinda not forgetting to mention her beauty and goodness and her wonderful powers of magic he also explained how the royal sorceress had sent him to jinxland especially to help the strangers whom she knew to be in danger because of the wiles of the cruel king and the wicked witch     chapter sixteen  pon summons the king to surrender   gloria had drawn near to the group to listen to their talk and it seemed to interest her in spite of her frigid manner they knew of course that the poor princess could not help being cold and reserved so they tried not to blame her  i ought to have come here a little sooner said the scarecrow regretfully but glinda sent me as soon as she discovered you were here and were likely to get into trouble and now that we are all togetherexcept buttonbright over whom it is useless to worryi propose we hold a council of war to decide what is best to be done  that seemed a wise thing to do so they all sat down upon the grass including gloria and the grasshopper perched upon trots shoulder and allowed her to stroke him gently with her hand  in the first place began the scarecrow this king krewl is a usurper and has no right to rule this kingdom of jinxland  that is true said pon eagerly my father was king before him and i  you are a gardeners boy interrupted the scarecrow your father had no right to rule either for the rightful king of this land was the father of princess gloria and only she is entitled to sit upon the throne of jinxland  good exclaimed trot but whatll we do with king krewl i spose he wont give up the throne unless he has to  no of course not said the scarecrow therefore it will be our duty to make him give up the throne  how asked trot  give me time to think was the reply thats what my brains are for i dont know whether you people ever think or not but my brains are the best that the wizard of oz ever turned out and if i give them plenty of time to work the result usually surprises me  take your time then suggested trot theres no hurry  thank you said the straw man and sat perfectly still for half an hour during this interval the grasshopper whispered in trots ear to which he was very close and trot whispered back to the grasshopper sitting upon her shoulder pon cast loving glances at gloria who paid not the slightest heed to them  finally the scarecrow laughed aloud  brains working inquired trot  yes they seem in fine order today we will conquer king krewl and put gloria upon his throne as queen of jinxland  fine cried the little girl clapping her hands together gleefully but how  leave the how to me said the scarecrow proudly as a conqueror im a wonder we will first of all write a message to send to king krewl asking him to surrender if he refuses then we will make him surrender  why ask him when we know hell refuse inquired pon  why we must be polite whatever we do explained the scarecrow it would be very rude to conquer a king without proper notice  they found it difficult to write a message without paper pen and ink none of which was at hand so it was decided to send pon as a messenger with instructions to ask the king politely but firmly to surrender  pon was not anxious to be the messenger indeed he hinted that it might prove a dangerous mission but the scarecrow was now the acknowledged head of the army of conquest and he would listen to no refusal so off pon started for the kings castle and the others accompanied him as far as his hut where they had decided to await the gardeners boys return  i think it was because pon had known the scarecrow such a short time that he lacked confidence in the straw mans wisdom it was easy to say we will conquer king krewl but when pon drew near to the great castle he began to doubt the ability of a strawstuffed man a girl a grasshopper and a frozenhearted princess to do it as for himself he had never thought of defying the king before  that was why the gardeners boy was not very bold when he entered the castle and passed through to the enclosed court where the king was just then seated with his favorite courtiers around him none prevented pons entrance because he was known to be the gardeners boy but when the king saw him he began to frown fiercely he considered pon to be to blame for all his trouble with princess gloria who since her heart had been frozen had escaped to some unknown place instead of returning to the castle to wed googlygoo as she had been expected to do so the king bared his teeth angrily as he demanded  what have you done with princess gloria  nothing your majesty i have done nothing at all answered pon in a faltering voice she does not love me any more and even refuses to speak to me  then why are you here you rascal roared the king  pon looked first one way and then another but saw no means of escape so he plucked up courage  i am here to summon your majesty to surrender  what shouted the king surrender  surrender to whom  pons heart sank to his boots  to the scarecrow he replied  some of the courtiers began to titter but king krewl was greatly annoyed he sprang up and began to beat poor pon with the golden staff he carried pon howled lustily and would have run away had not two of the soldiers held him until his majesty was exhausted with punishing the boy then they let him go and he left the castle and returned along the road sobbing at every step because his body was so sore and aching  well said the scarecrow did the king surrender  no but he gave me a good drubbing sobbed poor pon  trot was very sorry for pon but gloria did not seem affected in any way by her lovers anguish the grasshopper leaped to the scarecrows shoulder and asked him what he was going to do next  conquer was the reply but i will go alone this time for beatings cannot hurt me at all nor can lance thrustsor sword cutsor arrow pricks  why is that inquired trot  because i have no nerves such as you meat people possess even grasshoppers have nerves but straw doesnt so whatever they doexcept just one thingthey cannot injure me therefore i expect to conquer king krewl with ease  what is that one thing you excepted asked trot  they will never think of it so never mind and now if you will kindly excuse me for a time ill go over to the castle and do my conquering  you have no weapons pon reminded him  true said the scarecrow but if i carried weapons i might injure someoneperhaps seriouslyand that would make me unhappy i will just borrow that ridingwhip which i see in the corner of your hut if you dont mind it isnt exactly proper to walk with a ridingwhip but i trust you will excuse the inconsistency  pon handed him the whip and the scarecrow bowed to all the party and left the hut proceeding leisurely along the way to the kings castle     chapter seventeen  the ork rescues buttonbright   i must now tell you what had become of buttonbright since he wandered away in the morning and got lost this small boy as perhaps you have discovered was almost as destitute of nerves as the scarecrow nothing ever astonished him much nothing ever worried him or made him unhappy good fortune or bad fortune he accepted with a quiet smile never complaining whatever happened this was one reason why buttonbright was a favorite with all who knew himand perhaps it was the reason why he so often got into difficulties or found himself lost  today as he wandered here and there over hill and down dale he missed trot and capn bill of whom he was fond but nevertheless he was not unhappy the birds sang merrily and the wildflowers were beautiful and the breeze had a fragrance of newmown hay  the only bad thing about this country is its king he reflected but the country isnt to blame for that  a prairiedog stuck its round head out of a mound of earth and looked at the boy with bright eyes  walk around my house please it said and then you wont harm it or disturb the babies  all right answered buttonbright and took care not to step on the mound he went on whistling merrily until a petulant voice cried  oh stop it please stop that noise it gets on my nerves  buttonbright saw an old gray owl sitting in the crotch of a tree and he replied with a laugh all right old fussy and stopped whistling until he had passed out of the owls hearing at noon he came to a farmhouse where an aged couple lived they gave him a good dinner and treated him kindly but the man was deaf and the woman was dumb so they could answer no questions to guide him on the way to pons house when he left them he was just as much lost as he had been before  every grove of trees he saw from a distance he visited for he remembered that the kings castle was near a grove of trees and pons hut was near the kings castle but always he met with disappointment finally passing through one of these groves he came out into the open and found himself face to face with the ork  hello said buttonbright where did you come from  from orkland was the reply ive found my own country at last and it is not far from here either i would have come back to you sooner to see how you are getting along had not my family and friends welcomed my return so royally that a great celebration was held in my honor so i couldnt very well leave orkland again until the excitement was over  can you find your way back home again asked the boy  yes easily for now i know exactly where it is but where are trot and capn bill  buttonbright related to the ork their adventures since it had left them in jinxland telling of trots fear that the king had done something wicked to capn bill and of pons love for gloria and how trot and buttonbright had been turned out of the kings castle that was all the news that the boy had but it made the ork anxious for the safety of his friends  we must go to them at once for they may need us he said  i dont know where to go confessed buttonbright im lost  well i can take you back to the hut of the gardeners boy promised the ork for when i fly high in the air i can look down and easily spy the kings castle that was how i happened to spy you just entering the grove so i flew down and waited until you came out  how can you carry me asked the boy  youll have to sit straddle my shoulders and put your arms around my neck do you think you can keep from falling off  ill try said buttonbright so the ork squatted down and the boy took his seat and held on tight then the skinny creatures tail began whirling and up they went far above all the treetops  after the ork had circled around once or twice its sharp eyes located the towers of the castle and away it flew straight toward the place as it hovered in the air near by the castle buttonbright pointed out pons hut so they landed just before it and trot came running out to greet them  gloria was introduced to the ork who was surprised to find capn bill transformed into a grasshopper  how do you like it asked the creature  why it worries me good deal answered capn bill perched upon trots shoulder im always afraid o bein stepped on and i dont like the flavor of grass an cant seem to get used to it its my nature to eat grass you know but i begin to suspect its an acquired taste  can you give molasses asked the ork  i guess im not that kind of a grasshopper replied capn bill but i cant say what i might do if i was squeezedwhich i hope i wont be  well said the ork its a great pity and id like to meet that cruel king and his wicked witch and punish them both severely youre awfully small capn bill but i think i would recognize you anywhere by your wooden leg  then the ork and buttonbright were told all about glorias frozen heart and how the scarecrow had come from the land of oz to help them the ork seemed rather disturbed when it learned that the scarecrow had gone alone to conquer king krewl  im afraid hell make a fizzle of it said the skinny creature and theres no telling what that terrible king might do to the poor scarecrow who seems like a very interesting person so i believe ill take a hand in this conquest myself  how asked trot  wait and see was the reply but first of all i must fly home againback to my own countryso if youll forgive my leaving you so soon ill be off at once stand away from my tail please so that the wind from it when it revolves wont knock you over  they gave the creature plenty of room and away it went like a flash and soon disappeared in the sky  i wonder said buttonbright looking solemnly after the ork whether hell ever come back again  of course he will returned trot the orks a pretty good fellow and we can depend on him an mark my words buttonbright whenever our ork does come back theres one cruel king in jinxland thatll wish he hadnt     chapter eighteen  the scarecrow meets an enemy   the scarecrow was not a bit afraid of king krewl indeed he rather enjoyed the prospect of conquering the evil king and putting gloria on the throne of jinxland in his place so he advanced boldly to the royal castle and demanded admittance  seeing that he was a stranger the soldiers allowed him to enter he made his way straight to the throne room where at that time his majesty was settling the disputes among his subjects  who are you demanded the king  im the scarecrow of oz and i command you to surrender yourself my prisoner  why should i do that inquired the king much astonished at the straw mans audacity  because ive decided you are too cruel a king to rule so beautiful a country you must remember that jinxland is a part of oz and therefore you owe allegiance to ozma of oz whose friend and servant i am  now when he heard this king krewl was much disturbed in mind for he knew the scarecrow spoke the truth but no one had ever before come to jinxland from the land of oz and the king did not intend to be put out of his throne if he could help it therefore he gave a harsh wicked laugh of derision and said  im busy now stand out of my way scarecrow and ill talk with you by and by  but the scarecrow turned to the assembled courtiers and people and called in a loud voice  i hereby declare in the name of ozma of oz that this man is no longer ruler of jinxland from this moment princess gloria is your rightful queen and i ask all of you to be loyal to her and to obey her commands  the people looked fearfully at the king whom they all hated in their hearts but likewise feared krewl was now in a terrible rage and he raised his golden sceptre and struck the scarecrow so heavy a blow that he fell to the floor  but he was up again in an instant and with pons ridingwhip he switched the king so hard that the wicked monarch roared with pain as much as with rage calling on his soldiers to capture the scarecrow  they tried to do that and thrust their lances and swords into the straw body but without doing any damage except to make holes in the scarecrows clothes however they were many against one and finally old googlygoo brought a rope which he wound around the scarecrow binding his legs together and his arms to his sides and after that the fight was over  the king stormed and danced around in a dreadful fury for he had never been so switched since he was a boyand perhaps not then he ordered the scarecrow thrust into the castle prison which was no task at all because one man could carry him easily bound as he was  even after the prisoner was removed the king could not control his anger he tried to figure out some way to be revenged upon the straw man but could think of nothing that could hurt him at last when the terrified people and the frightened courtiers had all slunk away old googlygoo approached the king with a malicious grin upon his face  ill tell you what to do said he build a big bonfire and burn the scarecrow up and that will be the end of him  the king was so delighted with this suggestion that he hugged old googlygoo in his joy  of course he cried the very thing why did i not think of it myself  so he summoned his soldiers and retainers and bade them prepare a great bonfire in an open space in the castle park also he sent word to all his people to assemble and witness the destruction of the scarecrow who had dared to defy his power before long a vast throng gathered in the park and the servants had heaped up enough fuel to make a fire that might be seen for miles awayeven in the daytime  when all was prepared the king had his throne brought out for him to sit upon and enjoy the spectacle and then he sent his soldiers to fetch the scarecrow  now the one thing in all the world that the straw man really feared was fire he knew he would burn very easily and that his ashes wouldnt amount to much afterward it wouldnt hurt him to be destroyed in such a manner but he realized that many people in the land of oz and especially dorothy and the royal ozma would feel sad if they learned that their old friend the scarecrow was no longer in existence  in spite of this the straw man was brave and faced his fiery fate like a hero when they marched him out before the concourse of people he turned to the king with great calmness and said  this wicked deed will cost you your throne as well as much suffering for my friends will avenge my destruction  your friends are not here nor will they know what i have done to you when you are gone and cannot tell them answered the king in a scornful voice  then he ordered the scarecrow bound to a stout stake that he had had driven into the ground and the materials for the fire were heaped all around him when this had been done the kings brass band struck up a lively tune and old googlygoo came forward with a lighted match and set fire to the pile  at once the flames shot up and crept closer and closer toward the scarecrow the king and all his people were so intent upon this terrible spectacle that none of them noticed how the sky grew suddenly dark perhaps they thought that the loud buzzing soundlike the noise of a dozen moving railway trainscame from the blazing fagots that the rush of wind was merely a breeze but suddenly down swept a flock of orks half a hundred of them at the least and the powerful currents of air caused by their revolving tails sent the bonfire scattering in every direction so that not one burning brand ever touched the scarecrow  but that was not the only effect of this sudden tornado king krewl was blown out of his throne and went tumbling heels over head until he landed with a bump against the stone wall of his own castle and before he could rise a big ork sat upon him and held him pressed flat to the ground old googlygoo shot up into the air like a rocket and landed on a tree where he hung by the middle on a high limb kicking the air with his feet and clawing the air with his hands and howling for mercy like the coward he was  the people pressed back until they were jammed close together while all the soldiers were knocked over and sent sprawling to the earth the excitement was great for a few minutes and every frightened inhabitant of jinxland looked with awe and amazement at the great orks whose descent had served to rescue the scarecrow and conquer king krewl at one and the same time  the ork who was the leader of the band soon had the scarecrow free of his bonds then he said well we were just in time to save you which is better than being a minute too late you are now the master here and we are determined to see your orders obeyed  with this the ork picked up krewls golden crown which had fallen off his head and placed it upon the head of the scarecrow who in his awkward way then shuffled over to the throne and sat down in it  seeing this a rousing cheer broke from the crowd of people who tossed their hats and waved their handkerchiefs and hailed the scarecrow as their king the soldiers joined the people in the cheering for now they fully realized that their hated master was conquered and it would be wise to show their good will to the conqueror some of them bound krewl with ropes and dragged him forward dumping his body on the ground before the scarecrows throne googlygoo struggled until he finally slid off the limb of the tree and came tumbling to the ground he then tried to sneak away and escape but the soldiers seized and bound him beside krewl  the tables are turned said the scarecrow swelling out his chest until the straw within it crackled pleasantly for he was highly pleased but it was you and your people who did it friend ork and from this time you may count me your humble servant     chapter nineteen  the conquest of the witch   now as soon as the conquest of king krewl had taken place one of the orks had been dispatched to pons house with the joyful news at once gloria and pon and trot and buttonbright hastened toward the castle they were somewhat surprised by the sight that met their eyes for there was the scarecrow crowned king and all the people kneeling humbly before him so they likewise bowed low to the new ruler and then stood beside the throne capn bill as the gray grasshopper was still perched upon trots shoulder but now he hopped to the shoulder of the scarecrow and whispered into the painted ear  i thought gloria was to be queen of jinxland  the scarecrow shook his head  not yet he answered no queen with a frozen heart is fit to rule any country then he turned to his new friend the ork who was strutting about very proud of what he had done and said do you suppose you or your followers could find old blinkie the witch  where is she asked the ork  somewhere in jinxland im sure  then said the ork we shall certainly be able to find her  it will give me great pleasure declared the scarecrow when you have found her bring her here to me and i will then decide what to do with her  the ork called his followers together and spoke a few words to them in a low tone a moment after they rose into the airso suddenly that the scarecrow who was very light in weight was blown quite out of his throne and into the arms of pon who replaced him carefully upon his seat there was an eddy of dust and ashes too and the grasshopper only saved himself from being whirled into the crowd of people by jumping into a tree from where a series of hops soon brought him back to trots shoulder again the orks were quite out of sight by this time so the scarecrow made a speech to the people and presented gloria to them whom they knew well already and were fond of but not all of them knew of her frozen heart and when the scarecrow related the story of the wicked witchs misdeeds which had been encouraged and paid for by krewl and googlygoo the people were very indignant  meantime the fifty orks had scattered all over jinx land which is not a very big country and their sharp eyes were peering into every valley and grove and gully finally one of them spied a pair of heels sticking out from underneath some bushes and with a shrill whistle to warn his comrades that the witch was found the ork flew down and dragged old blinkie from her hidingplace then two or three of the orks seized the clothing of the wicked woman in their strong claws and lifting her high in the air where she struggled and screamed to no avail they flew with her straight to the royal castle and set her down before the throne of the scarecrow  good exclaimed the straw man nodding his stuffed head with satisfaction now we can proceed to business mistress witch i am obliged to request gently but firmly that you undo all the wrongs you have done by means of your witchcraft  pah cried old blinkie in a scornful voice i defy you all by my magic powers i can turn you all into pigs rooting in the mud and ill do it if you are not careful  i think you are mistaken about that said the scarecrow and rising from his throne he walked with wobbling steps to the side of the wicked witch before i left the land of oz glinda the royal sorceress gave me a box which i was not to open except in an emergency but i feel pretty sure that this occasion is an emergency dont you trot he asked turning toward the little girl  why weve got to do something replied trot seriously things seem in an awful muddle here jus now and theyll be worse if we dont stop this witch from doing more harm to people  that is my idea exactly said the scarecrow and taking a small box from his pocket he opened the cover and tossed the contents toward blinkie  the old woman shrank back pale and trembling as a fine white dust settled all about her under its influence she seemed to the eyes of all observers to shrivel and grow smaller  oh dearoh dear she wailed wringing her hands in fear havent you the antidote scarecrow didnt the great sorceress give you another box  she did answered the scarecrow  then give it mequick pleaded the witch give it meand ill do anything you ask me to  you will do what i ask first declared the scarecrow firmly  the witch was shriveling and growing smaller every moment  be quick then she cried tell me what i must do and let me do it or it will be too late  you made trots friend capn bill a grasshopper i command you to give him back his proper form again said the scarecrow  where is he wheres the grasshopper quickquick she screamed  capn bill who had been deeply interested in this conversation gave a great leap from trots shoulder and landed on that of the scarecrow blinkie saw him alight and at once began to make magic passes and to mumble magic incantations she was in a desperate hurry knowing that she had no time to waste and the grasshopper was so suddenly transformed into the old sailorman capn bill that he had no opportunity to jump off the scarecrows shoulder so his great weight bore the stuffed scarecrow to the ground no harm was done however and the straw man got up and brushed the dust from his clothes while trot delightedly embraced capn bill  the other box quick give me the other box begged blinkie who had now shrunk to half her former size  not yet said the scarecrow you must first melt princess glorias frozen heart  i cant its an awful job to do that i cant asserted the witch in an agony of fearfor still she was growing smaller  you must declared the scarecrow firmly  the witch cast a shrewd look at him and saw that he meant it so she began dancing around gloria in a frantic manner the princess looked coldly on as if not at all interested in the proceedings while blinkie tore a handful of hair from her own head and ripped a strip of cloth from the bottom of her gown then the witch sank upon her knees took a purple powder from her black bag and sprinkled it over the hair and cloth  i hate to do iti  hate to do it she wailed for there is no more of this magic compound in all the world but i must sacrifice it to save my own life a match give me a match quick and panting from lack of breath she gazed imploringly from one to another  capn bill was the only one who had a match but he lost no time in handing it to blinkie who quickly set fire to the hair and the cloth and the purple powder at once a purple cloud enveloped gloria and this gradually turned to a rosy pink colorbrilliant and quite transparent through the rosy cloud they could all see the beautiful princess standing proud and erect then her heart became visible at first frosted with ice but slowly growing brighter and warmer until all the frost had disappeared and it was beating as softly and regularly as any other heart and now the cloud dispersed and disclosed gloria her face suffused with joy smiling tenderly upon the friends who were grouped about her  poor pon stepped forwardtimidly fearing a repulse but with pleading eyes and arms fondly outstretched toward his former sweetheartand the princess saw him and her sweet face lighted with a radiant smile without an instants hesitation she threw herself into pons arms and this reunion of two loving hearts was so affecting that the people turned away and lowered their eyes so as not to mar the sacred joy of the faithful lovers  but blinkies small voice was shouting to the scarecrow for help  the antidote she screamed give me the other boxquick  the scarecrow looked at the witch with his quaint painted eyes and saw that she was now no taller than his knee so he took from his pocket the second box and scattered its contents on blinkie she ceased to grow any smaller but she could never regain her former size and this the wicked old woman well knew  she did not know however that the second powder had destroyed all her power to work magic and seeking to be revenged upon the scarecrow and his friends she at once began to mumble a charm so terrible in its effect that it would have destroyed half the population of jinxlandhad it worked but it did not work at all to the amazement of old blinkie and by this time the scarecrow noticed what the little witch was trying to do and said to her  go home blinkie and behave yourself you are no longer a witch but an ordinary old woman and since you are powerless to do more evil i advise you to try to do some good in the world believe me it is more fun to accomplish a good act than an evil one as you will discover when once you have tried it  but blinkie was at that moment filled with grief and chagrin at losing her magic powers she started away toward her home sobbing and bewailing her fate and not one who saw her go was at all sorry for her     chapter twenty  queen gloria   next morning the scarecrow called upon all the courtiers and the people to assemble in the throne room of the castle where there was room enough for all that were able to attend they found the straw man seated upon the velvet cushions of the throne with the kings glittering crown still upon his stuffed head on one side of the throne in a lower chair sat gloria looking radiantly beautiful and fresh as a newblown rose on the other side sat pon the gardeners boy still dressed in his old smock frock and looking sad and solemn for pon could not make himself believe that so splendid a princess would condescend to love him when she had come to her own and was seated upon a throne trot and capn bill sat at the feet of the scarecrow and were much interested in the proceedings buttonbright had lost himself before breakfast but came into the throne room before the ceremonies were over back of the throne stood a row of the great orks with their leader in the center and the entrance to the palace was guarded by more orks who were regarded with wonder and awe  when all were assembled the scarecrow stood up and made a speech he told how glorias father the good king kynd who had once ruled them and been loved by everyone had been destroyed by king phearce the father of pon and how king phearce had been destroyed by king krewl this last king had been a bad ruler as they knew very well and the scarecrow declared that the only one in all jinxland who had the right to sit upon the throne was princess gloria the daughter of king kynd  but he added it is not for me a stranger to say who shall rule you you must decide for yourselves or you will not be content so choose now who shall be your future ruler  and they all shouted  the scarecrow  the scarecrow shall rule us  which proved that the stuffed man had made himself very popular by his conquest of king krewl and the people thought they would like him for their king but the scarecrow shook his head so vigorously that it became loose and trot had to pin it firmly to his body again  no said he i belong in the land of oz where i am the humble servant of the lovely girl who rules us allthe royal ozma you must choose one of your own inhabitants to rule over jinxland who shall it be  they hesitated for a moment and some few cried pon but many more shouted gloria  so the scarecrow took glorias hand and led her to the throne where he first seated her and then took the glittering crown off his own head and placed it upon that of the young lady where it nestled prettily amongst her soft curls the people cheered and shouted then kneeling before their new queen but gloria leaned down and took pons hand in both her own and raised him to the seat beside her  you shall have both a king and a queen to care for you and to protect you my dear subjects she said in a sweet voice while her face glowed with happiness for pon was a kings son before he became a gardeners boy and because i love him he is to be my royal consort  that pleased them all especially pon who realized that this was the most important moment of his life trot and buttonbright and capn will all congratulated him on winning the beautiful gloria but the ork sneezed twice and said that in his opinion the young lady might have done better  then the scarecrow ordered the guards to bring in the wicked krewl king no longer and when he appeared loaded with chains and dressed in fustian the people hissed him and drew back as he passed so their garments would not touch him  krewl was not haughty or overbearing any more on the contrary he seemed very meek and in great fear of the fate his conquerors had in store for him but gloria and pon were too happy to be revengeful and so they offered to appoint krewl to the position of gardeners boy at the castle pon having resigned to become king but they said he must promise to reform his wicked ways and to do his duty faithfully and he must change his name from krewl to grewl all this the man eagerly promised to do and so when pon retired to a room in the castle to put on princely raiment the old brown smock he had formerly worn was given to grewl who then went out into the garden to water the roses  the remainder of that famous day which was long remembered in jinxland was given over to feasting and merrymaking in the evening there was a grand dance in the courtyard where the brass band played a new piece of music called the ork trot which was dedicated to our glorious gloria the queen  while the queen and pon were leading this dance and all the jinxland people were having a good time the strangers were gathered in a group in the park outside the castle capn bill trot buttonbright and the scarecrow were there and so was their old friend the ork but of all the great flock of orks which had assisted in the conquest but three remained in jinxland besides their leader the others having returned to their own country as soon as gloria was crowned queen to the young ork who had accompanied them in their adventures capn bill said  youve surely been a friend in need and were mighty grateful to you for helping us i might have been a grasshopper yet if it hadnt been for you an i might remark that bein a grasshopper isnt much fun  if it hadnt been for you friend ork said the scarecrow i fear i could not have conquered king krewl  no agreed trot youd have been just a heap of ashes by this time  and i might have been lost yet added buttonbright much obliged mr ork  oh thats all right replied the ork friends must stand together you know or they wouldnt be friends but now i must leave you and be off to my own country where theres going to be a surprise party on my uncle and ive promised to attend it  dear me said the scarecrow regretfully that is very unfortunate  why so asked the ork  i hoped you would consent to carry us over those mountains into the land of oz my mission here is now finished and i want to get back to the emerald city  how did you cross the mountains before inquired the ork  i scaled the cliffs by means of a rope and crossed the great gulf on a strand of spider web of course i can return in the same manner but it would be a hard journeyand perhaps an impossible onefor trot and buttonbright and capn bill so i thought that if you had the time you and your people would carry us over the mountains and land us all safely on the other side in the land of oz  the ork thoughtfully considered the matter for a while then he said  i mustnt break my promise to be present at the surprise party but tell me could you go to oz tonight  what now exclaimed trot  it is a fine moonlight night said the ork and ive found in my experience that theres no time so good as right away the fact is he explained its a long journey to orkland and i and my cousins here are all rather tired by our days work but if you will start now and be content to allow us to carry you over the mountains and dump you on the other side just say the word andoff we go  capn bill and trot looked at one another questioningly the little girl was eager to visit the famous fairyland of oz and the old sailor had endured such hardships in jinxland that he would be glad to be out of it  its rather impolite of us not to say goodbye to the new king and queen remarked the scarecrow but im sure theyre too happy to miss us and i assure you it will be much easier to fly on the backs of the orks over those steep mountains than to climb them as i did  all right lets go trot decided but wheres buttonbright  just at this important moment buttonbright was lost again and they all scattered in search of him he had been standing beside them just a few minutes before but his friends had an exciting hunt for him before they finally discovered the boy seated among the members of the band beating the end of the bass drum with the bone of a turkeyleg that he had taken from the table in the banquet room  hello trot he said looking up at the little girl when she found him this is the first chance i ever had to pound a drum with a reglar drum stick and i ate all the meat off the bone myself  come quick were going to the land of oz  oh whats the hurry said buttonbright but she seized his arm and dragged him away to the park where the others were waiting  trot climbed upon the back of her old friend the ork leader and the others took their seats on the backs of his three cousins as soon as all were placed and clinging to the skinny necks of the creatures the revolving tails began to whirl and up rose the four monster orks and sailed away toward the mountains they were so high in the air that when they passed the crest of the highest peak it seemed far below them no sooner were they well across the barrier than the orks swooped downward and landed their passengers upon the ground  here we are safe in the land of oz cried the scarecrow joyfully  oh are we asked trot looking around her curiously  she could see the shadows of stately trees and the outlines of rolling hills beneath her feet was soft turf but otherwise the subdued light of the moon disclosed nothing clearly  seems jus like any other country was capn bills comment  but it isnt the scarecrow assured him you are now within the borders of the most glorious fairyland in all the world this part of it is just a corner of the quadling country and the least interesting portion of it its not very thickly settled around here ill admit but  he was interrupted by a sudden whir and a rush of air as the four orks mounted into the sky  good night called the shrill voices of the strange creatures and although trot shouted good night as loudly as she could the little girl was almost ready to cry because the orks had not waited to be properly thanked for all their kindness to her and to capn bill  but the orks were gone and thanks for good deeds do not amount to much except to prove ones politeness  well friends said the scarecrow we mustnt stay here in the meadows all night so let us find a pleasant place to sleep not that it matters to me in the least for i never sleep but i know that meat people like to shut their eyes and lie still during the dark hours  im pretty tired admitted trot yawning as she followed the straw man along a tiny path so if you dont find a house handy capn bill and i will sleep under the trees or even on this soft grass  but a house was not very far off although when the scarecrow stumbled upon it there was no light in it whatever capn bill knocked on the door several times and there being no response the scarecrow boldly lifted the latch and walked in followed by the others and no sooner had they entered than a soft light filled the room trot couldnt tell where it came from for no lamp of any sort was visible but she did not waste much time on this problem because directly in the center of the room stood a table set for three with lots of good food on it and several of the dishes smoking hot  the little girl and buttonbright both uttered exclamations of pleasure but they looked in vain for any cook stove or fireplace or for any person who might have prepared for them this delicious feast  its fairyland muttered the boy tossing his cap in a corner and seating himself at the table this supper smells most as good as that turkeyleg i had in jinxland please pass the muffins capn bill  trot thought it was strange that no people but themselves were in the house but on the wall opposite the door was a gold frame bearing in big letters the word  welcome  so she had no further hesitation in eating of the food so mysteriously prepared for them  but there are only places for three she exclaimed  three are quite enough said the scarecrow i never eat because i am stuffed full already and i like my nice clean straw better than i do food  trot and the sailorman were hungry and made a hearty meal for not since they had left home had they tasted such good food it was surprising that buttonbright could eat so soon after his feast in jinxland but the boy always ate whenever there was an opportunity if i dont eat now he said the next time im hungry ill wish i had  really capn remarked trot when she found a dish of icecream appear beside her plate i blieve this is fairyland sure enough  theres no doubt of it trot he answered gravely  ive been here before said buttonbright so i know  after supper they discovered three tiny bedrooms adjoining the big living room of the house and in each room was a comfortable white bed with downy pillows you may be sure that the tired mortals were not long in bidding the scarecrow good night and creeping into their beds where they slept soundly until morning  for the first time since they set eyes on the terrible whirlpool trot and capn bill were free from anxiety and care buttonbright never worried about anything the scarecrow not being able to sleep looked out of the window and tried to count the stars     chapter twentyone  dorothy betsy and ozma   i suppose many of my readers have read descriptions of the beautiful and magnificent emerald city of oz so i need not describe it here except to state that never has any city in any fairyland ever equalled this one in stately splendor it lies almost exactly in the center of the land of oz and in the center of the emerald city rises the wall of glistening emeralds that surrounds the palace of ozma the palace is almost a city in itself and is inhabited by many of the rulers especial friends and those who have won her confidence and favor as for ozma herself there are no words in any dictionary i can find that are fitted to describe this young girls beauty of mind and person merely to see her is to love her for her charming face and manners to know her is to love her for her tender sympathy her generous nature her truth and honor born of a long line of fairy queens ozma is as nearly perfect as any fairy may be and she is noted for her wisdom as well as for her other qualities her happy subjects adore their girl ruler and each one considers her a comrade and protector  at the time of which i write ozmas best friend and most constant companion was a little kansas girl named dorothy a mortal who had come to the land of oz in a very curious manner and had been offered a home in ozmas palace furthermore dorothy had been made a princess of oz and was as much at home in the royal palace as was the gentle ruler she knew almost every part of the great country and almost all of its numerous inhabitants next to ozma she was loved better than anyone in all oz for dorothy was simple and sweet seldom became angry and had such a friendly chummy way that she made friends whereever she wandered it was she who first brought the scarecrow and the tin woodman and the cowardly lion to the emerald city dorothy had also introduced to ozma the shaggy man and the hungry tiger as well as billina the yellow hen eureka the pink kitten and many other delightful characters and creatures coming as she did from our world dorothy was much like many other girls we know so there were times when she was not so wise as she might have been and other times when she was obstinate and got herself into trouble but life in a fairyland had taught the little girl to accept all sorts of surprising things as mattersofcourse for while dorothy was no fairybut just as mortal as we areshe had seen more wonders than most mortals ever do  another little girl from our outside world also lived in ozmas palace this was betsy bobbin whose strange adventures had brought her to the emerald city where ozma had cordially welcomed her betsy was a shy little thing and could never get used to the marvels that surrounded her but she and dorothy were firm friends and thought themselves very fortunate in being together in this delightful country  one day dorothy and betsy were visiting ozma in the girl rulers private apartment and among the things that especially interested them was ozmas magic picture set in a handsome frame and hung upon the wall of the room this picture was a magic one because it constantly changed its scenes and showed events and adventures happening in all parts of the world thus it was really a moving picture of life and if the one who stood before it wished to know what any absent person was doing the picture instantly showed that person with his or her surroundings  the two girls were not wishing to see anyone in particular on this occasion but merely enjoyed watching the shifting scenes some of which were exceedingly curious and remarkable suddenly dorothy exclaimed why theres buttonbright and this drew ozma also to look at the picture for she and dorothy knew the boy well  who is buttonbright asked betsy who had never met him  why hes the little boy who is just getting off the back of that strange flying creature exclaimed dorothy then she turned to ozma and asked what is that thing ozma a bird ive never seen anything like it before  it is an ork answered ozma for they were watching the scene where the ork and the three big birds were first landing their passengers in jinxland after the long flight across the desert i wonder added the girl ruler musingly why those strangers dare venture into that unfortunate country which is ruled by a wicked king  that girl and the onelegged man seem to be mortals from the outside world said dorothy  the man isnt onelegged corrected betsy he has one wooden leg  its almost as bad declared dorothy watching capn bill stump around  they are three mortal adventurers said ozma and they seem worthy and honest but i fear they will be treated badly in jinxland and if they meet with any misfortune there it will reflect upon me for jinxland is a part of my dominions  cant we help them in any way inquired dorothy that seems like a nice little girl id be sorry if anything happened to her  let us watch the picture for awhile suggested ozma and so they all drew chairs before the magic picture and followed the adventures of trot and capn bill and buttonbright presently the scene shifted and showed their friend the scarecrow crossing the mountains into jinxland and that somewhat relieved ozmas anxiety for she knew at once that glinda the good had sent the scarecrow to protect the strangers  the adventures in jinxland proved very interesting to the three girls in ozmas palace who during the succeeding days spent much of their time in watching the picture it was like a story to them  that girls a reglar trump exclaimed dorothy referring to trot and ozma answered  shes a dear little thing and im sure nothing very bad will happen to her the old sailor is a fine character too for he has never once grumbled over being a grasshopper as so many would have done  when the scarecrow was so nearly burned up the girls all shivered a little and they clapped their hands in joy when the flock of orks came and saved him  so it was that when all the exciting adventures in jinxland were over and the four orks had begun their flight across the mountains to carry the mortals into the land of oz ozma called the wizard to her and asked him to prepare a place for the strangers to sleep  the famous wizard of oz was a quaint little man who inhabited the royal palace and attended to all the magical things that ozma wanted done he was not as powerful as glinda to be sure but he could do a great many wonderful things he proved this by placing a house in the uninhabited part of the quadling country where the orks landed capn bill and trot and buttonbright and fitting it with all the comforts i have described in the last chapter  next morning dorothy said to ozma  oughtnt we to go meet the strangers so we can show them the way to the emerald city im sure that little girl will feel shy in this beautiful land and i know if twas me id like somebody to give me a welcome  ozma smiled at her little friend and answered  you and betsy may go to meet them if you wish but i can not leave my palace just now as i am to have a conference with jack pumpkinhead and professor wogglebug on important matters you may take the sawhorse and the red wagon and if you start soon you will be able to meet the scarecrow and the strangers at glindas palace  oh thank you cried dorothy and went away to tell betsy and to make preparations for the journey     chapter twentytwo  the waterfall   glindas castle was a long way from the mountains but the scarecrow began the journey cheerfully since time was of no great importance in the land of oz and he had recently made the trip and knew the way it never mattered much to buttonbright where he was or what he was doing the boy was content in being alive and having good companions to share his wanderings as for trot and capn bill they now found themselves so comfortable and free from danger in this fine fairyland and they were so awed and amazed by the adventures they were encountering that the journey to glindas castle was more like a pleasure trip than a hardship so many wonderful things were there to see  buttonbright had been in oz before but never in this part of it so the scarecrow was the only one who knew the paths and could lead them they had eaten a hearty breakfast which they found already prepared for them and awaiting them on the table when they arose from their refreshing sleep so they left the magic house in a contented mood and with hearts lighter and more happy than they had known for many a day as they marched along through the fields the sun shone brightly and the breeze was laden with delicious fragrance for it carried with it the breath of millions of wildflowers  at noon when they stopped to rest by the bank of a pretty river trot said with a longdrawn breath that was much like a sigh  i wish wed brought with us some of the food that was left from our breakfast for im getting hungry again  scarcely had she spoken when a table rose up before them as if from the ground itself and it was loaded with fruits and nuts and cakes and many other good things to eat the little girls eyes opened wide at this display of magic and capn bill was not sure that the things were actually there and fit to eat until he had taken them in his hand and tasted them but the scarecrow said with a laugh  someone is looking after your welfare that is certain and from the looks of this table i suspect my friend the wizard has taken us in his charge ive known him to do things like this before and if we are in the wizards care you need not worry about your future  whos worrying inquired buttonbright already at the table and busily eating  the scarecrow looked around the place while the others were feasting and finding many things unfamiliar to him he shook his head and remarked  i must have taken the wrong path back in that last valley for on my way to jinxland i remember that i passed around the foot of this river where there was a great waterfall  did the river make a bend after the waterfall asked capn bill  no the river disappeared only a pool of whirling water showed what had become of the river but i suppose it is under ground somewhere and will come to the surface again in another part of the country  well suggested trot as she finished her luncheon as there is no way to cross this river i spose well have to find that waterfall and go around it  exactly replied the scarecrow so they soon renewed their journey following the river for a long time until the roar of the waterfall sounded in their ears by and by they came to the waterfall itself a sheet of silver dropping far far down into a tiny lake which seemed to have no outlet from the top of the fall where they stood the banks gradually sloped away so that the descent by land was quite easy while the river could do nothing but glide over an edge of rock and tumble straight down to the depths below  you see said the scarecrow leaning over the brink this is called by our oz people the great waterfall because it is certainly the highest one in all the land but i thinkhelp  he had lost his balance and pitched headforemost into the river they saw a flash of straw and blue clothes and the painted face looking upward in surprise the next moment the scarecrow was swept over the waterfall and plunged into the basin below  the accident had happened so suddenly that for a moment they were all too horrified to speak or move  quick we must go to help him or he will be drowned trot exclaimed  even while speaking she began to descend the bank to the pool below and capn bill followed as swiftly as his wooden leg would let him buttonbright came more slowly calling to the girl  he cant drown trot hes a scarecrow  but she wasnt sure a scarecrow couldnt drown and never relaxed her speed until she stood on the edge of the pool with the spray dashing in her face capn bill puffing and panting had just voice enough to ask as he reached her side  see him trot  not a speck of him  oh capn what do you spose has become of him  i spose replied the sailor that hes in that water more or less far down and im fraid itll make his straw pretty soggy but as fer his bein drowned i agree with buttonbright that it cant be done  there was small comfort in this assurance and trot stood for some time searching with her eyes the bubbling water in the hope that the scarecrow would finally come to the surface presently she heard buttonbright calling come here trot and looking around she saw that the boy had crept over the wet rocks to the edge of the waterfall and seemed to be peering behind it making her way toward him she asked  what do you see  a cave he answered lets go in praps well find the scarecrow there  she was a little doubtful of that but the cave interested her and so did it capn bill there was just space enough at the edge of the sheet of water for them to crowd in behind it but after that dangerous entrance they found room enough to walk upright and after a time they came to an opening in the wall of rock approaching this opening they gazed within it and found a series of steps cut so that they might easily descend into the cavern  trot turned to look inquiringly at her companions the falling water made such din and roaring that her voice could not be heard capn bill nodded his head but before he could enter the cave buttonbright was before him clambering down the steps without a particle of fear so the others followed the boy  the first steps were wet with spray and slippery but the remainder were quite dry a rosy light seemed to come from the interior of the cave and this lighted their way after the steps there was a short tunnel high enough for them to walk erect in and then they reached the cave itself and paused in wonder and admiration  they stood on the edge of a vast cavern the walls and domed roof of which were lined with countless rubies exquisitely cut and flashing sparkling rays from one to another this caused a radiant light that permitted the entire cavern to be distinctly seen and the effect was so marvelous that trot drew in her breath with a sort of a gasp and stood quite still in wonder  but the walls and roof of the cavern were merely a setting for a more wonderful scene in the center was a bubbling caldron of water for here the river rose again splashing and dashing till its spray rose high in the air where it took the ruby color of the jewels and seemed like a seething mass of flame and while they gazed into the tumbling tossing water the body of the scarecrow suddenly rose in the center struggling and kicking and the next instant wholly disappeared from view  my but hes wet exclaimed buttonbright but none of the others heard him  trot and capn bill discovered that a broad ledgecovered like the walls with glittering rubiesran all around the cavern so they followed this gorgeous path to the rear and found where the water made its final dive underground before it disappeared entirely where it plunged into this dim abyss the river was black and dreary looking and they stood gazing in awe until just beside them the body of the scarecrow again popped up from the water     chapter twenty three  the land of oz   the straw mans appearance on the water was so sudden that it startled trot but capn bill had the presence of mind to stick his wooden leg out over the water and the scarecrow made a desperate clutch and grabbed the leg with both hands he managed to hold on until trot and buttonbright knelt down and seized his clothing but the children would have been powerless to drag the soaked scarecrow ashore had not capn bill now assisted them when they laid him on the ledge of rubies he was the most useless looking scarecrow you can imaginehis straw sodden and dripping with water his clothing wet and crumpled while even the sack upon which his face was painted had become so wrinkled that the old jolly expression of their stuffed friends features was entirely gone but he could still speak and when trot bent down her ear she heard him say  get me out of here as soon as you can  that seemed a wise thing to do so capn bill lifted his head and shoulders and trot and buttonbright each took a leg among them they partly carried and partly dragged the damp scarecrow out of the ruby cavern along the tunnel and up the flight of rock steps it was somewhat difficult to get him past the edge of the waterfall but they succeeded after much effort and a few minutes later laid their poor comrade on a grassy bank where the sun shone upon him freely and he was beyond the reach of the spray  capn bill now knelt down and examined the straw that the scarecrow was stuffed with  i dont believe itll be of much use to him any more said he for its full of polliwogs an fish eggs an the water has took all the crinkle out o the straw an ruined it i guess trot that the best thing for us to do is to empty out all his body an carry his head an clothes along the road till we come to a field or a house where we can get some fresh straw  yes capn she agreed theres nothing else to be done but how shall we ever find the road to glindas palace without the scarecrow to guide us  thats easy said the scarecrow speaking in a rather feeble but distinct voice if capn bill will carry my head on his shoulders eyes front i can tell him which way to go  so they followed that plan and emptied all the old wet straw out of the scarecrows body then the sailorman wrung out the clothes and laid them in the sun till they were quite dry trot took charge of the head and pressed the wrinkles out of the face as it dried so that after a while the scarecrows expression became natural again and as jolly as before  this work consumed some time but when it was completed they again started upon their journey buttonbright carrying the boots and hat trot the bundle of clothes and capn bill the head the scarecrow having regained his composure and being now in a good humor despite his recent mishaps beguiled their way with stories of the land of oz  it was not until the next morning however that they found straw with which to restuff the scarecrow that evening they came to the same little house they had slept in before only now it was magically transferred to a new place the same bountiful supper as before was found smoking hot upon the table and the same cosy beds were ready for them to sleep in  they rose early and after breakfast went out of doors and there lying just beside the house was a heap of clean crisp straw ozma had noticed the scarecrows accident in her magic picture and had notified the wizard to provide the straw for she knew the adventurers were not likely to find straw in the country through which they were now traveling  they lost no time in stuffing the scarecrow anew and he was greatly delighted at being able to walk around again and to assume the leadership of the little party  really said trot i think youre better than you were before for you are fresh and sweet all through and rustle beautifully when you move  thank you my dear he replied gratefully i always feel like a new man when im freshly stuffed no one likes to get musty you know and even good straw may be spoiled by age  it was water that spoiled you the last time remarked buttonbright which proves that too much bathing is as bad as too little but after all scarecrow water is not as dangerous for you as fire  all things are good in moderation declared the scarecrow but now let us hurry on or we shall not reach glindas palace by nightfall     chapter twentyfour  the royal reception   at about four oclock of that same day the red wagon drew up at the entrance to glindas palace and dorothy and betsy jumped out ozmas red wagon was almost a chariot being inlaid with rubies and pearls and it was drawn by ozmas favorite steed the wooden sawhorse  shall i unharness you asked dorothy so you can come in and visit  no replied the sawhorse ill just stand here and think take your time thinking doesnt seem to bore me at all  what will you think of inquired betsy  of the acorn that grew the tree from which i was made  so they left the wooden animal and went in to see glinda who welcomed the little girls in her most cordial manner  i knew you were on your way said the good sorceress when they were seated in her library for i learned from my record book that you intended to meet trot and buttonbright on their arrival here  is the strange little girl named trot asked dorothy  yes and her companion the old sailor is named capn bill i think we shall like them very much for they are just the kind of people to enjoy and appreciate our fairyland and i do not see any way at present for them to return again to the outside world  well theres room enough here for them im sure said dorothy betsy and i are already eager to welcome trot it will keep us busy for a year at least showing her all the wonderful things in oz  glinda smiled  i have lived here many years said she and i have not seen all the wonders of oz yet  meantime the travelers were drawing near to the palace and when they first caught sight of its towers trot realized that it was far more grand and imposing than was the kings castle in jinxland the nearer they came the more beautiful the palace appeared and when finally the scarecrow led them up the great marble steps even buttonbright was filled with awe  i dont see any soldiers to guard the place said the little girl  there is no need to guard glindas palace replied the scarecrow we have no wicked people in oz that we know of and even if there were any glindas magic would be powerful enough to protect her  buttonbright was now standing on the top steps of the entrance and he suddenly exclaimed  why theres the sawhorse and the red wagon hip hooray and next moment he was rushing down to throw his arms around the neck of the wooden horse which goodnaturedly permitted this familiarity when it recognized in the boy an old friend  buttonbrights shout had been heard inside the palace so now dorothy and betsy came running out to embrace their beloved friend the scarecrow and to welcome trot and capn bill to the land of oz  weve been watching you for a long time in ozmas magic picture said dorothy and ozma has sent us to invite you to her own palace in the emrald city i dont know if you realize how lucky you are to get that invitation but youll understand it better after youve seen the royal palace and the emrald city  glinda now appeared in person to lead all the party into her azure reception room trot was a little afraid of the stately sorceress but gained courage by holding fast to the hands of betsy and dorothy capn bill had no one to help him feel at ease so the old sailor sat stiffly on the edge of his chair and said  yes maam or no maam when he was spoken to and was greatly embarrassed by so much splendor  the scarecrow had lived so much in palaces that he felt quite at home and he chatted to glinda and the oz girls in a merry lighthearted way he told all about his adventures in jinxland and at the great waterfall and on the journey hithermost of which his hearers knew alreadyand then he asked dorothy and betsy what had happened in the emerald city since he had left there  they all passed the evening and the night at glindas palace and the sorceress was so gracious to capn bill that the old man by degrees regained his selfpossession and began to enjoy himself trot had already come to the conclusion that in dorothy and betsy she had found two delightful comrades and buttonbright was just as much at home here as he had been in the fields of jinxland or when he was buried in the popcorn snow of the land of mo  the next morning they arose bright and early and after breakfast bade goodbye to the kind sorceress whom trot and capn bill thanked earnestly for sending the scarecrow to jinxland to rescue them then they all climbed into the red wagon  there was room for all on the broad seats and when all had taken their placesdorothy trot and betsy on the rear seat and capn bill buttonbright and the scarecrow in frontthey called giddap to the sawhorse and the wooden steed moved briskly away pulling the red wagon with ease  it was now that the strangers began to perceive the real beauties of the land of oz for they were passing through a more thickly settled part of the country and the population grew more dense as they drew nearer to the emerald city everyone they met had a cheery word or a smile for the scarecrow dorothy and betsy bobbin and some of them remembered buttonbright and welcomed him back to their country  it was a happy party indeed that journeyed in the red wagon to the emerald city and trot already began to hope that ozma would permit her and capn bill to live always in the land of oz  when they reached the great city they were more amazed than ever both by the concourse of people in their quaint and picturesque costumes and by the splendor of the city itself but the magnificence of the royal palace quite took their breath away until ozma received them in her own pretty apartment and by her charming manners and assuring smiles made them feel they were no longer strangers  trot was given a lovely little room next to that of dorothy while capn bill had the cosiest sort of a room next to trots and overlooking the gardens and that evening ozma gave a grand banquet and reception in honor of the new arrivals while trot had read of many of the people she then met capn bill was less familiar with them and many of the unusual characters introduced to him that evening caused the old sailor to open his eyes wide in astonishment  he had thought the live scarecrow about as curious as anyone could be but now he met the tin woodman who was all made of tin even to his heart and carried a gleaming axe over his shoulder wherever he went then there was jack pumpkinhead whose head was a real pumpkin with the face carved upon it and professor wogglebug who had the shape of an enormous bug but was dressed in neat fitting garments the professor was an interesting talker and had very polite manners but his face was so comical that it made capn bill smile to look at it a great friend of dorothy and ozma seemed to be a machine man called tiktok who ran down several times during the evening and had to be wound up again by someone before he could move or speak  at the reception appeared the shaggy man and his brother both very popular in oz as well as dorothys uncle henry and aunt em two happy old people who lived in a pretty cottage near the palace  but what perhaps seemed most surprising to both trot and capn bill was the number of peculiar animals admitted into ozmas parlors where they not only conducted themselves quite properly but were able to talk as well as anyone  there was the cowardly lion an immense beast with a beautiful mane and the hungry tiger who smiled continually and eureka the pink kitten who lay curled upon a cushion and had rather supercilious manners and the wooden sawhorse and nine tiny piglets that belonged to the wizard and a mule named hank who belonged to betsy bobbin a fuzzy little terrier dog named toto lay at dorothys feet but seldom took part in the conversation although he listened to every word that was said but the most wonderful of all to trot was a square beast with a winning smile that squatted in a corner of the room and wagged his square head at everyone in quite a jolly way betsy told trot that this unique beast was called the woozy and there was no other like him in all the world  capn bill and trot had both looked around expectantly for the wizard of oz but the evening was far advanced before the famous little man entered the room but he went up to the strangers at once and said  i know you but you dont know me so lets get acquainted  and they did get acquainted in a very short time and before the evening was over trot felt that she knew every person and animal present at the reception and that they were all her good friends  suddenly they looked around for buttonbright but he was nowhere to be found  dear me cried trot hes lost again  never mind my dear said ozma with her charming smile no one can go far astray in the land of oz and if buttonbright isnt lost occasionally he isnt happy      the wonderful oz books by l frank baum    the wizard of oz   the land of oz   ozma of oz
