38026863	history of friedrich ii of prussia  frederick the great  by thomas carlyle     appendix  this piece it would seem was translated sixteen years ago some four or five years before any part of the present history of friedrich got to paper the intercalated bits of commentary were as is evident all or mostly written at the same timethese also though they are now become in parts superfluous to a reader that has been diligent i have not thought of changing where not compelled here and there especially in the introductory part some slight additions have crept inwhich the above kind of reader will possibly enough detect and may even have for friendly reasons some vestige of interest in assigning to their new date and comparing with the old note of 1868     a day with friedrich23d july 1779  oberamtmann headmanager fromme was a sisters son of poet gleimgleim canon of halberstadt who wrote prussian grenadiersongs in or in reference to the sevenyears war songs still printed but worth little who begged once after friedrichs death an old hat of his and took it with him to halberstadt where i hope it still is who had a templeofhonor or little gardenhouse so named with portraits of his friends hung in it who put jean paul very soon there with a great explosion of praises and who in short seems to have been a very good effervescent creature at last rather wealthy too and able to effervesce with some comfortoberamtmann fromme i say was this gleims nephew and stood as a kind of royal landbailiff under frederick the great in a tract of country called the rhynluch a dreadfully moory country of sands and quagmires all green and fertile now some twenty or thirty miles northwest of berlin busy there in 1779 and had been for some years past he had originally been an officer of the artillery but obtained his discharge in 1769 and got before long into this employment a man of excellent disposition and temper with a solid and heavy stroke of work in him whatever he might be set to and who in this oberamtmannship became highly esteemed he died in 1798 and has left sons now perhaps grandsons or greatgrandsons who continue estimable in like situations under the prussian government  one of frommes useful gifts the usefulest of all for us at present was his wonderful talent of exact memory he could remember to a singular extent and we will hope on this occasion was unusually conscientious to do it for it so happened in july 1779 23d july friedrich just home from his troublesome bavarian war had arrived at berlin may 27th rodenbeck iii 201 and again looking into everything with his own eyes determined to have a personal view of those moor regions of frommes to take a days driving through that rhynluch which had cost him so much effort and outlay and he ordered fromme to attend him in the expedition which took effect accordingly fromme riding swiftly at the left wheel of friedrichs carriage and loudly answering questions of his all daydirectly on getting home fromme consulted his excellent memory and wrote down everything a considerable paperof which you shall now have an exact translation if it be worth anything fromme gave the paper to uncle gleim who in his enthusiasm showed it extensively about and so soon as there was liberty had it printed at his own expense for the benefit of poor soldiers children gleims edition brought out in 1786 the year of friedrichs death is now quite gonethe book undiscoverable but the paper was reprinted in an anekdotensammlung collection of anecdotes berlin 1787 8tes stuck where i discover it yesterday 17th july 1852 in a copy of mine much to my surprise having before met with it in one hildebrandts anekdotensammlung halberstadt 1830 4tes stuck a rather slovenly book where it is given out as one of the rarest of all rarities and as having been specially furnished by a dr w korte being unattainable otherwise the two copies differ slightly here and therenot always to dr kortes advantage or rather hardly ever i keep them both before me in translating marginale of 1852  the rhyn or rhin is a little river which near its higher clearer sources we were all once well acquainted with considerable little moorland river with several branches coming down from ruppin country and certain lakes and plashes there in a southwest direction towards the elbe valley towards the havel stream into which latter through another plash or lake called gulper see and a few miles farther into the elbe itself it conveys after a course of say 50 english miles circuitously southwest the black drainings of those dreary and intricate peatbogandsand countries luch it appears signifies loch or hole hollow and rhynluch will mean to prussian ears the peatbog quagmire drained by the rhynnew ruppin where this beautiful black stream first becomes considerable and of steadily black complexion lies between 40 and 50 miles northwest of berlin ten or twelve miles farther north is reinsberg properly rhynsberg where friedrich as crownprince lived his happiest few years the details of which were familiar to us long agoand no doubt dwell clear and soft in their appropriate pale moonlight in friedrichs memory on this occasion some time after his accession he gave the place to prince henri who lived there till 1802 it is now fallen all dim and there is nothing at new ruppin but a remembrance  to the hither edge of this rhynluoh from berlin i guess there may be fiveandtwenty miles in a northwest direction from potsdam whence friedrich starts today about the same distance northbywest at seelenhorst where fromme waits him friedrich has already had 30 miles of drivingrate 10 miles an hour as we chance to observe notable things besides the spadehusbandries he is intent on solicit his remembrance in this region of freisack and heavypeg with her didactic batterings there i suppose he in those fixed times knows nothing probably has never heard freisack is on a branch of this same rhyn and he might see it to left a mile or two if he cared  but fehrbellin ferry of belleen distinguished by the shining victory which the great elector friedrichs greatgrandfather gained there over the swedes in 1675 stands on the rhyn itself about midway and friedrich will pass through it on this occasion general ziethen too lives near it at wusterau as will be seen old ziethen a little stumpy man with hanging brows and thick pouting lips unbeautiful to look upon but pious wise silent and with a terrible blaze of fightingtalent in him full of obedience of endurance and yet of unsubduable silent rage which has brooked even the vocal rage of friedrich on occasion a really curious old hussar general he is now a kind of mythical or demigod personage among the prussians and was then 1779 and ever after the sevenyears war regarded popularly as their ajax with a dash of the ulysses superaddedseidlitz another horse general being the achilles of that service  the date of this drive through the moors being 23d july 1779 we perceive it is just about two months since friedrich got home from the bavarian war what they now call potato war so barren was it in fighting so ripe in foraging victorious in a sortand that in his private thought among the big troubles of the world on both sides of the atlantic the infinitesimally small business of the miller arnolds lawsuit is beginning to rise now and then

1787 8te sammlung ss 1579  on the 23d of july 1779 it pleased his majesty the king to undertake a journey to inspect those mud colonies in the rhynluch about neustadtonthedosse which his majesty at his own cost had settled thereby reclaiming a tract of waste moor einen oden bruch urbar machen into arability where now 308 families have their living  his majesty set off from potsdam about 5 in the morning in an open carriage general von gortz along with him and horses from his own poststations travelled over ferlaudt tirotz wustermark nauen konigshorst seelenhorst dechau fehrbellin see reimanns kreiskarten nos 7473 and twelve other small peat villages looking all their brightest in the morning sunto the hills at stollen where his majesty because a view of all the colonies could be had from those hills was pleased to get out for a little as will afterwards be seentherefrom the journey went by hohennauen to rathenau a civilized place where his majesty arrived about 3 in the afternoon and there dined and passed the nightnext morning about 6 his majesty continued his drive into the magdeburg region inspected various reclaimed moors bruche which in part are already made arable and in part are being made so came in the afternoon about 4 over ziesar and brandenburg back to potsdamand did not dine till about 4 when he arrived there and had finished the journey his usual dinnerhour is 12 the state hour on gala days when company has been invited is 1 pmand he always likes his dinner and has it of a hot peppery quality  till seelenhorst the amtsrath sach of konigshorst had ridden before his majesty but here at the border of my fehrbellin district where with one of his forestmen i was in waiting by appointment the turn came for me about 8 oclock am his majesty arrived in seelenhorst had the herr general graf von gortz in the carriage with him gortz we need nt say sitting back foremosthere i fromme with my woodman was respectfully in readiness while the horses were changing his majesty spoke with some of the ziethen hussarofficers who were upon grazing service in the adjoining villages all friedrichs cavalry went out to grass during certain months of the year and it was a landtax on every district to keep its quota of armyhorses in this mannerauf grasung and of me his majesty as yet took no notice as the damme dams or raised roads through the peatbog are too narrow hereabouts i could not ride beside him and so went before or behind with woodman before gott weiss in dechau his majesty got sight of rittmeister von ziethen old ajax ziethens son to whom dechau belongs and took him into the carriage along with him till the point where the dechau boundary is here there was again change of horses captain von rathenow an old favorite of the kings to whom the property of karvesee in part belongs happened to be here with his family he now went forward to the carriage  captain von rathenow humblest servant your majesty unterthanigster knecht different from the form of ending letters but really of the same import  king who are you  captain i am captain von rathenow from karvesee  king clapping his hands together mein gott dear rathenow are you still alive lebt er noch is he still aliveway of speaking to one palpably your inferior scarcely now in use even to servants which friedrich uses always in speaking to the highest uncrowned persons it gives a strange dash of comic emphasis often in his german talk i thought you were long since dead how goes it with you 7 are you whole and well  captain o ja your majesty  king mein gott how fat he has you are grown  captain ja your majesty i can still eat and drink only the feet get lazy wont go so well wollen nicht fort  king ja that is so with me too are you married  captain yea your majesty  king is your wife among the ladies yonder  captain yea your majesty  king bring her to me then to her taking off his hat i find in your herr husband a good old friend  frau von rathenow much grace and honor for my husband  king what were you by birth was sind sie the respectful word fur eine geborne  frau a fraulein von krocher  king haha a daughter of general von krochers  frau ja ihro majestat  king oh i knew him very wellto rathenow have you children too rathenow  captain yes your majesty my sons are in the service soldiering and these are my daughters  king well i am glad of that nun das freut mich fare he well fare he well  the road now went upon fehrbellin and forster forester brand as woodkeeper for the king in these parts rode along with us when we came upon the patch of sandknolls which lie near fehrbellin his majesty cried  forester why arent these sandknolls sown  forester your majesty they dont belong to the royal forest they belong to the farmground in part the people do sow them with all manner of crops here on the right hand they have sown fircones kienapfel  king who sowed them  forester the oberamtmann fromme here  the king to me na tell my geheimerrath michaelis that the sandpatches must be sownto the forester but do you know how fircones kienapfel should be sown  forester o ja your majesty  king na a frequent interjection of friedrichs and his fathers how are they sown then from east to west or from north to south van morgen gegen abend oder van abend gegen morgen so in orig p 22but surely except as above it has no sense from north to south there is but one firseed sown against the wind from east to west there is a whole row  forester from east to west  king that is right but why  forester because the most wind comes from the west  king thats right  now his majesty arrived at fehrbellin spoke there with lieutenant probst of the ziethen hussar regiment probst is the leftmost figure in that chodowiecki engraving of the famous ziethenandfriedrich chairscene five years after this supra 374 n and with the fehrbellin postmeister captain von mosch so soon as the horses were to we continued our travel and as his majesty was driving close by my big ditches graben trenches maindrains which have been made in the fehrbellin luch at the kings expense i rode up to the carriage and said  ich your majesty these now are the two new drains which by your majestys favor we have got here and which keep the luch dry for us  king so so that i am glad ofwho is he are you  fromme your majesty i am the beamte here of fehrbellin  king what s your name  ich fromme  king ha ha you are a son of the landrath frommes  ich your majestys pardon my father was amtsrath in the amt luhnin  king amtsrath amtsrath that isnt true your father was landrath i knew him very wellbut tell me now sagt mir einmal has the draining of the luch been of much use to you here  ich o ja your majesty  king do you keep more cattle than your predecessor  ich yes your majesty on this farm i keep 40 more on all the farms together 70 more  king that is right the murrain viehseuche is not here in this quarter  ich no your majesty  king have you had it here  ich ja  king do but diligently use rocksalt you wont have the murrain again  ich yes your majesty i do use it too but kitchen salt has very nearly the same effect  king no dont fancy that you must nt pound the rocksalt small but give it to the cattle so that they can lick it  ich yes it shall be done  king are there still improvements needed here  ich o ja your majesty here lies the kemmensee kemmenlake if that were drained out your majesty would gain some 1800 acres morgen threefifths english acre of pastureland where colonists could be settled and then the whole country would have navigation too which would help the village of fehrbellin and the town of ruppin to an uncommon degree  king i suppose so be a great help to you wont it and many will be ruined by the job especially the proprietors of the ground nicht wahr ha  ich your majestys gracious pardon ew majestat halten zu gnadenhold me to grace the ground belongs to the royal forest and there grows nothing but birches on it  king oh if birchwood is all it produces then we may see but you must not make your reckoning without your host either that the cost may not outrun the use  ich the cost will certainly not outrun the use for first your majesty may securely reckon that eighteen hundred acres will be won from the water that will be sixandthirty colonists allowing each 50 acres and now if there were a small light toll put upon the rafttimber and the ships that will frequent the new canal there would be ample interest for the outlay  king na tell my geheimerrath michaelis of it the man understands that kind of matters and i will advise you to apply to the man in every particular of such things and wherever you know that colonists can be settled i dont want whole colonies at once but wherever there are two or three families of them i say apply to that man about it  ich it shall be done your majesty  king cant i see wusterau where old ajax ziethen lives from here  ich yes your majesty there to the right that is it it belongs to general von ziethen and terrible building he has had herealmost all his life  king is the general at home  ich ja  king how do you know  ich your majesty the rittmeister von lestock lies in my village on grazing service and last night the herr general sent a letter over to him by a groom in that way i know it  king did general von ziethen gain among others by the draining of the luch  ich o ja the farmstead there to the right he built in consequence and has made a dairy there which he could not have done had not the luch been drained  king that i am glad ofwhat is the beamtes name in altruppin old ruppin i suppose or part of its endless ruppin or rhyn mere catches the kings eye  ich honig  king how long has he been there  ich since trinityterm  king since trinityterm what was he before  ich kanonious a canon  king kanonicus kanonicus how the devil comes a kanonicus to be a beamte  ich your majesty he is a young man who has money and wanted to have the honor of being a beamte of your majesty  king why did nt the old one stay  ich is dead  king well the widow might have kept his amt then  ich is fallen into poverty  king by woman

got no remission since that i never can get on again either  king my son today i have some disorder in my left ear and cannot hear rightly on that side of my head   ich it is a pity that geheimerrath michaelis has got the very same disorderi now retired a little back from the carriage i fancied his majesty might take this answer ill  king na amtmann forward stay by the carriage but take care of yourself that you dont get hurt speak loud i understand very well these words marked in italics capitals his majesty repeated at least ten times in the course of the journey tell me now what is that

ich yea your majesty he was ensign in the regiment prinz ferdinand  king why did the man seek his discharge  ich that i do not know  king you may tell me i have no view in asking why did the man take his discharge  ich your majesty i really cannot say  we had now got on to protzen i perceived old general van ziethen standing before the manorhouse in protzenrugged brave old soul with his hanging brows and strange dimfiery pious old thoughtsi rode forward to the carriage and said  ich your majesty the herr general von ziethen is are sind also here  king where where oh ride forward and tell the people to draw up they must halt ill get out  and now his majesty got out and was exceedingly delighted at the sight of herr general von ziethen talked with him and herr von kleist of many things whether the draining of the luch had done him good whether the murrain had been there among their cattleand recommended rocksalt against the murrain suddenly his majesty stept aside turned towards me and called amtmann then close into my ear who is the fat man there with the white coat  ich also close into his majestys ear your majesty that is the landrath quast of the ruppin circle  king very well  now his majesty went back to general von ziethen and herr von kleist and spoke of different things herr von kleist presented some very fine fruit to his majesty all at once his majesty turned round and said serviteur herr landrathas the landrath fat man there with the white coat was stepping towards his majesty said his majesty stay he there where he is i know him he is the landrath von quastvery good indeed old vater fritz let him stand there in his white coat a fat sufficiently honored manchodowiecki has an engraving of this incidenti saw it at the british museum once where they have only seven others on friedrich altogether all in one poor gotha almanac very small very coarse but very good this quast anglice tassel was one of them marginale of 1862  they had now yoked the horses his majesty took a very tender leave of old general von ziethen waved an adieu to those about and drove on although his majesty at protzen would not take any fruit yet when once we were out of the village his majesty took a luncheon from the carriagepocket for himself and the herr general graf von gortz and all along during the drive ate apricots immer pfirsche  at starting his majesty had fancied i was to stop here and called out of the carriage amtmann come along with us  king where is the beamte of altruppin  ich apparently he must be unwell otherwise he would have been in protzen at the change of horses there at the vorspann yesand manorhouse edelhof where old ziethen waited was lower down the street and sooner than the posthouse  king na tell me now dont you really know why that kleist at protzen took his discharge voila  ich no your majesty i really do not  king what village is this before us  ich manker  king and whose  ich yours your majesty in the amt altruppin  king looking round on the harvestfields here you now how are you content with the harvest  ich very well your majesty  king very well and to me they said very ill  ich your majesty the wintercrop was somewhat frostnipt but the summercrop in return is so abundant it will richly make up for the wintercrop his majesty now looked round upon the fields shock standing upon shock  king it is a good harvest you are right shock stands close by shock here  ich yes your majesty and the people here make steigs mounts of them too  king steigs what is that  ich that is 20 sheaves piled all together  king oh it is indisputably a good harvest but tell me though why did kleist of protzen take his discharge  ich your majesty i do not know i suppose he was obliged to take his fathers estates in hand no other cause do i know of  king whats the name of this village we are coming to  ich garz  king to whom belongs it  ich to the kriegsrath von quast  king to whom belongs it  ich to kriegsrath von quast  king ey was pooh pooh i know nothing of kriegsrathsto whom does the estate belong  ich to herr von quast friedrich had the greatest contempt for kriegsraths and indeed for most other raths or titular shams labelled boxes with nothing in the inside on a horrible wintermorning sleet thunder c marching off hours before sunrise he has been heard to say would one were a kriegsrath  king na that is the right answer  his majesty now arrived at garz the changing of the horses was managed by herr von luderitz of nackeln as first deputy of the ruppin circle he had his hat on and a white feather in it when the yoking was completed our journey proceeded again  king to whom belongs this estate on the left here  ich to herr van luderitz it is called nackeln  king what luderitz is that  ich your majesty he that was in garz while the horses were changing  king ha ha the herr with the white featherdo you sow wheat too  ich ja your majesty  king how much have you sown  ich three wispels 12 scheffels unknown measures  king how much did your predecessor use to sow  ich four scheffels  king how has it come that you sow so much more than he  ich as i have already had the honor to tell your majesty that i keep seventy head of cows more than he i have of course more manure for my ground and so put it in a better case for bearing wheat  king but why do you grow no hemp  ich it would not answer here in a cold climate it would answer better our sailors can buy russian hemp in lubeck cheaper and of better quality than i could grow here  king what do you sow then where you used to have hemp  ich wheat  king why do you sow no farbekraut dyeherb commonly called farberrothe yields a coarse red on decoction of the twigs and branches from its roots the finer red called krapp in french garance is got no krapp  ich it will not prosper the ground is nt good enough  king that is peoples talk you should have made the trial  ich i did make the trial but it failed and as beamte i cannot make many trials for let them fail or not the rent must be paid  king what do you sow then where you would have put farbekraut  ich wheat  king na then stand by wheatyour tenants are in good case i suppose  ich yes your majesty i can show by the register of hypothecks hypothekenbuch that they have about 50 thousand thalers of capital among them  king that is good  ich three years ago a tenant died who had 11000 thalers say 2000 pounds in the bank  king how much  ich eleven thousand thalers  king keep them so always  ich ja your majesty it is very good that the tenant have money but he becomes mutinous too as the tenants hereabouts do who have seven times over complained to your majesty against me to get rid of the hofdienst stated work due from them  king they will have had some cause too  ich your majesty will graciously pardon there was an investigation gone into and it was found that i had not oppressed the tenants but had always gone upon my right and merely held them to do their duty nevertheless the matter stood as it was the tenants are not punished your majesty puts always the tenants in the right the poor beamte is always in the wrong  king ja that you my son will contrive to get justice you i cannot but believe you will send your departmentsrath judge of these affairs such pretty gifts of butter capons poults  ich no your majesty we cannot corn brings no price if one did not turn a penny with other things how could one raise the rent at all  king where do you send your butter capons and poults puter for sale  ich to berlin  king why not to ruppin  ich most of the ruppin people keep cows as many as are needed for their own uses the soldier eats nothing but old salt butter he cannot buy fresh  king what do you get for your butter in berlin  ich four groschen the pound now the soldier at ruppin buys his salt butter at two  king but your capons and poults you could bring these to ruppin  ich in the regiment there are just four staffofficers they can use but little the burghers dont live delicately they thank god when they can get a bit of pork or bacon  king yes there you are in the right the berliners again like to eat some dainty articlena do what you will with the tenants unterthanen not quite adscripts at that time on the royal demesnes but tied to many services and by many shackles from which friedrich all his days was gradually delivering them only dont oppress them  ich your majesty that would never be my notion nor any reasonable beamtes  king tell me then where does stollen lie  ich stollen your majesty cannot see just here those big hills there on the left are the hills at stollen there your majesty will have a view of all the colonies  king so that is well then ride you with us thither  now his majesty came upon a quantity of peasants who were mowing rye they had formed themselves into two rows were wiping their scythes and so let his majesty drive through them  king what the devil these people will be wanting money from me i suppose  ich oh no your majesty they are full of joy that you are so gracious as to visit this district  king ill give them nothing thoughwhat village is that there ahead of us  ich barsekow  king to whom belongs it  ich to herr von mitschepfal  king what mitschepfal is that  ich he was major in the regiment which your majesty had when crownprince supra vii 403  king mein gott is he still alive  ich no he is dead his daughter has the estate  we now came into the village of barsekow where the manorhouse is in ruins  king hear is that the manorhouse edelhof  ich ja  king that does look miserable here mitschepfals daughter who has married a baronial herr von kriegsheim from mecklenburg came forward while the horses were changing kriegsheim came on account of her into this country the king has given them a colony of 200 morgen acres coming to the carriage frau von kriegsheim handed some fruit to his majesty his majesty declined with thanks asked who her father was when he died c on a sudden she presented her husband began to thank for the 200 morgen mounted on the coachstep wished to kiss if not his majestys hand at least his coat his majesty shifted quite to the other side of the carriage and criedgood old fritzlet be my daughter let be it is all wellamtmann let us get along macht dass wir fortkommen  king hear now these people are not prospering here  ich far from it your majesty they are in the greatest poverty  king that is badtell me though there lived a landrath here before he had a quantity of children cant you recollect his name  ich that will have been the landrath von gorgas of genser  king ja ja that was he is he dead now  ich ja your majesty he died in 1771 and it was very singular in one fortnight he his wife and four sons all died the other four that were left had all the same sickness too which was a hot fever and though the sons being in the army were in different garrisons and no brother had visited the other they all got the same illness and came out of it with merely their life left  king that was a desperate affair verzweifelter umstand gewesen where are the four sons that are still in life  ich one is in the ziethen hussars one in the gensdarmes another was in the regiment prinz ferdinand and lives on the estate dersau the fourth is soninlaw of herr general von ziethen he was lieutenant in the ziethen regiment but in the last war potatowar 1778 on account of his ill health your majesty gave him his discharge and he now lives in genser  king so that is one of the gorgases thenare you still making experiments with the foreign kinds of corn  ich o ja this year i have sown spanish barley but it will not rightly take hold i must give it up again however the holstein stoolingrye staudenroggen has answered very

all at once  ich that is not much please your majesty to ask the herr general von gortz who has not spoken a syllable all day he knows this is not reckoned much in holsteinthe general graf von gortz i first had the honor to make acquaintance with in holstein  they now talked for a while of the rye in the carriage together presently his majesty called to me from the carriage na stand by the holstein staudenrye then and give some to the tenants too  ich yes your majesty  king but give me some idea what kind of appearance had the luch before it was drained  ich it was mere high rough masses of hillocks hullen between them the water settled and had no flow in the driest years we couldnt cart the hay out but had to put it up in big ricks only in winter when the frost was sharp could we get it home but now we have cut away the hillocks and the trenches that your majesty got made for us take the water off and now the luch is as dry as your majesty sees and we can carry out our hay when we please  king that is well have your tenants too more cattle than formerly  ich ja  king how many more  ich many have one cow many two according as their means admit  king but how many more have they in all about how many that is  ich about 150 head  his majesty must lately have asked the herr general von gortz how i came to know himas i told his majesty to ask general von gortz about the holstein ryeand presumably the herr general must have answered what was the fact that he had first known me in holstein where i dealt in horses and that i had been at potsdam with horses suddenly his majesty said hear i know you are fond of horses but give up that and prefer cows you will find your account better there  ich your majesty i no longer deal in horses i merely rear a few foals every year  king rear calves instead that will be better  ich oh your majesty if one takes pains with it there is no loss in breeding horses i know a man who got two years ago 1000 thalers for a stallion of his raising  king he must have been a fool that gave it  ich your majesty he was a mecklenburg nobleman  king but nevertheless a fool  we now came upon the territory of the amt neustadt and here the amtsrath klausius who has the amt in farm was in waiting on the boundary and let his majesty drive past but as i began to get tired of the speaking and his majesty went on always asking about villages which stand hereabouts in great quantity and i had always to name the owner and say what sons he had in the armyi brought up herr amtsrath klausius to the carriage and said  ich your majesty this is the amtsrath klausius of the amt neustadt in whose jurisdiction the colonies are  king so so that is very good das ist mir lieb bring him up  king whats your name from this point the king spoke mostly with amtsrath klausius and i only wrote down what i heard  kl klausius  king klausius na have you many cattle here on the colonies  kl 1887 head of cows your majesty there would have been above 3000 had it not been for the murrain that was here  king do the people too increase well are there jolly children  kl o ja your majesty there are now 1576 souls upon the colonies  king are you married too

where we are  kl only a short mile 5 miles english but there are some villages scattered still within the boundary which belong to brandenburg there are stetzebart rosso and so on  king ja ja i know them but i should not have thought we were so near upon the mecklenburg country to the herr amtsrath klausius where were you born  kl at neustadt on the dosse  king what was your father  kl clergyman  king are they good people these colonists the first generation of them is nt usually good for much  kl they are getting on better or worse  king do they manage their husbandry well  kl o ja your majesty his excellency the minister von derschau too has given me a colony of 75 acres to show the other colonists a good example in management  king smiling ha ha good example but tell me i see no wood here where do the colonists get their timber  kl from the ruppin district  king how far is that  kl 3 miles 15 english  king well thats a great way it should have been contrived that they could have it nearer hand to me what man is that to the right there  ich bauinspector buildingsinspector menzelius who has charge of the buildings in these parts  king am i in rome they are mere latin nameswhy is that hedged in so high  ich that is the mulestud  king what is the name of this colony  ich klausiushof  kl your majesty it should be called klaushof  king its name is klausiushof what is the other colony called  ich brenkenhof  king that is not its name  ich ja your majesty i know it by no other  king its name is brenkenhosiushofare these the stollen hills that lie before us  ich ja your majesty  king have i to drive through the village  ich it is not indispensable but the change of horses is there if your majesty give order i will ride forward send the fresh horses out of the village and have them stationed to wait at the foot of the hills  king o ja do so take one of my pages with you  i now took measures about the new team of horses but so arranged it that when his majesty got upon the hills i was there too at dismounting from his carriage on the hilltop his majesty demanded a prospectglass looked round the whole region and then said well in truth that is beyond my expectation that is beautiful i must say this to you all of you that have worked in this business you have behaved like honorable peopleto me tell me now is the elbe far from here  ich your majesty it is 2 miles off 10 miles yonder is wurben in the altmark it lies upon the elbe  king that cannot be give me the glass againja ja it is true though but what other steeple is that  ich your majesty that is havelberg  king na come here all of you there were amtsrath klausius bauinspector menzelius and i hear now the tract of moor here to the left must also be reclaimed and what is to the right too so far as the moor extends what kind of wood is there on it  ich alders elsen and oaks your majesty  king na the alders you may root out and the oaks may continue standing the people may sell these or use them otherwise when once the ground is arable i reckon upon 300 families for it and 500 head of cowshanobody answered at last i began and said  ich ja your majesty perhaps  king hear now you may answer me with confidence there will be more or fewer families i know well enough one cannot all at once exactly say i was never there dont know the ground otherwise i could understand equally with you how many families could be put upon it  the bauinspector your majesty the luch is still subject to rights of common from a great many hands  king no matter for that you must make exchanges give them an equivalent according as will answer best in the case i want nothing from anybody except at its value to amtsrath klausius na hear now you can write to my kammer board boardofworks that does not sit idle what it is that i want reclaimed to the plough the money for it i will give to me and you you go to berlin and explain to my geheimerrath michaelis by word of mouth what it is i want reclaimed  his majesty now stept into his carriage again was gortz sitting all the while still in silence or had he perhaps got out at the bottom of the hill and sat down to a contemplative pipe of tobacco the smoke of which heartcheering to gortz was always disagreeable to friedrich nobody knowsand drove down the hill there the horses were changed and now as his majestys order was that i should attend him to the stollen hills i went up to the carriage and asked  ich does your majesty command that i should yet accompany farther befehlen command in the plural is polite your majesty that i yet farther shall with  king no my son ride in gods name home  the herr amtsrath klausius then accompanied his majesty to rathenow where he they his majesty is plural lodged in the posthouse at rathenow during dinner his majesty was uncommonly cheerful he dined with herr lieutenantcolonel von backhof of the carabineers and the herr lieutenantcolonel von backhof himself has related that his majesty said  my good von backhof mein lieber von backhof if he you have not for a long time been in the fehrbellin neighborhood go there fehrbellin the prussian bannockburn where the great elector cut the hitherto invincible swedes in two among the dams and intricate moory quagmires with a vastly inferior force nearly all of cavalry led by one derflinger who in his apprentice time had been a tailor beat one end of them all to rags then galloped off and beat the other into ditto quite taking the conceit out of the swedes or at least clearing prussia of them forever and a day a feat much admired by friedrich go there he says that region is uncommonly improved as i saw today i have not for a long time had such a pleasant drive i decided on this journey because i had no review on hand and it has given me such pleasure that i shall certainly have another by and by  tell me now how did you get on in the last war kartoffel krieg no fighting only a scramble for proviant and potatoes most likely ill you in saxony too could make nothing out the reason was we had not men to fight against but cannons i might have done a thing or two but i should have sacrificed more than the half of my army and shed innocent human blood in that case i should have deserved to be taken to the guardhouse door and to have got a sixscore there einen offfentlichen produkt wars are becoming frightful to carry on  this was surely touching to hear from the mouth of a great monarch said herr lieutenantcolonel von backhof to me and tears came into that old soldiers eyes afterwards his majesty had said  of the battle of fehrbellin i know everything almost as if i myself had been there while i was crownprince and lay in ruppin there was an old townsman the man was even then very old he could describe the whole battle and knew the scene of it extremely well once i got into a carriage took my old genius with me who showed me all over the ground and described everything so distinctly i was much contented with him as we were coming back i thought come let me have a little fun with the old bladeso i asked him father dont you know then why the two sovereigns came to quarrel with one anothero ja your royal highnesses from this point we have plattdeutsch prussian dialect for the old mans speech barely intelligible as scotch is to an ingenious englishman dat will ick se wohl seggen i can easily tell you that when our chorforste kurfursts great elector was young he studied in utrecht and there the king of sweden happened to be too and now the two young lords picked some quarrel got to pulling caps fell into one anothers hair and dit is nu de picke davon and this now was the upshot of ithis majesty spoke this in plattdeutsch as here givenbut grew at table so weary that he they fell asleep so far backhofand now again fromme by way of finish  of his majestys journey i can give no farther description for though his majesty spoke and asked many things else it would be difficult to bring them all to paper and so ends the day with friedrich the great very flat but i dare say very truea daguerrotype of one of his days
