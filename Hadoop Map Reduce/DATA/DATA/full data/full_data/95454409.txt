95454409	john bull on the guadalquivir from tales from all countries  by anthony trollope     i am an englishman living as all englishman should do in england and my wife would not i think be well pleased were any one to insinuate that she were other than an englishwoman but in the circumstances of my marriage i became connected with the south of spain and the narrative which i am to tell requires that i should refer to some of those details  the pomfrets and daguilars have long been in trade together in this country and one of the partners has usually resided at seville for the sake of the works which the firm there possesses  my father james pomfret lived there for ten years before his marriage and since that and up to the present period old mr daguilar has always been on the spot  he was i believe born in spain but he came very early to england he married an english wife and his sons had been educated exclusively in england  his only daughter maria daguilar did not pass so large a proportion of her early life in this country but she came to us for a visit at the age of seventeen and when she returned i made up my mind that i most assuredly would go after her so i did and she is now sitting on the other side of the fireplace with a legion of small linen habiliments in a huge basket by her side  i felt at the first that there was something lacking to make my cup of love perfectly delightful  it was very sweet but there was wanting that flower of romance which is generally added to the heavenly draught by a slight admixture of opposition  i feared that the path of my true love would run too smooth  when maria came to our house my mother and elder sister seemed to be quite willing that i should be continually alone with her and she had not been there ten days before my father by chance remarked that there was nothing old mr daguilar valued so highly as a thorough feeling of intimate alliance between the two families which had been so long connected in trade  i was never told that maria was to be my wife but i felt that the same thing was done without words and when after six weeks of somewhat elaborate attendance upon her i asked her to be mrs john pomfret i had no more fear of a refusal or even of hesitation on her part than i now have when i suggest to my partner some commercial transaction of undoubted advantage  but maria even at that age had about her a quiet sustained decision of character quite unlike anything i had seen in english girls  i used to hear and do still hear how much more flippant is the education of girls in france and spain than in england and i know that this is shown to be the result of many causesthe roman catholic religion being perhaps chief offender but nevertheless i rarely see in one of our own young women the same power of a self sustained demeanour as i meet on the continent  it goes no deeper than the demeanour people say  i can only answer that i have not found that shallowness in my own wife  miss daguilar replied to me that she was not prepared with an answer she had only known me six weeks and wanted more time to think about it besides there was one in her own country with whom she would wish to consult  i knew she had no mother and as for consulting old mr daguilar on such a subject that idea i knew could not have troubled her  besides as i afterwards learned mr daguilar had already proposed the marriage to his partner exactly as he would have proposed a division of assets  my mother declared that maria was a foolish chitin which bythebye she showed her entire ignorance of miss daguilars character my eldest sister begged that no constraint might he put on the young ladys inclinationswhich provoked me to assert that the young ladys inclinations were by no means opposed to my own and my father in the coolest manner suggested that the matter might stand over for twelve months and that i might then go to seville and see about it  stand over for twelve months  would not maria long before that time have been snapped up and carried off by one of those inordinately rich spanish grandees who are still to be met with occasionally in andalucia  my fathers dictum however had gone forth and maria in the calmest voice protested that she thought it very wise  i should be less of a boy by that time she said smiling on me but driving wedges between every fibre of my body as she spoke  be it so i said proudly  at any rate i am not so much of a boy that i shall forget you  and john you still have the trade to learn she added with her deliciously foreign intonationspeaking very slowly but with perfect pronunciation  the trade to learn  however i said not a word but stalked out of the room meaning to see her no more before she went  but i could not resist attending on her in the hall as she started and when she took leave of us she put her face up to be kissed by me as she did by my father and seemed to receive as much emotion from one embrace as from the other  hell go out by the packet of the 1st april said my father speaking of me as though i were a bale of goods  ah that will be so nice said maria settling her dress in the carriage the oranges will be ripe for him then  on the 17th april i did sail and felt still very like a bale of goods  i had received one letter from her in which she merely stated that her papa would have a room ready for me on my arrival and in answer to that i had sent an epistle somewhat longer and as i then thought a little more to the purpose  her turn of mind was more practical than mine and i must confess my belief that she did not appreciate my poetry  i landed at cadiz and was there joined by an old family friend one of the very best fellows that ever lived  he was to accompany me up as far as seville and as he had lived for a year or two at xeres was supposed to be more spanish almost than a spaniard  his name was johnson and he was in the wine trade and whether for travelling or whether for staying at homewhether for paying you a visit in your own house or whether for entertaining you in histhere never was and i am prepared to maintain there never will be a stancher friend choicer companion or a safer guide than thomas johnson words cannot produce a eulogium sufficient for his merits  but as i have since learned he was not quite so spanish as i had imagined three years among the bodegas of xeres had taught him no doubt to appreciate the exact twang of a good dry sherry but not as i now conceive the exactest flavour of the true spanish character  i was very lucky however in meeting such a friend and now reckon him as one of the stanchest allies of the house of pomfret daguilar and pomfret  he met me at cadiz took me about the town which appeared to me to be of no very great interestthough the young ladies were all very well  but in this respect i was then a stoic till such time as i might be able to throw myself at the feet of her whom i was ready to proclaim the most lovely of all the dulcineas of andalucia  he carried me up by boat and railway to xeres gave me a most terrific headache by dragging me out into the glare of the sun after i had tasted some half a dozen different wines and went through all the ordinary hospitalities  on the next day we returned to puerto and from thence getting across to st lucar and bonanza found ourselves on the banks of the guadalquivir and took our places in the boat for seville  i need say but little to my readers respecting that far famed river  thirty years ago we in england generally believed that on its banks was to be found a pure elysium of pastoral beauty that picturesque shepherds and lovely maidens here fed their flocks in fields of asphodel that the limpid stream ran cool and crystal over bright stones and beneath perennial shade and that every thing on the guadalquivir was as lovely and as poetical as its name  now it is pretty widely known that no uglier river oozes down to its bourn in the sea through unwholesome banks of low mud  it is brown and dirty ungifted by any scenic advantage margined for miles upon miles by huge flat expansive fields in which cattle are reared the bulls wanted for the bullfights among other and birds of prey sit constant on the shore watching for the carcases of such as die such are the charms of the golden guadalquivir  at first we were very dull on board that steamer  i never found myself in a position in which there was less to do  there was a nasty smell about the little boat which made me almost ill every turn in the river was so exactly like the last that we might have been standing still there was no amusement except eating and that when once done was not of a kind to make an early repetition desirable  even johnson was becoming dull and i began to doubt whether i was so desirous as i once had been to travel the length and breadth of all spain  but about noon a little incident occurred which did for a time remove some of our tedium  the boat had stopped to take in passengers on the river and among others a man had come on board dressed in a fashion that to my eyes was equally strange and picturesque  indeed his appearance was so singular that i could not but regard him with care though i felt at first averse to stare at a fellowpassenger on account of his clothes  he was a man of about fifty but as active apparently as though not more than twenty five he was of low stature but of admirable make his hair was just becoming grizzled but was short and crisp and well cared for his face was prepossessing having a look of good humour added to courtesy and there was a pleasant soft smile round his mouth which ingratiated one at the first sight  but it was his dress rather than his person which attracted attention  he wore the ordinary andalucian capof which such hideous parodies are now making themselves common in englandbut was not contented with the usual ornament of the double tuft  the cap was small and jaunty trimmed with silk velvetas is common here with men careful to adorn their persons but this mans cap was finished off with a jewelled button and golden filigree work  he was dressed in a short jacket with a stand up collar and that also was covered with golden buttons and with golden buttonholes  it was all gilt down the front and all lace down the back  the rows of buttons were double and those of the more backward row hung down in heavy pendules  his waistcoat was of coloured silkvery pretty to look at and ornamented with a small sash through which gold threads were worked  all the buttons of his breeches also were of gold and there were gold tags to all the buttonholes  his stockings were of the finest silk and clocked with gold from the knee to the ankle  dress any englishman in such a garb and he will at once give you the idea of a hog in armour  in the first place he will lack the proper spirit to carry it off and in the next place the motion of his limbs will disgrace the ornaments they bear  and so best most englishmen will say  very likely and therefore let no englishman try it  but my spaniard did not look at like a hog in armour  he walked slowly down the plank into the boat whistling lowly but very clearly a few bars from a opera tune  it was plain to see that he was master of himself of his ornaments and of his limbs  he had no appearance of thinking that men were looking at him or of feeling that he was beauteous in his attirenothing could be more natural than his footfall or the quiet glance of his cheery gray eye  he walked up to the captain who held the helm and lightly raised his hand to his cap  the captain taking one hand from the wheel did the same and then the stranger turning his back to the stern of the vessel and fronting down the river with his face continued to whistle slowly clearly and in excellent time  grand as were his clothes they were no burden on his mind  what is he said i going up to my friend johnson with a whisper  well ive been looking at him said johnsonwhich was true enough hes a  an uncommonly goodlooking fellow isnt he  particularly so said i and got up quite irrespective of expense is he aaa gentleman now do you think  well those things are so different in spain that its almost impossible to make an englishman understand them  one learns to know all this sort of people by being with them in the country but one cant explain  no exactly  are they real gold  yes yes i dare say they are  they sometimes have them silver gilt  it is quite a common thing then isnt it asked i  well not exactly thatah yes i see of course  he is a torero  a what  a mayo  i will explain it all to you  you will see them about in all places and you will get used to them  but i havent seen one other as yet  no and they are not all so gay as this nor so new in their finery you know  and what is a torero  well a torero is a man engaged in bullfighting  oh he is a matador is he said i looking at him with more than all my eyes  no not exactly thatnot of necessity  he is probably a mayo  a fellow that dresses himself smart for fairs and will be seen hanging about with the bullfighters  what would be a sporting fellow in englandonly he wont drink and curse like a low man on the turf there  come shall we go and speak to him  i cant talk to him said i diffident of my spanish  i had received lessons in england from maria daguilar but six weeks is little enough for making love let alone the learning of a foreign language  oh  ill do the talking  youll find the language easy enough before long  it soon becomes the same as english to you when you live among them  and then johnson walking up to the stranger accosted him with that goodnatured familiarity with which a thoroughly nice fellow always opens a conversation with his inferior of course i could not understand the words which were exchanged but it was clear enough that the mayo took the address in good part and was inclined to be communicative and social  they are all of pure gold said johnson turning to me after a minute making as he spoke a motion with his head to show the importance of the information  are they indeed said i  where on earth did a fellow like that get them  whereupon johnson again returned to his conversation with the man  after another minute he raised his hand and began to finger the button on the shoulder and to aid him in doing so the man of the bullring turned a little on one side  they are wonderfully well made said johnson talking to me and still fingering the button  they are manufactured he says at osuna and he tells me that they make them better there than anywhere else  i wonder what the whole set would cost said i  an enormous deal of money for a fellow like him i should think  over twelve ounces said johnson having asked the question and that will be more than forty pounds  what an uncommon ass he must be said i  as johnson by this time was very closely scrutinising the whole set of ornaments i thought i might do so also and going up close to our friend i too began to handle the buttons and tags on the other side nothing could have been more goodhumoured than he wasso much so that i was emboldened to hold up his arm that i might see the cut of his coat to take off his cap and examine the make to stuff my finger in beneath his sash and at last to kneel down while i persuaded him to hold up his legs that i might look to the clocking the fellow was thorough goodnatured and why should i not indulge my curiosity  youll upset him if you dont take care said johnson for i had got fast hold of him by one ankle and was determined to finish the survey completely  oh no i shant said i a bullfighting chap can surely stand on one leg  but what i wonder at is how on earth he can afford it whereupon johnson again began to interrogate him in spanish  he says he has got no children said johnson having received a reply and that as he has nobody but himself to look after he is able to allow himself such little luxuries  tell him that i say he would be better with a wife and couple of babies said iand johnson interpreted  he says that hell think of it some of these days when he finds that the supply of fools in the world is becoming short said johnson  we had nearly done with him now but after regaining my feet i addressed myself once more to the heavy pendules which hung down almost under his arm  i lifted one of these meaning to feel its weight between my fingers but unfortunately i gave a lurch probably through the motion of the boat and still holding by the button tore it almost off from our friends coat  oh i am so sorry i said in broad english  it do not matter at all he said bowing and speaking with equal plainness  and then taking a knife from his pocket he cut the pendule off leaving a bit of torn cloth on the side of his jacket  upon my word i am quite unhappy said i but i always am so awkward  whereupon he bowed low  couldnt i make it right said i bringing out my purse  he lifted his hand and i saw that it was small and white he lifted it and gently put it upon my purse smiling sweetly as he did so thank you no senor thank you no  and then bowing to us both he walked away down into the cabin  upon my word he is a deuced wellmannered fellow said i  you shouldnt have offered him money said johnson a spaniard does not like it  why i thought you could do nothing without money in this country doesnt every one take bribes  ah yes that is a different thing but not the price of a button by jove he understood english too  did you see that  yes and i called him an ass  i hope he doesnt mind it  oh no he wont think anything about it said johnson  that sort of fellows dont  i dare say we shall see him in the bullring next sunday and then well make all right with a glass of lemonade  and so our adventure ended with the man of the gold ornaments  i was sorry that i had spoken english before him so heedlessly and resolved that i would never be guilty of such gaucherie again  but then who would think that a spanish bullfighter would talk a foreign language  i was sorry also that i had torn his coat it had looked so awkward and sorry again that i had offered the man money  altogether i was a little ashamed of myself but i had too much to look forward to at seville to allow any heaviness to remain long at my heart and before i had arrived at the marvellous city i had forgotten both him and his buttons  nothing could be nicer than the way in which i was welcomed at mr daguilars house or more kindi may almost say affectionatethan marias manner to me  but it was too affectionate and i am not sure that i should not have liked my reception better had she been more diffident in her tone and less inclined to greet me with open warmth  as it was she again gave me her cheek to kiss in her fathers presence and called me dear john and asked me specially after some rabbits which i had kept at home merely for a younger sister and then it seemed as though she were in no way embarrassed by the peculiar circumstances of our position  twelve months since i had asked her to be my wife and now she was to give me an answer and yet she was as assured in her gait and as serenely joyous in her tone as though i were a brother just returned from college  it could not be that she meant to refuse me or she would not smile on me and be so loving but i could almost have found it in my heart to wish that she would  it is quite possible said i to myself that i may not be found so ready for this family bargain  a love that is to be had like a bale of goods is not exactly the love to suit my taste  but then when i met her again in the morning i could no more have quarrelled with her than i could have flown  i was inexpressibly charmed with the whole city and especially with the house in which mr daguilar lived  it opened from the corner of a narrow unfrequented streeta corner like an elbowand as seen from the exterior there was nothing prepossessing to recommend it but the outer door led by a short hall or passage to an inner door or grille made of open ornamental ironwork and through that we entered a court or patio as they i called it  nothing could be more lovely or deliciously cool than was this small court  the building on each side was covered by trelliswork and beautiful creepers vines and parasite flowers now in the full magnificence of the early summer grew up and clustered round the windows  every inch of wall was covered so that none of the glaring whitewash wounded the eye  in the four corners of the patio were four large orangetrees covered with fruit  i would not say a word in special praise of these remembering that childish promise she had made on my behalf  in the middle of the court there was a fountain and round about on the marble floor there were chairs and here and there a small table as though the space were really a portion of the house it was here that we used to take our cup of coffee and smoke our cigarettes i and old mr daguilar while maria sat by not only approving but occasionally rolling for me the thin paper round the fragrant weed with her taper fingers  beyond the patio was an open passage or gallery filled also with flowers in pots and then beyond this one entered the drawingroom of the house  it was by no means a princely palace or mansion fit for the owner of untold wealth  the rooms were not over large nor very numerous but the most had been made of a small space and everything had been done to relieve the heat of an almost tropical sun  it is pretty is it not she said as she took me through it  very pretty i said  i wish we could live in such houses  oh they would not do at all for dear old fat cold cozy england you are quite different you know in everything from us in the south more phlegmatic but then so much steadier  the men and the houses are all the same  i can hardly tell why but even this wounded me  it seemed to me as though she were inclined to put into one and the same category things english dull useful and solid and that she was disposed to show a sufficient appreciation for such necessaries of life though she herself had another and inner sensea sense keenly alive to the poetry of her own southern chime and that i as being english was to have no participation in this latter charm  an english husband might do very well the interests of the firm might make such an arrangement desirable such a mariage de convenanceso i argued to myselfmight be quite compatible withwith heaven only knows what delights of superterrestial romance from which i as being an english thickheaded lump of useful coarse mortality was to be altogether debarred  she had spoken to me of oranges and having finished the survey of the house she offered me some sweet little cakes  it could not be that of such things were the thoughts which lay undivulged beneath the clear waters of those deep black eyes undivulged to me though no one else could have so good a right to read those thoughts  it could not be that that noble brow gave index of a mind intent on the trade of which she spoke so often  words of other sort than any that had been vouchsafed to me must fall at times from the rich curves of that perfect month  so felt i then pining for something to make me unhappy  ah me  i know all about it now and am content  but i wish that some learned pundit would give us a good definition of romance would describe in words that feeling with which our hearts are so pestered when we are young which makes us sigh for we know not what and forbids us to be contented with what god sends us  we invest female beauty with impossible attributes and are angry because our women have not the spiritualised souls of angels anxious as we are that they should also be human in the flesh  a man looks at her he would love as at a distant landscape in a mountainous land  the peaks are glorious with more than the beauty of earth and rock and vegetation  he dreams of some mysterious grandeur of design which tempts him on under the hot sun and over the sharp rock till he has reached the mountain goal which he had set before him  but when there he finds that the beauty is wellnigh gone and as for that delicious mystery on which his soul had fed it has vanished for ever  i know all about it now and am as i said content  beneath those deep black eyes there lay a well of love good honest homely love love of father and husband and children that were to comeof that love which loves to see the loved ones prospering in honesty  that noble browfor it is noble i am unchanged in that opinion and will go unchanged to my gravecovers thoughts as to the welfare of many and an intellect fitted to the management of a household of servants namely and children and perchance a husband  that mouth can speak words of wisdom of very useful wisdomthough of poetry it has latterly uttered little that was original  poetry and romance they are splendid mountain views seen in the distance  so let men be content to see them and not attempt to tread upon the fallacious heather of the mystic hills  in the first week of my sojourn in seville i spoke no word of overt love to maria thinking as i confess to induce her thereby to alter her mode of conduct to myself  she knows that i have come here to make love to herto repeat my offer and she will at any rate be chagrined if i am slow to do so  but it had no effect  at home my mother was rather particular about her table and marias greatest efforts seemed to be used in giving me as nice dinners as we gave her  in those days i did not care a straw about my dinner and so i took an opportunity of telling her  dear me said she looking at me almost with grief do you not  what a pity  and do you not like music either  oh yes i adore it i replied  i felt sure at the time that had i been born in her own sunny clime she would never have talked to me about eating  but that was my mistake  i used to walk out with her about the city seeing all that is there of beauty and magnificence  and in what city is there more that is worth the seeing  at first this was very delightful to me for i felt that i was blessed with a privilege that would not be granted to any other man  but its value soon fell in my eyes for others would accost her and walk on the other side talking to her in spanish as though i hardly existed or were a servant there for her protection and i was not allowed to take her arm and thus to appropriate her as i should have done in england  no john she said with the sweetest prettiest smile we dont do that here only when people are married  and she made this allusion to married life out openly with no slightest tremor on her tongue  oh i beg pardon said i drawing back my hand and feeling angry with myself for not being fully acquainted with all the customs of a foreign country  you need not beg pardon said she when we were in england we always walked so  it is just a custom you know  and then i saw her drop her large dark eyes to the ground and bow gracefully in answer to some salute  i looked round and saw that we had been joined by a young cavalier a spanish nobleman as i saw at once a man with jet black hair and a straight nose and a black moustache and patent leather boots very slim and very tall andthough i would not confess it then uncommonly handsome  i myself am inclined to be stout my hair is light my nose broad i have no hair on my upper lip and my whiskers are rough and uneven  i could punch your head though my fine fellow said i to myself when i saw that he placed himself at marias side and think very little of the achievement  the wretch went on with us round the plaza for some quarter of an hour talking spanish with the greatest fluency and she was every whit as fluent  of course i could not understand a word that they said  of all positions that a man can occupy i think that that is about the most uncomfortable and i cannot say that even up to this day i have quite forgiven her for that quarter of an hour  i shall go in said i unable to bear my feelings and preparing to leave her  the heat is unendurable  oh dear john why did you not speak before she answered  you cannot leave me here you know as i am in your charge but i will go with you almost directly  and then she finished her conversation with the spaniard speaking with an animation she had never displayed in her conversations with me  it had been agreed between us for two or three days before this that we were to rise early on the following morning for the sake of ascending the tower of the cathedral and visiting the giralda as the iron figure is called which turns upon a pivot on the extreme summit  we had often wandered together up and down the long dark gloomy aisle of the stupendous building and had together seen its treasury of art but as yet we had not performed the task which has to be achieved by all visitors to seville and in order that we might have a clear view over the surrounding country and not be tormented by the heat of an advanced sun we had settled that we would ascend the giralda before breakfast  and now as i walked away from the plaza towards mr daguilars house with maria by my side i made up my mind that i would settle my business during this visit to the cathedral  yes and i would so manage the settlement that there should be no doubt left as to my intentions and my own ideas  i would not be guilty of shillyshally conduct i would tell her frankly what i felt and what i thought and would make her understand that i did not desire her hand if i could not have her heart  i did not value the kindness of her manner seeing that that kindness sprung from indifference rather than passion and so i would declare to her  and i would ask her also who was this young man with whom she was intimatefor whom all her volubility and energy of tone seemed to be employed  she had told me once that it behoved her to consult a friend in seville as to the expediency of her marriage with me  was this the friend whom she had wished to consult  if so she need not trouble herself  under such circumstances i should decline the connection  and i resolved that i would find out how this might be  a man who proposes to take a woman to his bosom as his wife has a right to ask for informationay and to receive it too  it flashed upon my mind at this moment that donna maria was well enough inclined to come to me as my wife but   i could hardly define the buts to myself for there were three or four of them  why did she always speak to me in a tone of childish affection as though i were a schoolboy home for the holidays  i would have all this out with her on the tower on the following morning standing under the giralda  on that morning we met together in the patio soon after five oclock and started for the cathedral  she looked beautiful with her black mantilla over her head and with black gloves on and her black morning silk dressbeautiful composed and at her ease as though she were well satisfied to undertake this early morning walk from feelings of good naturesustained probably by some under current of a deeper sentiment  well i would know all about it before i returned to her fathers house  there hardly stands as i think on the earth a building more remarkable than the cathedral of seville and hardly one more grand its enormous size its gloom and darkness the richness of ornamentation in the details contrasted with the severe simplicity of the larger outlines the variety of its architecture the glory of its paintings and the wondrous splendour of its metallic decoration its altarfriezes screens rails gates and the like render it to my mind the first in interest among churches  it has not the coloured glass of chartres or the marble glory of milan or such a forest of aisles as antwerp or so perfect a hue in stone as westminster nor in mixed beauty of form and colour does it possess anything equal to the choir of cologne but for combined magnificence and awecompelling grandeur i regard it as superior to all other ecclesiastical edifices  it is its deep gloom with which the stranger is so greatly struck on his first entrance  in a region so hot as the south of spain a cool interior is a main object with the architect and this it has been necessary to effect by the exclusion of light consequently the church is dark mysterious and almost cold  on the morning in question as we entered it seemed to be filled with gloom and the distant sound of a slow footstep here and there beyond the transept inspired one almost with awe  maria when she first met me had begun to talk with her usual smile offering me coffee and a biscuit before i started  i never eat biscuit i said with almost a severe tone as i turned from her  that dark horrid man of the plazawould she have offered him a cake had she been going to walk with him in the gloom of the morning  after that little had been spoken between us  she walked by my side with her accustomed smile but she had as i flattered myself begun to learn that i was not to he won by a meaningless good nature  we are lucky in our morning for the view that was all she said speaking with that peculiarly clear but slow pronunciation which she had assumed in learning our language  we entered the cathedral and walking the whole length of the aisle left it again at the porters porch at the farther end  here we passed through a low door on to the stone flight of steps and at once began to ascend  there are a party of your countrymen up before us said maria the porter says that they went through the lodge half an hour since  i hope they will return before we are on the top said i bethinking myself of the task that was before me and indeed my heart was hardly at ease within me for that which i had to say would require all the spirit of which i was master  the ascent to the giralda is very long and very fatiguing and we had to pause on the various landings and in the singular belfry in order that miss daguilar might recruit her strength and breath  as we rested on one of these occasions in a gallery which runs round the tower below the belfry we heard a great noise of shouting and a clattering of sticks among the bells  it is the party of your countrymen who went up before us said she  what a pity that englishmen should always make so much noise  and then she spoke in spanish to the custodian of the bells who is usually to be found in a little cabin up there within the tower  he says that they went up shouting like demons continued maria and it seemed to me that she looked as though i ought to be ashamed of the name of an englishman they may not be so solemn in their demeanour as spaniards i answered but for all that there may be quite as much in them  we then again began to mount and before we had ascended much farther we passed my three countrymen  they were young men with gray coats and gray trousers with slouched hats and without gloves  they had fair faces and fair hair and swung big sticks in their hands with crooked handles  they laughed and talked loud and when we met them seemed to be racing with each other but nevertheless they were gentlemen  no one who knows by sight what an english gentleman is could have doubted that but i did acknowledge to myself that they should have remembered that the edifice they were treading was a church and that the silence they were invading was the cherished property of a courteous people  they are all just the same as big boys said maria  the colour instantly flew into my face and i felt that it was my duty to speak up for my own countrymen  the word boys especially wounded my ears  it was as a boy that she treated me but on looking at that befringed young spanish donwho was not apparently my elder in ageshe had recognised a man  however i said nothing further till i reached the summit  one cannot speak with manly dignity while one is out of breath on a staircase  there john she said stretching her hands away over the fair plain of the guadalquivir as soon as we stood against the parapet is not that lovely  i would not deign to notice this  maria i said i think that you are too hard upon my countrymen  too hard no for i love them  they are so good and industrious and come home to their wives and take care of their children  but why do they make themselves sosowhat the french call gauche  good and industrious and come home to their wives thought i  i believe you hardly understand us as yet i answered  our domestic virtues are not always so very prominent but i believe we know how to conduct ourselves as gentlemen  at any rate as well as spaniards  i was very angrynot at the faults but at the good qualities imputed to us  in affairs of business yes said maria with a look of firm confidence in her own opinionthat look of confidence which she has never lost and i pray that she may never lose it while i remain with herbut in the little intercourses of the world no  a spaniard never forgets what is personally due either to himself or his neighbours  if he is eating an onion he eats it as an onion should be eaten  in such matters as that he is very grand no doubt said i angrily  and why should you not eat an onion properly john  now i heard a story yesterday from donabout two englishmen which annoyed me very much  i did not exactly catch the name of the don in question but i felt through every nerve in my body that it was the man who had been talking to her on the plaza  and what have they done said i  but it is the same everywhere we are always abused but nevertheless no people are so welcome at any rate we pay for the mischief we do  i was angry with myself the moment the words were out of my mouth for after all there is no feeling more mean than that pocketconfidence with which an englishman sometimes swaggers  there was no mischief done in this case she answered  it was simply that two men have made themselves ridiculous for ever  the story is all about seville and of course it annoys me that they should be englishmen  and what did they do  the marquis dalmavivas was coming up to seville in the boat and they behaved to him in the most outrageous manner  he is here now and is going to give a series of fetes  of course he will not ask a single englishman  we shall manage to live even though the marquis dalmavivas may frown upon us said i proudly  he is the richest and also the best of our noblemen continued maria and i never heard of anything so absurd as what they did to him  it made me blush when don  told me  don tomas i thought she said  if he be the best of your noblemen how comes it that he is angry because he has met two vulgar men  it is not to be supposed that every englishman is a gentleman  angry  oh no he was not angry he enjoyed the joke too much for that  he got completely the best of them though they did not know it poor fools  how would your lord john russell behave if two spaniards in an english railway carriage were to pull him about and tear his clothes  he would give them in charge to a policeman of course said i speaking of such a matter with the contempt it deserved  if that were done here your ambassador would be demanding national explanations  but almavivas did much betterhe laughed at them without letting them know it  but do you mean that they took hold of him violently without any provocation  they must have been drunk  oh no they were sober enough  i did not see it so i do not quite know exactly how it was but i understand that they committed themselves most absurdly absolutely took hold of his coat and tore it and but they did such ridiculous things that i cannot tell you  and yet don tomas if that was the mans name had been able to tell her and she had been able to listen to him  what made them take hold of the marquis said i  curiosity i suppose she answered  he dresses somewhat fancifully and they could not understand that any one should wear garments different from their own  but even then the blow did not strike home upon me  is it not pretty to look down upon the quiet town she said coming close up to me so that the skirt of her dress pressed me and her elbow touched my arm  now was the moment i should have asked her how her heart stood towards me but i was sore and uncomfortable and my destiny was before me  she was willing enough to let these english faults pass without further notice but i would not allow the subject i drop  i will find out who these men were said i and learn the truth of it  when did it occur  last thursday i think he said  why that was the day we came up in the boat johnson and myself there was no marquis there then and we were the only englishmen on board  it was on thursday certainly because it was well known in seville that he arrived on that day  you must have remarked him because he talks english perfectlythough bythebye these men would go on chattering before him about himself as though it were impossible that a spaniard should know their language  they are ignorant of spanish and they cannot bring themselves to believe that any one should be better educated than themselves  now the blow had fallen and i straightway appreciated the necessity of returning immediately to clapham where my family resided and giving up for ever all idea of spanish connections  i had resolved to assert the full strength of my manhood on that tower and now words had been spoken which left me weak as a child  i felt that i was shivering and did not dare to pronounce the truth which must be made known  as to speaking of love and signifying my pleasure that don tomas should for the future be kept at a distance any such effort was quite beyond me  had don tomas been there he might have walked off with her from before my face without a struggle on my part  now i remember about it she continued i think he must have been in the boat on thursday  and now that i remember i replied turning away to hide my embarrassment he was there  your friend down below in the plaza seems to have made out a grand story  no doubt he is not fond of the english  there was such a man there and i did take hold  oh john was it you  yes donna maria it was i and if lord john russell were to dress himself in the same way  but i had no time to complete my description of what might occur under so extravagantly impossible a combination of circumstances for as i was yet speaking the little door leading out on to the leads of the tower was opened and my friend the mayo of the boat still bearing gewgaws on his back stepped up on to the platform  my eye instantly perceived that the one pendule was still missing from his jacket  he did not come alone but three other gentlemen followed him who however had no peculiarities in their dress  he saw me at once and bowed and smiled and then observing donna maria he lifted his cap from his head and addressing himself to her in spanish began to converse with her as though she were an old friend  senor said maria after the first words of greeting had been spoken between them you must permit me to present to you my fathers most particular friend and my ownmr pomfret john this is the marquis dalmavivas  i cannot now describe the grace with which this introduction was effected or the beauty of her face as she uttered the word  there was a boldness about her as though she had said i know it allthe whole story  but in spite of that you must take him on my representation and be gracious to him in spite of what he has done you must be content to do that or in quarrelling with him you must quarrel with me also  and it was done at the spur of the moment without delay  she who not five minutes since had been loudly condemning the unknown englishman for his rudeness had already pardoned him now that he was known to be her friend and had determined that he should be pardoned by others also or that she would share his disgrace  i recognised the nobleness of this at the moment but nevertheless i was so sore that i would almost have preferred that she should have disowned me  the marquis immediately lifted his cap with his left hand while he gave me his right  i have already had the pleasure of meeting this gentleman he said we had some conversation in the boat together  yes said i pointing to his rent and you still bear the marks of our encounter  was it not delightful donna maria he continued turning to her your friends friend took me for a torero  and it served you properly senor said donna maria laughing you have no right to go about with all those rich ornaments upon you  oh quite properly indeed i make no complaint and i must beg your friend to understand and his friend also how grateful i am for their solicitude as to my pecuniary welfare  they were inclined to be severe on me for being so extravagant in such trifles  i was obliged to explain that i had no wife at home kept without her proper allowance of dresses in order that i might be gay  they are foreigners and you should forgive their error said she  and in token that i do so said the marquis i shall beg your friend to accept the little ornament which attracted his attention and so saying he pulled the identical button out of his pocket and gracefully proffered it to me  i shall carry it about with me always said i accepting it as a memento of humiliation  when i look at it i shall ever remember the folly of an englishman and the courtesy of a spaniard and as i made the speech i could not but reflect whether it might under any circumstances be possible that lord john russell should be induced to give a button off his coat to a spaniard  there were other civil speeches made and before we left the tower the marquis had asked me to his parties and exacted from me an unwilling promise that i would attend them  the senora he said bowing again to maria would he was sure grace them  she had done so on the previous year and as i had accepted his little present i was bound to acknowledge him as my friend  all this was very pretty and of course i said that i would go but i had not at that time the slightest intention of doing so  maria had behaved admirably she had covered my confusion and shown herself not ashamed to own me delinquent as i was but not the less had she expressed her opinion in language terribly strong of the awkwardness of which i had been guilty and had shown almost an aversion to my english character  i should leave seville as quickly as i could and should certainly not again put myself in the way of the marquis dalmavivas  indeed i dreaded the moment that i should be first alone with her and should find myself forced to say something indicative of my feelingsto hear something also indicative of her feelings  i had come out this morning resolved to demand my rights and to exercise themand now my only wish was to man away  i hated the marquis and longed to be alone that i might cast his button from me  to think that a man should be so ruined by such a trifle  we descended that prodigious flight without a word upon the subject and almost without a word at all  she had carried herself well in the presence of almavivas and had been too proud to seem ashamed of her companion but now as i could well see her feelings of disgust and contempt had returned  when i begged her not to hurry herself she would hardly answer me and when she did speak her voice was constrained and unlike herself  and yet how beautiful she was well my dream of spanish love must be over  but i was sure of this that having known her and given her my heart i could never afterwards share it with another  we came out at last on the dark gloomy aisle of the cathedral and walked together without a word up along the side of the choir till we came to the transept  there was not a soul near us and not a sound was to be heard but the distant low pattering of a mass then in course of celebration at some faroff chapel in the cathedral when we got to the transept maria turned a little as though she was going to the transept door and then stopped herself  she stood still and when i stood also she made two steps towards me and put her hand on my arm  oh john she said  well said i after all it does not signify  you can make a joke of it when my back is turned  dearest johnshe had never spoken to me in that way beforeyou must not be angry with me  it is better that we should explain to each other is it not  oh much better  i am very glad you heard of it at once  i do not look at it quite in the same light that you do but nevertheless  what do you mean  but i know you are angry with me  and yet you cannot think that i intended those words for you  of course i know now that there was nothing rude in what passed  oh but there was  no i am sure there was not  you could not be rude though you are so free hearted  i see it all now and so does the marquis  you will like him so much when you come to know him  tell me that you wont be cross with me for what i have said  sometimes i think that i have displeased you and yet my whole wish has been to welcome you to seville and to make you comfortable as an old friend  promise me that you will not be cross with me  cross with her  i certainly had no intention of being cross but i had begun to think that she would not care what my humour might be maria i said taking hold of her hand  no john do not do that  it is in the church you know  maria will you answer me a question  yes she said very slowly looking dawn upon the stone slabs beneath our feet  do you love me  love you  yes do you love me  you were to give me an answer here in seville and now i ask for it  i have almost taught myself to think that it is needless to ask and now this horrid mischance  what do you mean said she speaking very quickly  why this miserable blunder about the marquiss button  after that i suppose  the marquis  oh john is that to make a difference between you and mea little joke like that  but does it not  make a change between ussuch a thing as that  oh john  but tell me maria what am i to hope  if you will say that you can love me i shall care nothing for the marquis  in that case i can bear to be laughed at  who will dare to laugh at you  not the marquis whom i am sure you will like  your friend in this plaza who told you of all this  what poor tomas  i do not know about his being poor  i mean the gentleman who was with you last night  yes tomas  you do not know who he is  not in the least  how droll  he is your own clerkpartly your own now that you are one of the firm  and john i mean to make you do something for him he is such a good fellow and last year he married a young girl whom i loveoh almost like a sister  do something for him  of course i would  i promised then and there that i would raise his salary to any conceivable amount that a spanish clerk could desire which promise i have since kept if not absolutely to the letter at any rate to an extent which has been considered satisfactory by the gentlemans wife  but mariadearest maria  remember john we are in the church and poor papa will be waiting breakfast  i need hardly continue the story further  it will be known to all that my lovesuit throve in spite of my unfortunate raid on the button of the marquis dalmavivas at whose series of fetes through that month i was i may boast an honoured guest  i have since that had the pleasure of entertaining him in my own poor house in england and one of our boys bears his christian name  from that day in which i ascended the giralda to this present day in which i write i have never once had occasion to complain of a deficiency of romance either in maria daguilar or in maria pomfret
