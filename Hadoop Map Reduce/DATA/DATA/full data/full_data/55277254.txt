manners of scotland at three different periods waverley embraced the age of our fathers guy mannering that of our own youth and the antiquary refers to the last ten years of the eighteenth century i have in the two last narratives especially sought my principal personages in the class of society who are the last to feel the influence of that general polish which assimilates to each other the manners of different nations among the same class i have placed some of the scenes in which i have endeavoured to illustrate the operation of the higher and more violent passions both because the lower orders are less restrained by the habit of suppressing their feelings and because i agree with my friend wordsworth that they seldom fail to express them in the strongest and most powerful language this is i think peculiarly the case with the peasantry of my own country a class with whom i have long been familiar the antique force and simplicity of their language often tinctured with the oriental eloquence of scripture in the mouths of those of an elevated understanding give pathos to their grief and dignity to their resentment  i have been more solicitous to describe manners minutely than to arrange in any case an artificial and combined narrative and have but to regret that i felt myself unable to unite these two requisites of a good novel  the knavery of the adept in the following sheets may appear forced and improbable but we have had very late instances of the force of superstitious credulity to a much greater extent and the reader may be assured that this part of the narrative is founded on a fact of actual occurrence  i have now only to express my gratitude to the public for the distinguished reception which they have given to works that have little more than some truth of colouring to recommend them and to take my respectful leave as one who is not likely again to solicit their favour   to the above advertisement which was prefixed to the first edition of the antiquary it is necessary in the present edition to add a few words transferred from the introduction to the chronicles of the canongate respecting the character of jonathan oldbuck  i may here state generally that although i have deemed historical personages free subjects of delineation i have never on any occasion violated the respect due to private life it was indeed impossible that traits proper to persons both living and dead with whom i have had intercourse in society should not have risen to my pen in such works as waverley and those which followed it but i have always studied to generalise the portraits so that they should still seem on the whole the productions of fancy though possessing some resemblance to real individuals yet i must own my attempts have not in this last particular been uniformly successful there are men whose characters are so peculiarly marked that the delineation of some leading and principal feature inevitably places the whole person before you in his individuality thus the character of jonathan oldbuck in the antiquary was partly founded on that of an old friend of my youth to whom i am indebted for introducing me to shakspeare and other invaluable favours but i thought i had so completely disguised the likeness that it could not be recognised by any one now alive i was mistaken however and indeed had endangered what i desired should be considered as a secret for i afterwards learned that a highly respectable gentleman one of the few surviving friends of my father and an acute critic had said upon the appearance of the work that he was now convinced who was the author of it as he recognised in the antiquary traces of the character of a very intimate friend of my fathers family   the late george constable of wallace craigie near dundee  i have only farther to request the reader not to suppose that my late respected friend resembled mr oldbuck either in his pedigree or the history imputed to the ideal personage there is not a single incident in the novel which is borrowed from his real circumstances excepting the fact that he resided in an old house near a flourishing seaport and that the author chanced to witness a scene betwixt him and the female proprietor of a stagecoach very similar to that which commences the history of the antiquary an excellent temper with a slight degree of subacid humour learning wit and drollery the more poignant that they were a little marked by the peculiarities of an old bachelor a soundness of thought rendered more forcible by an occasional quaintness of expression were the author conceives the only qualities in which the creature of his imagination resembled his benevolent and excellent old friend  the prominent part performed by the beggar in the following narrative induces the author to prefix a few remarks of that character as it formerly existed in scotland though it is now scarcely to be traced  many of the old scottish mendicants were by no means to be confounded with the utterly degraded class of beings who now practise that wandering trade such of them as were in the habit of travelling through a particular district were usually well received both in the farmers ha and in the kitchens of the country gentlemen martin author of the reliquiae divi sancti andreae written in 1683 gives the following account of one class of this order of men in the seventeenth century in terms which would induce an antiquary like mr oldbuck to regret its extinction he conceives them to be descended from the ancient bards and proceedsthey are called by others and by themselves jockies who go about begging and use still to recite the sloggorne gatheringwords or warcries of most of the true ancient surnames of scotland from old experience and observation some of them i have discoursed and found to have reason and discretion one of them told me there were not now above twelve of them in the whole isle but he remembered when they abounded so as at one time he was one of five that usually met at st andrews  the race of jockies of the above description has i suppose been long extinct in scotland but the old remembered beggar even in my own time like the baccoch or travelling cripple of ireland was expected to merit his quarters by something beyond an exposition of his distresses he was often a talkative facetious fellow prompt at repartee and not withheld from exercising his powers that way by any respect of persons his patched cloak giving him the privilege of the ancient jester to be a gude crack that is to possess talents for conversation was essential to the trade of a puir body of the more esteemed class and burns who delighted in the amusement their discourse afforded seems to have looked forward with gloomy firmness to the possibility of himself becoming one day or other a member of their itinerant society in his poetical works it is alluded to so often as perhaps to indicate that he considered the consummation as not utterly impossible thus in the fine dedication of his works to gavin hamilton he says                       and when i downa yoke a naig                     then lord be thankit i can beg  again in his epistle to davie a brother poet he states that in their closing career                       the last ot the warst ot                          is only just to beg  and after having remarked that                    to lie in kilns and barns at een                   when banes are crazed and blude is thin  is doubtless great distress the bard reckons up with true poetical spirit the free enjoyment of the beauties of nature which might counterbalance the hardship and uncertainty of the life even of a mendicant in one of his prose letters to which i have lost the reference he details this idea yet more seriously and dwells upon it as not ill adapted to his habits and powers  as the life of a scottish mendicant of the eighteenth century seems to have been contemplated without much horror by robert burns the author can hardly have erred in giving to edie ochiltree something of poetical character and personal dignity above the more abject of his miserable calling the class had intact some privileges a lodging such as it was was readily granted to them in some of the outhouses and the usual awmous alms of a handful of meal called a gowpen was scarce denied by the poorest cottager the mendicant disposed these according to their different quality in various bags around his person and thus carried about with him the principal part of his sustenance which he literally received for the asking at the houses of the gentry his cheer was mended by scraps of broken meat and perhaps a scottish twalpenny or english penny which was expended in snuff or whiskey in fact these indolent peripatetics suffered much less real hardship and want of food than the poor peasants from whom they received alms  if in addition to his personal qualifications the mendicant chanced to be a kings bedesman or bluegown he belonged in virtue thereof to the aristocracy of his order and was esteemed a parson of great importance  these bedesmen are an order of paupers to whom the kings of scotland were in the custom of distributing a certain alms in conformity with the ordinances of the catholic church and who where expected in return to pray for the royal welfare and that of the state this order is still kept up their number is equal to the number of years which his majesty has lived and one bluegown additional is put on the roll for every returning royal birthday on the same auspicious era each bedesman receives a new cloak or gown of coarse cloth the colour light blue with a pewter badge which confers on them the general privilege of asking alms through all scotlandall laws against sorning masterful beggary and every other species of mendicity being suspended in favour of this privileged class with his cloak each receives a leathern purse containing as many shillings scots videlicet pennies sterling as the sovereign is years old the zeal of their intercession for the kings long life receiving it is to be supposed a great stimulus from their own present and increasing interest in the object of their prayers on the same occasion one of the royal chaplains preaches a sermon to the bedesmen who as one of the reverend gentlemen expressed himself are the most impatient and inattentive audience in the world something of this may arise from a feeling on the part of the bedesmen that they are paid for their own devotions not for listening to those of others or more probably it arises from impatience natural though indecorous in men bearing so venerable a character to arrive at the conclusion of the ceremonial of the royal birthday which so far as they are concerned ends in a lusty breakfast of bread and ale the whole moral and religious exhibition terminating in the advice of johnsons hermit hoar to his proselyte                     come my lad and drink some beer  of the charity bestowed on these aged bedesmen in money and clothing there are many records in the treasurers accompts the

subsists they are now seldom to be seen on the streets of edinburgh of which their peculiar dress made them rather a characteristic feature  having thus given an account of the genus and species to which edie ochiltree appertains the author may add that the individual he had in his eye was andrew gemmells an old mendicant of the character described who was many years since well known and must still be remembered in the vales of gala tweed ettrick yarrow and the adjoining country  the author has in his youth repeatedly seen and conversed with andrew but cannot recollect whether he held the rank of bluegown he was a remarkably fine old figure very tall and maintaining a soldierlike or military manner and address his features were intelligent with a powerful expression of sarcasm his motions were always so graceful that he might almost have been suspected of having studied them for he might on any occasion have served as a model for an artist so remarkably striking were his ordinary attitudes andrew gemmells had little of the cant of his calling his wants were food and shelter or a trifle of money which he always claimed and seemed to receive as his due he sung a good song told a good story and could crack a severe jest with all the acumen of shakespeares jesters though without using like them the cloak of insanity it was some fear of andrews satire as much as a feeling of kindness or charity which secured him the general good reception which he enjoyed everywhere in fact a jest of andrew gemmells especially at the expense of a person of consequence flew round the circle which he frequented as surely as the bonmot of a man of established character for wit glides through the fashionable world many of his good things are held in remembrance but are generally too local and personal to be introduced here  andrew had a character peculiar to himself among his tribe for aught i ever heard he was ready and willing to play at cards or dice with any one who desired such amusement this was more in the character of the irish itinerant gambler called in that country a carrow than of the scottish beggar but the late reverend doctor robert douglas minister of galashiels assured the author that the last time he saw andrew gemmells he was engaged in a game at brag with a gentleman of fortune distinction and birth to preserve the due gradations of rank the party was made at an open window of the chateau the laird sitting on his chair in the inside the beggar on a stool in the yard and they played on the windowsill the stake was a considerable parcel of silver the author expressing some surprise dr douglas observed that the laird was no doubt a humourist or original but that many decent persons in those times would like him have thought there was nothing extraordinary in passing an hour either in cardplaying or conversation with andrew gemmells  this singular mendicant had generally or was supposed to have much money about his person as would have been thought the value of his life among modern footpads on one occasion a country gentleman generally esteemed a very narrow man happening to meet andrew expressed great regret that he had no silver in his pocket or he would have given him sixpencei can give you change for a note laird replied andrew  like most who have arisen to the head of their profession the modern degradation which mendicity has undergone was often the subject of andrews lamentations as a trade he said it was forty pounds ayear worse since he had first practised it on another occasion he observed begging was in modern times scarcely the profession of a gentleman and that if he had twenty sons he would not easily be induced to breed one of them up in his own line when or where this laudator temporis acti closed his wanderings the author never heard with certainty but most probably as burns says                     he died a cadgerpownys death                           at some dike side  the author may add another picture of the same kind as edie ochiltree and andrew gemmells considering these illustrations as a sort of gallery open to the reception of anything which may elucidate former manners or amuse the reader  the authors contemporaries at the university of edinburgh will probably remember the thin wasted form of a venerable old bedesman who stood by the potterrowport now demolished and without speaking a syllable gently inclined his head and offered his hat but with the least possible degree of urgency towards each individual who passed this man gained by silence and the extenuated and wasted appearance of a palmer from a remote country the same tribute which was yielded to andrew gemmells sarcastic humour and stately deportment he was understood to be able to maintain a son a student in the theological classes of the university at the gate of which the father was a mendicant the young man was modest and inclined to learning so that a student of the same age and whose parents where rather of the lower order moved by seeing him excluded from the society of other scholars when the secret of his birth was suspected endeavoured to console him by offering him some occasional civilities the old mendicant was grateful for this attention to his son and one day as the friendly student passed he stooped forward more than usual as if to intercept his passage the scholar drew out a halfpenny which he concluded was the beggars object when he was surprised to receive his thanks for the kindness he had shown to jemmie and at the same time a cordial invitation to dine with them next saturday on a shoulder of mutton and potatoes adding yell put on your clean sark as i have company the student was strongly tempted to accept this hospitable proposal as many in his place would probably have done but as the motive might have been capable of misrepresentation he thought it most prudent considering the character and circumstances of the old man to decline the invitation  such are a few traits of scottish mendicity designed to throw light on a novel in which a character of that description plays a prominent part we conclude that we have vindicated edie ochiltrees right to the importance assigned him and have shown that we have known one beggar take a hand at cards with a person of distinction and another give dinner parties  i know not if it be worth while to observe that the antiquary was not so well received on its first appearance as either of its predecessors though in course of time it rose to equal and with some readers superior popularity   note a mottoes     editors introduction to the antiquary  the antiquary was begun in 1815 the bargain for its publication by constable was made in the october of that year on december 22 scott wrote to morritt i shall set myself seriously to the antiquary of which i have only a very general sketch at present but when once i get my pen to the paper it will walk fast enough i am sometimes tempted to leave it alone and try whether it will not write as well without the assistance of my head as with ita hopeful prospect for the reader it is amazing enough that he even constructed a general sketch for to such sketches he confesses that he never could keep constant i have generally written to the middle of one of these novels without having the least idea how it was to endin short in the hab nab at a venture style of composition journal feb 24 1828 yet it is almost impossible but that the plot of the antiquary should have been duly considered scott must have known from the first who lovel was to turn out to be and must have recognised in the hapless bride of lord glenallan the object of the antiquarys solitary and unfortunate passion to introduce another wandering heir immediately after the harry bertram of guy mannering was rather audacious but that old favourite the lost heir is nearly certain to be popular for the antiquarys immortal sorrow scott had a model in his own experience what a romance to telland told i fear it will one day be and then my three years of dreaming and my two years of wakening will be chronicled doubtless but the dead will feel no pain the dead as aristotle says if they care for such things at all care no more than we do for what has passed in a dream  the general sketch probably began to take full shape about the last day of 1815 on december 29 scott wrote to ballantyne            dear james                ive done thankgod with the long yarns                    of the most prosy of apostlespaul 1                and now advance sweet heathen of monkbarns                   step out old quizz as fast as i can scrawl  in the antiquary scott had a subject thoroughly to his mind he had been an antiquary from his childhood his earliest pence had been devoted to that collection of printed ballads which is still at abbotsford these he mentions in the unfinished fragment of his reliquiae trotcosienses in much the same words as in his manuscript note on one of the seven volumes  this little collection of stall tracts and ballads was formed by me when a boy from the baskets of the travelling pedlars until put into its present decent binding it had such charms for the servants that it was repeatedly and with difficulty recovered from their clutches it contains most of the pieces that were popular about thirty years since and i dare say many that could not now be procured for any price 1810  nor did he collect only                        the rare melody of some old ditties           that first were sung to please king pepins cradle  walter had soon begun to gather outoftheway things of all sorts he had more books than shelves sic a small painted cabinet with scotch and roman coins in it and so forth a claymore and lochaber axe given him by old invernahyle mounted guard on a little print of prince charlie and broughtons saucer was hooked up on the wall below it he had entered literature through the ruined gateway of archleology in the border minstrelsy and his last project was an edition of perraults contes de ma mere loie as pleasant to him as the purchase of new lands like turn again bought dearly as in monkbarnss case from bonnet lauds was a fresh acquisition of an old book or of old armour yet with all his enthusiasm he did not please the antiquaries of his own day george chalmers in constables life and correspondence i 431 sneers at his want of learning his notes are loose and unlearned as they generally are charles kirkpatrick sharpe his friend in life disported himself in jealous and ribald mockery of scotts archaeological knowledge when scott was dead in a letter of the enigmatic thomas allen or james stuart hay father of john sobieski and charles edward stuart this mysterious person avers that he never knew scotts opinion to be held as of any value by antiquaries 1829 they probably missed in him a sort of pettifogging intimacy with dates names and trifling matters of facta tiresome and frivolous accuracy of memory which sir arthur wardour reproves in monkbarns scott in brief was not as dryasdust all the dead bones that he touches come to life he was as great an archeologist as a poet can be and with virgil was the greatest antiquary among poets like monkbarns he was not incapable of being beguiled as oldbuck bought the bodle from the pedlar at the price of a rare coin so scott took surteess barthrams dirge and his latin legend of the tourney with the spectre knight for genuine antiquities no edie ochiltree ever revealed to him the truth about these forgeries and the spectre knight with the ballad of anthony featherstonhaugh hold their own in marmion to assure the world that this antiquary was gullible when the sleight was practised by a friend non est tanti he would have said had he learned the truth for he was ever conscious of the humorous side of the study of the mouldering past i do not know anything which relieves the mind so much from the sullens as a trifling discourse about antiquarian oldwomanries it is like knitting a stockingdiverting the mind without occupying it journal march 9 1828  begun about jan 1 1816 the antiquary was published before may 16 1816 when scott writes to say that he has sent mr morritt the novel some time since it is not so interesting as its predecessors the period does not admit of so much romantic situation but it has been more fortunate than any of them in the sale for six thousand went off in the first six days and it is now at press again the preface of the first edition ends with the melancholy statement that the author takes his respectful leave as one who is not likely again to solicit favour apparently scott had already determined not to announce his next novels the black dwarf and old mortality as by the author of waverley mr constable in the biography of his father says iii 84 even before the publication of the antiquary john ballantyne had been impowered by the author to negotiate with mr murray and mr blackwood for the first series of the tales of my landlord the note of withdrawal from the stage in the first edition of the antiquary was probably only a part of another experiment on public sagacity as lockhart says mr murray and mr blackwood thought that the consequent absence of the author of waverleys name from the tales of my landlord would check very much the first success of the book but they risked this to disturb constables tenure  scotts temporary desertion of constable in the tales of my landlord may have had various motives there was a slight grudge against constable born of some complications of the ballantynes affairs perhaps the mere amusement of the experiment on public sagacity was one of the more powerful reasons for the change in our day lord lytton and mr trollope made similar trials of their popularity when anonymous the former author with the greater success the idea of these masquerades and veils of the incognito appears to have bewitched constable william godwin was writing for him his novel mandeville and godwin had obviously been counselled to try a disguise he says jan 30 1816 i have amused my imagination a thousand times since last we parted with the masquerade you devised for me the world is full of wonder an old favourite is always reviewed with coldness    pooh they say godwin has worn his pen to the stump    but let me once be equipped with a significant mask and an unknown character from your masquerade shop and admitted to figure in with the last minstrel the lady of the lake and guy mannering in the scottish carnival gods how the boys and girls will admire me here is a new wonder they will say ah this is something like here is godwin beaten on his own ground   here is for once a scottish writer that they cannot say has anything of the scotchman about him  however mr godwin did not don the mask and domino mandeville came out about the same time as rob roy but the craziness of the public for the author of waverley was not changed into a passion for the fatherinlaw of shelley  the antiquary after a little pause of hesitation attained popularity not inferior to guy mannering and though the author appears for a moment to have shared the doubts which he read in the countenance of james ballantyne it certainly was in the sequel his chief favourite among all his novels  as scott said to terry if a man will paint from nature he will be likely to amuse those who are daily looking at it the years which saw the first appearance of guy mannering also witnessed that of emma by the singular chance or law which links great authors closely in time giving us novelists in pairs miss austen was drawing from nature at the very moment when scott was wedding nature with romance how generously and wisely he admired her is familiar and it may to some seem curious that he never deliberately set himself to a picture of ordinary life free from the intrusion of the unusual of the heroic once looking down at the village which lies on the tweed opposite melrose he remarked that under its roofs tragedies and tales were doubtless being lived i undertake to say there is some real romance at this moment going on down there that if it could have justice done to it would be well worth all the fiction that was ever spun out of human brains but the example he gave was terribleanything more dreadful was never conceived by crabbe yet adds lockhart it would never have entered into his head to elaborate such a tale he could not dwell in the unbroken gloom dear to some modern malingerers but he could easily have made a tale of common scotch life dark with the sorrow of mucklebackit and bright with the mirth of cuddie headrigg there was however this difficultythat scott cared not to write a story of a single class from the peer to the ploughman all society mingles in each of his novels a fiction of middleclass life did not allure him and he was not at the best but at his worst as sydney smith observed in the light talk of society he could admire miss austen and read her novels again and again but had he attempted to follow her by way of variety then inevitably wild as well as disciplined humour would have kept breaking in and his fancy would have wandered like the old knights of arthurs court at adventure st ronans well proved the truth of all this thus it happens that in the antiquary with all his sympathy for the people with all his knowledge of them he does not confine himself to their cottages as lockhart says in his admirable piece of criticism he preferred to choose topics in which he could display his highest art that of skilful contrast  even the tragic romance of waverley does not set off its macwheebles and callum begs better than the oddities of jonathan oldbuck and his circle are relieved on the one hand by the stately gloom of the glenallans on the other by the stern affliction of the poor fisherman who when discovered repairing the auld black bitch of a boat in which his boy had been lost and congratulated by his visitors on being capable of the exertion makes answer and what would you have me to do unless i wanted to see four children starve because one is drowned it s weel with you gentles that can sit in the house with handkerchers at your een when ye lose a friend but the like o us maun to our work again if our hearts were beating as hard as ony hammer and to his work again scott had to go when he lost the partner of his life  the simple unsought charm which lockhart notes in the antiquary may have passed away in later works when what had been the amusement of happy days became the task of sadness but this magic the antiquary keeps perhaps beyond all its companionsthe magic of pleasant memories and friendly associations the sketches of the epoch of expected invasion with its patriotic musters and volunteer drillings are pictures out of that part in the authors life which with his early highland wanderings waverley and his liddesdale raids guy mannering was most dear to him in redgauntlet again he makes as alan fairford a return on his youth and his home and in rob roy he revives his highland recollections his highland lairds of the blawing bleezing stories none of the rest of the tales are so intimate in their connection with scotts own personal history the antiquary has always therefore been held in the very first rank of his novels  as far as plot goes though godwin denied that it had any story the antiquary may be placed among the most careful the underplot of the glenallans gloomy almost beyond endurance is very ingeniously made to unravel the mystery of lovel the other sidenarrative that of dousterswivel is the weak point of the whole but this scott justifies by very late instances of the force of superstitious credulity to a much greater extent some occurrence of the hour may have suggested the knavish adept with his diviningrod but facts are never a real excuse for the morally incredible or all but incredible in fiction on the wealth and vraisemblance and variety of character it were superfluous to dilate as in shakspeare there is not even a minor person but lives and is of flesh and blood if we except perhaps dousterswivel and sir arthur wardour sir arthur is only sir robert hazlewood over again with a slightly different folly and a somewhat more amiable nature lovels place as usual is among the shades of heroes and his loveaffair is far less moving far more summarily treated than that of jenny caxon the skilful contrasts are perhaps most remarkable when we compare elspeth of the burnfoot with the gossiping old women in the postoffice at fairporta town studied perhaps from arbroath it was the opinion of sydney smith that every one of the novels before the fortunes of nigel contained a meg merrilies and a dominie sampson he may have recognized a male meg in edie ochiltreethe invaluable character who is always behind a wall always overhears everything and holds the threads of the plot or he may have been hypercritical enough to think that elspeth of the burnfoot is the meg of the romance few will agree with him that meg merrilies in either of these cases is good but good too often  the supposed originals of certain persons in the tale have been topics of discussion the character of oldbuck like most characters in fiction is a combination of traits observed in various persons scott says in a note to the ashiestiel fragment of autobiography that mr george constable an old friend of his fathers had many of those peculiarities of character which long afterwards i tried to develop in the character of jonathan oldbuck sir walter when a child made mr constables acquaintance at prestonpans in 1777 where he explored the battlefield under the learned guidance of dalgetty mr constable first introduced him to shakspeares plays and gave him his first german dictionary other traits may have been suggested by john clerk of eldin whose grandfather was the hero of the story praetorian here praetorian there i made it wi a flaughter spade lockhart is no doubt right in thinking that oldbuck is partly a caricature of oldbucks creatorsir walter indeed frankly accepted the kinship and the book which he began on his own collection he proposed to style reliquim trotcosienses or the gabions of jonathan oldbuck  another person who added a few points to oldbuck was sandy gordon author of the itinerarium septentrionale 1726 the very folio which monkbarns carried in the dilatory coach to queensferry gordon had been a student in the university of aberdeen he was an amateur in many arts but antiquarianism was his favourite hobby he was an acquaintance of sir john clerk of eldin the hero of the praetorium the words of gordon in his itinerarium where he describes the battle of the grampians have supplied or suggested the speech of monkbarns at the kaim of kinprunes the great question was where is the mons grampius of tacitus dismissing camdens grantsbain because he does not know where it is gordon says as for our scotch antiquaries they are so divided that some will have it to be in the shire of angus or in the mearns some at the blair of athol in perthshire or ardoch in strathallan and others at inverpeffery gordon votes for strathern half a mile short of the kirk of comrie this spot is both at the foot of the montes grampii and boasts a roman camp capable of holding an army fit to encounter so formidable a number as thirty thousand caledonians    here is the porta decumana opposite the prcetoria together with the dextra and sinistra gates all discovered by sandy gordon moreover the situation of the ground is so very exact with the description given by tacitus that in all my travels through britain i never beheld anything with more pleasure    nor is it difficult in viewing this ground to say where the covinarii or charioteers stood in fine to an antiquary this is a ravishing scene he adds the argument that galgacuss name still remains on this ground for the moor on which the camp stood is called to this day galdachan or galgachan rosmoor all this lore gordon illustrates by an immense chart of a camp and a picture of very small montes grampii about the size and shape of buns the plate is dedicated to his excellency general wade  in another point monkbapns borrows from gordon sandy has a plate page 20 of the roman sacellum of mars signifer vulgarly called arthurs oon with regard to its shape it is not unlike the famous pantheon at rome before the noble portico was added to it by marcus agrippa gordon agrees with stukeley in attributing arthurs oon to agricola and here monkbarns and lovel adopt almost his words time has left julius agricolas very name on the place    and if ever those initial letters j a m p m p t mentioned by sir robert sibbald were engraven on a stone in this building it may not be reckoned altogether absurd that they should bear this reading julius agricola magnus pietatis monumentum posuit templum but this my reader may either accept or reject as he pleases however i think it may be as probably received as that inscription on caligulas pharos in holland which having these following letters c c p f is read caius caligula pharum fecit this monkbarns adds has ever been recorded as a sound exposition  the character of edie ochiltree scott himself avers to have been suggested by andrew gemmells pleasantly described in the introduction mr chambers in illustrations of the author of waverley clears up a point doubtful in scotts memory by saying that geimells really was a bluegown he rode a horse of his own and at races was a bookmaker he once dropped at rutherford in teviotdale a clue of yarn containing twenty guineas like edie ochiltree he had served at fontenoy he died at roxburgh newton in 1793 at the age of one hundred and five according to his own reckoning his wealth was the means of enriching a nephew in ayrshire who is now 1825 a considerable landholder there and belongs to a respectable class of society  an old irus of similar character patrolled teviotdale while andrew gemmells was attached to ettrick and yarrow this was blind willie craw willie was the society journal of hawick and levied blackmail on the inhabitants he is thus described by mr grieve in the diary already quoted he lived at branxholme town in a free house set apart for the gamekeeper and for many a year carried all the bread from hawick used in my fathers family he came in that way at breakfasttime and got a wallet which he put it in and returned at dinnertime with the bawbee rows and two loaves he laid the town of hawick under contribution for bawbees and he knew the history of every individual and went rhyming through the town from door to door and as he knew something against every one which they would rather wish should not be rehearsed a bawbee put a stop to the paragraph which they wished suppressed willie craw was the son of a gamekeeper of the dukes and enjoyed a free house at branxholme town as long as he lived  had burns ever betaken himself to the gaberlunzies life which he speaks of in one of his poems as the last ot the worst ot he would have proved a much more formidable satirist than poor willie craw the last of the blind crowders burns wrote of course in a spirit of reckless humour but he could not even in sport have alluded to the life as suited to his habits and powers had gaberlunzies been mere mendicants in herds collection of ballads is one on the ancient scottish beggar                  in scotland there lived a humble beggar                   he had nor house nor hald nor hame                   but he was well liked by ilk a body                 and they gave him sunkets to rax his wame                  a sieve fu o meal a handfu o groats                   a dad o a bannock or pudding bree                   cauld porridge or the lickings o plates                 wad make him as blythe as a body could be  the dress and trade of the beggar are said to have been adopted by james v in his adventures and tradition attributes to him a song the gaberlunzie man  one of edies most charming traits is his readiness to fight for his dish like the laird for his land when a french invasion was expected scott places the date of the false alarm when he himself rode a hundred miles to join his regiment on feb 2 1804  lockhart gives it as an event of 1805 vol ii p 275 the occasion gave great pleasure to scott on account of the patriotism and courage displayed by all classes me no muckle to fight for says edie isna there the country to fight for and the burns i gang dandering beside and the hearths o the gudewives that gie me my bit bread and the bits o weans that come toddling to play wi me when i come about a landward town edie had fought at fontenoy and was of the old school scott would have been less pleased with a recruit from st boswells on the tweed this man was a shoemaker john younger a very intelligent and worthy person famous as an angler and writer on angling who has left an account of the false alarm in his memoirs his view was that the people unlike edie had nothing to fight for that only the rich had any reason to be patriotic that the french had no quarrel with the poor in fact mr younger was a cosmopolitan democrat and sneered at the old border glories of the warlike days probably however he would have done his duty had the enemy landed and like edie might have remembered the burns he dandered beside always with a fishingrod in his hand       the editor cannot resist the temptation to add that the patriotic      lady mentioned in scotts note who would rather have seen her son      dead on that hearth than hear that he had been a horses length      behind his companions was his paternal greatgrandmother mrs      john lang her husband who died shortly afterwards so that she was      a widow when scott conversed with her chanced to be chief      magistrate of selkirk his family was aroused late one night by the      sound of a carriage hurrying down the steep and narrow street lord      napier was bringing probably from hawick the tidings that the      beacons were ablaze the townbell was instantly rung the      inhabitants met in the marketplace where scotts statue now stands      and the whole force with one solitary exception armed and marched      to dalkeith according to the gentleman whose horse and arms were      sent on to meet him it was intended if the french proved      victorious that the population of the border towns should abandon      their homes and retire to the hills  no characters in the antiquary except monkbarns and edie ochiltree seem to have been borrowed from notable originals the frauds of dousterswivel scott says are rendered plausible by very late instances of the force of superstitious credulity to a much greater extent he can hardly be referring to the career of cagliostro but he may have had in his memory some unsuccessful mining speculations by charles earl of traquair who sought for lead and found little or none in traquair hills the old statistical account of scotland vol xii p 370 says nothing about imposture and merely remarks that the noble family of traquair have made several attempts to discover lead mines and have found quantities of the ore of that metal though not adequate to indemnify the expenses of working and have therefore given up the attempt this was published in 1794 so twenty years had passed when the antiquary was written if there was here an instance of superstitious credulity it was not a very late instance the divining or dowsing rod of dousterswivel still keeps its place in mining superstition and in the search for wells  with the antiquary most contemporary reviews of the novels lose their interest their author had firmly established his position at least till the monastery caused some murmurings even the quarterly review was infinitely more genial in its reception of the antiquary than of guy mannering the critic only grumbled at lovels feverish dreams which he thought showed an intention to introduce the marvellous he complained of the dark dialect of anglified erse but found comfort in the glossary appended the edinburgh review pronounced the chapter on the escape from the tide to be i the very best description we have ever met inverse or in prose in ancient or in modern writing no reviewer seems to have noticed that the sun is made to set in the sea on the east coast of scotland the edinburgh however declared that the antiquary at least in so far as he is an antiquary was the chief blemish on the book the sweet heathen of monkbarns has not suffered from this disparagement the british critic pledged its reputation that scott was the author if an argument were wanted it would be that which has been applied to prove the authenticity of the last book of the iliadthat homer must have written it because no one else could alas that argument does not convince german critics                                              andrew lang      chapter first                 go call a coach and let a coach be called                and let the man who calleth be the caller                and in his calling let him nothing call                but coach coach coach o for a coach ye gods                                  chrononhotonthologos  it was early on a fine summers day near the end of the eighteenth century when a young man of genteel appearance journeying towards the northeast of scotland provided himself with a ticket in one of those public carriages which travel between edinburgh and the queensferry at which place as the name implies and as is well known to all my northern readers there is a passageboat for crossing the firth of forth the coach was calculated to carry six regular passengers besides such interlopers as the coachman could pick up by the way and intrude upon those who were legally in possession the tickets which conferred right to a seat in this vehicle of little ease were dispensed by a sharplooking old dame with a pair of spectacles on a very thin nose who inhabited a laigh shop anglice a cellar opening to the high street by a straight and steep stair at the bottom of which she sold tape thread needles skeins of worsted coarse linen cloth and such feminine gear to those who had the courage and skill to descend to the profundity of her dwelling without falling headlong themselves or throwing down any of the numerous articles which piled on each side of the descent indicated the profession of the trader below  the written handbill which pasted on a projecting board announced that the queensferry diligence or hawes fly departed precisely at twelve oclock on tuesday the fifteenth july 17 in order to secure for travellers the opportunity of passing the firth with the floodtide lied on the present occasion like a bulletin for although that hour was pealed from saint giless steeple and repeated by the tron no coach appeared upon the appointed stand it is true only two tickets had been taken out and possibly the lady of the subterranean mansion might have an understanding with her automedon that in such cases a little space was to be allowed for the chance of filling up the vacant placesor the said automedon might have been attending a funeral and be delayed by the necessity of stripping his vehicle of its lugubrious trappingsor he might have staid to take a halfmutchkin extraordinary with his crony the hostlerorin short he did not make his appearance  the young gentleman who began to grow somewhat impatient was now joined by a companion in this petty misery of human lifethe person who had taken out the other place he who is bent upon a journey is usually easily to be distinguished from his fellowcitizens the boots the greatcoat the umbrella the little bundle in his hand the hat pulled over his resolved brows the determined importance of his pace his brief answers to the salutations of lounging acquaintances are all marks by which the experienced traveller in mailcoach or diligence can distinguish at a distance the companion of his future journey as he pushes onward to the place of rendezvous it is then that with worldly wisdom the first comer hastens to secure the best berth in the coach for himself and to make the most convenient arrangement for his baggage before the arrival of his competitors our youth who was gifted with little prudence of any sort and who was moreover by the absence of the coach deprived of the power of availing himself of his priority of choice amused himself instead by speculating upon the occupation and character of the personage who was now come to the coach office  he was a goodlooking man of the age of sixty perhaps olderbut his hale complexion and firm step announced that years had not impaired his strength or health his countenance was of the true scottish cast strongly marked and rather harsh in features with a shrewd and penetrating eye and a countenance in which habitual gravity was enlivened by a cast of ironical humour his dress was uniform and of a colour becoming his age and gravity a wig well dressed and powdered surmounted by a slouched hat had something of a professional air he might be a clergyman yet his appearance was more that of a man of the world than usually belongs to the kirk of scotland and his first ejaculation put the matter beyond question  he arrived with a hurried pace and casting an alarmed glance towards the dialplate of the church then looking at the place where the coach should have been exclaimed deils in iti am too late after all  the young man relieved his anxiety by telling him the coach had not yet appeared the old gentleman apparently conscious of his own want of punctuality did not at first feel courageous enough to censure that of the coachman he took a parcel containing apparently a large folio from a little boy who followed him and patting him on the head bid him go back and tell mr b that if he had known he was to have had so much time he would have put another word or two to their bargainthen told the boy to mind his business and he would be as thriving a lad as ever dusted a duodecimo the boy lingered perhaps in hopes of a penny to buy marbles but none was forthcoming our senior leaned his little bundle upon one of the posts at the head of the staircase and facing the traveller who had first arrived waited in silence for about five minutes the arrival of the expected diligence  at length after one or two impatient glances at the progress of the minutehand of the clock having compared it with his own watch a huge and antique gold repeater and having twitched about his features to give due emphasis to one or two peevish pshaws he hailed the old lady of the cavern  good womanwhat the dl is her namemrs macleuchar  mrs macleuchar aware that she had a defensive part to sustain in the encounter which was to follow was in no hurry to hasten the discussion by returning a ready answer  mrs macleuchargood woman with an elevated voicethen apart old doited hag shes as deaf as a posti say mrs macleuchar  i am just serving a customerindeed hinny it will no be a bodle cheaper than i tell ye  woman reiterated the traveller do you think we can stand here all day till you have cheated that poor servant wench out of her halfyears fee and bountith  cheated retorted mrs macleuchar eager to take up the quarrel upon a defensible ground i scorn your words sir you are an uncivil person and i desire you will not stand there to slander me at my ain stairhead  the woman said the senior looking with an arch glance at his destined travelling companion does not understand the words of actionwoman again turning to the vault i arraign not thy character but i desire to know what is become of thy coach  whats your wull answered mrs macleuchar relapsing into deafness  we have taken places maam said the younger stranger in your diligence for queensferrywhich should have been halfway on the road before now continued the elder and more impatient traveller rising in wrath as he spoke and now in all likelihood we shall miss the tide and i have business of importance on the other sideand your cursed coach  the coachgude guide us gentlemen is it no on the stand yet answered the old lady her shrill tone of expostulation sinking into a kind of apologetic whine is it the coach ye hae been waiting for  what else could have kept us broiling in the sun by the side of the gutter here youyou faithless woman eh  mrs macleuchar now ascended her trap stair for such it might be called though constructed of stone until her nose came upon a level with the pavement then after wiping her spectacles to look for that which she well knew was not to be found she exclaimed with wellfeigned astonishment gude guide ussaw ever onybody the like o that  yes you abominable woman vociferated the traveller many have seen the like of it and all will see the like of it that have anything to do with your trolloping sex then pacing with great indignation before the door of the shop still as he passed and repassed like a vessel who gives her broadside as she comes abreast of a hostile fortress he shot down complaints threats and reproaches on the embarrassed mrs macleuchar he would take a postchaisehe would call a hackney coachhe would take four horseshe musthe would be on the north side todayand all the expense of his journey besides damages direct and consequential arising from delay should be accumulated on the devoted head of mrs macleuchar  there was something so comic in his pettish resentment that the younger traveller who was in no such pressing hurry to depart could not help being amused with it especially as it was obvious that every now and then the old gentleman though very angry could not help laughing at his own vehemence but when mrs macleuchar began also to join in the laughter he quickly put a stop to her illtimed merriment  woman said he is that advertisement thine showing a bit of crumpled printed paper does it not set forth that god willing as you hypocritically express it the hawes fly or queensferry diligence would set forth today at twelve oclock and is it not thou falsest of creatures now a quarter past twelve and no such fly or diligence to be seendost thou know the consequence of seducing the lieges by false reportsdost thou know it might be brought under the statute of leasingmaking answerand for once in thy long useless and evil life let it be in the words of truth and sincerityhast thou such a coachis it in rerum naturaor is this base annunciation a mere swindle on the incautious to beguile them of their time their patience and three shillings of sterling money of this realmhast thou i say such a coach ay or no  o dear yes sir the neighbours ken the diligence weel green picked oat wi redthree yellow wheels and a black ane  woman thy special description will not serveit may be only a lie with a circumstance  o man man said the overwhelmed mrs macleuchar totally exhausted at having been so long the butt of his rhetoric take back your three shillings and make me quit o ye  not so fast not so fast womanwill three shillings transport me to queensferry agreeably to thy treacherous programor will it requite the damage i may sustain by leaving my business undone or repay the expenses which i must disburse if i am obliged to tarry a day at the south ferry for lack of tidewill it hire i say a pinnace for which alone the regular price is five shillings  here his argument was cut short by a lumbering noise which proved to be the advance of the expected vehicle pressing forward with all the dispatch to which the brokenwinded jades that drew it could possibly be urged with ineffable pleasure mrs macleuchar saw her tormentor deposited in the leathern convenience but still as it was driving off his head thrust out of the window reminded her in words drowned amid the rumbling of the wheels that if the diligence did not attain the ferry in time to save the floodtide she mrs macleuchar should be held responsible for all the consequences that might ensue  the coach had continued in motion for a mile or two before the stranger had completely repossessed himself of his equanimity as was manifested by the doleful ejaculations which he made from time to time on the too great probability or even certainty of their missing the floodtide by degrees however his wrath subsided he wiped his brows relaxed his frown and undoing the parcel in his hand produced his folio on which he gazed from time to time with the knowing look of an amateur admiring its height and condition and ascertaining by a minute and individual inspection of each leaf that the volume was uninjured and entire from titlepage to colophon his fellowtraveller took the liberty of inquiring the subject of his studies he lifted up his eyes with something of a sarcastic glance as if he supposed the young querist would not relish or perhaps understand his answer and pronounced the book to be sandy gordons itinerarium septentrionale a book illustrative of the roman remains in scotland   note b sandy gordons itinerarium  the querist unappalled by this learned title proceeded to put several questions which indicated that he had made good use of a good education and although not possessed of minute information on the subject of antiquities had yet acquaintance enough with the classics to render him an interested and intelligent auditor when they were enlarged upon the elder traveller observing with pleasure the capacity of his temporary companion to understand and answer him plunged nothing loath into a sea of discussion concerning urns vases votive altars roman camps and the rules of castrametation  the pleasure of this discourse had such a dulcifying tendency that although two causes of delay occurred each of much more serious duration than that which had drawn down his wrath upon the unlucky mrs macleuchar our antiquary only bestowed on the delay the honour of a few episodical poohs and pshaws which rather seemed to regard the interruption of his disquisition than the retardation of his journey  the first of these stops was occasioned by the breaking of a spring which half an hours labour hardly repaired to the second the antiquary was himself accessory if not the principal cause of it for observing that one of the horses had cast a forefoot shoe he apprized the coachman of this important deficiency its jamie martingale that furnishes the naigs on contract and uphauds them answered john and i am not entitled to make any stop or to suffer prejudice by the like of these accidents  and when you go toi mean to the place you deserve to go to you scoundrelwho do you think will uphold you on contract if you dont stop directly and carry the poor brute to the next smithy ill have you punished if theres a justice of peace in midlothian and opening the coachdoor out he jumped while the coachman obeyed his orders muttering that if the gentlemen lost the tide now they could not say but it was their ain fault since he was willing to get on  i like so little to analyze the complication of the causes which influence actions that i will not venture to ascertain whether our antiquarys humanity to the poor horse was not in some degree aided by his desire of showing his companion a picts camp or roundabout a subject which he had been elaborately discussing and of which a specimen very curious and perfect indeed happened to exist about a hundred yards distant from the spot where this interruption took place but were i compelled to decompose the motives of my worthy friend for such was the gentleman in the sober suit with powdered wig and slouched hat i should say that although he certainly would not in any case have suffered the coachman to proceed while the horse was unfit for service and likely to suffer by being urged forward yet the man of whipcord escaped some severe abuse and reproach by the agreeable mode which the traveller found out to pass the interval of delay  so much time was consumed by these interruptions of their journey that when they descended the hill above the hawes for so the inn on the southern side of the queensferry is denominated the experienced eye of the antiquary at once discerned from the extent of wet sand and the number of black stones and rocks covered with seaweed which were visible along the skirts of the shore that the hour of tide was past the young traveller expected a burst of indignation but whether as croaker says in the goodnatured man our hero had exhausted himself in fretting away his misfortunes beforehand so that he did not feel them when they actually arrived or whether he found the company in which he was placed too congenial to lead him to repine at anything which delayed his journey it is certain that he submitted to his lot with much resignation  the dls in the diligence and the old hag it belongs todiligence quoth i thou shouldst have called it the slothfly quoth she why it moves like a fly through a gluepot as the irishman says but however time and tide tarry for no man and so my young friend well have a snack here at the hawes which is a very decent sort of a place and ill be very happy to finish the account i was giving you of the difference between the mode of entrenching castra stativa and castra aestiva things confounded by too many of our historians lackaday if they had taen the pains to satisfy their own eyes instead of following each others blind guidancewell we shall be pretty comfortable at the hawes and besides after all we must have dined somewhere and it will be pleasanter sailing with the tide of ebb and the evening breeze  in this christian temper of making the best of all occurrences our travellers alighted at the hawes     chapter second                sir they do scandal me upon the road here                 a poor quotidian rack of mutton roasted                 dry

the crazy steps of the diligence at the inn he was greeted by the fat gouty pursy landlord with that mixture of familiarity and respect which the scotch innkeepers of the old school used to assume towards their more valued customers  have a care o us monkbarns distinguishing him by his territorial epithet always most agreeable to the ear of a scottish proprietor is this you i little thought to

donnard auld crippled idiot what have i to do with the session or the geese that flock to it or the hawks that pick their pinions for them  troth and thats true said mine host who in fact only spoke upon a very general recollection of the strangers original education yet would have been sorry not to have been supposed accurate as to the station and profession of him or any other occasional

theres cranberry tarts very weel preserved andand theres just ony thing else ye like  which is to say there is nothing else whatever well well the fish and the chop and the tarts will do very well but dont imitate the cautious delay that you praise in the courts of justice let there be no remits from the inner to the outer house hear ye me  na na said mackitchinson whose long and heedful perusal of volumes of printed session papers had made him acquainted with some law phrasesthe denner shall be served quam primum and that peremptorie and with the flattering laugh of a promising host he left them in his sanded parlour hung with prints of the four seasons  as notwithstanding his pledge to the contrary the glorious delays of the law were not without their parallel in the kitchen of the inn our younger traveller had an opportunity to step out and make some inquiry of the people of the house concerning the rank and station of his companion the information which he received was of a general and less authentic nature but quite sufficient to make him acquainted with the name history and circumstances of the gentleman whom we shall endeavour in a few words to introduce more accurately to our readers  jonathan oldenbuck or oldinbuck by popular contraction oldbuck of monkbarns was the second son of a gentleman possessed of a small property in the neighbourhood of a thriving seaport town on the northeastern coast of scotland which for various reasons we shall denominate fairport they had been established for several generations as landholders in the county and in most shires of england would have been accounted a family of some standing but the shire ofwas filled with gentlemen of more ancient descent and larger fortune in the last generation also the neighbouring gentry had been almost uniformly jacobites while the proprietors of monkbarns like the burghers of the town near which they were settled were steady assertors of the protestant succession the latter had however a pedigree of their own on which they prided themselves as much as those who despised them valued their respective saxon norman or celtic genealogies the first oldenbuck who had settled in their family mansion shortly after the reformation was they asserted descended from one of the original printers of germany and had left his country in consequence of the persecutions directed against the professors of the reformed religion he had found a refuge in the town near which his posterity dwelt the more readily that he was a sufferer in the protestant cause and certainly not the less so that he brought with him money enough to purchase the small estate of monkbarns then sold by a dissipated laird to whose father it had been gifted with other church lands on the dissolution of the great and wealthy monastery to which it had belonged the oldenbucks were therefore loyal subjects on all occasions of insurrection and as they kept up a good intelligence with the borough it chanced that the laird of monkbarns who flourished in 1745 was provost of the town during that illfated year and had exerted himself with much spirit in favour of king george and even been put to expenses on that score which according to the liberal conduct of the existing government towards their friends had never been repaid him by dint of solicitation however and borough interest he contrived to gain a place in the customs and being a frugal careful man had found himself enabled to add considerably to his paternal fortune he had only two sons of whom as we have hinted the present laird was the younger and two daughters one of whom still flourished in single blessedness and the other who was greatly more juvenile made a lovematch with a captain in the fortytwa who had no other fortune but his commission and a highland pedigree poverty disturbed a union which love would otherwise have made happy and captain mintyre in justice to his wife and two children a boy and girl had found himself obliged to seek his fortune in the east indies being ordered upon an expedition against hyder ally the detachment to which he belonged was cut off and no news ever reached his unfortunate wife whether he fell in battle or was murdered in prison or survived in what the habits of the indian tyrant rendered a hopeless captivity she sunk under the accumulated load of grief and uncertainty and left a son and daughter to the charge of her brother the existing laird of monkbarns  the history of that proprietor himself is soon told being as we have said a second son his father destined him to a share in a substantial mercantile concern carried on by some of his maternal relations from this jonathans mind revolted in the most irreconcilable manner he was then put apprentice to the profession of a writer or attorney in which he profited so far that he made himself master of the whole forms of feudal investitures and showed such pleasure in reconciling their incongruities and tracing their origin that his master had great hope he would one day be an able conveyancer but he halted upon the threshold and though he acquired some knowledge of the origin and system of the law of his country he could never be persuaded to apply it to lucrative and practical purposes it was not from any inconsiderate neglect of the advantages attending the possession of money that he thus deceived the hopes of his master were he thoughtless or lightheaded or rei suae prodigus said his instructor i would know what to make of him but he never pays away a shilling without looking anxiously after the change makes his sixpence go farther than another lads halfcrown and wilt ponder over an old blackletter copy of the acts of parliament for days rather than go to the golf or the changehouse and yet he will not bestow one of these days on a little business of routine that would put twenty shillings in his pocketa strange mixture of frugality and industry and negligent indolencei dont know what to make of him  but in process of time his pupil gained the means of making what he pleased of himself for his father having died was not long survived by his eldest son an arrant fisher and fowler who departed this life in consequence of a cold caught in his vocation while shooting ducks in the swamp called kittlefittingmoss notwithstanding his having drunk a bottle of brandy that very night to keep the cold out of his stomach jonathan therefore succeeded to the estate and with it to the means of subsisting without the hated drudgery of the law his wishes were very moderate and as the rent of his small property rose with the improvement of the country it soon greatly exceeded his wants and expenditure and though too indolent to make money he was by no means insensible to the pleasure of beholding it accumulate the burghers of the town near which he lived regarded him with a sort of envy as one who affected to divide himself from their rank in society and whose studies and pleasures seemed to them alike incomprehensible still however a sort of hereditary respect for the laird of monkbarns augmented by the knowledge of his being a readymoney man kept up his consequence with this class of his neighbours the country gentlemen were generally above him in fortune and beneath him in intellect and excepting one with whom he lived in habits of intimacy had little intercourse with mr oldbuck of monkbarns he had however the usual resources the company of the clergyman and of the doctor when he chose to request it and also his own pursuits and pleasures being in correspondence with most of the virtuosi of his time who like himself measured decayed entrenchments made plans of ruined castles read illegible inscriptions and wrote essays on medals in the proportion of twelve pages to each letter of the legend some habits of hasty irritation he had contracted partly it was said in the borough of fairport from an early disappointment in love in virtue of which he had commenced misogynist as he called it but yet more by the obsequious attention paid to him by his maiden sister and his orphan niece whom he had trained to consider him as the greatest man upon earth and whom he used to boast of as the only women he had ever seen who were well broke in and bitted to obedience though it must be owned miss grizzy oldbuck was sometimes apt to jibb when he pulled the reins too tight the rest of his character must be gathered from the story and we dismiss with pleasure the tiresome task of recapitulation  during the time of dinner mr oldbuck actuated by the same curiosity which his fellowtraveller had entertained on his account made some advances which his age and station entitled him to do in a more direct manner towards ascertaining the name destination and quality of his young companion  his name the young gentleman said was lovel  what the cat the rat and lovel our dog was he descended from king richards favourite  he had no pretensions he said to call himself a whelp of that litter his father was a northofengland gentleman he was at present travelling to fairport the town near to which monkbarns was situated and if he found the place agreeable might perhaps remain there for some weeks  was mr lovels excursion solely for pleasure  not entirely  perhaps on business with some of the commercial people of fairport  it was partly on business but had no reference to commerce  here he paused and mr oldbuck having pushed his inquiries as far as good manners permitted was obliged to change the conversation the antiquary though by no means an enemy to good cheer was a determined foe to all unnecessary expense on a journey and upon his companion giving a hint concerning a bottle of port wine he drew a direful picture of the mixture which he said was usually sold under that denomination and affirming that a little punch was more genuine and better suited for the season he laid his hand upon the bell to order the materials but mackitchinson had in his own mind settled their beverage otherwise and appeared bearing in his hand an immense double quart bottle or magnum as it is called in scotland covered with sawdust and cobwebs the warrants of its antiquity  punch said he catching that generous sound as he entered the parlour the deil a drap punch yese get here the day monkbarns and that ye may lay your account wi  what do you mean you impudent rascal  ay ay its nae matter for thatbut do you mind the trick ye served me the last time ye were here  i trick you  ay just yoursell monkbarns the laird o tamlowrie and sir gilbert grizzlecleuch and auld rossballoh and the bailie were just setting in to make an afternoon ot and you wi some o your auldwarld stories that the mind o man canna resist whirld them to the back o beyont to look at the auld roman campah sir turning to lovel he wad wile the bird aff the tree wi the tales he tells about folk lang syneand did not i lose the drinking o sax pints o gude claret for the deil ane wad hae stirred till he had seen that out at the least  dye hear the impudent scoundrel said monkbarns but laughing at the same time for the worthy landlord as he used to boast

fit for you lairds and i dare say nane of the folk ye speak so much o ever drank either of the twa  do you hear how absolute the knave is well my young friend we must for once prefer the falernian to the vile sabinum  the ready landlord had the cork instantly extracted decanted the wine into a vessel of suitable capaciousness and declaring it parfumed the very room left his guests to make the most of it  mackitchinsons wine was really good and had its effect upon the spirits of the elder guest who told some good stories cut some sly jokes and at length entered into a learned discussion concerning the ancient dramatists a ground on which he found his new acquaintance so strong that at length he began to suspect he had made them his professional study a traveller partly for business and partly for pleasurewhy the stage partakes of both it is a labour to the performers and affords or is meant to afford pleasure to the spectators he seems in manner and rank above the class of young men who take that turn but i remember hearing them say that the little theatre at fairport was to open with the performance of a young gentleman being his first appearance on any stageif this should be thee lovellovel yes lovel or belville are just the names which youngsters are apt to assume on such occasionson my life i am sorry for the lad  mr oldbuck was habitually parsimonious but in no respects mean his first thought was to save his fellowtraveller any part of the expense of the entertainment which he supposed must be in his situation more or less inconvenient he therefore took an opportunity of settling privately with mr mackitchinson the young traveller remonstrated against his liberality and only acquiesced in deference to his years and respectability  the mutual satisfaction which they found in each others society induced mr oldbuck to propose and lovel willingly to accept a scheme for travelling together to the end of their journey mr oldbuck intimated a wish to pay twothirds of the hire of a postchaise saying that a proportional quantity of room was necessary to his accommodation but this mr lovel resolutely declined their expense then was mutual unless when lovel occasionally slipt a shilling into the hand of a growling postilion for oldbuck tenacious of ancient customs never extended his guerdon beyond eighteenpence a stage in this manner they travelled until they arrived at fairport about two oclock on the following day   the fairport of this novel is supposed to refer to the town of  arbroath in forfarshire and musselcrag post to the fishing village of  auchmithie in the same county  lovel probably expected that his travelling companion would have invited him to dinner on his arrival but his consciousness of a want of ready preparation for unexpected guests and perhaps some other reasons prevented oldbuck from paying him that attention he only begged to see him as early as he could make it convenient to call in a forenoon recommended him to a widow who had apartments to let and to a person who kept a decent ordinary cautioning both of them apart that he only knew mr lovel as a pleasant companion in a postchaise and did not mean to guarantee any bills which he might contract while residing at fairport the young gentlemans figure and manners not to mention a wellfurnished trunk which soon arrived by sea to his address at fairport probably went as far in his favour as the limited recommendation of his fellowtraveller     chapter third                   he had a routh o auld nicknackets                  rusty airn caps and jinglinjackets                would held the loudons three in tackets                             a towmond gude                and parritchpats and auld saytbackets                            afore the flude                                            burns  after he had settled himself in his new apartments at fairport mr lovel bethought him of paying the requested visit to his fellowtraveller he did not make it earlier because with all the old gentlemans goodhumour and information there had sometimes glanced forth in his language and manner towards him an air of superiority which his companion considered as being fully beyond what the difference of age warranted he therefore waited the arrival of his baggage from edinburgh that he might arrange his dress according to the fashion of the day and make his exterior corresponding to the rank in society which he supposed or felt himself entitled to hold  it was the fifth day after his arrival that having made the necessary inquiries concerning the road he went forth to pay his respects at monkbarns a footpath leading over a heathy hill and through two or three meadows conducted him to this mansion which stood on the opposite side of the hill aforesaid and commanded a fine prospect of the bay and shipping secluded from the town by the rising ground which also screened it from the northwest wind the house had a solitary and sheltered appearance the exterior had little to recommend it it was an irregular oldfashioned building some part of which had belonged to a grange or solitary farmhouse inhabited by the bailiff or steward of the monastery when the place was in possession of the monks it was here that the community stored up the grain which they received as groundrent from their vassals for with the prudence belonging to their order all their conventional revenues were made payable in kind and hence as the present proprietor loved to tell came the name of monkbarns to the remains of the bailiffs house the succeeding lay inhabitants had made various additions in proportion to the accommodation required by their families and as this was done with an equal contempt of convenience within and architectural regularity without the whole bore the appearance of a hamlet which had suddenly stood still when in the act of leading down one of amphions or orpheuss country dances it was surrounded by tall clipped hedges of yew and holly some of which still exhibited the skill of the topiarian artist and presented curious armchairs towers and the figures of saint george and the dragon   ars topiaria the art of clipping yewhedges into fantastic figures a latin poem entitled ars topiaria contains a curious account of the process  the taste of mr oldbuck did not disturb these monuments of an art now unknown and he was the less tempted so to do as it must necessarily have broken the heart of the old gardener one tall embowering holly was however sacred from the shears and on a garden seat beneath its shade lovel beheld his old friend with spectacles on nose and pouch on side busily employed in perusing the london chronicle soothed by the summer breeze through the rustling leaves and the distant dash of the waves as they rippled upon the sand  mr oldbuck immediately rose and advanced to greet his travelling acquaintance with a hearty shake of the hand by my faith said he i began to think you had changed your mind and found the stupid people of fairport so tiresome that you judged them unworthy of your talents and had taken french leave as my old friend and brotherantiquary maccribb did when he went off with one of my syrian medals  i hope my good sir i should have fallen under no such imputation  quite as bad let me tell you if you had stolen yourself away without giving me the pleasure of seeing you again i had rather you had taken my copper otho himselfbut come let me show you the way into my sanctum sanctorummy cell i may call it for except two idle hussies of womankind by this contemptuous phrase borrowed from his brotherantiquary the cynic anthony awood mr oldbuck was used to denote the fair sex in general and his sister and niece in particular that on some idle pretext of relationship have established themselves in my premises i live here as much a coenobite as my predecessor john o the girnell whose grave i will show you by and by  thus speaking the old gentleman led the way through a low door but before entrance suddenly stopped short to point out some vestiges of what he called an inscription and shaking his head as he pronounced it totally illegible ah if you but knew mr lovel the time and trouble that these mouldering traces of letters have cost me no mother ever travailed so for a childand all to no purposealthough i am almost positive that these two last marks imply the figures or letters lv and may give us a good guess at the real date of the building since we know aliunde that it was founded by abbot waldimir about the middle of the fourteenth centuryand i profess i think that centre ornament might be made out by better eyes than mine  i think answered lovel willing to humour the old man it has something the appearance of a mitre  i protest you are right you are right it never struck me beforesee what it is to have younger eyesa mitrea mitreit corresponds in every respect  the resemblance was not much nearer than that of poloniuss cloud to a whale or an owzel it was sufficient however to set the antiquarys brains to work a mitre my dear sir continued he as he led the way through a labyrinth of inconvenient and dark passages and accompanied his disquisition with certain necessary cautions to his guesta mitre my dear sir will suit our abbot as well as a bishophe was a mitred abbot and at the very top of the rolltake care of these three stepsi know maccribb denies this but it is as certain as that he took away my antigonus no leave askedyoull see the name of the abbot of trotcosey abbas trottocosiensis at the head of the rolls of parliament in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuriesthere is very little light here and these cursed womankind always leave their tubs in the passagenow take care of the cornerascend twelve steps and ye are safe  illustration the antiquary and lovelthe sanctum  mr oldbuck had by this time attained the top of the winding stair which led to his own apartment and opening a door and pushing aside a piece of tapestry with which it was covered his first exclamation was what are you about here you sluts a dirty barefooted chambermaid threw down her duster detected in the heinous fact of arranging the sanctum sanctorum and fled out of an opposite door from the face of her incensed master a genteellooking young woman who was superintending the operation stood her ground but with some timidity  indeed uncle your room was not fit to be seen and i just came to see that jenny laid everything down where she took it up  and how dare you or jenny either presume to meddle with my private matters mr oldbuck hated puttting to rights as much as dr orkborne or any other professed student go sew your sampler you monkey and do not let me find you here again as you value your earsi assure you mr lovel that the last inroad of these pretended friends to cleanliness was almost as fatal to my collection as hudibrass visit to that of sidrophel and i have ever since missed                      my copperplate with almanacks                     engraved upont and other knacks                     my moondial with napiers bones                     and several constellation stones                     my flea my morpeon and punaise                       i purchased for my proper ease  and so forth as old butler has it  the young lady after courtesying to lovel had taken the opportunity to make her escape during this enumeration of losses youll be poisoned here with the volumes of dust they have raised continued the antiquary but i assure you the dust was very ancient peaceful quiet dust about an hour ago and would have remained so for a hundred years had not these gipsies disturbed it as they do everything else in the world  it was indeed some time before lovel could through the thick atmosphere perceive in what sort of den his friend had constructed his retreat it was a lofty room of middling size obscurely lighted by high narrow latticed windows one end was entirely occupied by bookshelves greatly too limited in space for the number of volumes placed upon them which were therefore drawn up in ranks of two or three files deep while numberless others littered the floor and the tables amid a chaos of maps engraving scraps of parchment bundles of papers pieces of old armour swords dirks helmets and highland targets behind mr oldbucks seat which was an ancient leatherncovered easychair worn smooth by constant use was a huge oaken cabinet decorated at each corner with dutch cherubs having their little duckwings displayed and great jolterheaded visages placed between them the top of this cabinet was covered with busts and roman lamps and paterae intermingled with one or two bronze figures the walls of the apartment were partly clothed with grim old tapestry representing the memorable story of sir gawaines wedding in which full justice was done to the ugliness of the lothely lady although to judge from his own looks the gentle knight had less reason to be disgusted with the match on account of disparity of outward favour than the romancer has given us to understand the rest of the room was panelled or wainscotted with black oak against which hung two or three portraits in armour being characters in scottish history favourites of mr oldbuck and as many in tiewigs and laced coats staring representatives of his own ancestors a large oldfashioned oaken table was covered with a profusion of papers parchments books and nondescript trinkets and gewgaws which seemed to have little to recommend them besides rust and the antiquity which it indicates in the midst of this wreck of ancient books and utensils with a gravity equal to marius among the ruins of carthage sat a large black cat which to a superstitious eye might have presented the genius loci the tutelar demon of the apartment the floor as well as the table and chairs was overflowed by the same mare magnum of miscellaneous trumpery where it would have been as impossible to find any individual article wanted as to put it to any use when discovered  amid this medley it was no easy matter to find ones way to a chair without stumbling over a prostrate folio or the still more awkward mischance of overturning some piece of roman or ancient british pottery and when the chair was attained it had to be disencumbered with a careful hand of engravings which might have received damage and of antique spurs and buckles which would certainly have occasioned it to any sudden occupant of this the antiquary made lovel particularly aware adding that his friend the rev doctor heavysterne from the low countries had sustained much injury by sitting down suddenly and incautiously on three ancient calthrops or crawtaes which had been lately dug up in the bog near bannockburn and which dispersed by robert bruce to lacerate the feet of the english chargers came thus in process of time to endamage the sitting part of a learned professor of utrecht  having at length fairly settled himself and being nothing loath to make inquiry concerning the strange objects around him which his host was equally ready as far as possible to explain lovel was introduced to a large club or bludgeon with an iron spike at the end of it which it seems had been lately found in a field on the monkbarns property adjacent to an old buryingground it had mightily the air of such a stick as the highland reapers use to walk with on their annual peregrinations from their mountains but mr oldbuck was strongly tempted to believe that as its shape was singular it might have been one of the clubs with which the monks armed their peasants in lieu of more martial weaponswhence he observed the villains were called colvecarles or kolbkerls that is clavigeri or clubbearers for the truth of this custom he quoted the chronicle of antwerp and that of st martin against which authorities lovel had nothing to oppose having never heard of them till that moment  mr oldbuck next exhibited thumbscrews which had given the covenanters of former days the cramp in their joints and a collar with the name of a fellow convicted of theft whose services as the inscription bore had been adjudged to a neighbouring baron in lieu of the modern scottish punishment which as oldbuck said sends such culprits to enrich england by their labour and themselves by their dexterity many and various were the other curiosities which he showedbut it was chiefly upon his books that he prided himself repeating with a complacent air as he led the way to the crowded and dusty shelves the verses of old chaucer                 for he would rather have at his bedhead                a twenty books clothed in black or red                     of aristotle or his philosophy                     than robes rich rebeck or saltery  this pithy motto he delivered shaking his head and giving each guttural the true anglosaxon enunciation which is now forgotten in the southern parts of this realm  the collection was indeed a curious one and might well be envied by an amateur yet it was not collected at the enormous prices of modern times which are sufficient to have appalled the most determined as well as earliest bibliomaniac upon record whom we take to have been none else than the renowned don quixote de la mancha as among other slight indications of an infirm understanding he is stated by his veracious historian cid hamet benengeli to have exchanged fields and farms for folios and quartos of chivalry in this species of exploit the good knighterrant has been imitated by lords knights and squires of our own day though we have not yet heard of any that has mistaken an inn for a castle or laid his lance in rest against a windmill mr oldbuck did not follow these collectors in such excess of expenditure but taking a pleasure in the personal labour of forming his library saved his purse at the expense of his time and toil he was no encourager of that ingenious race of peripatetic middlemen who trafficking between the obscure keeper of a stall and the eager amateur make their profit at once of the ignorance of the former and the dearbought skill and taste of the latter when such were mentioned in his hearing he seldom failed to point out how necessary it was to arrest the object of your curiosity in its first transit and to tell his favourite story of snuffy davie and caxtons game at chessdavy wilson he said commonly called snuffy davy from his inveterate addiction to black rappee was the very prince of scouts for searching blind alleys cellars and stalls for rare volumes he had the scent of a slowhound sir and the snap of a bulldog he would detect you an old blackletter ballad among the leaves of a lawpaper and find an editio princeps under the mask of a school corderius snuffy davy bought the game of chess 1474 the first book ever printed in england from a stall in holland for about two groschen or twopence of our money he sold it to osborne for twenty pounds and as many books as came to twenty pounds more osborne resold this inimitable windfall to dr askew for sixty guineas at dr askews sale continued the old gentleman kindling as he spoke this inestimable treasure blazed forth in its full value and was purchased by royalty itself for one hundred and seventy poundscould a copy now occur lord only knows he ejaculated with a deep sigh and liftedup handslord only knows what would be its ransom and yet it was originally secured by skill and research for the easy equivalent of twopence sterling  happy thrice happy snuffy davieand blessed were the times when thy industry could be so rewarded   this bibliomaniacal anecdote is literally true and david wilson the author need not tell his brethren of the roxburghe and bannatyne clubs was a real personage  even i sir he went on though far inferior in industry and discernment and presence of mind to that great man can show you a fewa very few things which i have collected not by force of money as any wealthy man mightalthough as my friend lucian says he might chance to throw away his coin only to illustrate his ignorancebut gained in a manner that shows i know something of the matter see this bundle of ballads not one of them later than 1700 and some of them an hundred years older i wheedled an old woman out of these who loved them better than her psalmbook tobacco sir snuff and the complete syren were the equivalent for that mutilated copy of the complaynt of scotland i sat out the drinking of two dozen bottles of strong ale with the late learned proprietor who in gratitude bequeathed it to me by his last will these little elzevirs are the memoranda and trophies of many a walk by night and morning through the cowgate the canongate the bow st marys wyndwherever in fine there were to be found brokers and trokers those miscellaneous dealers in things rare and curious how often have i stood haggling on a halfpenny lest by a too ready acquiescence in the dealers first price he should be led to suspect the value i set upon the articlehow have i trembled lest some passing stranger should chop in between me and the prize and regarded each poor student of divinity that stopped to turn over the books at the stall as a rival amateur or prowling bookseller in disguiseand then mr lovel the sly satisfaction with which one pays the consideration and pockets the article affecting a cold indifference while the hand is trembling with pleasurethen to dazzle the eyes of our wealthier and emulous rivals by showing them such a treasure as this displaying a little black smoked book about the size of a primer to enjoy their surprise and envy shrouding meanwhile under a veil of mysterious consciousness our own superior knowledge and dexterity these my young friend these are the white moments of life that repay the toil and pains and sedulous attention which our profession above all others so peculiarly demands  lovel was not a little amused at hearing the old gentleman run on in this manner and however incapable of entering into the full merits of what he beheld he admired as much as could have been expected the various treasures which oldbuck exhibited here were editions esteemed as being the first and there stood those scarcely less regarded as being the last and best here was a book valued because it had the authors final improvements and there another which strange to tell was in request because it had them not one was precious because it was a folio another because it was a duodecimo some because they were tall some because they were short the merit of this lay in the titlepageof that in the arrangement of the letters in the word finis there was it seemed no peculiar distinction however trifling or minute which might not give value to a volume providing the indispensable quality of scarcity or rare occurrence was attached to it  not the least fascinating was the original broadsidethe dying speech bloody murder or wonderful wonder of wondersin its primary tattered guise as it was hawked through the streets and sold for the cheap and easy price of one penny though now worth the weight of that penny in gold on these the antiquary dilated with transport and read with a rapturous voice the elaborate titles which bore the same proportion to the contents that the painted signs without a showmans booth do to the animals within mr oldbuck for example piqued himself especially in possessing an unique broadside entitled and called strange and wonderful news from chippingnorton in the county of oxon of certain dreadful apparitions which were seen in the air on the 26th of july 1610 at half an hour after nine oclock at noon and continued till eleven in which time was seen appearances of several flaming swords strange motions of the superior orbs with the unusual sparkling of the stars with their dreadful continuations with the account of the opening of the heavens and strange appearances therein disclosing themselves with several other prodigious circumstances not heard of in any age to the great amazement of the beholders as it was communicated in a letter to one mr colley living in west smithfield and attested by thomas brown elizabeth greenaway and anne gutheridge who were spectators of the dreadful apparitions and if any one would be further satisfied of the truth of this relation let them repair to mr nightingales at the bear inn in west smithfield and they may be satisfied   of this thrice and four times rare broadside the author possesses an exemplar  you laugh at this said the proprietor of the collection and i forgive you i do acknowledge that the charms on which we doat are not so obvious to the eyes of youth as those of a fair lady but you will grow wiser and see more justly when you come to wear spectaclesyet stay i have one piece of antiquity which you perhaps will prize more highly  so saying mr oldbuck unlocked a drawer and took out a bundle of keys then pulled aside a piece of the tapestry which concealed the door of a small closet into which he descended by four stone steps and after some tinkling among bottles and cans produced two longstalked wineglasses with bell mouths such as are seen in teniers pieces and a small bottle of what he called rich racy canary with a little bit of diet cake on a small silver server of exquisite old workmanship i will say nothing of the server he remarked though it is said to have been wrought by the old mad florentine benvenuto cellini but mr lovel our ancestors drank sackyou who admire the drama know where thats to be foundheres success to your exertions at fairport sir  and to you sir and an ample increase to your treasure with no more trouble on your part than is just necessary to make the acquisitions valuable  after a libation so suitable to the amusement in which they had been engaged lovel rose to take his leave and mr oldbuck prepared to give him his company a part of the way and show him something worthy of his curiosity on his return to fairport     chapter fourth                  the pawkie auld carle cam ower the lea                 wi mony goodeens and goodmorrows to me                     saying kind sir for your courtesy                     will ye lodge a silly puir man                                   the gaberlunzie man  our two friends moved through a little orchard where the aged appletrees well loaded with fruit showed as is usual in the neighbourhood of monastic buildings that the days of the monks had not always been spent in indolence but often dedicated to horticulture and gardening mr oldbuck failed not to make lovel remark that the planters of those days were possessed of the modern secret of preventing the roots of the fruittrees from penetrating the till and compelling them to spread in a lateral direction by placing pavingstones beneath the trees when first planted so as to interpose between their fibres and the subsoil this old fellow he said which was blown down last summer and still though half reclined on the ground is covered with fruit has been as you may see accommodated with such a barrier between his roots and the unkindly till that other tree has a storythe fruit is called the abbots apple the lady of a neighbouring baron was so fond of it that she would often pay a visit to monkbarns to have the pleasure of gathering it from the tree the husband a jealous man belike suspected that a taste so nearly resembling that of mother eve prognosticated a similar fall as the honour of a noble family is concerned i will say no more on the subject only that the lands of lochard and cringlecut still pay a fine of six bolls of barley annually to atone the guilt of their audacious owner who intruded himself and his worldly suspicions upon the seclusion of the abbot and his penitentadmire the little belfry rising above the ivymantled porchthere was here a hospitium hospitale or hospitamentum for it is written all these various ways in the old writings and evidents in which the monks received pilgrims i know our minister has said in the statistical account that the hospitium was situated either in the lands of haltweary or upon those of halfstarvet but he is incorrect mr lovelthat is the gate called still the palmers port and my gardener found many hewn stones when he was trenching the ground for winter celery several of which i have sent as specimens to my learned friends and to the various antiquarian societies of which i am an unworthy member but i will say no more at present i reserve something for another visit and we have an object of real curiosity before us  while he was thus speaking he led the way briskly through one or two rich pasturemeadows to an open heath or common and so to the top of a gentle eminence here he said mr lovel is a truly remarkable spot  it commands a fine view said his companion looking around him  true but it is not for the prospect i brought you hither do you see nothing else remarkablenothing on the surface of the ground  why yes i do see something like a ditch indistinctly marked  indistinctlypardon me sir but the indistinctness must be in your powers of vision nothing can be more plainly traceda proper agger or vallum with its corresponding ditch or fossa indistinctly why heaven help you the lassie my niece as lightheaded a goose as womankind affords saw the traces of the ditch at once indistinctwhy the great station at ardoch or that at burnswark in annandale may be clearer doubtless because they are stative forts whereas this was only an occasional encampment indistinctwhy you must suppose that fools boors and idiots have ploughed up the land and like beasts and ignorant savages have thereby obliterated two sides of the square and greatly injured the third but you see yourself the fourth side is quite entire  lovel endeavoured to apologize and to explain away his illtimed phrase and pleaded his inexperience but he was not at once quite successful his first expression had come too frankly and naturally not to alarm the antiquary and he could not easily get over the shock it had given him  my dear sir continued the senior your eyes are not inexperienced you know a ditch from level ground i presume when you see them indistinct why the very common people the very least boy that can herd a cow calls it the kaim of kinprunes and if that does not imply an ancient camp i am ignorant what does  lovel having again acquiesced and at length lulled to sleep the irritated and suspicious vanity of the antiquary he proceeded in his task of cicerone you must know he said our scottish antiquaries have been greatly divided about the local situation of the final conflict between agricola and the caledonians some contend for ardoch in strathallan some for innerpeffry some for the raedykes in the mearns and some are for carrying the scene of action as far north as blair in athole now after all this discussion continued the old gentleman with one of his slyest and most complacent looks what would you think mr loveli say what would you thinkif the memorable scene of conflict should happen to be on the very spot called the kaim of kinprunes the property of the obscure and humble individual who now speaks to you then having paused a little to suffer his guest to digest a communication so important he resumed his disquisition in a higher tone yes my good friend i am indeed greatly deceived if this place does not correspond with all the marks of that celebrated place of action it was near to the grampian mountainslo yonder they are mixing and contending with the sky on the skirts of the horizon it was in conspectu classisin sight of the roman fleet and would any admiral roman or british wish a fairer bay to ride in than that on your right hand it is astonishing how blind we professed antiquaries sometimes are sir robert sibbald saunders gordon general roy dr stokelywhy it escaped all of them i was unwilling to say a word about it till i had secured the ground for it belonged to auld johnnie howie a bonnetlaird hard by and many a communing we had before he and i could agree   a bonnetlaird signifies a petty proprietor wearing the dress along with the habits of a yeoman  at lengthi am almost ashamed to say itbut i even brought my mind to give acre for acre of my good cornland for this barren spot but then it was a national concern and when the scene of so celebrated an event became my own i was overpaidwhose patriotism would not grow warmer as old johnson says on the plains of marathon i began to trench the ground to see what might be discovered and the third day sir we found a stone which i have transported to monkbarns in order to have the sculpture taken off with plaster of paris it bears a sacrificing vessel and the letters a d l l which may stand without much violence for agricola dicavit libens lubens  certainly sir for the dutch antiquaries claim caligula as the founder of a lighthouse on the sole authority of the letters c c p f which they interpret caius caligula pharum fecit  true and it has ever been recorded as a sound exposition i see we shall make something of you even before you wear spectacles notwithstanding you thought the traces of this beautiful camp indistinct when you first observed them  in time sir and by good instruction  you will become more apti doubt it not you shall peruse upon your next visit to monkbarns my trivial essay upon castrametation with some particular remarks upon the vestiges of ancient fortifications lately discovered by the author at the kaim of kinprunes i think i have pointed out the infallible touchstone of supposed antiquity i premise a few general rules on that point on the nature namely of the evidence to be received in such cases meanwhile be pleased to observe for example that i could press into my service claudians famous line                 ille caledoniis posuit qui castra pruinis  for pruinis though interpreted to mean hoar frosts to which i own we are somewhat subject in this northeastern seacoast may also signify a locality namely prunes the castra pruinis posita would therefore be the kaim of kinprunes but i waive this for i am sensible it might be laid hold of by cavillers as carrying down my castra to the time of theodosius sent by valentinian into britain as late as the year 367 or thereabout no my good friend i appeal to peoples eyesight is not here the decuman gate and there but for the ravage of the horrid plough as a learned friend calls it would be the praetorian gate on the left hand you may see some slight vestiges of the porta sinistra and on the right one side of the porta dextra wellnigh entire here then let us take our stand on this tumulus exhibiting the foundation of ruined buildingsthe central pointthe praetorium doubtless of the camp from this place now scarce to be distinguished but by its slight elevation and its greener turf from the rest of the fortification we may suppose agricola to have looked forth on the immense army of caledonians occupying the declivities of yon opposite hillthe infantry rising rank over rank as the form of ground displayed their array to its utmost advantagethe cavalry and covinarii by which i understand the charioteersanother guise of folks from your bondstreet fourinhand men i trowscouring the more level space below                         see then lovelsee             see that huge battle moving from the mountains         their gilt coats shine like dragon scalestheir march         like a rough tumbling stormsee them and view them                        and then see rome no more  yes my dear friend from this stance it is probablenay it is nearly certain that julius agricola beheld what our beaumont has so admirably describedfrom this very praetorium  a voice from behind interrupted his ecstatic descriptionpraetorian here praetorian there i mind the bigging ot  both at once turned round lovel with surprise and oldbuck with mingled surprise and indignation at so uncivil an interruption an auditor had stolen upon them unseen and unheard amid the energy of the antiquarys enthusiastic declamation and the attentive civility of lovel he had the exterior appearance of a mendicant a slouched hat of huge dimensions a long white beard which mingled with his grizzled hair an aged but strongly marked and expressive countenance hardened by climate and exposure to a right brickdust complexion a long blue gown with a pewter badge on the right arm two or three wallets or bags slung across his shoulder for holding the different kinds of meal when he received his charity in kind from those who were but a degree richer than himselfall these marked at once a beggar by profession and one of that privileged class which are called in scotland the kings bedesmen or vulgarly bluegowns  what is that you say edie said oldbuck hoping perhaps that his ears had betrayed their dutywhat were you speaking about  about this bit bourock your honour answered the undaunted edie i mind the bigging ot  the devil you do why you old fool it was here before you were born and will be after you are hanged man  hanged or drowned here or awa dead or alive i mind the bigging ot  youyouyou said the antiquary stammering between confusion and anger you strolling old vagabond what the devil do you know about it  ou i ken this about it monkbarnsand what profit have i for telling ye a liel just ken this about it that about twenty years syne i and a wheen hallenshakers like mysell and the masonlads that built the lang dike that gaes down the loaning and twa or three herds maybe just set to wark and built this bit thing here that ye ca thethepraetorian and a just for a bield at auld aiken drums bridal and a bit blithe gaedown wi had int some sair rainy weather mair by token monkbarns if ye howk up the bourock as ye seem to have began yell find if ye hae not fund it already a stane that ane o the masoncallants cut a ladle on to have a bourd at the bridegroom and he put four letters ont thats a d l laiken drums lang ladlefor aiken was ane o the kalesuppers o fife  this thought lovel to himself is a famous counterpart to the story of keip on this syde he then ventured to steal a glance at our antiquary but quickly withdrew it in sheer compassion for gentle reader if thou hast ever beheld the visage of a damsel of sixteen whose romance of true love has been blown up by an untimely discovery or of a child of ten years whose castle of cards has been blown down by a malicious companion i can safely aver to you that jonathan oldbuck of monkbarns looked neither more wise nor less disconcerted  there is some mistake about this he said abruptly turning away from the mendicant  deil a bit on my side o the wa answered the sturdy beggar i never deal in mistakes they aye bring mischancesnow monkbarns that young gentleman thats wi your honour thinks little of a carle like me and yet ill wager ill tell him whar he was yestreen at the gloamin only he maybe wadna like to haet spoken o in company  lovels soul rushed to his cheeks with the vivid blush of twoandtwenty  never mind the old rogue said mr oldbuck dont suppose i think the worse of you for your profession they are only prejudiced fools and coxcombs that do so you remember what old tully says in his oration pro archia poeta concerning one of your confraternityquis nostrum tam anino agresti ac duro fuitututi forget the latinthe meaning is which of us was so rude and barbarous as to remain unmoved at the death of the great roscius whose advanced age was so far from preparing us for his death that we rather hoped one so graceful so excellent in his art ought to be exempted from the common lot of mortality so the prince of orators spoke of the stage and its professor  the words of the old man fell upon lovels ears but without conveying any precise idea to his mind which was then occupied in thinking by what means the old beggar who still continued to regard him with a countenance provokingly sly and intelligent had contrived to thrust himself into any knowledge of his affairs he put his hand in his pocket as the readiest mode of intimating his desire of secrecy and securing the concurrence of the person whom he addressed and while he bestowed on him an alms the amount of which rather bore proportion to his fears than to his charity looked at him with a marked expression which the mendicant a physiognomist by profession seemed perfectly to understandnever mind me siri am no talepyet but there are mair een in the warld than mine answered he as he pocketed lovels bounty but in a tone to be heard by him alone and with an expression which amply filled up what was left unspoken then turning to oldbucki am awa to the manse your honour has your honour ony word there or to sir arthur for ill come in by knockwinnock castle again een  oldbuck started as from a dream and in a hurried tone where vexation strove with a wish to conceal it paying at the same time a tribute to edies smooth greasy unlined hat he said go down go down to monkbarnslet them give you some dinneror stay if you do go to the manse or to knockwinnock ye need say nothing about that foolish story of yours  who i said the mendicantlord bless your honour naebody sall ken a word about it frae me mair than if the bit bourock had been there since noahs flood but lord they tell me your honour has gien johnnie howie acre for acre of the laigh crofts for this heathery knowe now if he has really imposed the bourock on ye for an ancient wark its my real opinion the bargain will never haud gude if you would just bring down your heart to try it at the law and say that he beguiled ye  provoking scoundrel muttered the indignant antiquary between his teethsill have the hangmans lash and his back acquainted for this and then in a louder tonenever mind edieit is all a mistake  troth i am thinking sae continued his tormentor who seemed to have pleasure in rubbing the galled wound troth i aye thought sae and its no sae lang since i said to luckie gemmers never think you luckie said i that his honour monkbarns would hae done sic a daftlike thing as to gie grund weel worth fifty shillings an acre for a mailing that would be dear oa pund scots na na quo i depend upont the lards been imposed upon wi that wily dolittle deevil johnnie howie but lord haud a care o us sirs how can that be quo she again when the lairds sae booklearned theres no the like o him in the country side and johnnie howie has hardly sense eneugh to ca the cows out o his kaleyard aweel aweel quo i but yell hear hes circumvented him with some of his auldwarld storiesfor ye ken laird yon other time about the bodle that ye thought was an auld coin  go to the devil said oldbuck and then in a more mild tone as one that was conscious his reputation lay at the mercy of his antagonist he addedaway with you down to monkbarns and when i come back ill send ye a bottle of ale to the kitchen  heaven reward your honour this was uttered with the true mendicant whine as setting his pikestaff before him he began to move in the direction of monkbarnsbut did your honour turning round ever get back the siller ye gae to the travelling packman for the bodle  curse thee go about thy business  aweel aweel sir god bless your honour i hope yell ding johnnie howie yet and that ill live to see it and so saying the old beggar moved off relieving mr oldbuck of recollections which were anything rather than agreeable  who is this familiar old gentleman said lovel when the mendicant was out of hearing  o one of the plagues of the countryi have been always against poorsrates and a workhousei think ill vote for them now to have that scoundrel shut up o your oldremembered guest of a beggar becomes as well acquainted with you as he is with his dishas intimate as one of the beasts familiar to man which signify love and with which his own trade is especially conversant who is hewhy he has gone the vole has been soldier balladsinger travelling tinker and is now a beggar he is spoiled by our foolish gentry who laugh at his jokes and rehearse edie ochiltrees good things as regularly as joe millers  why he uses freedom apparently which is the soul of wit answered lovel  o ay freedom enough said the antiquary he generally invents some damned improbable lie or another to provoke you like that nonsense he talked just nownot that ill publish my tract till i have examined the thing to the bottom  in england said lovel such a mendicant would get a speedy check  yes your churchwardens and dogwhips would make slender allowance for his vein of humour but here curse him he is a sort of privileged nuisanceone of the last specimens of the old fashioned scottish mendicant who kept his rounds within a particular space and was the newscarrier the minstrel and sometimes the historian of the district that rascal now knows more old ballads and traditions than any other man in this and the four next parishes and after all continued he softening as he went on describing edies good gifts the dog has some good humour he has borne his hard fate with unbroken spirits and its cruel to deny him the comfort of a laugh at his betters the pleasure of having quizzed me as you gay folk would call it will be meat and drink to him for a day or two but i must go back and look after him or he will spread his dd nonsensical story over half the country   note c praetorium  so saying our heroes parted mr oldbuck to return to his hospitium at monkbarns and lovel to pursue his way to fairport where he arrived without farther adventure     chapter fifth                       launcelot gobbo mark me now                       now will i raise the waters                                          merchant of venice  the theatre at fairport had opened but no mr lovel appeared on the boards nor was there anything in the habits or deportment of the young gentleman so named which authorised mr oldbucks conjecture that his fellowtraveller was a candidate for the public favour regular were the antiquarys inquiries at an oldfashioned barber who dressed the only three wigs in the parish which in defiance of taxes and times were still subjected to the operation of powdering and frizzling and who for that purpose divided his time among the three employers whom fashion had yet left him regular i say were mr oldbucks inquiries at this personage concerning the news of the little theatre at fairport expecting every day to hear of mr lovels appearance on which occasion the old gentleman had determined to put himself to charges in honour of his young friend and not only to go to the play himself but to carry his womankind along with him but old jacob caxon conveyed no information which warranted his taking so decisive a step as that of securing a box  he brought information on the contrary that there was a young man residing at fairport of whom the town by which he meant all the gossips who having no business of their own fill up their leisure moments by attending to that of other people could make nothing he sought no society but rather avoided that which the apparent gentleness of his manners and some degree of curiosity induced many to offer him nothing could be more regular or less resembling an adventurer than his mode of living which was simple but so completely well arranged that all who had any transactions with him were loud in their approbation  these are not the virtues of a stagestruck hero thought oldbuck to himself and however habitually pertinacious in his opinions he must have been compelled to abandon that which he had formed in the present instance but for a part of caxons communication the young gentleman he said was sometimes heard speaking to himsell and rampauging about in his room just as if he was ane o the player folk  nothing however excepting this single circumstance occurred to confirm mr oldbucks supposition and it remained a high and doubtful question what a wellinformed young man without friends connections or employment of any kind could have to do as a resident at fairport neither port wine nor whist had apparently any charms for him he declined dining with the mess of the volunteer cohort which had been lately embodied and shunned joining the convivialities of either of the two parties which then divided fairport as they did more important places he was too little of an aristocrat to join the club of royal true blues and too little of a democrat to fraternise with an affiliated society of the soidisant friends of the people which the borough had also the happiness of possessing a coffeeroom was his detestation and i grieve to say it he had as few sympathies with the teatablein short since the name was fashionable in novelwriting and that is a great while agone there was never a master lovel of whom so little positive was known and who was so universally described by negatives  one negative however was importantnobody knew any harm of lovel indeed had such existed it would have been speedily made public for the natural desire of speaking evil of our neighbour could in his case have been checked by no feelings of sympathy for a being so unsocial on one account alone he fell somewhat under suspicion as he made free use of his pencil in his solitary walks and had drawn several views of the harbour in which the signal tower and even the fourgun battery were introduced some zealous friends of the public sent abroad a whisper that this mysterious stranger must certainly be a french spy the sheriff paid his respects to mr lovel accordingly but in the interview which followed it would seem that he had entirely removed that magistrates suspicions since he not only suffered him to remain undisturbed in his retirement but it was credibly reported sent him two invitations to dinnerparties both which were civilly declined but what the nature of the explanation was the magistrate kept a profound secret not only from the public at large but from his substitute his clerk his wife and his two daughters who formed his privy council on all questions of official duty  all these particulars being faithfully reported by mr caxon to his patron at monkbarns tended much to raise lovel in the opinion of his former fellowtraveller a decent sensible lad said he to himself who scorns to enter into the fooleries and nonsense of these idiot people at fairporti must do something for himi must give him a dinnerand i will write sir arthur to come to monkbarns to meet him i must consult my womankind  accordingly such consultation having been previously held a special messenger being no other than caxon himself was ordered to prepare for a walk to knockwinnock castle with a letter for the honoured sir arthur wardour of knockwinnock bart the contents ran thus  dear sir arthur  on tuesday the 17th curt stilo novo i hold a coenobitical symposion at monkbarns and pray you to assist thereat at four oclock precisely if my fair enemy miss isabel can and will honour us by accompanying you my womankind will be but too proud to have the aid of such an auxiliary in the cause of resistance to awful rule and right supremacy if not i will send the womankind to the manse for the day i have a young acquaintance to make known to you who is touched with some strain of a better spirit than belongs to these giddypaced timesreveres his elders and has a pretty notion of the classicsand as such a youth must have a natural contempt for the people about fairport i wish to show him some rational as well as worshipful societyi am dear sir arthur etc etc etc  fly with this letter caxon said the senior holding out his missive signatum atque sigillatum fly to knockwinnock and bring me back an answer go as fast as if the towncouncil were met and waiting for the provost and the provost was waiting for his newpowdered wig  ah sir answered the messenger with a deep sigh thae days hae lang gane by deil a wig has a provost of fairport worn sin auld provost jervies timeand he had a quean of a servantlass that dressed it herself wi the doup o a candle and a drudgingbox but i hae seen the day monkbarns when the towncouncil of fairport wad hae as soon wanted their townclerk or their gill of brandy owerhead after the haddies as they wad hae wanted ilk ane a weelfavoured sonsy decent periwig on his pow hegh sirs nae wonder the commons will be discontent and rise against the law when they see magistrates and bailies and deacons and the provost himsell wi heads as bald and as bare as ane o my blocks  and as well furnished within caxon but away with youyou have an excellent view of public affairs and i dare say have touched the cause of our popular discontent as closely as the provost could have done himself but away with you caxon  and off went caxon upon his walk of three miles                    he hobbledbut his heart was good                   could he go faster than he could  while he is engaged in his journey and return it may not be impertinent to inform the reader to whose mansion he was bearing his embassy  we have said that mr oldbuck kept little company with the surrounding gentlemen excepting with one person only this was sir arthur wardour a baronet of ancient descent and of a large but embarrassed fortune his father sir anthony had been a jacobite and had displayed all the enthusiasm of that party while it could be served with words only no man squeezed the orange with more significant gesture no one could more dexterously intimate a dangerous health without coming under the penal statutes and above all none drank success to the cause more deeply and devoutly but on the approach of the highland army in 1745 it would appear that the worthy baronets zeal became a little more moderate just when its warmth was of most consequence he talked much indeed of taking the field for the rights of scotland and charles stuart but his demipique saddle would suit only one of his horses and that horse could by no means be brought to stand fire perhaps the worshipful owner sympathized in the scruples of this sagacious quadruped and began to think that what was so much dreaded by the horse could not be very wholesome for the rider at any rate while sir anthony wardour talked and drank and hesitated the sturdy provost of fairport who as we before noticed was the father of our antiquary sallied from his ancient burgh heading a body of whigburghers and seized at once in the name of george ii upon the castle of knockwinnock and on the four carriagehorses and person of the proprietor sir anthony was shortly after sent off to the tower of london by a secretary of states warrant and with him went his son arthur then a youth but as nothing appeared like an overt act of treason both father and son were soon set at liberty and returned to their own mansion of knockwinnock to drink healths five fathoms deep and talk of their sufferings in the royal cause this became so much a matter of habit with sir arthur that even after his fathers death the nonjuring chaplain used to pray regularly for the restoration of the rightful sovereign for the downfall of the usurper and for deliverance from their cruel and bloodthirsty enemies although all idea of serious opposition to the house of hanover had long mouldered away and this treasonable liturgy was kept up rather as a matter of form than as conveying any distinct meaning so much was this the case that about the year 1770 upon a disputed election occurring in the county the worthy knight fairly gulped down the oaths of abjuration and allegiance in order to serve a candidate in whom he was interestedthus renouncing the heir for whose restoration he weekly petitioned heaven and acknowledging the usurper whose dethronement he had never ceased to pray for and to add to this melancholy instance of human inconsistency sir arthur continued to pray for the house of stuart even after the family had been extinct and when in truth though in his theoretical loyalty he was pleased to regard them as alive yet in all actual service and practical exertion he was a most zealous and devoted subject of george iii  in other respects sir arthur wardour lived like most country gentlemen in scotland hunted and fishedgave and received dinnersattended races and county meetingswas a deputylieutenant and trustee upon turnpike acts but in his more advanced years as he became too lazy or unwieldy for fieldsports he supplied them by now and then reading scottish history and having gradually acquired a taste for antiquities though neither very deep nor very correct he became a crony of his neighbour mr oldbuck of monkbarns and a jointlabourer with him in his antiquarian pursuits  there were however points of difference between these two humourists which sometimes occasioned discord the faith of sir arthur as an antiquary was boundless and mr oldbuck notwithstanding the affair of the praetorium at the kaim of kinprunes was much more scrupulous in receiving legends as current and authentic coin sir arthur would have deemed himself guilty of the crime of lezemajesty had he doubted the existence of any single individual of that formidable headroll of one hundred and four kings of scotland received by boethius and rendered classical by buchanan in virtue of whom james vi claimed to rule his ancient kingdom and whose portraits still frown grimly upon the walls of the gallery of holyrood now oldbuck a shrewd and suspicious man and no respecter of divine hereditary right was apt to cavil at this sacred list and to affirm that the procession of the posterity of fergus through the pages of scottish history was as vain and unsubstantial as the gleamy pageant of the descendants of banquo through the cavern of hecate  another tender topic was the good fame of queen mary of which the knight was a most chivalrous assertor while the esquire impugned it in spite both of her beauty and misfortunes when unhappily their conversation turned on yet later times motives of discord occurred in almost every page of history oldbuck was upon principle a staunch presbyterian a ruling elder of the kirk and a friend to revolution principles and protestant succession while sir arthur was the very reverse of all this they agreed it is true in dutiful love and allegiance to the sovereign who now fills the throne but this was their only point of union   the reader will understand that this refers to the reign of our late gracious sovereign george the third  it therefore often happened that bickerings hot broke out between them in which oldbuck was not always able to suppress his caustic humour while it would sometimes occur to the baronet that the descendant of a german printer whose sires had sought the base fellowship of paltry burghers forgot himself and took an unlicensed freedom of debate considering the rank and ancient descent of his antagonist this with the old feud of the coachhorses and the seizure of his manorplace and tower of strength by mr oldbucks father would at times rush upon his mind and inflame at once his cheeks and his arguments and lastly as mr oldbuck thought his worthy friend and compeer was in some respects little better than a fool he was apt to come more near communicating to him that unfavourable opinion than the rules of modern politeness warrant in such cases they often parted in deep dudgeon and with something like a resolution to forbear each others company in future  but with the morning calm reflection came and as each was sensible that the society of the other had become through habit essential to his comfort the breach was speedily made up between them on such occasions oldbuck considering that the baronets pettishness resembled that of a child usually showed his superior sense by compassionately making the first advances to reconciliation but it once or twice happened that the aristocratic pride of the fardescended knight took a flight too offensive to the feelings of the representative of the typographer in these cases the breach between these two originals might have been immortal but for the kind exertion and interposition of the baronets daughter miss isabella wardour who with a son now absent upon foreign and military service formed his whole surviving family she was well aware how necessary mr oldbuck was to her fathers amusement and comfort and seldom failed to interpose with effect when the office of a mediator between them was rendered necessary by the satirical shrewdness of the one or the assumed superiority of the other under isabellas mild influence the wrongs of queen mary were forgotten by her father and mr oldbuck forgave the blasphemy which reviled the memory of king william however as she used in general to take her fathers part playfully in these disputes oldbuck was wont to call isabella his fair enemy though in fact he made more account of her than any other of her sex of whom as we have seen he was no admirer  there existed another connection betwixt these worthies which had alternately a repelling and attractive influence upon their intimacy sir arthur always wished to borrow mr oldbuck was not always willing to lend mr oldbuck per contra always wished to be repaid with regularity sir arthur was not always nor indeed often prepared to gratify this reasonable desire and in accomplishing an arrangement between tendencies so opposite little miffs would occasionally take place still there was a spirit of mutual accommodation upon the whole and they dragged on like dogs in couples with some difficulty and occasional snarling but without absolutely coming to a standstill or throttling each other  some little disagreement such as we have mentioned arising out of business or politics had divided the houses of knockwinnock and monkbarns when the emissary of the latter arrived to discharge his errand in his ancient gothic parlour whose windows on one side looked out upon the restless ocean and on the other upon the long straight avenue was the baronet seated now turning over the leaves of a folio now casting a weary glance where the sun quivered on the darkgreen foliage and smooth trunks of the large and branching limes with which the avenue was planted at length sight of joy a moving object is seen and it gives rise to the usual inquiries who is it and what can be his errand the old whitishgrey coat the hobbling gait the hat halfslouched halfcocked announced the forlorn maker of periwigs and left for investigation only the second query this was soon solved by a servant entering the parloura letter from monkbarns sir arthur  sir arthur took the epistle with a due assumption of consequential dignity  take the old man into the kitchen and let him get some refreshment said the young lady whose compassionate eye had remarked his thin grey hair and wearied gait  mr oldbuck my love invites us to dinner on tuesday the 17th said the baronet pausinghe really seems to forget that he has not of late conducted himself so civilly towards me as might have been expected  dear sir you have so many advantages over poor mr oldbuck that no wonder it should put him a little out of humour but i know he has much respect for your person and your conversationnothing would give him more pain than to be wanting in any real attention  true true isabella and one must allow for the original descentsomething of the german boorishness still flows in the blood something of the whiggish and perverse opposition to established rank and privilege you may observe that he never has any advantage of me in dispute unless when he avails himself of a sort of pettifogging intimacy with dates names and trifling matters of facta tiresome and frivolous accuracy of memory which is entirely owing to his mechanical descent  he must find it convenient in historical investigation i should think sir said the young lady  it leads to an uncivil and positive mode of disputing and nothing seems more unreasonable than to hear him impugn even bellendens rare translation of hector boece which i have the satisfaction to possess and which is a blackletter folio of great value upon the authority of some old scrap of parchment which he has saved from its deserved destiny of being cut up into tailors measures and besides that habit of minute and troublesome accuracy leads to a mercantile manner of doing business which ought to be beneath a landed proprietor whose family has stood two or three generations i question if theres a dealers clerk in fairport that can sum an account of interest better than monkbarns  but youll accept his invitation sir  why yeyes we have no other engagement on hand i think who can the young man be he talks ofhe seldom picks up new acquaintance and he has no relation that i ever heard of  probably some relation of his brotherinlaw captain mintyre  very possiblyyes we will acceptthe mintyres are of a very ancient highland family you may answer his card in the affirmative isabella i believe i have no leisure to be dear sirring myself  so this important matter being adjusted miss wardour intimated her own and sir arthurs compliments and that they would have the honour of waiting upon mr oldbuck miss wardour takes this opportunity to renew her hostility with mr oldbuck on account of his late long absence from knockwinnock where his visits give so much pleasure with this placebo she concluded her note with which old caxon now refreshed in limbs and wind set out on his return to the antiquarys mansion     chapter sixth                     moth by woden god of saxons             from whence comes wensday that is wodnesday                    truth is a thing that i will ever keep

womankindbut here they be mr lovel i present to you in due order my most discreet sister griselda who disdains the simplicity as well as patience annexed to the poor old name of grizzel and my most exquisite niece maria whose mother was called mary and sometimes molly  the elderly lady rustled in silks and satins and bore upon her head a structure resembling the fashion in the ladies memorandumbook for the year 1770a superb piece of architecture not much less than a modern gothic castle of which the curls might represent the turrets the black pins the chevaux de frise and the lappets the banners  the face which like that of the ancient statues of vesta was thus crowned with towers was large and long and peaked at nose and chin and bore in other respects such a ludicrous resemblance to the physiognomy of mr jonathan oldbuck that lovel had they not appeared at once like sebastian and viola in the last scene of the twelfth night might have supposed that the figure before him was his old friend masquerading in female attire an antique flowered silk gown graced the extraordinary person to whom belonged this unparalleled tete which her brother was wont to say was fitter for a turban for mahound or termagant than a headgear for a reasonable creature or christian gentlewoman two long and bony arms were terminated at the elbows by triple blond ruffles and being folded saltireways in front of her person and decorated with long gloves of a bright vermilion colour presented no bad resemblance to a pair of gigantic lobsters highheeled shoes and a short silk cloak thrown in easy negligence over her shoulders completed the exterior of miss griselda oldbuck  her niece the same whom lovel had seen transiently during his first visit was a pretty young woman genteelly dressed according to the fashion of the day with an air of espieglerie which became her very well and which was perhaps derived from the caustic humour peculiar to her uncles family though softened by transmission  mr lovel paid his respects to both ladies and was answered by the elder with the prolonged courtesy of 1760 drawn from the righteous period                         when folks conceived a grace                        of half an hours space                        and rejoiced in a fridays capon  and by the younger with a modern reverence which like the festive benediction of a modern divine was of much shorter duration  while this salutation was exchanging sir arthur with his fair daughter hanging upon his arm having dismissed his chariot appeared at the garden door and in all due form paid his respects to the ladies  sir arthur said the antiquary and you my fair foe let me make known to you my young friend mr lovel a gentleman who during the scarletfever which is epidemic at present in this our island has the virtue and decency to appear in a coat of a civil complexion you see however that the fashionable colour has mustered in his cheeks which appears not in his garments sir arthur let me present to you a young gentleman whom your farther knowledge will find grave wise courtly and scholarlike well seen deeply read and thoroughly grounded in all the hidden mysteries of the greenroom and stage from the days of davie lindsay down to those of dibdinhe blushes again which is a sign of grace  my brother said miss griselda addressing lovel has a humorous way of expressing himself sir nobody thinks anything of what monkbarns saysso i beg you will not be so confused for the matter of his nonsense but you must have had a warm walk beneath this broiling sunwould you take anythinga glass of balmwine  ere lovel could answer the antiquary interposed aroint thee witch wouldst thou poison my guests with thy infernal decoctions dost thou not remember how it fared with the clergyman whom you seduced to partake of that deceitful beverage  o fy fy brothersir arthur did you ever hear the likehe must have everything his ain way or he will invent such storiesbut there goes jenny to ring the old bell to tell us that the dinner is ready  rigid in his economy mr oldbuck kept no male servant this he disguised under the pretext that the masculine sex was too noble to be employed in those acts of personal servitude which in all early periods of society were uniformly imposed on the female why would he say did the boy tam rintherout whom at my wise sisters instigation i with equal wisdom took upon trialwhy did he pilfer apples take birds nests break glasses and ultimately steal my spectacles except that he felt that noble emulation which swells in the bosom of the masculine sex which has conducted him to flanders with a musket on his shoulder and doubtless will promote him to a glorious halbert or even to the gallows and why does this girl his full sister jenny rintherout move in the same vocation with safe and noiseless stepshod or unshodsoft as the pace of a cat and docile as a spanielwhy but because she is in her vocation let them minister to us sir arthurlet them minister i sayits the only thing they are fit for all ancient legislators from lycurgus to mahommed corruptly called mahomet agree in putting them in their proper and subordinate rank and it is only the crazy heads of our old chivalrous ancestors that erected their dulcineas into despotic princesses  miss wardour protested loudly against this ungallant doctrine but the bell now rung for dinner  let me do all the offices of fair courtesy to so fair an antagonist said the old gentleman offering his arm i remember miss wardour mahommed vulgarly mahomet had some hesitation about the mode of summoning his moslemah to prayer he rejected bells as used by christians trumpets as the summons of the guebres and finally adopted the human voice i have had equal doubt concerning my dinnercall gongs now in present use seemed a newfangled and heathenish invention and the voice of the female womankind i rejected as equally shrill and dissonant wherefore contrary to the said mahommed or mahomet i have resumed the bell it has a local propriety since it was the conventual signal for spreading the repast in their refectory and it has the advantage over the tongue of my sisters prime minister jenny that though not quite so loud and shrill it ceases ringing the instant you drop the bellrope whereas we know by sad experience that any attempt to silence jenny only wakes the sympathetic chime of miss oldbuck and mary mintyre to join in chorus  with this discourse he led the way to his diningparlour which lovel had not yet seenit was wainscotted and contained some curious paintings the diningtable was attended by jenny but an old superintendent a sort of female butler stood by the sideboard and underwent the burden of bearing several reproofs from mr oldbuck and inuendos not so much marked but not less cutting from his sister  the dinner was such as suited a professed antiquary comprehending many savoury specimens of scottish viands now disused at the tables of those who affect elegance there was the relishing solan goose whose smell is so powerful that he is never cooked within doors bloodraw he proved to be on this occasion so that oldbuck half threatened to throw the greasy seafowl at the head of the negligent housekeeper who acted as priestess in presenting this odoriferous offering but by goodhap she had been most fortunate in the hotchpotch which was unanimously pronounced to be inimitable i knew we should succeed here said oldbuck exultingly for davie dibble the gardener an old bachelor like myself takes care the rascally women do not dishonour our vegetables and here is fish and sauce and crappitheadsi acknowledge our womankind excel in that dishit procures them the pleasure of scolding for half an hour at least twice aweek with auld maggy mucklebackit our fishwife the chickenpie mr lovel is made after a recipe bequeathed to me by my departed grandmother of happy memoryand if you will venture on a glass of wine you will find it worthy of one who professes the maxim of king alphonso of castileold wood to burnold books to readold wine to drinkand old friends sir arthuray mr lovel and young friends too to converse with  and what news do you bring us from edinburgh monkbarns said sir arthur how wags the world in auld reekie  mad sir arthur madirretrievably franticfar beyond dipping in the sea shaving the crown or drinking hellebore the worst sort of frenzy a military frenzy hath possessed man woman and child  and high time i think said miss wardour when we are threatened with invasion from abroad and insurrection at home  o i did not doubt you would join the scarlet host against mewomen like turkeys are always subdued by a red ragbut what says sir arthur whose dreams are of standing armies and german oppression  why i say mr oldbuck replied the knight that so far as i am capable of judging we ought to resist cum toto corpore regnias the phrase is unless i have altogether forgotten my latinan enemy who comes to propose to us a whiggish sort of government a republican system and who is aided and abetted by a sort of fanatics of the worst kind in our own bowels i have taken some measures i assure you such as become my rank in the community for i have directed the constables to take up that old scoundrelly beggar edie ochiltree for spreading disaffection against church and state through the whole parish he said plainly to old caxon that willie howies kilmarnock cowl covered more sense than all the three wigs in the parishi think it is easy to make out that inuendobut the rogue shall be taught better manners  o no my dear sir exclaimed miss wardour not old edie that we have known so longi assure you no constable shall have my good graces that executes such a warrant  ay there it goes said the antiquary you to be a staunch tory sir arthur have nourished a fine sprig of whiggery in your bosomwhy miss wardour is alone sufficient to control a whole quartersessiona quartersession ay a general assembly or convocation to boota boadicea shean amazon a zenobia  and yet with all my courage mr oldbuck i am glad to hear our people are getting under arms  under arms lord love thee didst thou ever read the history of sister margaret which flowed from a head that though now old and somedele grey has more sense and political intelligence than you find nowadays in the whole synod dost thou remember the nurses dream in that exquisite work which she recounts in such agony to hubble bubblewhen she would have taken up a piece of broadcloth in her vision lo it exploded like a great iron cannon when she put out her hand to save a pirn it perked up in her face in the form of a pistol my own vision in edinburgh has been something similar i called to consult my lawyer he was clothed in a dragoons dress belted and casqued and about to mount a charger which his writingclerk habited as a sharpshooter walked to and fro before his door i went to scold my agent for having sent me to advise with a madman he had stuck into his head the plume which in more sober days he wielded between his fingers and figured as an artillery officer my mercer had his spontoon in his hand as if he measured his cloth by that implement instead of a legitimate yard the bankers clerk who was directed to sum my cashaccount blundered it three times being disordered by the recollection of his military tellingsoff at the morningdrill i was ill and sent for a surgeon                 he camebut valour so had fired his eye                and such a falchion glittered on his thigh                that by the gods with such a load of steel               i thought he came to murdernot to heal  i had recourse to a physician but he also was practising a more wholesale mode of slaughter than that which his profession had been supposed at all times to open to him and now since i have returned here even our wise neighbours of fairport have caught the same valiant humour i hate a gun like a hurt wild ducki detest a drum like a quakerand they thunder and rattle out yonder upon the towns common so that every volley and roll goes to my very heart  dear brother dinna speak that gate o the gentlemen volunteersi am sure they have a most becoming uniformweel i wot they have been wet to the very skin twice last weeki met them marching in terribly doukit an mony a sair hoast was amang themand the trouble they take i am sure it claims our gratitude  and i am sure said miss mintyre that my uncle sent twenty guineas to help out their equipments  it was to buy liquorice and sugarcandy said the cynic to encourage the trade of the place and to refresh the throats of the officers who had bawled themselves hoarse in the service of their country  take care monkbarns we shall set you down among the blacknebs by and by  no sir arthura tame grumbler i i only claim the privilege of croaking in my own corner here without uniting my throat to the grand chorus of the marshni quito rey ni pongo reyi neither make king nor mar king as sancho says but pray heartily for our own sovereign pay scot and lot and grumble at the excisemanbut here comes the ewemilk cheese in good time it is a better digestive than politics  when dinner was over and the decanters placed on the table mr oldbuck proposed the kings health in a bumper which was readily acceded to both by lovel and the baronet the jacobitism of the latter being now a sort of speculative opinion merelythe shadow of a shade  after the ladies had left the apartment the landlord and sir arthur entered into several exquisite discussions in which the younger guest either on account of the abstruse erudition which they involved or for some other reason took but a slender share till at length he was suddenly started out of a profound reverie by an unexpected appeal to his judgment  i will stand by what mr lovel says he was born in the north of england and may know the very spot  sir arthur thought it unlikely that so young a gentleman should have paid much attention to matters of that sort  i am avised of the contrary said oldbuck  how say you mr lovelspeak up for your own credit man  lovel was obliged to confess himself in the ridiculous situation of one alike ignorant of the subject of conversation and controversy which had engaged the company for an hour  lord help the lad his head has been woolgatheringi thought how it would be when the womankind were admittedno getting a word of sense out of a young fellow for six hours afterwhy man there was once a people called the piks  more properly picts interrupted the baronet  i say the pikar pihar piochtar piaghter or peughtar vociferated oldbuck they spoke a gothic dialect  genuine celtic again asseverated the knight  gothic gothic ill go to death upon it counterasseverated the squire  why gentlemen sad lovel i conceive that is a dispute which may be easily settled by philologists if there are any remains of the language  there is but one word said the baronet but in spite of mr oldbucks pertinacity it is decisive of the question  yes in my favour said oldbuck mr lovel you shall be judgei have the learned pinkerton on my side  i on mine the indefatigable and erudite chalmers  gordon comes into my opinion  sir robert sibbald holds mine  innes is with me vociferated oldbuck  riston has no doubt shouted the baronet  truly gentlemen said lovel before you muster your forces and overwhelm me with authorities i should like to know the word in dispute  benval said both the disputants at once  which signifies caput valli said sir arthur  the head of the wall echoed oldbuck  there was a deep pauseit is rather a narrow foundation to build a hypothesis upon observed the arbiter  not a whit not a whit said oldbuck men fight best in a narrow ringan inch is as good as a mile for a homethrust  it is decidedly celtic said the baronet every hill in the highlands begins with ben  but what say you to val sir arthur is it not decidedly the saxon wall  it is the roman vallum said sir arthurthe picts borrowed that part of the word  no such thing if they borrowed anything it must have been your ben which they might have from the neighbouring britons of strath cluyd  the piks or picts said lovel must have been singularly poor in dialect since in the only remaining word of their vocabulary and that consisting only of two syllables they have been confessedly obliged to borrow one of them from another language and methinks gentlemen with submission the controversy is not unlike that which the two knights fought concerning the shield that had one side white and the other black each of you claim onehalf of the word and seem to resign the other but what strikes me most is the poverty of the language which has left such slight vestiges behind it  you are in an error said sir arthur it was a copious language and they were a great and powerful people built two steeplesone at brechin one at abernethy the pictish maidens of the bloodroyal were kept in edinburgh castle thence called castrum puellarum  a childish legend said oldbuck invented to give consequence to trumpery womankind it was called the maiden castle quasi lucus a non lucendo because it resisted every attack and women never do  there is a list of the pictish kings persisted sir arthur well authenticated from crentheminachcryme the date of whose reign is somewhat uncertain down to drusterstone whose death concluded their dynasty half of them have the celtic patronymic mac prefixedmac id est filiuswhat do you say to that mr oldbuck there is drust macmorachin trynel maclachlin first of that ancient clan as it may be judged and gormach macdonald alpin macmetegus drust mactallargam here he was interrupted by a fit of coughingugh ugh ughgolarge macchanugh ughmacchananughmacchananail kennethughugh macferedith eachan macfungusand twenty more decidedly celtic names which i could repeat if this damned cough would let me  take a glass of wine sir arthur and drink down that beadroll of unbaptized jargon that would choke the devilwhy that last fellow has the only intelligible name you have repeatedthey are all of the tribe of macfungusmushroom monarchs every one of them sprung up from the fumes of conceit folly and falsehood fermenting in the brains of some mad highland seannachie  i am surprised to hear you mr oldbuck you know or ought to know that the list of these potentates was copied by henry maule of melguin from the chronicles of loch leven and st andrews and put forth by him in his short but satisfactory history of the picts printed by robert freebairn of edinburgh and sold by him at his shop in the parliament close in the year of god seventeen hundred and five or six i am not precisely certain whichbut i have a copy at home that stands next to my twelvemo copy of the scots acts and ranges on the shelf with them very well what say you to that mr oldbuck  saywhy i laugh at harry maule and his history answered oldbuck and thereby comply with his request of giving it entertainment according to its merits  do not laugh at a better man than yourself said sir arthur somewhat scornfully  i do not conceive i do sir arthur in laughing either at him or his history  henry maule of melgum was a gentleman mr oldbuck  i presume he had no advantage of me in that particular replied the antiquary somewhat tartly  permit me mr oldbuckhe was a gentleman of high family and ancient descent and therefore  the descendant of a westphalian printer should speak of him with deference such may be your opinion sir arthurit is not mine i conceive that my descent from that painful and industrious typographer wolfbrand oldenbuck who in the month of december 1493 under the patronage as the colophon tells us of sebaldus scheyter and sebastian kammermaister accomplished the printing of the great chronicle of nurembergi conceive i say that my descent from that great restorer of learning is more creditable to me as a man of letters than if i had numbered in my genealogy all the brawling bulletheaded ironfisted old gothic barons since the days of crentheminachcrymenot one of whom i suppose could write his own name  if you mean the observation as a sneer at my ancestry said the knight with an assumption of dignified superiority and composure i have the pleasure to inform you that the name of my ancestor gamelyn de guardover miles is written fairly with his own hand in the earliest copy of the ragmanroll  which only serves to show that he was one of the earliest who set the mean example of submitting to edward i what have you to say for the stainless loyalty of your family sir arthur after such a backsliding as that  its enough sir said sir arthur starting up fiercely and pushing back his chair i shall hereafter take care how i honour with my company one who shows himself so ungrateful for my condescension  in that you will do as you find most agreeable sir arthuri hope that as i was not aware of the extent of the obligation which you have done me by visiting my poor house i may be excused for not having carried my gratitude to the extent of servility  mighty wellmighty well mr oldbucki wish you a good eveningmr aaashoveli wish you a very good evening  out of the parlour door flounced the incensed sir arthur as if the spirit of the whole round table inflamed his single bosom and traversed with long strides the labyrinth of passages which conducted to the drawingroom  did you ever hear such an old tupheaded ass said oldbuck briefly apostrophizing lovel but i must not let him go in this madlike way neither  so saying he pushed off after the retreating baronet whom he traced by the clang of several doors which he opened in search of the apartment for tea and slammed with force behind him at every disappointment youll do yourself a mischief roared the antiquary qui ambulat in tenebris nescit quo vadityoull tumble down the backstair  sir arthur had now got involved in darkness of which the sedative effect is well known to nurses and governesses who have to deal with pettish children it retarded the pace of the irritated baronet if it did not abate his resentment and mr oldbuck better acquainted with the locale got up with him as he had got his grasp upon the handle of the drawingroom door  stay a minute sir arthur said oldbuck opposing his abrupt entrance dont be quite so hasty my good old friend i was a little too rude with you about sir gamelynwhy he is an old acquaintance of mine man and a favourite he kept company with bruce and wallaceand ill be sworn on a blackletter bible only subscribed the ragmanroll with the legitimate and justifiable intention of circumventing the false southerntwas right scottish craft my good knighthundreds did it come come forget and forgiveconfess we have given the young fellow here a right to think us two testy old fools  speak for yourself mr jonathan oldbuck said sir arthur with much majesty  awell awella wilful man must have his way  with that the door opened and into the drawingroom marched the tall gaunt form of sir arthur followed by lovel and mr oldbuck the countenances of all the three a little discomposed  i have been waiting for you sir said miss wardour to propose we should walk forward to meet the carriage as the evening is so fine  sir arthur readily assented to this proposal which suited the angry mood in which he found himself and having agreeable to the established custom in cases of pet refused the refreshment of tea and coffee he tucked his daughter under his arm and after taking a ceremonious leave of the ladies and a very dry one of oldbuckoff he marched  i think sir arthur has got the black dog on his back again said miss oldbuck  black dogblack devilhes more absurd than womankindwhat say you lovelwhy the lads gone too  he took his leave uncle while miss wardour was putting on her things but i dont think you observed him  the devils in the people this is all one gets by fussing and bustling and putting ones self out of ones way in order to give dinners besides all the charges they are put too seged emperor of ethiopia said he taking up a cup of tea in the one hand and a volume of the rambler in the otherfor it was his regular custom to read while he was eating or drinking in presence of his sister being a practice which served at once to evince his contempt for the society of womankind and his resolution to lose no moment of instructiono seged emperor of ethiopia well hast thou spokenno man should presume to say this shall be a day of happiness  oldbuck proceeded in his studies for the best part of an hour uninterrupted by the ladies who each in profound silence pursued some female employment at length a light and modest tap was heard at the parlour door is that you caxoncome in come in man  the old man opened the door and thrusting in his meagre face thatched with thin grey locks and one sleeve of his white coat said in a subdued and mysterious tone of voice i was wanting to speak to you sir  come in then you old fool and say what you have got to say  ill maybe frighten the ladies said the exfriseur  frighten answered the antiquarywhat do you meannever mind the ladies have you seen another ghaist at the humlockknowe  na sirits no a ghaist this turn replied caxtonbut im no easy in my mind  did you ever hear of any body that was answered oldbuckwhat reason has an old battered powderpuff like you to be easy in your mind more than all the rest of the world besides  its no for mysell sir but it threatens an awfu night and sir arthur and miss wardour poor thing  why man they must have met the carriage at the head of the loaning or thereabouts they must be home long ago  na sir they didna gang the road by the turnpike to meet the carriage they gaed by the sands  the word operated like electricity on oldbuck the sands he exclaimed impossible  ou sir thats what i said to the gardener but he says he saw them turn down by the musselcraig in troth says i to him an that be the case davie i am misdoubting  an almanac an almanac said oldbuck starting up in great alarmnot that bauble flinging away a little pocket almanac which his niece offered himgreat god my poor dear miss isabellafetch me instantly the fairport almanacit was brought consulted and added greatly to his agitation ill go myselfcall the gardener and ploughmanbid them bring ropes and laddersbid them raise more help as they come alongkeep the top of the cliffs and halloo down to themill go myself  what is the matter inquired miss oldbuck and miss mintyre  the tidethe tide answered the alarmed antiquary  had not jenny betterbut no ill run myself said the younger lady partaking in all her uncles terrorsill run myself to saunders mucklebackit and make him get out his boat  thank you my dear thats the wisest word that has been spoken yetrun runto go by the sands seizing his hat and cane was there ever such madness heard of     chapter seventh                         pleased awhile to view                the watery waste the prospect wild and new                the now receding waters gave them space                on either side the growing shores to trace                and then returning they contract the scene                till small and smaller grows the walk between                                             crabbe  the information of davie dibble which had spread such general alarm at monkbarns proved to be strictly correct sir arthur and his daughter had set out according to their first proposal to return to knockwinnock by the turnpike road but when they reached the head of the loaning as it was called or great lane which on one side made a sort of avenue to the house of monkbarns they discerned a little way before them lovel who seemed to linger on the way as if to give him an opportunity to join them miss wardour immediately proposed to her father that they should take another direction and as the weather was fine walk home by the sands which stretching below a picturesque ridge of rocks afforded at almost all times a pleasanter passage between knockwinnock and monkbarns than the highroad  illustration sir arthur and miss wardour  sir arthur acquiesced willingly it would be unpleasant he said to be joined by that young fellow whom mr oldbuck had taken the freedom to introduce them to and his oldfashioned politeness had none of the ease of the present day which permits you if you have a mind to cut the person you have associated with for a week the instant you feel or suppose yourself in a situation which makes it disagreeable to own him sir arthur only stipulated that a little ragged boy for the guerdon of one penny sterling should run to meet his coachman and turn his equipage back to knockwinnock  when this was arranged and the emissary despatched the knight and his daughter left the highroad and following a wandering path among sandy hillocks partly grown over with furze and the long grass called bent soon attained the side of the ocean the tide was by no means so far out as they had computed but this gave them no alarmthere were seldom ten days in the year when it approached so near the cliffs as not to leave a dry passage but nevertheless at periods of springtide or even when the ordinary flood was accelerated by high winds this road was altogether covered by the sea and tradition had recorded several fatal accidents which had happened on such occasions still such dangers were considered as remote and improbable and rather served with other legends to amuse the hamlet fireside than to prevent any one from going between knockwinnock and monkbarns by the sands  as sir arthur and miss wardour paced along enjoying the pleasant footing afforded by the cool moist hard sand miss wardour could not help observing that the last tide had risen considerably above the usual watermark sir arthur made the same observation but without its occurring to either of them to be alarmed at the circumstance the sun was now resting his huge disk upon the edge of the level ocean and gilded the accumulation of towering clouds through which he had travelled the livelong day and which now assembled on all sides like misfortunes and disasters around a sinking empire and falling monarch still however his dying splendour gave a sombre magnificence to the massive congregation of vapours forming out of their unsubstantial gloom the show of pyramids and towers some touched with gold some with purple some with a hue of deep and dark red the distant sea stretched beneath this varied and gorgeous canopy lay almost portentously still reflecting back the dazzling and level beams of the descending luminary and the splendid colouring of the clouds amidst which he was setting nearer to the beach the tide rippled onward in waves of sparkling silver that imperceptibly yet rapidly gained upon the sand  with a mind employed in admiration of the romantic scene or perhaps on some more agitating topic miss wardour advanced in silence by her fathers side whose recently offended dignity did not stoop to open any conversation following the windings of the beach they passed one projecting point of headland or rock after another and now found themselves under a huge and continued extent of the precipices by which that ironbound coast is in most places defended long projecting reefs of rock extending under water and only evincing their existence by here and there a peak entirely bare or by the breakers which foamed over those that were partially covered rendered knockwinnock bay dreaded by pilots and shipmasters the crags which rose between the beach and the mainland to the height of two or three hundred feet afforded in their crevices shelter for unnumbered seafowl in situations seemingly secured by their dizzy height from the rapacity of man many of these wild tribes with the instinct which sends them to seek the land before a storm arises were now winging towards their nests with the shrill and dissonant clang which announces disquietude and fear the disk of the sun became almost totally obscured ere he had altogether sunk below the horizon and an early and lurid shade of darkness blotted the serene twilight of a summer evening the wind began next to arise but its wild and moaning sound was heard for some time and its effects became visible on the bosom of the sea before the gale was felt on shore the mass of waters now dark and threatening began to lift itself in larger ridges and sink in deeper furrows forming waves that rose high in foam upon the breakers or burst upon the beach with a sound resembling distant thunder  appalled by this sudden change of weather miss wardour drew close to her father and held his arm fast i wish at length she said but almost in a whisper as if ashamed to express her increasing apprehensions i wish we had kept the road we intended or waited at monkbarns for the carriage  sir arthur looked round but did not see or would not acknowledge any signs of an immediate storm they would reach knockwinnock he said long before the tempest began but the speed with which he walked and with which isabella could hardly keep pace indicated a feeling that some exertion was necessary to accomplish his consolatory prediction  they were now near the centre of a deep but narrow bay or recess formed by two projecting capes of high and inaccessible rock which shot out into the sea like the horns of a crescentand neither durst communicate the apprehension which each began to entertain that from the unusually rapid advance of the tide they might be deprived of the power of proceeding by doubling the promontory which lay before them or of retreating by the road which brought them thither  as they thus pressed forward longing doubtless to exchange the easy curving line which the sinuosities of the bay compelled them to adopt for a straighter and more expeditious path sir arthur observed a human figure on the beach advancing to meet them thank god he exclaimed we shall get round halketheadthat person must have passed it thus giving vent to the feeling of hope though he had suppressed that of apprehension  thank god indeed echoed his daughter half audibly half internally as expressing the gratitude which she strongly felt  the figure which advanced to meet them made many signs which the haze of the atmosphere now disturbed by wind and by a drizzling rain prevented them from seeing or comprehending distinctlysome time before they met sir arthur could recognise the old bluegowned beggar edie ochiltree it is said that even the brute creation lay aside their animosities and antipathies when pressed by an instant and common danger the beach under halkethead rapidly diminishing in extent by the encroachments of a springtide and a northwest wind was in like manner a neutral field where even a justice of peace and a strolling mendicant might meet upon terms of mutual forbearance  turn back turn back exclaimed the vagrant why did ye not turn when i waved to you  we thought replied sir arthur in great agitation we thought we could get round halkethead  halketheadthe tide will be running on halkethead by this time like the fall of fyersit was a i could do to get round it twenty minutes sinceit was coming in three feet abreast we will maybe get back by ballyburgh ness point yet the lord help usits our only chance we can but try  my god my childmy father my dear father exclaimed the parent and daughter as fear lending them strength and speed they turned to retrace their steps and endeavoured to double the point the projection of which formed the southern extremity of the bay  i heard ye were here frae the bit callant ye sent to meet your carriage said the beggar as he trudged stoutly on a step or two behind miss wardour and i couldna bide to think o the dainty young leddys peril that has aye been kind to ilka forlorn heart that cam near her sae i lookit at the lift and the rin o the tide till i settled it that if i could get down time eneugh to gie you warning we wad do weel yet but i doubt i doubt i have been beguiled for what mortal ee ever saw sic a race as the tide is risening een now see yonders the rattons skerryhe aye held his neb abune the water in my daybut hes aneath it now  sir arthur cast a look in the direction in which the old man pointed a huge rock which in general even in springtides displayed a hulk like the keel of a large vessel was now quite under water and its place only indicated by the boiling and breaking of the eddying waves which encountered its submarine resistance  mak haste mak haste my bonny leddy continued the old manmak haste and we may do yet take haud o my arman auld and frail arm its now but its been in as sair stress as this is yet take haud o my arm my winsome leddy dye see yon wee black speck amang the wallowing waves yonder this morning it was as high as the mast o a brigits sma eneugh nowbut while i see as muckle black about it as the crown o my hat i winna believe but well get round the ballyburgh ness for a thats come and gane yet  isabella in silence accepted from the old man the assistance which sir arthur was less able to afford her the waves had now encroached so much upon the beach that the firm and smooth footing which they had hitherto had on the sand must be exchanged for a rougher path close to the foot of the precipice and in some places even raised upon its lower ledges it would have been utterly impossible for sir arthur wardour or his daughter to have found their way along these shelves without the guidance and encouragement of the beggar who had been there before in high tides though never he acknowledged in sae awsome a night as this  it was indeed a dreadful evening the howling of the storm mingled with the shrieks of the seafowl and sounded like the dirge of the three devoted beings who pent between two of the most magnificent yet most dreadful objects of naturea raging tide and an insurmountable precipicetoiled along their painful and dangerous path often lashed by the spray of some giant billow which threw itself higher on the beach than those that had preceded it each minute did their enemy gain ground perceptibly upon them still however loth to relinquish the last hopes of life they bent their eyes on the black rock pointed out by ochiltree it was yet distinctly visible among the breakers and continued to be so until they came to a turn in their precarious path where an intervening projection of rock hid it from their sight deprived of the view of the beacon on which they had relied they now experienced the double agony of terror and suspense they struggled forward however but when they arrived at the point from which they ought to have seen the crag it was no longer visible the signal of safety was lost among a thousand white breakers which dashing upon the point of the promontory rose in prodigious sheets of snowy foam as high as the mast of a firstrate manofwar against the dark brow of the precipice  the countenance of the old man fell isabella gave a faint shriek and god have mercy upon us which her guide solemnly uttered was piteously echoed by sir arthurmy child my childto die such a death  my father my dear father his daughter exclaimed clinging to himand you too who have lost your own life in endeavouring to save ours  thats not worth the counting said the old man i hae lived to be weary o life and here or yonderat the back o a dyke in a wreath o snaw or in the wame o a wave what signifies how the auld gaberlunzie dies  good man said sir arthur can you think of nothingof no helpill make you richill give you a farmill  our riches will be soon equal said the beggar looking out upon the strife of the watersthey are sae already for i hae nae land and you would give your fair bounds and barony for a square yard of rock that would be dry for twal hours  while they exchanged these words they paused upon the highest ledge of rock to which they could attain for it seemed that any further attempt to move forward could only serve to anticipate their fate here then they were to await the sure though slow progress of the raging element something in the situation of the martyrs of the early church who exposed by heathen tyrants to be slain by wild beasts were compelled for a time to witness the impatience and rage by which the animals were agitated while awaiting the signal for undoing their grates and letting them loose upon the victims  yet even this fearful pause gave isabella time to collect the powers of a mind naturally strong and courageous and which rallied itself at this terrible juncture must we yield life she said without a struggle is there no path however dreadful by which we could climb the crag or at least attain some height above the tide where we could remain till morning or till help comes they must be aware of our situation and will raise the country to relieve us  sir arthur who heard but scarcely comprehended his daughters question turned nevertheless instinctively and eagerly to the old man as if their lives were in his gift ochiltree pausedi was a bauld craigsman he said ance in my life and mony a kittywakes and lungies nest hae i harried up amang thae very black rocks but its lang lang syne and nae mortal could speel them without a ropeand if i had ane my eesight and my footstep and my handgrip hae a failed mony a day sinsyneand then how could i save you but there was a path here ance though maybe if we could see it ye would rather bide where we arehis name be praised he ejaculated suddenly theres ane coming down the crag een nowthen exalting his voice he hilload out to the daring

around miss wardour wrapping her previously in his own blue gown to preserve her as much as possible from injury then availing himself of the rope which was made fast at the other end he began to ascend the face of the craga most precarious and dizzy undertaking which however after one or two perilous escapes placed him safe on the broad flat stone beside our friend lovel their joint strength was able to raise isabella to the place of safety which they had attained lovel then descended in order to assist sir arthur around whom he adjusted the rope and again mounting to their place of refuge with the assistance of old ochiltree and such aid as sir arthur himself could afford he raised himself beyond the reach of the billows  illustration the rescue of sir arthur and miss wardour  the sense of reprieve from approaching and apparently inevitable death had its usual effect the father and daughter threw themselves into each others arms kissed and wept for joy although their escape was connected with the prospect of passing a tempestuous night upon a precipitous ledge of rock which scarce afforded footing for the four shivering beings who now like the seafowl around them clung there in hopes of some shelter from the devouring element which raged beneath the spray of the billows which attained in fearful succession the foot of the precipice overflowing the beach on which they so lately stood flew as high as their place of temporary refuge and the stunning sound with which they dashed against the rocks beneath seemed as if they still demanded the fugitives in accents of thunder as their destined prey it was a summer night doubtless yet the probability was slender that a frame so delicate as that of miss wardour should survive till morning the drenching of the spray and the dashing of the rain which now burst in full violence accompanied with deep and heavy gusts of wind added to the constrained and perilous circumstances of their situation  the lassiethe puir sweet lassie said the old man mony such a night have i weathered at hame and abroad but god guide us how can she ever win through it  his apprehension was communicated in smothered accents to lovel for with the sort of freemasonry by which bold and ready spirits correspond in moments of danger and become almost instinctively known to each other they had established a mutual confidenceill climb up the cliff again said loveltheres daylight enough left to see my footing ill climb up and call for more assistance  do so do so for heavens sake said sir arthur eagerly  are ye mad said the

you i charge you said isabella faintly i am well and can spend the night very well herei feel quite refreshed so saying her voice failed hershe sunk down and would have fallen from the crag had she not been supported by lovel and ochiltree who placed her in a posture half sitting half reclining beside her father who exhausted by fatigue of body and mind so extreme and unusual had already sat down on a stone in a sort of stupor  it is impossible to leave them said lovelwhat is to be donehark harkdid i not hear a halloo  the skreigh of a tammie norie answered ochiltreei ken the skirl weel  no by heaven replied lovel it was a human voice  a distant hail was repeated the sound plainly distinguishable among the various elemental noises and the clang of the seamews by which they were surrounded the mendicant and lovel exerted their voices in a loud halloo the former waving miss wardours handkerchief on the end of his staff to make them conspicuous from above though the shouts were repeated it was some time before they were in exact response to their own leaving the unfortunate sufferers uncertain whether in the darkening twilight and increasing storm they had made the persons who apparently were traversing the verge of the precipice to bring them assistance sensible of the place in which they had found refuge at length their halloo was regularly and distinctly answered and their courage confirmed by the assurance that they were within hearing if not within reach of friendly assistance     chapter eighth                there is a cliff whose high and bending head                  looks fearfully on the confined deep                  bring me but to the very brim of it               and ill repair the misery thou dost bear                                     king lear  the shout of human voices from above was soon augmented and the gleam of torches mingled with those lights of evening which still remained amidst the darkness of the storm some attempt was made to hold communication between the assistants above and the sufferers beneath who were still clinging to their precarious place of safety but the howling of the tempest limited their intercourse to cries as inarticulate as those of the winged denizens of the crag which shrieked in chorus alarmed by the reiterated sound of human voices where they had seldom been heard  on the verge of the precipice an anxious group had now assembled oldbuck was the foremost and most earnest pressing forward with unwonted desperation to the very brink of the crag and extending his head his hat and wig secured by a handkerchief under his chin over the dizzy height with an air of determination which made his more timorous assistants tremble  haud a care haud a care monkbarns cried caxon clinging to the skirts of his patron and withholding him from danger as far as his strength permittedgods sake haud a caresir arthurs drowned already and an ye fa over the cleugh too there will be but ae wig left in the parish

and brandy lang syneget up the pickaxe make a step for the mastmake the chair fast with the rattlinhaul taught and belay  the fishers had brought with them the mast of a boat and as half of the country fellows about had now appeared either out of zeal or curiosity it was soon sunk in the ground and sufficiently secured a yard across the upright mast and a rope stretched along it and reeved through a block at each end formed an extempore crane which afforded the means of lowering an armchair well secured and fastened down to the flat shelf on which the sufferers had roosted their joy at hearing the preparations going on for their deliverance was considerably qualified when they beheld the precarious vehicle by means of which they were to be conveyed to upper air it swung about a yard free of the spot which they occupied obeying each impulse of the tempest the empty air all around it and depending upon the security of a rope which in the increasing darkness had dwindled to an almost imperceptible thread besides the hazard of committing a human being to the vacant atmosphere in such a slight means of conveyance there was the fearful danger of the chair and its occupant being dashed either by the wind or the vibrations of the cord against the rugged face of the precipice but to diminish the risk as much as possible the experienced seaman had let down with the chair another line which being attached to it and held by the persons beneath might serve by way of gy as mucklebackit expressed it to render its descent in some measure steady and regular still to commit ones self in such a vehicle through a howling tempest of wind and rain with a beetling precipice above and a raging abyss below required that courage which despair alone can inspire yet wild as the sounds and sights of danger were both above beneath and around and doubtful and dangerous as the mode of escaping appeared to be lovel and the old mendicant agreed after a moments consultation and after the former by a sudden strong pull had at his own imminent risk ascertained the security of the rope that it would be best to secure miss wardour in the chair and trust to the tenderness and care of those above for her being safely craned up to the top of the crag  let my father go first exclaimed isabella for gods sake my friends place him first in safety  it cannot be miss wardour said lovelyour life must be first securedthe rope which bears your weight may  i will not listen to a reason so selfish  but ye maun listen to it my bonnie lassie said ochiltree for a our lives depend on

reasoning she exclaimed true most true i am ready and willing to undertake the first riskwhat shall i say to our friends above  just to look that their tackle does not graze on the face o the crag and to let the chair down and draw it up hooly and fairlywe will halloo when we are ready  with the sedulous attention of a parent to a child lovel bound miss wardour with his handkerchief neckcloth and the mendicants leathern belt to the back and arms of the chair ascertaining accurately the security of each knot while ochiltree kept sir arthur quiet what are ye doing wi my bairnwhat are ye doingshe shall not be separated from meisabel stay with me i command you  lordsake sir arthur haud your tongue and be thankful to god that theres wiser folk than you to manage this job cried the beggar worn out by the unreasonable exclamations of the poor baronet  farewell my father murmured isabellafarewell mymy friends and shutting her eyes as edies experience recommended she gave the signal to lovel and he to those who were above she rose while the chair in which she sate was kept steady by the line which lovel managed beneath with a beating heart he watched the flutter of her white dress until the vehicle was on a level with the brink of the precipice  canny now lads canny now exclaimed old mucklebackit who acted as commodore swerve the yard a bitnowthere there she sits safe on dry land  a loud shout announced the successful experiment to her fellowsufferers beneath who replied with a ready and cheerful halloo monkbarns in his ecstasy of joy stripped his greatcoat to wrap up the young lady and would have pulled off his coat and waistcoat for the same purpose had he not been withheld by the cautious caxon haud a care o us your honour will be killed wi the hoastyell no get out oyour

of his coat youre right caxon this is a naughty night to swim inmiss wardour let me convey you to the chariot  not for worlds till i see my father safe  in a few distinct words evincing how much her resolution had surmounted even the mortal fear of so agitating a hazard she explained the nature of the situation beneath and the wishes of lovel and ochiltree  right right thats right tooi should like to see the son of sir gamelyn de guardover on dry land myselfi have a notion he would sign the abjuration oath and the ragmanroll to boot and acknowledge queen mary to be nothing better than she should be to get alongside my bottle of old port that he ran away from and left scarce begun but hes safe now and here a comesfor the chair was again lowered and sir arthur made fast in it without

his daughter who assuming that authority which the circumstances demanded ordered some of the assistants to convey him to the chariot promising to follow in a few minutes she lingered on the cliff holding an old countrymans arm to witness probably the safety of those whose dangers she had shared  what have we here said oldbuck as the vehicle once more ascendedwhat patched and weatherbeaten

were like john harlowesyo ho my hearts bowse away with him  lovel did in fact run a much greater risk than any of his precursors his weight was not sufficient to render his ascent steady amid such a storm of wind and he swung like an agitated pendulum at the mortal risk of being dashed against the rocks but he was young bold and active and with the assistance of the beggars stout piked staff which he had retained by advice of the proprietor contrived to bear himself from the face of the precipice and the yet more hazardous projecting cliffs which varied its surface tossed in empty space like an idle and unsubstantial feather with a motion that agitated the brain at once with fear and with dizziness he retained his alertness of exertion and presence of mind and it was not until he was safely grounded upon the summit of the cliff that he felt temporary and giddy sickness as he recovered from a sort of half swoon he cast his eyes eagerly around the object which they would most willingly have sought was already in the act of vanishing her white garment was just discernible as she followed on the path which her father had taken she had lingered till she saw the last of their company rescued from danger and until she had been assured by the hoarse voice of mucklebackit that the callant had come off wi unbrizzed banes and that he was but in a kind of dwam but lovel was not aware that she had expressed in his fate even this degree of interestwhich though nothing more than was due to a stranger who had assisted her in such an hour of peril he would have gladly purchased by braving even more imminent danger than he had that evening been exposed to the beggar she had already commanded to come to knockwinnock that night he made an excusethen tomorrow let me see you  the

praiseworthy qualities besides age though that too is honourable albeit it is the last quality for which womankind would wish to be honouredbut perpend my words let lovel and me have forthwith the relics of the chickenpie and the reversion of the port  the chickenpie the portou dear brotherthere was but a wheen banes and scarce a drap o the wine  the antiquarys countenance became clouded though he was too well bred to give way in the presence of a stranger to his displeased surprise at the disappearance of the viands on which he had reckoned with absolute certainty but his sister understood these looks of ire ou dear monkbarns whats the use of making a wark  i make no wark as ye call it woman  but whats the use o looking sae glum and glunch about a pickle banesan ye will hae the truth ye

 hout monkbarns ye speak as if there was nae mair meat in the housewad ye not have had me offer the honest man some slight refreshment after his walk frae the manse  oldbuck halfwhistled halfhummed

               the deil clink down wi that o  his sister hastened to silence his murmurs by proposing some of the relies of the dinner he spoke of another bottle of wine but recommended in preference a glass of brandy which was really excellent as no entreaties could prevail on lovel to indue the velvet nightcap and branched morninggown of his host oldbuck who pretended to a little knowledge of the medical art insisted on his going to bed as soon as possible and proposed to despatch a messenger the indefatigable caxon to fairport early in the morning to procure him a change of clothes  this was the first intimation miss oldbuck had received that the young stranger was to be their guest for the night and such was the surprise with which she was struck by a proposal so uncommon that had the superincumbent weight of her headdress such as we before described been less preponderant her grey locks must have started up on end and hurled it from its position  lord haud a care o us exclaimed the astounded maiden  whats the matter now grizel  wad ye but just speak a moment monkbarns  speakwhat should i speak about i want to get to my bedand this poor young fellowlet a bed be made

am sure ye ken yoursell what a night he hadye wadna expose the young gentleman to the like o that wad ye  lovel interfered upon hearing this altercation and protested he would far rather walk home than put them to the least inconveniencethat the exercise would be of service to himthat he knew the road perfectly by night or day to fairportthat the storm was abating and so forthadding all that civility could suggest as an excuse for escaping from a hospitality which seemed more inconvenient to his host than he could possibly have anticipated but the howling of the wind and the pattering of the rain against the windows with his knowledge of the preceding fatigues of the evening must have prohibited oldbuck even had he entertained less regard for his young friend than he really felt from permitting him to depart besides he was piqued in honour to show that he himself was not governed by womankindsit ye down sit ye down sit ye down man he reiteratedan ye part so i would i might never draw a cork again and here comes out one from a prime bottle ofstrong aleright anno domininone of your wassia quassia decoctions but brewed of monkbarns barleyjohn of the girnel never drew a better flagon to entertain a wandering minstrel or palmer with the freshest news from palestineand to remove from your mind the slightest wish to depart know that if you do so your character as a gallant knight is gone for ever why tis an adventure man to sleep in the green room at monkbarnssister pray see it got readyand although the bold adventurer heavysterne dreed pain and dolour in that charmed apartment it is no reason why a gallant knight like you nearly twice as tall and not half so heavy should not encounter and break the spell  what a haunted apartment i suppose  to be sure to be sureevery mansion in this country of the slightest antiquity has its ghosts and its haunted chamber and you must not suppose us worse off than our neighbours they are going indeed somewhat out of fashion i have seen the day when if you had doubted the reality of a ghost in an old manorhouse you ran the risk of being made a ghost yourself as hamlet saysyes if you had challenged the existence of redcowl in the castle of glenstirym old sir peter pepperbrand would have had ye out to his courtyard made you betake yourself to your weapon and if your trick of fence were not the better would have sticked you like a paddock on his own baronial middenstead i once narrowly escaped such an affraybut i humbled myself and apologised to redcowl for even in my younger days i was no friend to the monomachia or duel and would rather walk with sir priest than with sir knighti care not who knows so much of my valour thank god i am old now and can indulge my irritabilities without the necessity of supporting them by cold steel  here miss oldbuck reentered with a singularly sage expression of countenancemr lovels beds ready brotherclean sheetsweel aireda spunk of fire in the chimneyi am sure mr lovel addressing him its no for the troubleand i hope you will have a good nights restbut  you are resolved said the antiquary to do what you can to prevent it  mei am sure i have said naething

doneweel i was at the search that our gudesire monkbarns that then was made wi auld rab tulls assistancebut neerbelicket could they find that was to their purpose and sae after they had touzled out mony a leather pokefull o papers the townclerk had his drap punch at een to wash the dust out of his throatwe never were glassbreakers in this house mr lovel but the body had got sic a trick of sippling and tippling wi the bailies and deacons when they met which was amaist ilka night concerning the common gude o the burgh that he couldna weel sleep without itbut his punch he gat and to bed he gaed and in the middle of the night he got a fearfu wakeninghe was never just himsell after it and he was strucken wi the dead palsy that very day four years he thought mr lovel that he heard the curtains o his bed fissil and out he lookit fancying puir man it might hae been the catbut he sawgod hae a care o us it gars my flesh aye creep though i hae tauld the story twenty timeshe saw a weelfaard auld gentleman standing by his bedside in the moonlight in a queerfashioned dress wi mony a button and bandstring about it and that part o his garments which it does not become a leddy to particulareeze was baith side and wide and as mony plies ot as of ony hamburgh skippershe had a beard too and whiskers turned upwards on his upperlip as lang as baudronsand mony mair particulars there were that rab tull tauld o but they are forgotten nowits an auld story aweel rab was a justliving man for a country writerand he was less feared than maybe might just hae been expected and he asked in the name o goodness what the apparition wantedand the spirit answered in an unknown tongue then rab said he tried him wi erse for he cam in his youth frae the braes of glenlivatbut it wadna do aweel in this strait he bethought him of the twa or three words o latin that he used in making out the towns deeds and he had nae sooner tried the spirit wi that than out cam sic a blatter o latin about his lugs that poor rab tull wha was nae great scholar was clean overwhelmed od but he was a bauld body and he minded the latin name for the deed that he was wanting it was something about a cart i fancy for the ghaist cried aye carter carter  carta you transformer of languages cried oldbuckif my ancestor had learned no other language in the other world at least he would not forget the latinity for which he was so famous while in this  weel weel carta be it then but they cad it carter that telld me the story it cried aye carta if sae be that it was carta and made a sign to rab to follow it rab tull keepit a highland heart and banged out o bed and till some of his readiest claesand he did follow the thing up stairs and down stairs to the place we ca the high dowcota sort of a little tower in the corner of the auld house where there was a rickle o useless boxes and trunksand there the ghaist gae rab a kick wi the tae foot and a kick wi the tother to that very auld eastcountry tabernacle of a cabinet that my brother has standing beside his library table and then disappeared like a fuff o tobacco leaving rab in a very pitiful condition  tenues secessit in auras quoth oldbuck marry sir mansit odorbut sure enough the deed was there found in a drawer of this forgotten repository which contained many other curious old papers now properly labelled and arranged and which seemed to have belonged to my ancestor the first possessor of monkbarns the deed thus strangely recovered was the original charter of erection of the abbey abbey lands and so forth of trotcosey comprehending monkbarns and others into a lordship of regality in favour of the first earl of glengibber a favourite of james the sixth it is subscribed by the king at westminster the seventeenth day of january a d one thousand six hundred and twelvethirteen its not worth while to repeat the witnesses names  i would rather said lovel with awakened curiosity i would rather hear your opinion of the way in which the deed was discovered  why if i wanted a patron for my legend i could find no less a one than saint augustine who tells the story of a deceased person appearing to his son when sued for a debt which had been paid and directing him where to find the discharge  note d mr rutherfords dream  but i rather opine with lord bacon who says that imagination is much akin to miracleworking faith there was always some idle story of the room being haunted by the spirit of aldobrand oldenbuck my greatgreatgreatgrandfatherits a shame to the english language that we have not a less clumsy way of expressing a relationship of which we have occasion to think and speak so frequently he was a foreigner and wore his national dress of which tradition had preserved an accurate description and indeed there is a print of him supposed to be by reginald elstracke pulling the press with his own hand as it works off the sheets of his scarce edition of the augsburg confession he was a chemist as well as a good mechanic and either of these qualities in this country was at that time sufficient to constitute a white witch at least this superstitious old writer had heard all this and probably believed it and in his sleep the image and idea of my ancestor recalled that of his cabinet which with the grateful attention to antiquities and the memory of our ancestors not unusually met with had been pushed into the pigeonhouse to be out of the wayadd a quantum sufficit of exaggeration and you have a key to the whole mystery  o brother brother but dr heavysterne brotherwhose sleep was so sore broken that he declared he wadna pass another night in the green room to get all monkbarns so that mary and i were forced to yield our  why grizel the doctor is a good honest puddingheaded german of much merit in his own way but fond of the mystical like many of his countrymen you and he had a traffic the whole evening in which you received tales of mesmer shropfer cagliostro and other modern pretenders to the mystery of raising spirits discovering hidden treasure and so forth in exchange for your legends of the green bedchamberand considering that the illustrissimus ate a pound and a half of scotch collops to supper smoked six pipes and drank ale and brandy in proportion i am not surprised at his having a fit of the nightmare but everything is now ready permit me to light you to your apartment mr loveli am sure you have need of restand i trust my ancestor is too sensible of the duties of hospitality to interfere with the repose which you have so well merited by your manly and gallant behaviour  so saying the antiquary took up a bedroom candlestick of massive silver and antique form which he observed was wrought out of the silver found in the mines of the harz mountains and had been the property of the very personage who had supplied them with a subject for conversation and having so said he led the way through many a dusky and winding passage now ascending and anon descending again until he came to the apartment destined for his young guest     chapter tenth                   when midnight oer the moonless skies                  her pall of transient death has spread                  when mortals sleep when spectres rise                    and none are wakeful but the dead                    no bloodless shape my way pursues                    no sheeted ghost my couch annoys                    visions more sad my fancy views                        visions of long departed joys                                         w r spenser  when they reached the green room as it was called oldbuck placed the candle on the toilet table before a huge mirror with a black japanned frame surrounded by dressingboxes of the same and looked around him with something of a disturbed expression of countenance i am seldom in this apartment he said and never without yielding to a melancholy feelingnot of course on account of the childish nonsense that grizel was telling you but owing to circumstances of an early and unhappy attachment it is at such moments as these mr lovel that we feel the changes of time the same objects are before usthose inanimate things which we have gazed on in wayward infancy and impetuous youth in anxious and scheming manhoodthey are permanent and the same but when we look upon them in cold unfeeling old age can we changed in our temper our pursuits our feelingschanged in our form our limbs and our strengthcan we be ourselves called the same or do we not rather look back with a sort of wonder upon our former selves as being separate and distinct from what we now are the philosopher who appealed from philip inflamed with wine to philip in his hours of sobriety did not choose a judge so different as if he had appealed from philip in his youth to philip in his old age i cannot but be touched with the feeling so beautifully expressed in a poem which i have heard repeated  probably wordsworths lyrical ballads had not as yet been published                     my eyes are dim with childish tears                        my heart is idly stirred                    for the same sound is in my ears                       which in those days i heard                     thus fares it still in our decay                         and yet the wiser mind                    mourns less for what time takes away                        than what he leaves behind  well time cures every wound and though the scar may remain and occasionally ache yet the earliest agony of its recent infliction is felt no moreso saying he shook lovel cordially by the hand wished him goodnight and took his leave  step after step lovel could trace his hosts retreat along the various passages and each door which he closed behind him fell with a sound more distant and dead the guest thus separated from the living world took up the candle and surveyed the apartment  the fire blazed cheerfully mrs grizels attention had left some fresh wood should he choose to continue it and the apartment had a comfortable though not a lively appearance it was hung with tapestry which the looms of arras had produced in the sixteenth century and which the learned typographer so often mentioned had brought with him as a sample of the arts of the continent the subject was a huntingpiece and as the leafy boughs of the foresttrees branching over the tapestry formed the predominant colour the apartment had thence acquired its name of the green chamber grim figures in the old flemish dress with slashed doublets covered with ribbands short cloaks and trunkhose were engaged in holding greyhounds or staghounds in the leash or cheering them upon the objects of their game others with boarspears swords and oldfashioned guns were attacking stags or boars whom they had brought to bay the branches of the woven forest were crowded with fowls of various kinds each depicted with its proper plumage it seemed as if the prolific and rich invention of old chaucer had animated the flemish artist with its profusion and oldbuck had accordingly caused the following verses from that ancient and excellent poet to be embroidered in gothic letters on a sort of border which he had added to the tapestry                lo here be oakis grete streight as a line               under the which the grass so fresh of line               beth newly sprungat eight foot or nine               everich tree well from his fellow grew               with branches broad laden with leaves new               that sprongen out against the sonne sheene               some golden red and some a glad bright green  and in another canton was the following similar legend                    and many an hart and many an hind                     was both before me and behind                   of fawns sownders bucks and does                     was full the wood and many roes                     and many squirrels that ysate                     high on the trees and nuts ate  the bed was of a dark and faded green wrought to correspond with the tapestry but by a more modern and less skilful hand the large and heavy stuffbottomed chairs with black ebony backs were embroidered after the same pattern and a lofty mirror over the antique chimneypiece corresponded in its mounting with that on the oldfashioned toilet  i have heard muttered lovel as he took a cursory view of the room and its furniture that ghosts often chose the best room in the mansion to which they attached themselves and i cannot disapprove of the taste of the disembodied printer of the augsburg confession but he found it so difficult to fix his mind upon the stories which had been told him of an apartment with which they seemed so singularly to correspond that he almost regretted the absence of those agitated feelings half fear half curiosity which sympathise with the old legends of awe and wonder from which the anxious reality of his own hopeless passion at present detached him for he now only felt emotions like those expressed in the lines                   ah cruel maid how hast thou changed                         the temper of my mind                  my heart by thee from all estranged                         becomes like thee unkind  he endeavoured to conjure up something like the feelings which would at another time have been congenial to his situation but his heart had no room for these vagaries of imagination the recollection of miss wardour determined not to acknowledge him when compelled to endure his society and evincing her purpose to escape from it would have alone occupied his imagination exclusively but with this were united recollections more agitating if less painfulher hairbreadth escapethe fortunate assistance which he had been able to render heryet what was his requital she left the cliff while his fate was yet doubtfulwhile it was uncertain whether her preserver had not lost the life which he had exposed for her so freely surely gratitude at least called for some little interest in his fatebut noshe could not be selfish or unjustit was no part of her nature she only desired to shut the door against hope and even in compassion to him to extinguish a passion which she could never return  but this loverlike mode of reasoning was not likely to reconcile him to his fate since the more amiable his imagination presented miss wardour the more inconsolable he felt he should be rendered by the extinction of his hopes he was indeed conscious of possessing the power of removing her prejudices on some points but even in extremity he determined to keep the original determination which he had formed of ascertaining that she desired an explanation ere he intruded one upon her and turn the matter as he would he could not regard his suit as desperate there was something of embarrassment as well as of grave surprise in her look when oldbuck presented himand perhaps upon second thoughts the one was assumed to cover the other he would not relinquish a pursuit which had already cost him such pains plans suiting the romantic temper of the brain that entertained them chased each other through his head thick and irregular as the motes of the sunbeam and long after he had laid himself to rest continued to prevent the repose which he greatly needed then wearied by the uncertainty and difficulties with which each scheme appeared to be attended he bent up his mind to the strong effort of shaking off his love like dewdrops from the lions mane and resuming those studies and that career of life which his unrequited affection had so long and so fruitlessly interrupted in this last resolution he endeavoured to fortify himself by every argument which pride as well as reason could suggest she shall not suppose he said that presuming on an accidental service to her or to her father i am desirous to intrude myself upon that notice to which personally she considered me as having no title i will see her no more i will return to the land which if it affords none fairer has at least many as fair and less haughty than miss wardour tomorrow i will bid adieu to these northern shores and to her who is as cold and relentless as her climate when he had for some time brooded over this sturdy resolution exhausted nature at length gave way and despite of wrath doubt and anxiety he sank into slumber  it is seldom that sleep after such violent agitation is either sound or refreshing lovels was disturbed by a thousand baseless and confused visions he was a birdhe was a fishor he flew like the one and swam like the otherqualities which would have been very essential to his safety a few hours before then miss wardour was a syren or a bird of paradise her father a triton or a seagull and oldbuck alternately a porpoise and a cormorant these agreeable imaginations were varied by all the usual vagaries of a feverish dreamthe air refused to bear the visionary the water seemed to burn himthe rocks felt like down pillows as he was dashed against themwhatever he undertook failed in some strange and unexpected mannerand whatever attracted his attention underwent as he attempted to investigate it some wild and wonderful metamorphosis while his mind continued all the while in some degree conscious of the delusion from which it in vain struggled to free itself by awakingfeverish symptoms all with which those who are haunted by the nighthag whom the learned call ephialtes are but too well acquainted at length these crude phantasmata arranged themselves into something more regular if indeed the imagination of lovel after he awoke for it was by no means the faculty in which his mind was least rich did not gradually insensibly and unintentionally arrange in better order the scene of which his sleep presented it may be a less distinct outline or it is possible that his feverish agitation may have assisted him in forming the vision  leaving this discussion to the learned we will say that after a succession of wild images such as we have above described our hero for such we must acknowledge him so far regained a consciousness of locality as to remember where he was and the whole furniture of the green chamber was depicted to his slumbering eye and here once more let me protest that if there should be so much oldfashioned faith left among this shrewd and sceptical generation as to suppose that what follows was an impression conveyed rather by the eye than by the imagination i do not impugn their doctrine he was then or imagined himself broad awake in the green chamber gazing upon the flickering and occasional flame which the unconsumed remnants of the faggots sent forth as one by one they fell down upon the red embers into which the principal part of the boughs to which they belonged had crumbled away insensibly the legend of aldobrand oldenbuck and his mysterious visits to the inmates of the chamber awoke in his mind and with it as we often feel in dreams an anxious and fearful expectation which seldom fails instantly to summon up before our minds eye the object of our fear brighter sparkles of light flashed from the chimney with such intense brilliancy as to enlighten all the room the tapestry waved wildly on the wall till its dusky forms seemed to become animated the hunters blew their hornsthe stag seemed to fly the boar to resist and the hounds to assail the one and pursue the other the cry of deer mangled by throttling dogsthe shouts of men and the clatter of horses hoofs seemed at once to surround himwhile every group pursued with all the fury of the chase the employment in which the artist had represented them as engaged lovel looked on this strange scene devoid of wonder which seldom intrudes itself upon the sleeping fancy but with an anxious sensation of awful fear at length an individual figure among the tissued huntsmen as he gazed upon them more fixedly seemed to leave the arras and to approach the bed of the slumberer as he drew near his figure appeared to alter his buglehorn became a brazen clasped volume his huntingcap changed to such a furred headgear as graces the burgomasters of rembrandt his flemish garb remained but his features no longer agitated with the fury of the chase were changed to such a state of awful and stern composure as might best portray the first proprietor of monkbarns such as he had been described to lovel by his descendants in the course of the preceding evening as this metamorphosis took place the hubbub among the other personages in the arras disappeared from the imagination of the dreamer which was now exclusively bent on the single figure before him lovel strove to interrogate this awful person in the form of exorcism proper for the occasion but his tongue as is usual in frightful dreams refused its office and clung palsied to the roof of his mouth aldobrand held up his finger as if to impose silence upon the guest who had intruded on his apartment and began deliberately to unclasp the venerable volume which occupied his left hand when it was unfolded he turned over the leaves hastily for a short space and then raising his figure to its full dimensions and holding the book aloft in his left hand pointed to a passage in the page which he thus displayed although the language was unknown to our dreamer his eye and attention were both strongly caught by the line which the figure seemed thus to press upon his notice the words of which appeared to blaze with a supernatural light and remained riveted upon his memory as the vision shut his volume a strain of delightful music seemed to fill the apartmentlovel started and became completely awake the music however was still in his ears nor ceased till he could distinctly follow the measure of an old scottish tune  he sate up in bed and endeavoured to clear his brain of the phantoms which had disturbed it during this weary night the beams of the morning sun streamed through the halfclosed shutters and admitted a distinct light into the apartment he looked round upon the hangingsbut the mixed groups of silken and worsted huntsmen were as stationary as tenterhooks could make them and only trembled slightly as the early breeze which found its way through an open crevice of the latticed window glided along their surface lovel leapt out of bed and wrapping himself in a morninggown that had been considerately laid by his bedside stepped towards the window which commanded a view of the sea the roar of whose billows announced it still disquieted by the storm of the preceding evening although the morning was fair and serene the window of a turret which projected at an angle with the wall and thus came to be very near lovels apartment was halfopen and from that quarter he heard again the same music which had probably broken short his dream with its visionary character it had lost much of its charmsit was now nothing more than an air on the harpsichord tolerably well performedsuch is the caprice of imagination as affecting the fine arts a female voice sung with some taste and great simplicity something between a song and a hymn in words to the following effect                   why sittst thou by that ruind hall                   thou aged carle so stern and grey                   dost thou its former pride recall                      or ponder how it passed away               knowst thou not me the deep voice cried                    so long enjoyed so oft misused                     alternate in thy fickle pride                     desired neglected and accused                  before my breath like blazing flax                     man and his marvels pass away                     and changing empires wane and wax                    are founded flourish and decay                  redeem mine hoursthe space is brief                 while in my glass the sandgrains shiver                    and measureless thy joy or grief                 when time and thou shalt part for ever  while the verses were yet singing lovel had returned to his bed the train of ideas which they awakened was romantic and pleasing such as his soul delighted in and willingly adjourning till more broad day the doubtful task of determining on his future line of conduct he abandoned himself to the pleasing languor inspired by the music and fell into a sound and refreshing sleep from which he was only awakened at a late hour by old caxon who came creeping into the room to render the offices of a valetdechambre  i have brushed your coat sir said the old man when he perceived lovel was awake the callant brought it frae fairport this morning for that ye had on yesterday is scantly feasibly dry though its been a night at the kitchen fire and i hae cleaned your shoon i doubt yell no be wanting me to tie your hair for with a gentle sigh a the young gentlemen wear crops now but i hae the curling tangs here to gie it a bit turn ower the brow if ye like before ye gae down to the leddies  lovel who was by this time once more on his legs declined the old mans professional offices but accompanied the refusal with such a douceur as completely sweetened caxons mortification  its a pity he disna get his hair tied and pouthered said the ancient friseur when he had got once more into the kitchen in which on one pretence or other he spent three parts of his idle timethat is to say of his whole timeits a great pity for hes a comely young gentleman  hout awa ye auld gowk said jenny rintherout would ye creesh his bonny brown hair wi your nasty ulyie and

lovels headye wad spoil the maist natural and beautifaest head o hair in a fairport baith burgh and county  the poor barber sighed over the disrespect into which his art had so universally fallen but jenny was a person too important to offend by contradiction so sitting quietly down in the kitchen he digested at once his humiliation and the contents of a bicker which held a scotch pint of substantial oatmeal porridge     chapter eleventh              sometimes he thinks that heaven this pageant sent                and ordered all the pageants as they went              sometimes that only twas wild fancys play                the loose and scattered relics of the day  we must now request our readers to adjourn to the breakfast parlour of mr oldbuck who despising the modern slops of tea and coffee was substantially regaling himself more majorum with cold roastbeef and a glass of a sort of beverage called muma species of fat ale brewed from wheat and bitter herbs of which the present generation only know the name by its occurrence in revenue acts of parliament coupled with cider perry and other excisable commodities lovel who was seduced to taste it with difficulty refrained from pronouncing it detestable but did refrain as he saw he should otherwise give great offence to his host who had the liquor annually prepared with peculiar care according to the approved recipe bequeathed to him by the sooften mentioned aldobrand oldenbuck the hospitality of the ladies offered lovel a breakfast more suited to modern taste and while he was engaged in partaking of it he was assailed by indirect inquiries concerning the manner in which he had passed the night  we canna compliment mr lovel on his looks this morning brotherbut he winna condescend on any ground of disturbance he has had in the night time i am certain he looks very pale and when he came here he was as fresh as a rose  why sister consider this rose of yours has been knocked about by sea and wind all yesterday evening as if he had been a bunch of kelp or tangle and how the devil would you have him retain his colour  i certainly do still feel somewhat fatigued said lovel notwithstanding the excellent accommodations with which your hospitality so amply supplied me  ah sir said miss oldbuck looking at him with a knowing smile or what was meant to be one yell not allow of ony inconvenience out of civility to us  really madam replied lovel i had no disturbance for i cannot term such the music with which some kind fairy favoured me  i doubted mary wad waken you wi her skreighing she dinna

he be formed of air can be expelled by a receipt against windthis wise grizel of mine mr lovel recollects with what accuracy you may judge a charm which i once mentioned to her and which happening to hit her superstitious noddle she remembers better than anything tending to a useful purpose i may chance to have said for this ten years but many an old woman besides herself  auld woman monkbarns said miss oldbuck roused something above her usual submissive tone ye really are less than civil to me  not less than just grizel however i include in the same class many a sounding name from jamblichus down to aubrey who have wasted their time in devising imaginary remedies for nonexisting diseasesbut i hope my young friend that charmed or uncharmedsecured by the potency of hypericon

itselfno is a surly honest fellowspeaks his mind rough and round at once but is a sneaking evasive halfbred exceptuous sort of a conjunction which comes to pull away the cup just when it is at your lips                               it does allay                 the good precedentfie upon but yet                 but yet is as a jailor to bring forth                          some monstrous malefactor  well then answered lovel whose motions were really undetermined at the moment you shall not connect the recollection of my name with so churlish a particle i must soon think of leaving fairport i am afraidand i will since you are good enough to wish it take this opportunity of spending another day here  and you shall be rewarded my boy first you shall see john o the girnels grave and then well walk gently along the sands the state of the tide being first ascertained for we will have no more peter wilkins adventures no more glum and gawrie work as far as knockwinnock castle and inquire after the old knight and my fair foewhich will but be barely civil and then  i beg pardon my dear sir but perhaps you had better adjourn your visit till tomorrowi am a stranger you know  and are therefore the more bound to show civility i should suppose but i beg your pardon for mentioning a word that perhaps belongs only to a collector of antiquitiesi am one of the old school    when courtiers galloped oer four counties   the balls fair partner to behold   and humbly hope she caught no cold  why ififif you thought it would be expectedbut i believe i had better stay  nay nay my good friend i am not so oldfashioned as to press you to what is disagreeable neitherit is sufficient that i see there is some remora some cause of delay some mid impediment which i have no title to inquire into or you are still somewhat tired perhapsi warrant i find means to entertain your intellects without fatiguing your limbsi am no friend to violent exertion myselfa walk in the garden once aday is exercise enough for any thinking beingnone but a fool or a foxhunter would require more well what shall we set aboutmy essay on castrametationbut i have that in petto for our afternoon cordialor i will show you the controversy upon ossians poems between maccribb and me i hold with the acute orcadianhe with the defenders of the authenticitythe controversy began in smooth oily ladylike terms but is now waxing more sour and eager as we get onit already partakes somewhat of old scaligers style i fear the rogue will get some scent of that story of ochiltreesbut at worst i have a hard repartee for him on the affair of the abstracted antigonusi will show you his last epistle and the scroll of my answeregad it is a trimmer  so saying the antiquary opened a drawer and began rummaging among a quantity of miscellaneous papers ancient and modern but it was the misfortune of this learned gentleman as it may be that of many learned and unlearned that he frequently experienced on such occasions what harlequin calls lembarras des richesses in other words the abundance of his collection often prevented him from finding the article he sought for curse the papersi believe said oldbuck as he shuffled them to and froi believe they make themselves wings like grasshoppers and fly away bodilybut here in the meanwhile look at that little treasure so saying he put into his hand a case made of oak fenced at the corner with silver roses and studsprythee undo this button said he as he observed lovel fumbling at the clasp he did sothe lid opened and discovered a thin quarto curiously bound in black shagreenthere mr lovelthere is the work i mentioned to you last nightthe rare quarto of the augsburg confession the foundation at once and the bulwark of the reformation drawn up by the learned and venerable melancthon defended by the elector of saxony and the other valiant hearts who stood up for their faith even against the front of a powerful and victorious emperor and imprinted by the scarcely less venerable and praiseworthy aldobrand oldenbuck my happy progenitor during the yet more tyrannical attempts of philip ii to suppress at once civil and religious liberty yes sirfor printing this work that eminent man was expelled from his ungrateful country and driven to establish his household gods even here at monkbarns among the ruins of papal superstition and dominationlook upon his venerable effigies mr lovel and respect the honourable occupation in which it presents him as labouring personally at the press for the diffusion of christian and political knowledgeand see here his favourite motto expressive of his independence and selfreliance which scorned to owe anything to patronage that was not earned by desertexpressive also of that firmness of mind and tenacity of purpose recommended by horace he was indeed a man who would have stood firm had his whole printinghouse presses fonts forms great and small pica been shivered to pieces around himread i say his mottofor each printer had his motto or device when that illustrious art was first practised my ancestors was expressed as you see in the teutonic phrase kunst macht gunstthat is skill or prudence in availing ourselves of our natural talents and advantages will compel favour and patronage even where it is withheld from prejudice or ignorance  and that said lovel after a moments thoughtful silencethat then is the meaning of these german words  unquestionably you perceive the appropriate application to a consciousness of inward worth and of eminence in a useful and honourable arteach printer in those days as i have already informed you had his device his impresa as i may call it in the same manner as the doughty chivalry of the age who frequented tilt and tournament my ancestor boasted as much in his as if he had displayed it over a conquered field of battle though it betokened the diffusion of knowledge not the effusion of blood and yet there is a family tradition which affirms him to have chosen it from a more romantic circumstance  and what is that said to have been my good sir inquired his young friend  why it rather encroaches on my respected predecessors fame for prudence and wisdomsed semel insanivimus omneseverybody has played the fool in their turn it is said my ancestor during his apprenticeship with the descendant of old faust whom popular tradition hath sent to the devil under the name of faustus was attracted by a paltry slip of womankind his masters daughter called berthathey broke rings or went through some idiotical ceremony as is usual on such idle occasions as the plighting of a truelove troth and aldobrand set out on his journey through germany as became an honest handwerker for such was the custom of mechanics at that time to make a tour through the empire and work at their trade for a time in each of the most eminent towns before they finally settled themselves for life it was a wise custom for as such travellers were received like brethren in each town by those of their own handicraft they were sure in every case to have the means either of gaining or communicating knowledge when my ancestor returned to nuremburg he is said to have found his old master newly dead and two or three gallant young suitors some of them halfstarved sprigs of nobility forsooth in pursuit of the yungfraw bertha whose father was understood to have bequeathed her a dowry which might weigh against sixteen armorial quarters but bertha not a bad sample of womankind had made a vow she would only marry that man who would work her fathers press the skill at that time was as rare as wonderful besides that the expedient rid her at once of most of her gentle suitors who would have as soon wielded a conjuring wand as a composing stick some of the more ordinary typographers made the attempt but none were sufficiently possessed of the mysterybut i tire you  by no means pray proceed mr oldbucki listen with uncommon interest  ah it is all folly howeveraldobrand arrived in the ordinary dress as we would say of a journeyman printerthe same in which he had traversed germany and conversed with luther melancthon erasmus and other learned men who disdained not his knowledge and the power he possessed of diffusing it though hid under a garb so homely but what appeared respectable in the eyes of wisdom religion learning and philosophy seemed mean as might readily be supposed and disgusting in those of silly and affected womankind and bertha refused to acknowledge her former lover in the torn doublet skin cap clouted shoes and leathern apron of a travelling handicraftsman or mechanic he claimed his privilege however of being admitted to a trial and when the rest of the suitors had either declined the contest or made such work as the devil could not read if his pardon depended on it all eyes were bent on the stranger aldobrand stepped gracefully forward arranged the types without omission of a single letter hyphen or comma imposed them without deranging a single space and pulled off the first proof as clear and free from errors as if it had been a triple revise all applauded the worthy successor of the immortal faustusthe blushing maiden acknowledged her error in trusting to the eye more than the intellectand the elected bridegroom thenceforward chose for his impress or device the appropriate words skill wins favourbut what is the matter with youyou are in a brown study come i told you this was but trumpery conversation for thinking peopleand now i have my hand on the ossianic controversy  i beg your pardon said lovel i am going to appear very silly and changeable in your eyes mr oldbuckbut you seemed to think sir arthur might in civility expect a call from me  psha psha i can make your apology and if you must leave us so soon as you say what signifies how you stand in his honours good gracesand i warn you that the essay on castrametation is something prolix and will occupy the time we can spare after dinner so you may lose the ossianic controversy if we do not dedicate this morning to it we will go out to my evergreen bower my sacred hollytree yonder and have it fronde super viridi                 sing heighho heighho for the green holly          most friendship is feigning most loving mere folly  but egad continued the old gentleman when i look closer at you i begin to think you may be of a different opinion amen with all my hearti quarrel with no mans hobby if he does not run it a tilt against mine and if he doeslet him beware his eyes what say youin the language of the world and worldlings base if you can condescend to so mean a sphere shall we stay or go  in the language of selfishness then which is of course the language of the worldlet us go by all means  amen amen quo the earl marshall answered oldbuck as he exchanged his slippers for a pair of stout walking shoes with cutikins as he called them of black cloth he only interrupted the walk by a slight deviation to the tomb of john o the girnel remembered as the last bailiff of the abbey who had resided at monkbarns beneath an old oaktree upon a hillock sloping pleasantly to the south and catching a distant view of the sea over two or three rich enclosures and the musselcrag lay a mossgrown stone and in memory of the departed worthy it bore an inscription of which as mr oldbuck affirmed though many doubted the defaced characters could be distinctly traced to the following effect                      here lyeth john o ye girnell                 erth has ye nit and heuen ye kirnell                  in hys tyme ilk wyfes hennis clokit              ilka gud mannis herth wi bairnis was stokit               he deled a boll o bear in firlottis fyve         four for ye halie kirke and ane for puir mennis wyvis  you see how modest the author of this sepulchral commendation washe tells us that honest john could make five firlots or quarters as you would say out of the boll instead of fourthat he gave the fifth to the wives of the parish and accounted for the other four to the abbot and chapterthat in his time the wives hens always laid eggsand devil thank them if they got onefifth of the abbey rents and that honest mens hearths were never unblest with offspringan addition to the miracle which they as well as i must have considered as perfectly unaccountable but come onleave we jock o the girnel and let us jog on to the yellow sands where the sea like a repulsed enemy is now retreating from the ground on which he gave us battle last night  thus saying he led the way to the sands upon the links or downs close to them were seen four or five huts inhabited by fishers whose boats drawn high upon the beach lent the odoriferous vapours of pitch melting under a burning sun to contend with those of the offals of fish and other nuisances usually collected round scottish cottages undisturbed by these complicated steams of abomination a middleaged woman with a face which had defied a thousand storms sat mending a net at the door of one of the cottages a handkerchief close bound about her head and a coat which had formerly been that of a man gave her a masculine air which was increased by her strength uncommon stature and harsh voice what are ye for the day your honour she said or rather screamed to oldbuck caller haddocks and whitingsa bannockfluke and a cockpadle  how much for the bannockfluke and cockpadle demanded the antiquary  four white shillings and saxpence answered the naiad  four devils and six of their imps retorted the antiquary do you think i am mad maggie  and div ye think rejoined the virago setting her arms akimbo that my man and my sons are to gae to the sea in weather like yestreen and the daysic

grizzy for the dram mysell and say ye sent me  a nondescript animal which might have passed for a mermaid as it was paddling in a pool among the rocks was summoned ashore by the shrill screams of its dam and having been made decent as her mother called it which was performed by adding a short red cloak to a petticoat which was at first her sole covering and which reached scantily below her knee the child was dismissed with the fish in a basket and a request on the part of monkbarns that they might be prepared for dinner it would have been long said oldbuck with much selfcomplacency ere my womankind could have made such a reasonable bargain with that old skinflint though they sometimes wrangle with her for an hour together under my study window like three seagulls screaming and sputtering in a gale of wind but come wend we on our way to knockwinnock     chapter twelfth                beggarthe only freeman of your commonwealth               free above scotfree that observe no laws                    obey no governor use no religion            but what they draw from their own ancient custom            or constitute themselves yet they are no rebels                                             brome  with our readers permission we will outstep the slow though sturdy pace of the antiquary whose halts as he turned round to his companion at every moment to point out something remarkable in the landscape or to enforce some favourite topic more emphatically than the exercise of walking permitted delayed their progress considerably  notwithstanding the fatigues and dangers of the preceding evening miss wardour was able to rise at her usual hour and to apply herself to her usual occupations after she had first satisfied her anxiety concerning her fathers state of health sir arthur was no farther indisposed than by the effects of great agitation and unusual fatigue but these were sufficient to induce him to keep his bedchamber  to look back on the events of the preceding day was to isabella a very unpleasing retrospect she owed her life and that of her father to the very person by whom of all others she wished least to be obliged because she could hardly even express common gratitude towards him without encouraging hopes which might be injurious to them both why should it be my fate to receive such benefits and conferred at so much personal risk from one whose romantic passion i have so unceasingly laboured to discourage why should chance have given him this advantage over me and why oh why should a halfsubdued feeling in my own bosom in spite of my sober reason almost rejoice that he has attained it  while miss wardour thus taxed herself with wayward caprice she beheld advancing down the avenue not her younger and more dreaded preserver but the old beggar who had made such a capital figure in the melodrama of the preceding evening  she rang the bell for her maidservant bring the old man up stairs  the servant returned in a minute or twohe will come up at no rate madamhe says his clouted shoes never were on a carpet in his life and that please god they never shallmust i take him into the servants hall  no stay i want to speak with himwhere is he for she had lost sight of him as he approached the house  sitting in the sun on the stonebench in the court beside the window of the flagged parlour  illustration eddie ochiltree visits miss wardour  bid him stay thereill come down to the parlour and speak with him at the window  she came down accordingly and found the mendicant halfseated halfreclining upon the bench beside the window edie ochiltree old man and beggar as he was had apparently some internal consciousness of the favourable impressions connected with his tall form commanding features and long white beard and hair it used to be remarked of him that he was seldom seen but in a posture which showed these personal attributes to advantage at present as he lay halfreclined with his wrinkled yet ruddy cheek and keen grey eye turned up towards the sky his staff and bag laid beside him and a cast of homely wisdom and sarcastic irony in the expression of his countenance while he gazed for a moment around the courtyard and then resumed his former look upward he might have been taken by an artist as the model of an old philosopher of the cynic school musing upon the frivolity of mortal pursuits and the precarious tenure of human possessions and looking up to the source from which aught permanently good can alone be derived the young lady as she presented her tall and elegant figure at the open window but divided from the courtyard by a grating with which according to the fashion of ancient times the lower windows of the castle were secured gave an interest of a different kind and might be supposed by a romantic imagination an imprisoned damsel communicating a tale of her durance to a palmer in order that he might call upon the gallantry of every knight whom he should meet in his wanderings to rescue her from her oppressive thraldom  after miss wardour had offered in the terms she thought would be most acceptable those thanks which the beggar declined as far beyond his merit she began to express herself in a manner which she supposed would speak more feelingly to his apprehension she did not know she said what her father intended particularly to do for their preserver but certainly it would be something that would make him easy for life if he chose to reside at the castle she would give orders  the old man smiled and shook his head i wad be baith a grievance and a disgrace to your fine servants my leddy and i have never been a disgrace to onybody yet that i ken of  sir arthur would give strict orders  yere very kindi doubtna i doubtna but there are some things a master can command and some he cannai daresay he wad gar them keep hands aff meand troth i think they wad hardly venture on that ony gateand he wad gar them gie me my soup parritch and bit meat but trow ye that sir arthurs command could forbid the gibe o the tongue or the blink o the ee or gar them gie me my food wi the look o kindness that gars it digest sae weel or that he could make them forbear a the slights and taunts that hurt anes spirit mair nor downright miscaingbesides i am the idlest auld carle that ever lived i downa be bound down to hours o eating and sleeping and to speak the honest truth i wad be a very bad example in ony weel regulated family  well then edie what do you think of a neat cottage and a garden and a daily dole and nothing to do but to dig a little in your garden when you pleased yourself  and how often wad that be trow ye my leddy maybe no ance atween candlemas and yule and if a thing were done to my hand as if i was sir arthur himsell i could never bide the staying still in ae place and just seeing the same joists and couples aboon my head night after nightand then i have a queer humour o my ain that sets a strolling beggar weel eneugh whase word naebody mindsbut ye ken sir arthur has odd sort o waysand i wad be jesting or scorning at themand ye wad be angry and then i wad be just fit to hang mysell  o you are a licensed man said isabella we shall give you all reasonable scope so you had better be ruled and remember your age  but i am no that sair failed yet replied the mendicant od ance i gat a wee soupled yestreen i was as yauld as an eel and then what wad a the country about do for want o auld edie ochiltree that brings news and country cracks frae ae farmsteading to anither and gingerbread to the lasses and helps the lads to mend their fiddles and the gudewives to clout their pans and plaits rushswords and grenadier caps for the weans and busks the lairds flees and has skill o cowills and horseills and kens mair auld sangs and tales than a the barony besides and gars ilka body laugh wherever he comes troth my leddy i canna lay down my vocation it would be a public loss  well edie if your idea of your importance is so strong as not to be shaken by the prospect of independence  na na missits because i am mair independent as i am answered the old man i beg nae mair at ony single house than a meal o meat or maybe but a mouthfou otif its refused at ae place i get it at anithersae i canna be said to depend on onybody in particular but just on the country at large  well then only promise me that you will let me know should you ever wish to settle as you turn old and more incapable of making your usual rounds and in the meantime take this  na na my leddy i downa take muckle siller at anceits against our rule andthough its maybe no civil to be repeating the like o thatthey say that sillers like to be scarce wi sir arthur himsell and that hes run himsell out o thought wi his honkings and minings for lead and copper yonder  isabella had some anxious anticipations to the same effect but was shocked to hear that her fathers embarrassments were such public talk as if scandal ever failed to stoop upon so acceptable a quarry as the failings of the good man the decline of the powerful or the decay of the prosperousmiss wardour sighed deeplywell edie we have enough to pay our debts let folks say what they will and requiting you is one of the foremostlet me press this sum upon you  that i might be robbed and murdered some night between town and town or whats as bad that i might live in constant apprehension oti am nolowering his voice to a whisper and looking keenly around himi am no that clean unprovided for neither and though i should die at the back of a dyke theyll find as muckle quilted in this auld blue gown as will bury me like a christian and gie the lads and lasses a blythe lykewake too sae theres the gaberlunzies burial provided for and i need nae mair were the like o me ever to change a note wha the deil dye think wad be sic fules as to gie me charity after thatit wad flee through the country like wildfire that auld edie suld hae done siccan a like thing and then ise warrant i might grane my heart out or onybody wad gie me either a bane or a bodle  is there nothing then that i can do for you  ou ayill aye come for my awmous as usualand whiles i wad be fain o a pickle sneeshin and ye maun speak to the constable and groundofficer just to owerlook me and maybe yell gie a gude word for me to sandie netherstanes the miller that he may chain up his muckle dogi wadna hae him to hurt the puir beast for it just does its office in barking at a gaberlunzie like me and theres ae thing maybe mairbut yell think its very bald o the like o me to speak ot  what is it edieif it respects you it shall be done if it is in my power  it respects yoursell and it is in your power and i maun come out wit ye are a bonny young leddy and a gude ane and maybe a weeltochered anebut dinna ye sneer awa the lad lovel as ye did a while sinsyne on the walk beneath the brierybank when i saw ye baith and heard ye too though ye saw nae me be canny wi the lad for he loes ye weel and its to him and no to anything i could have done for you that sir arthur and you wan ower yestreen  he uttered these words in a low but distinct tone of voice and without waiting for an answer walked towards a low door which led to the apartments of the servants and so entered the house  miss wardour remained for a moment or two in the situation in which she had heard the old mans last extraordinary speech leaning namely against the bars of the window nor could she determine upon saying even a single word relative to a subject so delicate until the beggar was out of sight it was indeed difficult to determine what to do that her having had an interview and private conversation with this young and unknown stranger should be a secret possessed by a person of the last class in which a young lady would seek a confidant and at the mercy of one who was by profession gossipgeneral to the whole neighbourhood gave her acute agony she had no reason indeed to suppose that the old man would wilfully do anything to hurt her feelings much less to injure her but the mere freedom of speaking to her upon such a subject showed as might have been expected a total absence of delicacy and what he might take it into his head to do or say next that she was pretty sure so professed an admirer of liberty would not hesitate to do or say without scruple this idea so much hurt and vexed her that she halfwished the officious assistance of lovel and ochiltree had been absent upon the preceding evening  while she was in this agitation of spirits she suddenly observed oldbuck and lovel entering the court she drew instantly so far back from the window that she could without being seen observe how the antiquary paused in front of the building and pointing to the various scutcheons of its former owners seemed in the act of bestowing upon lovel much curious and erudite information which from the absent look of his auditor isabella might shrewdly guess was entirely thrown away the necessity that she should take some resolution became instant and pressingshe rang therefore for a servant and ordered him to show the visitors to the drawingroom while she by another staircase gained her own apartment to consider ere she made her appearance what line of conduct were fittest for her to pursue the guests agreeably to her instructions were introduced into the room where company was usually received     chapter thirteenth                       the time was that i hated thee                 and yet it is not that i bear thee love                 thy company which erst was irksome to me                             i will endure                 but do not look for further recompense                                         as you like it  miss isabella wardours complexion was considerably heightened when after the delay necessary to arrange her ideas she presented herself in the drawingroom  i am glad you are come my fair foe said the antiquary greeting her with much kindness for i have had a most refractory or at least negligent auditor in my young friend here while i endeavoured to make him acquainted with the history of knockwinnock castle i think the danger of last night has mazed the poor lad but you miss isabelwhy you look as if flying through the night air had been your natural and most congenial occupation your colour is even better than when you honoured my hospitium yesterday and sir arthurhow fares my good old friend  indifferently well mr oldbuck but i am afraid not quite able to receive your congratulations or to payto paymr lovel his thanks for his unparalleled exertions  i dare say nota good down pillow for his good white head were more meet than a couch so churlish as bessysapron plague on her  i had no thought of intruding said lovel looking upon the ground and speaking with hesitation and suppressed emotion i did notdid not mean to intrude upon sir arthur or miss wardour the presence of one whowho must necessarily be unwelcomeas associated i mean with painful reflections  do not think my father so unjust and ungrateful said miss wardour i dare say she continued participating in lovels embarrassmenti dare sayi am certainthat my father would be happy to show his gratitudein any waythat is which mr lovel could consider it as proper to point out  why the deuce interrupted oldbuck what sort of a qualification is thaton my word it reminds me of our minister who choosing like a formal old fop as he is to drink to my sisters inclinations thought it necessary to add the saving clause provided madam they be virtuous come let us have no more of this nonsensei dare say sir arthur will bid us welcome on some future day and what news from the kingdom of subterranean darkness and airy hopewhat says the swart spirit of the mine has sir arthur had any good intelligence of his adventure lately in glenwithershins  miss wardour shook her headbut indifferent i fear mr oldbuck but there lie some specimens which have lately been sent down  ah my poor dear hundred pounds which sir arthur persuaded me to give for a share in that hopeful scheme would have bought a porters load of mineralogybut let me see them  and so saying he sat down at the table in the recess on which the mineral productions were lying and proceeded to examine them grumbling and pshawing at each which he took up and laid aside  in the meantime lovel forced as it were by this secession of oldbuck into a sort of teteatete with miss wardour took an opportunity of addressing her in a low and interrupted tone of voice i trust miss wardour will impute to circumstances almost irresistible this intrusion of a person who has reason to think himselfso unacceptable a visitor  mr lovel answered miss wardour observing the same tone of caution i trust you will noti am sure you are incapable of abusing the advantages given to you by the services you have rendered us which as they affect my father can never be sufficiently acknowledged or repaid could mr lovel see me without his own peace being affectedcould he see me as a friendas a sisterno man will beand from all i have ever heard of mr lovel ought to be more welcome but  oldbucks anathema against the preposition but was internally echoed by lovel forgive me if i interrupt you miss wardour you need not fear my intruding upon a subject where i have been already severely repressedbut do not add to the severity of repelling my sentiments the rigour of obliging me to disavow them  i am much embarrassed mr lovel replied the young lady by youri would not willingly use a strong wordyour romantic and hopeless pertinacity it is for yourself i plead that you would consider the calls which your country has upon your talentsthat you will not waste in an idle and fanciful indulgence of an illplaced predilection time which well redeemed by active exertion should lay the foundation of future distinction let me entreat that you would form a manly resolution  it is enough miss wardouri see plainly that  mr lovel you are hurtand believe me i sympathize in the pain which i inflict but can i in justice to myself in fairness to you do otherwise without my fathers consent i never will entertain the addresses of any one and how totally impossible it is that he should countenance the partiality with which you honour me you are yourself fully aware and indeed  no miss wardour answered lovel in a tone of passionate entreaty do not go fartheris it not enough to crush every hope in our present relative situationdo not carry your resolutions fartherwhy urge what would be your conduct if sir arthurs objections could be removed  it is indeed vain mr lovel said miss wardour because their removal is impossible and i only wish as your friend and as one who is obliged to you for her own and her fathers life to entreat you to suppress this unfortunate attachmentto leave a country which affords no scope for your talents and to resume the honourable line of the profession which you seem to have abandoned  well miss wardour your wishes shall be obeyedhave patience with me one little month and if in the course of that space i cannot show you such reasons for continuing my residence at fairport as even you shall approve of i will bid adieu to its vicinity and with the same breath to all my hopes of happiness  not so mr lovel many years of deserved happiness founded on a more rational basis than your present wishes are i trust before you but it is full time to finish this conversation i cannot force you to adopt my advicei cannot shut the door of my fathers house against the preserver of his life and mine but the sooner mr lovel can teach his mind to submit to the inevitable disappointment of wishes which have been so rashly formed the more highly he will rise in my esteemand in the meanwhile for his sake as well as mine he must excuse my putting an interdict upon conversation on a subject so painful  a servant at this moment announced that sir arthur desired to speak to mr oldbuck in his dressingroom  let me show you the way said miss wardour who apparently dreaded a continuation of her teteatete with lovel and she conducted the antiquary accordingly to her fathers apartment  sir arthur his legs swathed in flannel was stretched on the couch welcome mr oldbuck he said i trust you have come better off than i have done from the inclemency of yesterday evening  truly sir arthur i was not so much exposed to iti kept terra firmayou fairly committed yourself to the cold nightair in the most literal of all senses but such adventures become a gallant knight better than a humble esquireto rise on the wings of the nightwindto dive into the bowels of the earth what news from our subterranean good hopethe terra incognita of glenwithershins  nothing good as yet said the baronet turning himself hastily as if stung by a pang of the gout but dousterswivel does not despair  does he not quoth oldbuck i do though under his favour why old dr hn told me when i was in edinburgh that we should never find copper enough judging from the specimens i showed him to make a pair of sixpenny kneebucklesand i cannot see that those samples on the table below differ much in quality   probably dr hutton the celebrated geologist  the learned doctor is not infallible i presume  no but he is one of our first chemists and this tramping philosopher of yoursthis dousterswivelis i have a notion one of those learned adventurers described by kirchner artem habent sine arte partem sine parte quorum medium est mentiri vita eorum mendicatum ire that is to say miss wardour  it is unnecessary to translate said miss wardouri comprehend your general meaning but i hope mr dousterswivel will turn out a more trustworthy character  i doubt it not a little said the antiquaryand we are a foul way out if we cannot discover this infernal vein that he has prophesied about these two years  you have no great interest in the matter mr oldbuck said the baronet  too much too much sir arthur and yet for the sake of my fair foe here i would consent to lose it all so you had no more on the venture  there was a painful silence of a few moments for sir arthur was too proud to acknowledge the downfall of his golden dreams though he could no longer disguise to himself that such was likely to be the termination of the adventure i understand he at length said that the young gentleman to whose gallantry and presence of mind we were so much indebted last night has favoured me with a visiti am distressed that i am unable to see him or indeed any one but an old friend like you mr oldbuck  a declination of the antiquarys stiff backbone acknowledged the preference  you made acquaintance with this young gentleman in edinburgh i suppose  oldbuck told the circumstances of their becoming known to each other  why then my daughter is an older acquaintance of mr lovel than you are said the baronet  indeed i was not aware of that answered oldbuck somewhat surprised  i met mr lovel said isabella slightly colouring when i resided this last spring with my aunt mrs wilmot  in yorkshireand what character did he bear then or how was he engaged said oldbuckand why did not you recognise him when i introduced you  isabella answered the least difficult question and passed over the otherhe had a commission in the army and had i believe served with reputation he was much respected as an amiable and promising young man  and pray such being the case replied the antiquary not disposed to take one reply in answer to two distinct questions why did you not speak to the lad at once when you met him at my house i thought you had less of the paltry pride of womankind about you miss wardour  there was a reason for it said sir arthur with dignity you know the opinionsprejudices perhaps you will call themof our house concerning purity of birth this young gentleman is it seems the illegitimate son of a man of fortune my daughter did not choose to renew their acquaintance till she should know whether i approved of her holding any intercourse with him  if it had been with his mother instead of himself answered oldbuck with his usual dry causticity of humour i could see an excellent reason for it ah poor lad that was the cause then that he seemed so absent and confused while i explained to him the reason of the bend of bastardy upon the shield yonder under the corner turret  true said the baronet with complacencyit is the shield of malcolm the usurper as he is called the tower which he built is termed after him malcolms tower but more frequently misticots tower which i conceive to be a corruption for misbegot he is denominated in the latin pedigree of our family milcolumbus nothus and his temporary seizure of our property and most unjust attempt to establish his own illegitimate line in the estate of knockwinnock gave rise to such family feuds and misfortunes as strongly to found us in that horror and antipathy to defiled blood and illegitimacy which has been handed down to me from my respected ancestry  i know the story said oldbuck and i was telling it to lovel this moment with some of the wise maxims and consequences which it has engrafted on your family politics poor fellow he must have been much hurt i took the wavering of his attention for negligence and was something piqued at it and it proves to be only an excess of feeling i hope sir arthur you will not think the less of your life because it has been preserved by such assistance  nor the less of my assistant either said the baronet my doors and table shall be equally open to him as if he had descended of the most unblemished lineage  come i am glad of thathell know where he can get a dinner then if he wants one but what views can he have in this neighbourhood i must catechise him and if i find he wants itor indeed whether he does or nothe shall have my best advice as the antiquary made this liberal promise he took his leave of miss wardour and her father eager to commence operations upon mr lovel he informed him abruptly that miss wardour sent her compliments and remained in attendance on her father and then taking him by the arm he led him out of the castle  knockwinnock still preserved much of the external attributes of a baronial castle it had its drawbridge though now never drawn up and its dry moat the sides of which had been planted with shrubs chiefly of the evergreen tribes above these rose the old building partly from a foundation of red rock scarped down to the seabeach and partly from the steep green verge of the moat the trees of the avenue have been already mentioned and many others rose around of large sizeas if to confute the prejudice that timber cannot be raised near to the ocean our walkers paused and looked back upon the castle as they attained the height of a small knoll over which lay their homeward road for it is to be supposed they did not tempt the risk of the tide by returning along the sands the building flung its broad shadow upon the tufted foliage of the shrubs beneath it while the front windows sparkled in the sun they were viewed by the gazers with very different feelings lovel with the fond eagerness of that passion which derives its food and nourishment from trifles as the chameleon is said to live on the air or upon the invisible insects which it contains endeavoured to conjecture which of the numerous windows belonged to the apartment now graced by miss wardours presence the speculations of the antiquary were of a more melancholy cast and were partly indicated by the ejaculation of cito peritura as he turned away from the prospect lovel roused from his reverie looked at him as if to inquire the meaning of an exclamation so ominous the old man shook his head yes my young friend said he i doubt greatlyand it wrings my heart to say itthis ancient family is going fast to the ground  indeed answered lovelyou surprise me greatly  we harden ourselves in vain continued the antiquary pursuing his own train of thought and feelingwe harden ourselves in vain to treat with the indifference they deserve the changes of this trumpery whirligig world we strive ineffectually to be the selfsufficing invulnerable being the teres atque rotundus of the poetthe stoical exemption which philosophy affects to give us over the pains and vexations of human life is as imaginary as the state of mystical quietism and perfection aimed at by some crazy enthusiasts  and heaven forbid that it should be otherwise said lovel warmlyheaven forbid that any process of philosophy were capable so to sear and indurate our feelings that nothing should agitate them but what arose instantly and immediately out of our own selfish interests i would as soon wish my hand to be as callous as horn that it might escape an occasional cut or scratch as i would be ambitious of the stoicism which should render my heart like a piece of the nether millstone  the antiquary regarded his youthful companion with a look half of pity half of sympathy and shrugged up his shoulders as he repliedwait young manwait till your bark has been battered by the storm of sixty years of mortal vicissitude you will learn by that time to reef your sails that she may obey the helmor in the language of this world you will find distresses enough endured and to endure to keep your feelings and sympathies in full exercise without concerning yourself more in the fate of others than you cannot possibly avoid  well mr oldbuck it may be sobut as yet i resemble you more in your practice than in your theory for i cannot help being deeply interested in the fate of the family we have just left  and well you may replied oldbuck sir arthurs embarrassments have of late become so many and so pressing that i am surprised you have not heard of them and then his absurd and expensive operations carried on by this highgerman landlouper dousterswivel  i think i have seen that person when by some rare chance i happened to be in the coffeeroom at fairporta tall beetlebrowed awkwardbuilt man who entered upon scientific subjects as it appeared to my ignorance at least with more assurance than knowledgewas very arbitrary in laying down and asserting his opinions and mixed the terms of science with a strange jargon of mysticism a simple youth whispered me that he was an illumine and carried on an intercourse with the invisible world  o the samethe same he has enough of practical knowledge to speak scholarly and wisely to those of whose intelligence he stands in awe and to say the truth this faculty joined to his matchless impudence imposed upon me for some time when i first knew him but i have since understood that when he is among fools and womankind he exhibits himself as a perfect charlatantalks of the magisteriumof sympathies and antipathiesof the cabalaof the diviningrodand all the trumpery with which the rosicrucians cheated a darker age and which to our eternal disgrace has in some degree revived in our own my friend heavysterne knew this fellow abroad and unintentionally for he you must know is god bless the mark a sort of believer let me into a good deal of his real character ah were i caliph for a day as honest abon hassan wished to be i would scourge me these jugglers out of the commonwealth with rods of scorpions they debauch the spirit of the ignorant and credulous with mystical trash as effectually as if they had besotted their brains with gin and then pick their pockets with the same facility and now has this strolling blackguard and mountebank put the finishing blow to the ruin of an ancient and honourable family  but how could he impose upon sir arthur to any ruinous extent  why i dont know sir arthur is a good honourable gentleman but as you may see from his loose ideas concerning the pikish language he is by no means very strong in the understanding his estate is strictly entailed and he has been always an embarrassed man this rapparee promised him mountains of wealth and an english company was found to advance large sums of moneyi fear on sir arthurs guarantee some gentlemeni was ass enough to be onetook small shares in the concern and sir arthur himself made great outlay we were trained on by specious appearances and more specious lies and now like john bunyan we awake and behold it is a dream  i am surprised that you mr oldbuck should have encouraged sir arthur by your example  why said oldbuck dropping his large grizzled eyebrow i am something surprised and ashamed at it myself it was not the lucre of gainnobody cares less for money to be a prudent man than i dobut i thought i might risk this small sum it will be expected though i am sure i cannot see why that i should give something to any one who will be kind enough to rid me of that slip of womankind my niece mary mintyre and perhaps it may be thought i should do something to get that jackanapes her brother on in the army in either case to treble my venture would have helped me out and besides i had some idea that the phoenicians had in former times wrought copper in that very spot that cunning scoundrel dousterswivel found out my blunt side and brought strange tales dn him of appearances of old shafts and vestiges of mining operations conducted in a manner quite different from those of modern times and iin short i was a fool and there is an end my loss is not much worth speaking about but sir arthurs engagements are i understand very deep and my heart aches for him and the poor young lady who must share his distress  here the conversation paused until renewed in the next chapter     chapter fourteenth                if i may trust the flattering eye of sleep               my dreams presage some joyful news at hand               my bosoms lord sits lightly on his throne                  and all this day an unaccustomed spirit               lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts                                     romeo and juliet  the account of sir arthurs unhappy adventure had led oldbuck somewhat aside from his purpose of catechising lovel concerning the cause of his residence at fairport he was now however resolved to open the subject miss wardour was formerly known to you she tells me mr lovel  he had had the pleasure lovel answered to see her at mrs wilmots in yorkshire  indeed you never mentioned that to me before and you did not accost her as an old acquaintance  ii did not know said lovel a good deal embarrassed it was the same lady till we met and then it was my duty to wait till she should recognise me  i am aware of your delicacy the knights a punctilious old fool but i promise you his daughter is above all nonsensical ceremony and prejudice and now since you have found a new set of friends here may i ask if you intend to leave fairport as soon as you proposed  what if i should answer your question by another replied lovel and ask you what is your opinion of dreams  of dreams you foolish ladwhy what should i think of them but as the deceptions of imagination when reason drops the reins i know no difference betwixt them and the hallucinations of madnessthe unguided horses run away with the carriage in both cases only in the one the coachman is drunk and in the other he slumbers what says our marcus tulliussi insanorum visis fides non est habenda cur credatur somnientium visis quae multo etiam perturbatiora sunt non intelligo  yes sir but cicero also tells us that as he who passes the whole day in darting the javelin must sometimes hit the mark so amid the cloud of nightly dreams some may occur consonant to future events  aythat is to say you have hit the mark in your own sage opinion lord lord how this world is given to folly well i will allow for once the oneirocritical sciencei will give faith to the exposition of dreams and say a daniel hath arisen to interpret them if you can prove to me that that dream of yours has pointed to a prudent line of conduct  tell me then answered lovel why when i was hesitating whether to abandon an enterprise which i have perhaps rashly undertaken i should last night dream i saw your ancestor pointing to a motto which encouraged me to perseverancewhy should i have thought of those words which i cannot remember to have heard before which are in a language unknown to me and which yet conveyed when translated a lesson which i could so plainly apply to my own circumstances  the antiquary burst into a fit of laughing excuse me my young friendbut it is thus we silly mortals deceive ourselves and look out of doors for motives which originate in our own wilful will i think i can help out the cause of your vision you were so abstracted in your contemplations yesterday after dinner as to pay little attention to the discourse between sir arthur and me until we fell upon the controversy concerning the piks which terminated so abruptlybut i remember producing to sir arthur a book printed by my ancestor and making him observe the motto your mind was bent elsewhere but your ear had mechanically received and retained the sounds and your busy fancy stirred by grizels legend i presume had introduced this scrap of german into your dream as for the waking wisdom which seized on so frivolous a circumstance as an apology for persevering in some course which it could find no better reason to justify it is exactly one of those juggling tricks which the sagest of us play off now and then to gratify our inclination at the expense of our understanding  i own it said lovel blushing deeplyi believe you are right mr oldbuck and i ought to sink in your esteem for attaching a moments consequence to such a frivolitybut i was tossed by contradictory wishes and resolutions and you know how slight a line will tow a boat when afloat on the billows though a cable would hardly move her when pulled up on the beach  right right exclaimed the antiquary fall in my opinionnot a whiti love thee the better manwhy we have story for story against each other and i can think with less shame on having exposed myself about that cursed praetoriumthough i am still convinced agricolas camp must have been somewhere in this neighbourhood and now lovel my good lad be sincere with mewhat make you from wittenbergwhy have you left your own country and professional pursuits for an idle residence in such a place as fairport a truant disposition i fear  even so replied lovel patiently submitting to an interrogatory which he could not well evade yet i am so detached from all the world have so few in whom i am interested or who are interested in me that my very state of destitution gives me independence he whose good or evil fortune affects himself alone has the best right to pursue it according to his own fancy  pardon me young man said oldbuck laying his hand kindly on his shoulder and making a full haltsufflaminaa little patience if you please i will suppose that you have no friends to share or rejoice in your success in lifethat you cannot look back to those to whom you owe gratitude or forward to those to whom you ought to afford protection but it is no less incumbent on you to move steadily in the path of dutyfor your active exertions are due not only to society but in humble gratitude to the being who made you a member of it with powers to serve yourself and others  but i am unconscious of possessing such powers said lovel somewhat impatiently i ask nothing of society but the permission of walking innoxiously through the path of life without jostling others or permitting myself to be jostled i owe no man anythingi have the means of maintaining myself with complete independence and so moderate are my wishes in this respect that even these means however limited rather exceed than fall short of them  nay then said oldbuck removing his hand and turning again to the road if you are so true a philosopher as to think you have money enough theres no more to be saidi cannot pretend to be entitled to advise youyou have attained the acmethe summit of perfection and how came fairport to be the selected abode of so much selfdenying philosophy it is as if a worshipper of the true religion had set up his staff by choice among the multifarious idolaters of the land of egypt there is not a man in fairport who is not a devoted worshipper of the golden calfthe mammon of unrighteousness why even i man am so infected by the bad neighbourhood that i feel inclined occasionally to become an idolater myself  my principal amusements being literary answered lovel and circumstances which i cannot mention having induced me for a time at least to relinquish the military service i have pitched on fairport as a place where i might follow my pursuits without any of those temptations to society which a more elegant circle might have presented to me  aha replied oldbuck knowinglyi begin to understand your application of my ancestors motto you are a candidate for public favour though not in the way i first suspectedyou are ambitious to shine as a literary character and you hope to merit favour by labour and perseverance  lovel who was rather closely pressed by the inquisitiveness of the old gentleman concluded it would be best to let him remain in the error which he had gratuitously adopted  i have been at times foolish enough he replied to nourish some thoughts of the kind  ah poor fellow nothing can be more melancholy unless as young men sometimes do you had fancied yourself in love with some trumpery specimen of womankind which is indeed as shakspeare truly says pressing to death whipping and hanging all at once  he then proceeded with inquiries which he was sometimes kind enough to answer himself for this good old gentleman had from his antiquarian researches acquired a delight in building theories out of premises which were often far from affording sufficient ground for them and being as the reader must have remarked sufficiently opinionative he did not readily brook being corrected either in matter of fact or judgment even by those who were principally interested in the subjects on which he speculated he went on therefore chalking out lovels literary career for him  and with what do you propose to commence your debut as a man of lettersbut i guesspoetrypoetrythe soft seducer of youth yes there is an acknowledging modesty of confusion in your eye and manner and where lies your veinare you inclined to soar to the higher regions of parnassus or to flutter around the base of the hill  i have hitherto attempted only a few lyrical pieces said lovel  just as i supposedpruning your wing and hopping from spray to spray but i trust you intend a bolder flight observe i would by no means recommend your persevering in this unprofitable pursuitbut you say you are quite independent of the public caprice  entirely so replied lovel  and that you are determined not to adopt a more active course of life  for the present such is my resolution replied the young man  why then it only remains for me to give you my best advice and assistance in the object of your pursuit i have myself published two essays in the antiquarian repositoryand therefore am an author of experience there was my remarks on hearnes edition of robert of gloucester signed scrutator and the other signed indagator upon a passage in tacitus i might add what attracted considerable notice at the time and that is my paper in the gentlemans magazine upon the inscription of oelia lelia which i subscribed oedipus so you see i am not an apprentice in the mysteries of authorcraft and must necessarily understand the taste and temper of the times and now once more what do you intend to commence with  i have no instant thoughts of publishing  ah that will never do you must have the fear of the public before your eyes in all your undertakings let us see now a collection of fugitive pieces but noyour fugitive poetry is apt to become stationary with the bookseller it should be something at once solid and attractivenone of your romances or anomalous noveltiesi would have you take high ground at once let me see what think you of a real epicthe grand oldfashioned historical poem which moved through twelve or twentyfour books well have it soill supply you with a subjectthe battle between the caledonians and romansthe caledoniad or invasion repelledlet that be the titleit will suit the present taste and you may throw in a touch of the times  but the invasion of agricola was not repelled  no but you are a poetfree of the corporation and as little bound down to truth or probability as virgil himselfyou may defeat the romans in spite of tacitus  and pitch agricolas camp at the kaim ofwhat do you call it answered lovel in defiance of edie ochiltree  no more of that an thou lovest meand yet i dare say ye may unwittingly speak most correct truth in both instances in despite of the toga of the historian and the blue gown of the mendicant  gallantly counselledwell i will do my bestyour kindness will assist me with local information  will i not manwhy i will write the critical and historical notes on each canto and draw out the plan of the story myself i pretend to some poetical genius mr lovel only i was never able to write verses  it is a pity sir that you should have failed in a qualification somewhat essential to the art  essentialnot a whitit is the mere mechanical department a man may be a poet without measuring spondees and dactyls like the ancients or clashing the ends of lines into rhyme like the moderns as one may be an architect though unable to labour like a stonemasondost think palladio or vitruvius ever carried a hod  in that case there should be two authors to each poemone to think and plan another to execute  why it would not be amiss at any rate well make the experimentnot that i would wish to give my name to the publicassistance from a learned friend might be acknowledged in the preface after what flourish your nature willi am a total stranger to authorial vanity  lovel was much entertained by a declaration not very consistent with the eagerness wherewith his friend seemed to catch at an opportunity of coming before the public though in a manner which rather resembled stepping up behind a carriage than getting into one the antiquary was indeed uncommonly delighted for like many other men who spend their lives in obscure literary research he had a secret ambition to appear in print which was checked by cold fits of diffidence fear of criticism and habits of indolence and procrastination but thought he i may like a second teucer discharge my shafts from behind the shield of my ally and admit that he should not prove to be a firstrate poet i am in no shape answerable for his deficiencies and the good notes may very probably help off an indifferent text but he ishe must be a good poet he has the real parnassian abstractionseldom answers a question till it is twice repeateddrinks his tea scalding and eats without knowing what he is putting into his mouth this is the real aestus the awen of the welsh bards the divinus afflatus that transports the poet beyond the limits of sublunary things his visions too are very symptomatical of poetic furyi must recollect to send caxon to see he puts out his candle tonightpoets and visionaries are apt to be negligent in that respect then turning to his companion he expressed himself aloud in continuation  yes my dear lovel you shall have full notes and indeed think we may introduce the whole of the essay on castrametation into the appendixit will give great value to the work then we will revive the good old forms so disgracefully neglected in modern times you shall invoke the museand certainly she ought to be propitious to an author who in an apostatizing age adheres with the faith of abdiel to the ancient form of adorationthen we must have a visionin which the genius of caledonia shall appear to galgacus and show him a procession of the real scottish monarchsand in the notes i will have a hit at boethiusno i must not touch that topic now that sir arthur is likely to have vexation enough besidesbut ill annihilate ossian macpherson and maccribb  but we must consider the expense of publication said lovel willing to try whether this hint would fall like cold water on the blazing zeal of his selfelected coadjutor  expense said mr oldbuck pausing and mechanically fumbling in his pocketthat is truei would wish to do somethingbut you would not like to publish by subscription  by no means answered lovel  no no gladly acquiesced the antiquaryit is not respectable ill tell you what i believe i know a bookseller who has a value for my opinion and will risk print and paper and i will get as many copies sold for you as i can  o i am no mercenary author answered lovel smiling i only wish to be out of risk of loss  hush hush well take care of thatthrow it all on the publishers i do long to see your labours commenced you will choose blank verse doubtlessit is more grand and magnificent for an historical subject and what concerneth you my friend it is i have an idea more easily written  this conversation brought them to monkbarns where the antiquary had to undergo a chiding from his sister who though no philosopher was waiting to deliver a lecture to him in the portico guide us monkbarns are things no dear eneugh already but ye maun be raising the very fish on us by giving that randy luckie mucklebackit just what she likes to ask  why grizel said the sage somewhat abashed at this unexpected attack i thought i made a very fair bargain  a fair bargain when ye gied the limmer a full half o what she seekitan ye will be a wifecarle and buy fish at your ain hands ye suld never bid muckle mair than a quarter and the impudent quean had the assurance to come up and seek a drambut i trow jenny and i sorted her  truly said oldbuck with a sly look to his companion i think our estate was gracious that kept us out of hearing of that controversywell well grizel i was wrong for once in my life ultra crepidami fairly admit but hang expensescare killed a catwell eat the fish cost what it willand then lovel you must know i pressed you to stay here today the rather because our cheer will be better than usual yesterday having been a gaude dayi love the reversion of a feast better than the feast itself i delight in the analecta the collectanea as i may call them of the preceding days

reader to the backparlour of the postmasters house at fairport where his wife he himself being absent was employed in assorting for delivery the letters which had come by the edinburgh post this is very often in country towns the period of the day when gossips find it particularly agreeable to call on the man or woman of letters in order from the outside of the epistles and if they are not belied occasionally from the inside also to amuse themselves with gleaning information or forming conjectures about the correspondence and affairs of their neighbours two females of this description

the office  aweel aweel mrs mailsetter i see what ye wad be atbut an ye like to risk the bairn ill risk the beast  orders were accordingly given the unwilling pony was brought out of his bed of straw and again equipped for servicedavie a leathern postbag strapped across his shoulders was perched upon the saddle with a tear in his eye and a switch in his hand jock goodnaturedly led the animal out of town and by the crack of his whip and the whoop and halloo of his too wellknown voice compelled it to take the road towards monkbarns  meanwhile the gossips like the sibyls after consulting their leaves arranged and combined the information of the evening which flew next morning through a hundred channels and in a hundred varieties through the world of fairport many strange and inconsistent were the rumours to which their communications and conjectures gave rise some said tennant and co were broken and that all their bills had come back protestedothers that they had got a great contract from government and letters from the principal merchants at glasgow desiring to have shares upon a premium one report stated that lieutenant taffril had acknowledged a private marriage with jenny caxonanother that he had sent her a letter upbraiding her with the lowness of her birth and education and bidding her an eternal adieu it was generally rumoured that sir arthur wardours affairs had fallen into irretrievable confusion and this report was only doubted by the wise because it was traced to mrs mailsetters shopa source more famous for the circulation of news than for their accuracy but all agreed that a packet from the secretary of states office had arrived directed for mr lovel and that it had been forwarded by an orderly dragoon despatched from the headquarters at edinburgh who had galloped through fairport without stopping except just to inquire the way to monkbarns the reason of such an extraordinary mission to a very peaceful and retired individual was variously explained some said lovel was an emigrant noble summoned to head an insurrection that had broken out in la vendeeothers that he was a spyothers that he was a general officer who was visiting the coast privatelyothers that he was a prince of the blood who was travelling incognito  meanwhile the progress of the packet which occasioned so much speculation towards its destined owner at monkbarns had been perilous and interrupted the bearer davie mailsetter as little resembling a bold dragoon as could well be imagined was carried onwards towards monkbarns by the pony so long as the animal had in his recollection the crack of his usual instrument of chastisement and the shout of the butchers boy but feeling how davie whose short legs were unequal to maintain his balance swung to and fro upon his back the pony began to disdain furthur compliance with the intimations he had received first then he slackened his pace to a walk this was no point of quarrel between him and his rider who had been considerably discomposed by the rapidity of his former motion and who now took the opportunity of his abated pace to gnaw a piece of gingerbread which had been thrust into his hand by his mother in order to reconcile this youthful emissary of the postoffice to the discharge of his duty by and by the crafty pony availed himself of this surcease of discipline to twitch the rein out of davies hands and applied himself to browse on the grass by the side of the lane sorely astounded by these symptoms of selfwilled rebellion and afraid alike to sit or to fall poor davie lifted up his voice and wept aloud the pony hearing this pudder over his head began apparently to think it would be best both for himself and davie to return from whence they came and accordingly commenced a retrograde movement towards fairport but as all retreats are apt to end in utter rout so the steed alarmed by the boys cries and by the flapping of the reins which dangled about his forefeetfinding also his nose turned homeward began to set off at a rate which if davie kept the saddle a matter extremely dubious would soon have presented him at heukbanes stabledoorwhen at a turn of the road an intervening auxiliary in the shape of old edie ochiltree caught hold of the rein and stopped his farther proceeding whas aught ye callant whaten a gates that to ride  i canna help it blubbered the express they ca me little davie  and where are ye gaun  im gaun to monkbarns wi a letter  stirra this is no the road to monkbarns  but davie could oinly answer the expostulation with sighs and tears  old edie was easily moved to compassion where childhood was in the casei wasna gaun that gate he thought but its the best o my way o life that i canna be weel out o my road theyll gie me quarters at monkbarns readily eneugh and ill een hirple awa there wi the wean for it will knock its hams out puir thing if theres no somebody to guide the ponysae ye hae a letter hinney will ye let me seet  im no gaun to let naebody see the letter sobbed the boy till i giet to mr lovel for i am a faithfu servant o the officeif it werena for the powny  very right my little man said ochiltree turning the reluctant ponys head towards monkbarns but well guide him atween us if hes no a the sweerer  upon the very height of kinprunes to which monkbarns had invited lovel after their dinner the antiquary again reconciled to the once degraded spot was expatiating upon the topics the scenery afforded for a description of agricolas camp at the dawn of morning when his eye was caught by the appearance of the mendicant and his protegee what the devilhere comes old edie bag and baggage i think  the beggar explained his errand and davie who insisted upon a literal execution of his commission by going on to monkbarns was with difficulty prevailed upon to surrender the packet to its proper owner although he met him a mile nearer than the place he had been directed to but my minnie said i maun be sure to get twenty shillings and five shillings for the postage and ten shillings and sixpence for the expresstheres the paper  let me seelet me see said oldbuck putting on his spectacles and examining the crumpled copy of regulations to which davie appealed express per man and horse one day not to exceed ten shillings and sixpence one day why its not an hourman and horse why tis a monkey on a starved cat  father wad hae come himsell said davie on the muckle red mear an ye wad hae bidden till the morns night  fourandtwenty hours after the regular date of delivery you little cockatrice egg do you understand the art of imposition so early  hout monkbarns dinna set your wit against a bairn said the beggar mind the butcher risked his beast and the wife her wean and i am sure ten and sixpence isna ower muckle ye didna gang sae near wi johnnie howie when  lovel who sitting on the supposed praetorium had glanced over the contents of the packet now put an end to the altercation by paying davies demand and then turning to mr oldbuck with a look of much agitation he excused himself from returning with him to monkbarns that eveningi must instantly go to fairport and perhaps leave it on a moments noticeyour kindness mr oldbuck i can never forget  no bad news i hope said the antiquary  of a very chequered complexion answered his friend farewellin good or bad fortune i will not forget your regard  nay naystop a moment ifif making an effortif there be any pecuniary inconveniencei have fiftyor a hundred guineas at your servicetilltill whitsundayor indeed as long as you please  i am much obliged mr oldbuck but i am amply provided said his mysterious young friend excuse mei really cannot sustain further conversation at present i will write or see you before i leave fairportthat is if i find myself obliged to go  so saying he shook the antiquarys hand warmly turned from him and walked rapidly towards the town staying no longer question  very extraordinary indeed said oldbuckbut theres something about this lad i can never fathom and yet i cannot for my heart think ill of him neither i must go home and take off the fire in the green room for none of my womankind will venture into it after twilight  and how am i to win hame blubbered the disconsolate express  its a fine night said the bluegown looking up to the skies i had as gude gang back to the town and take care o the wean  do so do so edie and rummaging for some time in his huge waistcoat pocket till he found the object of his search the antiquary added theres sixpence to ye to buy sneeshin     chapter sixteenth       i am bewitched with the rogues company if the rascal has not      given me medicines to make me love him ill be hanged it could      not be else i have drunk medicines                             second part of henry iv  regular for a fortnight were the inquiries of the antiquary at the veteran caxon whether he had heard what mr lovel was about and as regular were caxons answers that the town could learn naething about him whatever except that he had received anither muckle letter or twa frae the south and that he was never seen on the plainstanes at a  how does he live caxon  ou mrs hadoway just dresses him a beefsteak or a muttonchop or makes him some friars chicken or just what she likes hersell and he eats it in the little red parlour off his bedroom she canna get him to say that he likes ae thing better than anither and she makes him tea in a morning and he settles honourably wi her every week  but does he never stir abroad  he has clean gien up walking and he sits a day in his room reading or writing a hantle letters he has written but he wadna put them into our posthouse though mrs hadoway offered to carry them hersell but sent them a under ae cover to the sheriff and its mrs mailsetters belief that the sheriff sent his groom to put them into the postoffice at tannonburgh its my puir thought that he jaloused their looking into his letters at fairport and weel had he need for my puir daughter jenny  tut dont plague me with your womankind caxon about this poor young laddoes he write nothing but letters  ou ayhale sheets o other things mrs hadoway says she wishes muckle he could be gotten to take a walk she thinks hes but looking very puirly and his appetites clean gane but hell no hear o ganging ower the doorstanehim that used to walk sae muckle too  thats wrongi have a guess what hes busy about but he must not work too hard neither ill go and see him this very dayhes deep doubtless in the caledoniad  having formed this manful resolution mr oldbuck equipped himself for the expedition with his thick walkingshoes and goldheaded cane muttering the while the words of falstaff which we have chosen for the motto of this chapter for the antiquary was himself rather surprised at the degree of attachment which he could not but acknowledge be entertained for this stranger the riddle was notwithstanding easily solved lovel had many attractive qualities but he won our antiquarys heart by being on most occasions an excellent listener  a walk to fairport had become somewhat of an adventure with mr oldbuck and one which he did not often care to undertake he hated greetings in the marketplace and there were generally loiterers in the streets to persecute him either about the news of the day or about some petty pieces of business so on this occasion he had no sooner entered the streets of fairport than it was goodmorrow mr oldbucka sight o yous gude for sair een what dye think of the news in the sun the daythey say the great attempt will be made in a fortnight  i wish to the lord it were made and over that i might hear no more about it  monkbarns your honour said the nursery and seedsman i hope the plants gied satisfactionand if ye wanted ony flowerroots fresh frae holland or this in a lower key an anker or twa o cologne gin ane o our brigs cam in yestreen  thank ye thank yeno occasion at present mr crabtree said the antiquary pushing resolutely onward  mr oldbuck said the townclerk a more important person who came in front and ventured to stop the old gentleman the provost understanding you were in town begs on no account that youll quit it without seeing him he wants to speak to ye about bringing the water frae the fairwellspring through a part o your lands  what the deucehave they nobodys land but mine to cut and carve oni wont consent tell them  and the provost said the clerk going on without noticing the rebuff and the council wad be agreeable that you should hae the auld stones at donagilds chapel that ye was wussing to hae  ehwhatoho thats another storywell well ill call upon the provost and well talk about it  but ye maun speak your mind ont forthwith monkbarns if ye want the stones for deacon harlewalls thinks the carved throughstanes might be put with advantage on the front of the new councilhousethat is the twa crosslegged figures that the callants used to ca robin and bobbin ane on ilka doorcheek and the other stane that they cad ailie dailie abune the door it will be very tastefu the deacon says and just in the style of modern gothic  lord deliver me from this gothic generation exclaimed the antiquarya monument of a knighttemplar on each side of a grecian porch and a madonna on the top of ito criminiwell tell the provost i wish to have the stones and well not differ about the watercourse its lucky i happened to come this way today  they parted mutually satisfied but the wily clerk had most reason to exult in the dexterity he had displayed since the whole proposal of an exchange between the monuments which the council had determined to remove as a nuisance because they encroached three feet upon the public road and the privilege of conveying the water to the burgh through the estate of monkbarns was an idea which had originated with himself upon the pressure of the moment  through these various entanglements monkbarns to use the phrase by which he was distinguished in the country made his way at length to mrs hadoways this good woman was the widow of a late clergyman at fairport who had been reduced by her husbands untimely death to that state of straitened and embarrassed circumstances in which the widows of the scotch clergy are too often found the tenement which she occupied and the furniture of which she was possessed gave her the means of letting a part of her house and as lovel had been a quiet regular and profitable lodger and had qualified the necessary intercourse which they had together with a great deal of gentleness and courtesy mrs hadoway not perhaps much used to such kindly treatment had become greatly attached to her lodger and was profuse in every sort of personal attention which circumstances permitted her to render him to cook a dish somewhat better than ordinary for the poor young gentlemans dinner to exert her interest with those who remembered her husband or loved her for her own sake and his in order to procure scarce vegetables or something which her simplicity supposed might tempt her lodgers appetite was a labour in which she delighted although she anxiously concealed it from the person who was its object she did not adopt this secrecy of benevolence to avoid the laugh of those who might suppose that an oval face and dark eyes with a clear brown complexion though belonging to a woman of fiveandforty and enclosed within a widows closedrawn pinners might possibly still aim at making conquests for to say truth such a ridiculous suspicion having never entered into her own head she could not anticipate its having birth in that of any one else but she concealed her attentions solely out of delicacy to her guest whose power of repaying them she doubted as much as she believed in his inclination to do so and in his being likely to feel extreme pain at leaving any of her civilities unrequited she now opened the door to mr oldbuck and her surprise at seeing him brought tears into her eyes which she could hardly restrain  i am glad to see you siri am very glad to see you my poor gentleman is i am afraid very unwell and oh mr oldbuck hell see neither doctor nor minister nor writer and think what it would be if as my poor mr hadoway used to say a man was to die without advice of the three learned faculties  greatly better than with them grumbled the cynical antiquary i tell you mrs hadoway the clergy live by our sins the medical faculty by our diseases and the law gentry by our misfortunes  o fie monkbarnsto hear the like o that frae youbut yell walk up and see the poor young ladhegh sirs sae young and weelfavouredand day by day he has eat less and less and now he hardly touches onything only just pits a bit on the plate to make fashionand his poor cheek has turned every day thinner and paler sae that he now really looks as auld as me that might be his motherno that i might be just that neither but something very near it  why does he not take some exercise said oldbuck  i think we have persuaded him to do that for he has bought a horse from gibbie golightly the galloping groom a gude judge o horseflesh gibbie tauld our lass that he wasfor he offered him a beast he thought wad answer him weel eneugh as he was a bookish man but mr lovel wadna look at it and bought ane might serve the master o morphiethey keep it at the graemes arms ower the streetand he rode out yesterday morning and this morning before breakfastbut winna ye walk up to his room  presently presently but has he no visitors  o dear mr oldbuck not ane if he wadna receive them when he was weel and sprightly what chance is there of onybody in fairport looking in upon him now  ay ay very truei should have been surprised had it been otherwisecome show me up stairs mrs hadoway lest i make a blunder and go where i should not  the good landlady showed mr oldbuck up her narrow staircase warning him of every turn and lamenting all the while that he was laid under the necessity of mounting up so high at length she gently tapped at the door of her guests parlour come in said lovel and mrs hadoway ushered in the laird of monkbarns  the little apartment was neat and clean and decently furnishedornamented too by such relics of her youthful arts of sempstressship as mrs hadoway had retained but it was close overheated and as it appeared to oldbuck an unwholesome situation for a young person in delicate healthan observation which ripened his resolution touching a project that had already occurred to him in lovels behalf with a writingtable before him on which lay a quantity of books and papers lovel was seated on a couch in his nightgown and slippers oldbuck was shocked at the change which had taken place in his personal appearance his cheek and brow had assumed a ghastly white except where a round bright spot of hectic red formed a strong and painful contrast totally different from the general cast of hale and hardy complexion which had formerly overspread and somewhat embrowned his countenance oldbuck observed that the dress he wore belonged to a deep mourning suit and a coat of the same colour hung on a chair near to him as the antiquary entered lovel arose and came forward to welcome him  this is very kind he said shaking him by the hand and thanking him warmly for his visitthis is very kind and has anticipated a visit with which i intended to trouble you you must know i have become a horseman lately  i understand as much from mrs hadowayi only hope my good young friend you have been fortunate in a quiet horse i myself inadvertently bought one from the said gibbie golightly which brute ran two miles on end with me after a pack of hounds with which i had no more to do than the last years snow and after affording infinite amusement i suppose to the whole hunting field he was so good as to deposit me in a dry ditchi hope yours is a more peaceful beast  i hope at least we shall make our excursions on a better plan of mutual understanding  that is to say you think yourself a good horseman  i would not willingly answered lovel confess myself a very bad one  noall you young fellows think that would be equal to calling yourselves tailors at oncebut have you had experience for crede experto a horse in a passion is no joker  why i should be sorry to boast myself as a great horseman but when i acted as aidedecamp to sirin the cavalry action at last year i saw many better cavaliers than myself dismounted  ah you have looked in the face of the grisly god of arms thenyou are acquainted with the frowns of mars armipotent that experience fills up the measure of your qualifications for the epopea the britons however you will remember fought in chariotscovinarii is the phrase of tacitusyou recollect the fine description of their dashing among the roman infantry although the historian tells us how ill the rugged face of the ground was calculated for equestrian combat and truly upon the whole what sort of chariots could be driven in scotland anywhere but on turnpike roads has been to me always matter of amazement and well nowhas the muse visited youhave you got anything to show me  my time said lovel with a glance at his black dress has been less pleasantly employed  the death of a friend said the antiquary  yes mr oldbuckof almost the only friend i could ever boast of possessing  indeed well young man replied his visitor in a tone of seriousness very different from his affected gravity be comforted to have lost a friend by death while your mutual regard was warm and unchilled while the tear can drop unembittered by any painful recollection of coldness or distrust or treachery is perhaps an escape from a more heavy dispensation look round youhow few do you see grow old in the affections of those with whom their early friendships were formed our sources of common pleasure gradually dry up as we journey on through the vale of bacha and we hew out to ourselves other reservoirs from which the first companions of our pilgrimage are excludedjealousies rivalries envy intervene to separate others from our side until none remain but those who are connected with us rather by habit than predilection or who allied more in blood than in disposition only keep the old man company in his life that they may not be forgotten at his death                      haec data poena diu viventibus  ah mr lovel if it be your lot to reach the chill cloudy and comfortless evening of life you will remember the sorrows of your youth as the light shadowy clouds that intercepted for a moment the beams of the sun when it was rising but i cram these words into your ears against the stomach of your sense  i am sensible of your kindness answered the youth but the wound that is of recent infliction must always smart severely and i should be little comforted under my present calamityforgive me for saying soby the conviction that life had nothing in reserve for me but a train of successive sorrows and permit me to add you mr oldbuck have least reason of many men to take so gloomy a view of life you have a competent and easy fortuneare generally respectedmay in your own phrase vacare musis indulge yourself in the researches to which your taste addicts you you may form your own society without doorsand within you have the affectionate and sedulous attention of the nearest relatives  why yesthe womankind for womankind are thanks to my training very civil and tractabledo not disturb me in my morning studiescreep across the floor with the stealthy pace of a cat when it suits me to take a nap in my easychair after dinner or tea all this is very well but i want something to exchange ideas withsomething to talk to  then why do you not invite your nephew captain mintyre who is mentioned by every one as a fine spirited young fellow to become a member of your family  who exclaimed monkbarns my nephew hectorthe hotspur of the north why heaven love you i would as soon invite a firebrand into my stackyard hes an almanzor a chamonthas a highland pedigree as long as his claymore and a claymore as long as the high street of fairport which he unsheathed upon the surgeon the last time he was at fairport i expect him here one of these days but i will keep him at staffs end i promise you he an inmate of my house to make my very chairs and tables tremble at his brawls no noill none of hector mintyre but hark ye lovelyou are a quiet gentletempered lad had not you better set up your staff at monkbarns for a month or two since i conclude you do not immediately intend to leave this countryi will have a door opened out to the gardenit will cost but a triflethere is the space for an old one which was condemned long agoby which said door you may pass and repass into the green chamber at pleasure so you will not interfere with the old man nor he with you as for your fare mrs hadoway tells me you are as she terms it very moderate of your mouth so you will not quarrel with my humble table your washing  hold my dear mr oldbuck interposed lovel unable to repress a smile and before your hospitality settles all my accommodations let me thank you most sincerely for so kind an offerit is not at present in my power to accept of it but very likely before i bid adieu to scotland i shall find an opportunity to pay you a visit of some length  mr oldbucks countenance fell why i thought i had hit on the very arrangement that would suit us bothand who knows what might happen in the long run and whether we might ever part why i am master of my acres manthere is the advantage of being descended from a man of more sense than pridethey cannot oblige me to transmit my goods chattels and heritages any way but as i please no string of substitute heirs of entail as empty and unsubstantial as the morsels of paper strung to the train of a boys kite to cumber my flights of inclination and my humours of predilection welli see you wont be tempted at presentbut caledonia goes on i hope  o certainly said lovel i cannot think of relinquishing a plan so hopeful  it is indeed said the antiquary looking gravely upwardfor though shrewd and acute enough in estimating the variety of plans formed by others he had a very natural though rather disproportioned good opinion of the importance of those which originated with himselfit is indeed one of those undertakings which if achieved with spirit equal to that which dictates its conception may redeem from the charge of frivolity the literature of the present generation  here he was interrupted by a knock at the room door which introduced a letter for mr lovel the servant waited mrs hadoway said for an answer you are concerned in this matter mr oldbuck said lovel after glancing over the billet and handing it to the antiquary as he spoke  it was a letter from sir arthur wardour couched in extremely civil language regetting that a fit of the gout had prevented his hitherto showing mr lovel the attentions to which his conduct during a late perilous occasion had so well entitled himapologizing for not paying his respects in person but hoping mr lovel would dispense with that ceremony and be a member of a small party which proposed to visit the ruins of saint ruths priory on the following day and afterwards to dine and spend the evening at knockwinnock castle sir arthur concluded with saying that he had sent to request the monkbarns family to join the party of pleasure which he thus proposed the place of rendezvous was fixed at a turnpikegate which was about an equal distance from all the points from which the company were to assemble  what shall we do said lovel looking at the antiquary but pretty certain of the part he would take  go manwell go by all means let me seeit will cost a postchaise though which will hold you and me and mary mintyre very welland the other womankind may go to the manseand you can come out in the chaise to monkbarns as i will take it for the day  why i rather think i had better ride  true true i forgot your bucephalus you are a foolish lad by the by for purchasing the brute outright you should stick to eighteenpence a side if you will trust any creatures legs in preference to your own  why as the horses have the advantage of moving considerably faster and are besides two pair to one i own i incline  enough saidenough saiddo as you please well then ill bring either grizel or the minister for i love to have my full pennyworth out of posthorsesand we meet at tirlingen turnpike on friday at twelve oclock precisely and with this ageement the friends separated     chapter seventeenth            of seats they tell where priests mid tapers dim           breathed the warm prayer or tuned the midnight hymn                to scenes like these the fainting soul retired                revenge and anger in these cells expired              by pity soothed remorse lost half her fears              and softened pride dropped penitential tears                            crabbes borough  the morning of friday was as serene and beautiful as if no pleasure party had been intended and that is a rare event whether in novelwriting or real life lovel who felt the genial influence of the weather and rejoiced at the prospect of once more meeting with miss wardour trotted forward to the place of rendezvous with better spirits than he had for some time enjoyed his prospects seemed in many respects to open and brighten before himand hope although breaking like the morning sun through clouds and showers appeared now about to illuminate the path before him he was as might have been expected from this state of spirits first at the place of meetingand as might also have been anticipated his looks were so intently directed towards the road from knockwinnock castles that he was only apprized of the arrival of the monkbarns division by the geehupping of the postilion as the postchaise lumbered up behind him in this vehicle were pent up first the stately figure of mr oldbuck himself secondly the scarce less portly person of the reverend mr blattergowl minister of trotcosey the parish in which monkbarns and knockwinnock were both situated the reverend gentleman was equipped in a buzz wig upon the top of which was an equilateral cocked hat this was the paragon of the three yet remaining wigs of the parish which differed as monkbarns used to remark like the three degrees of comparisonsir arthurs ramilies being the positive his own bobwig the comparative and the overwhelming grizzle of the worthy clergyman figuring as the superlative the superintendent of these antique garnitures deeming or affecting to deem that he could not well be absent on an occasion which assembled all three together had seated himself on the board behind the carriage just to be in the way in case they wanted a touch before the gentlemen sat down to dinner between the two massive figures of monkbarns and the clergyman was stuck by way of bodkin the slim form of mary mintyre her aunt having preferred a visit to the manse and a social chat with miss beckie blattergowl to investigating the ruins of the priory of saint ruth  as greetings passed between the members of the monkbarns party and mr lovel the baronets carriage an open barouche swept onward to the place of appointment making with its smoking bays smart drivers arms blazoned panels and a brace of outriders a strong contrast with the battered vehicle and brokenwinded hacks which had brought thither the antiquary and his followers the principal seat of the carriage was occupied by sir arthur and his daughter at the first glance which passed betwixt miss wardour and lovel her colour rose considerablybut she had apparently made up her mind to receive him as a friend and only as such and there was equal composure and courtesy in the mode of her reply to his fluttered salutation sir arthur halted the barouche to shake his preserver kindly by the hand and intimate the pleasure he had on this opportunity of returning him his personal thanks then mentioned to him in a tone of slight introduction mr dousterswivel mr lovel  lovel took the necessary notice of the german adept who occupied the front seat of the carriage which is usually conferred upon dependants or inferiors the ready grin and supple inclination with which his salutation though slight was answered by the foreigner increased the internal dislike which lovel had already conceived towards him and it was plain from the lower of the antiquarys shaggy eyebrow that he too looked with displeasure on this addition to the company little more than distant greeting passed among the members of the party until having rolled on for about three miles beyond the place at which they met the carriages at length stopped at the sign of the four horseshoes a small hedge inn where caxon humbly opened the door and let down the step of the hackchaise while the inmates of the barouche were by their more courtly attendants assisted to leave their equipage  here renewed greetings passed the young ladies shook hands and oldbuck completely in his element placed himself as guide and cicerone at the head of the party who were now to advance on foot towards the object of their curiosity he took care to detain lovel close beside him as the best listener of the party and occasionally glanced a word of explanation and instruction to miss wardour and mary mintyre who followed next in order the baronet and the clergyman he rather avoided as he was aware both of them conceived they understood such matters as well or better than he did and dousterswivel besides that he looked on him as a charlatan was so nearly connected with his apprehended loss in the stock of the mining company that he could not abide the sight of him these two latter satellites therefore attended upon the orb of sir arthur to whom moreover as the most important person of the society they were naturally induced to attach themselves  it frequently happens that the most beautiful points of scottish scenery lie hidden in some sequestered dell and that you may travel through the country in every direction without being aware of your vicinity to what is well worth seeing unless intention or accident carry you to the very spot this is particularly the case in the country around fairport which is generally speaking open unenclosed and bare but here and there the progress of rills or small rivers has formed dells glens or as they are provincially termed dens on whose high and rocky banks trees and shrubs of all kinds find a shelter and grow with a luxuriant profusion which is the more gratifying as it forms an unexpected contrast with the general face of the country this was eminently the case with the approach to the ruins of saint ruth which was for some time merely a sheeptrack along the side of a steep and bare hill by degrees however as this path descended and winded round the hillside trees began to appear at first singly stunted and blighted with locks of wool upon their trunks and their roots hollowed out into recesses in which the sheep love to repose themselvesa sight much more gratifying to the eye of an admirer of the picturesque than to that of a planter or forester by and by the trees formed groups fringed on the edges and filled up in the middle by thorns and hazel bushes and at length these groups closed so much together that although a broad glade opened here and there under their boughs or a small patch of bog or heath occurred which had refused nourishment to the seed which they sprinkled round and consequently remained open and waste the scene might on the whole be termed decidedly woodland the sides of the valley began to approach each other more closely the rush of a brook was heard below and between the intervals afforded by openings in the natural wood its waters were seen hurling clear and rapid under their silvan canopy  oldbuck now took upon himself the full authority of cicerone and anxiously directed the company not to go a footbreadth off the track which he pointed out to them if they wished to enjoy in full perfection what they came to see you are happy in me for a guide miss wardour exclaimed the veteran waving his hand and head in cadence as he repeated with emphasis                 i know each lane and every alley green                dingle or bushy dell of this wild wood                and every bosky bower from side to side    miltons comus  ah deuce take itthat spray of a bramble has demolished all caxons labours and nearly canted my wig into the streamso much for recitations hors de propos  never mind my dear sir said miss wardour you have your faithful attendant ready to repair such a disaster when it happens and when you appear with it as restored to its original splendour i will carry on the quotation                  so sinks the daystar in the ocean bed                 and yet anon repairs his drooping head                and tricks his beams and with newspangled ore                        flames on the forehead   lycidas  o enough enough answered oldbuck i ought to have known what it was to give you advantage over mebut here is what will stop your career of satire for you are an admirer of nature i know in fact when they had followed him through a breach in a low ancient and ruinous wall they came suddenly upon a scene equally unexpected and interesting  they stood pretty high upon the side of the glen which had suddenly opened into a sort of amphitheatre to give room for a pure and profound lake of a few acres extent and a space of level ground around it the banks then arose everywhere steeply and in some places were varied by rocksin others covered with the copse which run up feathering their sides lightly and irregularly and breaking the uniformity of the green pasturegroundbeneath the lake discharged itself into the huddling and tumultuous brook which had been their companion since they had entered the glen at the point at which it issued from its parent lake stood the ruins which they had come to visit they were not of great extent but the singular beauty as well as the wild and sequestered character of the spot on which they were situated gave them an interest and importance superior to that which attaches itself to architectural remains of greater consequence but placed near to ordinary houses and possessing less romantic accompaniments the eastern window of the church remained entire with all its ornaments and tracery work and the sides upheld by flying buttresses whose airy support detached from the wall against which they were placed and ornamented with pinnacles and carved work gave a variety and lightness to the building the roof and western end of the church were completely ruinous but the latter appeared to have made one side of a square of which the ruins of the conventual buildings formed other two and the gardens a fourth the side of these buildings which overhung the brook was partly founded on a steep and precipitous rock for the place had been occasionally turned to military purposes and had been taken with great slaughter during montroses wars the ground formerly occupied by the garden was still marked by a few orchard trees at a greater distance from the buildings were detached oaks and elms and chestnuts growing singly which had attained great size the rest of the space between the ruins and the hill was a closecropt sward which the daily pasture of the sheep kept in much finer order than if it had been subjected to the scythe and broom the whole scene had a repose which was still and affecting without being monotonous the dark deep basin in which the clear blue lake reposed reflecting the water lilies which grew on its surface and the trees which here and there threw their arms from the banks was finely contrasted with the haste and tumult of the brook which broke away from the outlet as if escaping from confinement and hurried down the glen wheeling around the base of the rock on which the ruins were situated and brawling in foam and fury with every shelve and stone which obstructed its passage a similar contrast was seen between the level green meadow in which the ruins were situated and the large timbertrees which were scattered over it compared with the precipitous banks which arose at a short distance around partly fringed with light and feathery underwood partly rising in steeps clothed with purple heath and partly more abruptly elevated into fronts of grey rock chequered with lichen and with those hardy plants which find root even in the most arid crevices of the crags  there was the retreat of learning in the days of darkness mr lovel said oldbuckaround whom the company had now grouped themselves while they admired the unexpected opening of a prospect so romanticthere reposed the sages who were aweary of the world and devoted either to that which was to come or to the service of the generations who should follow them in this i will show you presently the librarysee that stretch of wall with squareshafted windowsthere it existed stored as an old manuscript in my possession assures me with five thousand volumes and here i might well take up the lamentation of the learned leland who regretting the downfall of the conventual libraries exclaims like rachel weeping for her children that if the papal laws decrees decretals clementines and other such drugs of the devilyea if heytesburgs sophisms porphyrys universals aristotles logic and dunses divinity with such other lousy legerdemains begging your pardon miss wardour and fruits of the bottomless pithad leaped out of our libraries for the accommodation of grocers candlemakers soapsellers and other worldly occupiers we might have been therewith contented but to put our ancient chronicles our noble histories our learned commentaries and national muniments to such offices of contempt and subjection has greatly degraded our nation and showed ourselves dishonoured in the eyes of posterity to the utmost stretch of timeo negligence most unfriendly to our land  and o john knox said the baronet through whose influence and under whose auspices the patriotic task was accomplished  the antiquary somewhat in the situation of a woodcock caught in his own springe turned short round and coughed to excuse a slight blush as he mustered his answeras to the apostle of the scottish reformation  but miss wardour broke in to interrupt a conversation so dangerous pray who was the author you quoted mr oldbuck  the learned leland miss wardour who lost his senses on witnessing the destruction of the conventual libraries in england  now i think replied the young lady his misfortune may have saved the rationality of some modern antiquaries which would certainly have been drowned if so vast a lake of learning had not been diminished by draining  well thank heaven there is no danger nowthey have hardly left us a spoonful in which to perform the dire feat  so saying mr oldbuck led the way down the bank by a steep but secure path which soon placed them on the verdant meadow where the ruins stood there they lived continued the antiquary with nought to do but to spend their time in investigating points of remote antiquity transcribing manuscripts and composing new works for the information of posterity  and added the baronet in exercising the rites of devotion with a pomp and ceremonial worthy of the office of the priesthood  and if sir arthurs excellence will permit said the german with a low bow the monksh might also make de vary curious experiment in deir laboraties both in chemistry and magia naturalis  i think said the clergyman they would have enough to do in collecting the teinds of the parsonage and vicarage of three good parishes  and all added miss wardour nodding to the antiquary without interruption from womankind  true my fair foe said oldbuck this was a paradise where no eve was admitted and we may wonder the rather by what chance the good fathers came to lose it  with such criticisms on the occupations of those by whom the ruins had been formerly possessed they wandered for some time from one mossgrown shrine to another under the guidance of oldbuck who explained with much plausibility the groundplan of the edifice and read and expounded to the company the various mouldering inscriptions which yet were to be traced upon the tombs of the dead or under the vacant niches of the sainted images  what is the reason at length miss wardour asked the antiquary why tradition has preserved to us such meagre accounts of the inmates of these stately edifices raised with such expense of labour and taste and whose owners were in their times personages of such awful power and importance the meanest tower of a freebooting baron or squire who lived by his lance and broadsword is consecrated by its appropriate legend and the shepherd will tell you with accuracy the names and feats of its inhabitantsbut ask a countryman concerning these beautiful and extensive remainsthese towers these arches and buttresses and shafted windows reared at such costthree words fill up his answerthey were made up by the monks lang syne  the question was somewhat puzzling sir arthur looked upward as if hoping to be inspired with an answeroldbuck shoved back his wigthe clergyman was of opinion that his parishioners were too deeply impressed with the true presbyterian doctrine to preserve any records concerning the papistical cumberers of the land offshoots as they were of the great overshadowing tree of iniquity whose roots are in the bowels of the seven hills of abominationlovel thought the question was best resolved by considering what are the events which leave the deepest impression on the minds of the common peoplethese he contended were not such as resemble the gradual progress of a fertilizing river but the headlong and precipitous fury of some portentous flood the eras by which the vulgar compute time have always reference to some period of fear and tribulation and they date by a tempest an earthquake or burst of civil commotion when such are the facts most alive in the memory of the common people we cannot wonder he concluded that the ferocious warrior is remembered and the peaceful abbots are abandoned to forgetfulness and oblivion  if you pleashe gentlemans and ladies and ashking pardon of sir arthur and miss wardour and this worthy clergymansh and my goot friend mr oldenbuck who is my countrymansh and of goot young mr lofel also i think it is all owing to de hand of glory  the hand of what exclaimed oldbuck  de hand of glory my goot master oldenbuck which is a vary great and terrible secretswhich de monksh used to conceal their treasures when they were triven from their cloisters by what you call de reform  ay indeed tell us about that said oldbuck for these are secrets worth knowing  why my goot master oldenbuck you will only laugh at mebut de hand of glory is vary well known in de countries where your worthy progenitors did liveand it is hand cut off from a dead man as has been hanged for murther and dried very nice in de shmoke of juniper wood and if you put a little of what you call yew wid your juniper it will not be any betterthat is it will not be no worsethen you do take something of de fatsh of de bear and of de badger and of de great eber as you call de grand boar and of de little sucking child as has not been christened for dat is very essentials and you do make a candle and put it into de hand of glory at de proper hour and minute with de proper ceremonish and he who seeksh for treasuresh shall never find none at all  i dare take my corporal oath of that conclusion said the antiquary and was it the custom mr dousterswivel in westphalia to make use of this elegant candelabrum  alwaysh mr oldenbuck when you did not want nobody to talk of nothing you wash doing aboutand the monksh alwaysh did this when they did hide their churchplates and their great chalices and de rings wid very preshious shtones and jewels  but notwithstanding you knights of the rosy cross have means no doubt of breaking the spell and discovering what the poor monks have put themselves to so much trouble to conceal  ah goot mr oldenbuck replied the adept shaking his head mysteriously you was very hard to believe but if you had seen de great huge pieces of de plate so massive sir arthurso fine fashion miss wardourand de silver cross dat we did find dat was schroepfer and my ownself for de herr freygraf as you call de baron von blunderhaus i do believe you would have believed then  seeing is believing indeed but what was your artwhat was your mystery mr dousterswivel  aha mr oldenbuck dat is my little secret mine goot siryou sall forgife me that i not tell that but i will tell you dere are various waysyes indeed dere is de dream dat you dream tree timesdat is a vary goot way  i am glad of that said oldbuck i have a friend with a sideglance to lovel who is peculiarly favoured by the visits of queen mab  den dere is de sympathies and de antipathies and de strange properties and virtues natural of divers herb and of de little diviningrod  i would gladly rather see some of these wonders than hear of them said miss wardour  ah but my muchhonoured young lady this is not de time or de way to do de great wonder of finding all de churchs plate and treasure but to oblige you and sir arthur my patron and de reverend clergymans and goot mr oldenbuck and young mr lofel who is a very goot young gentleman also i will show you dat it is possible a vary possible to discover de spring of water and de little fountain hidden in de ground without any mattock or spade or dig at all  umph quoth the antiquary i have heard of that conundrum that will be no very productive art in our countryyou should carry that property to spain or portugal and turn it to good account  ah my goot master oldenbuck dere is de inquisition and de autodafethey would burn me who am but a simple philosopher for one great conjurer  they would cast away their coals then said oldbuck but continued he in a whisper to lovel were they to pillory him for one of the most impudent rascals that ever wagged a tongue they would square the punishment more accurately with his deserts but let us see i think he is about to show us some of his legerdemain  in truth the german was now got to a little copsethicket at some distance from the ruins where he affected busily to search for such a wand as would suit the purpose of his mystery and after cutting and examining and rejecting several he at length provided himself with a small twig of hazel terminating in a forked end which he pronounced to possess the virtue proper for the experiment that he was about to exhibit holding the forked ends of the wand each between a finger and thumb and thus keeping the rod upright he proceeded to pace the ruined aisles and cloisters followed by the rest of the company in admiring procession i believe dere was no waters here said the adept when he had made the round of several of the buildings without perceiving any of those indications which he pretended to expecti believe those scotch monksh did find de water too cool for de climate and alwaysh drank de goot comfortable rhinewine but ahasee there accordingly the assistants observed the rod to turn in his fingers although he pretended to hold it very tightdere is water here about sure enough and turning this way and that way as the agitation of the diviningrod seemed to increase or diminish he at length advanced into the midst of a vacant and roofless enclosure which had been the kitchen of the priory when the rod twisted itself so as to point almost straight downwards here is de place said the adept and if you do not find de water here i will give you all leave to call me an impudent knave  i shall take that license whispered the antiquary to lovel whether the water is discovered or no  a servant who had come up with a basket of cold refreshments was now despatched to a neighbouring foresters hut for a mattock and pickaxe the loose stones and rubbish being removed from the spot indicated by the german they soon came to the sides of a regularlybuilt well and when a few feet of rubbish were cleared out by the assistance of the forester and his sons the water began to rise rapidly to the delight of the philosopher the astonishment of the ladies mr blattergowl and sir arthur the surprise of lovel and the confusion of the incredulous antiquary he did not fail however to enter his protest in lovers ear against the miracle this is a mere trick he said the rascal had made himself sure of the existence of this old well by some means or other before he played off this mystical piece of jugglery mark what he talks of next i am much mistaken if this is not intended as a prelude to some more serious fraud see how the rascal assumes consequence and plumes himself upon the credit of his success and how poor sir arthur takes in the tide of nonsense which he is delivering to him as principles of occult science  you do see my goot patron you do see my goot ladies you do see worthy dr bladderhowl and even mr lofel and mr oldenbuck may see if they do will to see how art has no enemy at all but ignorance look at this little slip of hazel nutsit is fit for nothing at all but to whip de little childi would choose a cat and nine tails for your occasions whispered oldbuck apartand you put it in the hands of a philosopherpaf it makes de grand discovery but this is nothing sir arthurnothing at all worthy dr botherhowlnothing at all ladiesnothing at all young mr lofel and goot mr oldenbuck to what art can do ah if dere was any man that had de spirit and de courage i would show him better things than de well of wateri would show him  and a little money would be necessary also would it not said the antiquary  bah one trifle not worth talking about maight be necessaries answered the adept  i thought as much rejoined the antiquary drily and i in the meanwhile without any diviningrod will show you an excellent venison pasty and a bottle of london particular madeira and i think that will match all that mr dousterswivels art is like to exhibit  the feast was spread fronde super viridi as oldbuck expressed himself under a huge old tree called the priors oak and the company sitting down around it did ample honour to the contents of the basket     chapter eighteenth                 as when a gryphon through the wilderness                with winged course oer hill and moory dale                  pursues the arimaspian who by stealth                  had from his wakeful custody purloined                   the guarded gold so eagerly the fiend                                    paradise lost  when their collation was ended sir arthur resumed the account of the mysteries of the diviningrod as a subject on which he had formerly conversed with dousterswivel my friend mr oldbuck will now be prepared mr dousterswivel to listen with more respect to the stories you have told us of the late discoveries in germany by the brethren of your association  ah sir arthur that was not a thing to speak to those gentlemans because it is want of credulitywhat you call faiththat spoils the great enterprise  at least however let my daughter read the narrative she has taken down of the story of martin waldeck  ah that was vary true storybut miss wardour she is so sly and so witty that she has made it just like one romanceas well as goethe or wieland could have done it by mine honest wort  to say the truth mr dousterswivel answered miss wardour the romantic predominated in the legend so much above the probable that it was impossible for a lover of fairyland like me to avoid lending a few touches to make it perfect in its kind but here it is and if you do not incline to leave this shade till the heat of the day has somewhat declined and will have sympathy with my bad composition perhaps sir arthur or mr oldbuck will read it to us  not i said sir arthur i was never fond of reading aloud  nor i said oldbuck for i have forgot my spectacles but here is lovel with sharp eyes and a good voice for mr blattergowl i know never reads anything lest he should be suspected of reading his sermons  the task was therefore imposed upon lovel who received with some trepidation as miss wardour delivered with a little embarrassment a paper containing the lines traced by that fair hand the possession of which he coveted as the highest blessing the earth could offer to him but there was a necessity of suppressing his emotions and after glancing over the manuscript as if to become acquainted with the character he collected himself and read the company the following tale  the fortunes of martin waldeck  the solitudes of the harz forest in germany but especially the mountains called blocksberg or rather brockenberg are the chosen scenes for tales of witches demons and apparitions  the outline of this story is taken from the german though the author is at present unable to say in which of the various collections of the popular legends in that language the original is to be found  the occupation of the inhabitants who are either miners or foresters is of a kind that renders them peculiarly prone to superstition and the natural phenomena which they witness in pursuit of their solitary or subterraneous profession are often set down by them to the interference of goblins or the power of magic among the various legends current in that wild country there is a favourite one which supposes the harz to be haunted by a sort of tutelar demon in the shape of a wild man of huge stature his head wreathed with oak leaves and his middle cinctured with the same bearing in his hand a pine torn up by the roots it is certain that many persons profess to have seen such a form traversing with huge strides in a line parallel to their own course the opposite ridge of a mountain when divided from it by a narrow glen and indeed the fact of the apparition is so generally admitted that modern scepticism has only found refuge by ascribing it to optical deception   the shadow of the person who sees the phantom being reflected upon a cloud of mist like the image of the magic lantern upon a white sheet is supposed to have formed the apparition  in elder times the intercourse of the demon with the inhabitants was more familiar and according to the traditions of the harz he was wont with the caprice usually ascribed to these earthborn powers to interfere with the affairs of mortals sometimes for their weal sometimes for their wo but it was observed that even his gifts often turned out in the long run fatal to those on whom they were bestowed and it was no uncommon thing for the pastors in their care of their flocks to compose long sermons the burden whereof was a warning against having any intercourse direct or indirect with the harz demon the fortunes of martin waldeck have been often quoted by the aged to their giddy children when they were heard to scoff at a danger which appeared visionary  a travelling capuchin had possessed himself of the pulpit of the thatched church at a little hamlet called morgenbrodt lying in the harz district from which he declaimed against the wickedness of the inhabitants their communication with fiends witches and fairies and in particular with the woodland goblin of the harz the doctrines of luther had already begun to spread among the peasantry for the incident is placed under the reign of charles v  and they laughed to scorn the zeal with which the venerable man insisted upon his topic at length as his vehemence increased with opposition so their opposition rose in proportion to his vehemence the inhabitants did not like to hear an accustomed quiet demon who had inhabited the brockenberg for so many ages summarily confounded with baalpeor ashtaroth and beelzebub himself and condemned without reprieve to the bottomless tophet the apprehensions that the spirit might avenge himself on them for listening to such an illiberal sentence added to their national interest in his behalf a travelling friar they said that is here today and away tomorrow may say what he pleases but it is we the ancient and constant inhabitants of the country that are left at the mercy of the insulted demon and must of course pay for all under the irritation occasioned by these reflections the peasants from injurious language betook themselves to stones and having pebbled the priest pretty handsomely they drove him out of the parish to preach against demons elsewhere  three young men who had been present and assisting on this occasion were upon their return to the hut where they carried on the laborious and mean occupation of preparing charcoal for the smelting furnaces on the way their conversation naturally turned upon the demon of the harz and the doctrine of the capuchin max and george waldeck the two elder brothers although they allowed the language of the capuchin to have been indiscreet and worthy of censure as presuming to determine upon the precise character and abode of the spirit yet contended it was dangerous in the highest degree to accept of his gifts or hold any communication with him he was powerful they allowed but wayward and capricious and those who had intercourse with him seldom came to a good end did he not give the brave knight ecbert of rabenwald that famous black steed by means of which he vanquished all the champions at the great tournament at bremen and did not the same steed afterwards precipitate itself with its rider into an abyss so steep and fearful that neither horse nor man were ever seen more had he not given to dame gertrude trodden a curious spell for making butter come and was she not burnt for a witch by the grand criminal judge of the electorate because she availed herself of his gift but these and many other instances which they quoted of mischance and illluck ultimately attending on the apparent benefits conferred by the harz spirit failed to make any impression upon martin waldeck the youngest of the brothers  martin was youthful rash and impetuous excelling in all the exercises which distinguish a mountaineer and brave and undaunted from his familiar intercourse with the dangers that attend them he laughed at the timidity of his brothers tell me not of such folly he said the demon is a good demonhe lives among us as if he were a peasant like ourselveshaunts the lonely crags and recesses of the mountains like a huntsman or goatherdand he who loves the harz forest and its wild scenes cannot be indifferent to the fate of the hardy children of the soil but if the demon were as malicious as you would make him how should he derive power over mortals who barely avail themselves of his gifts without binding themselves to submit to his pleasure when you carry your charcoal to the furnace is not the money as good that is paid you by blaspheming blaize the old reprobate overseer as if you got it from the pastor himself it is not the goblins gifts which can endanger you then but it is the use you shall make of them that you must account for and were the demon to appear to me at this moment and indicate to me a gold or silver mine i would begin to dig away even before his back were turnedand i would consider myself as under protection of a much greater than he while i made a good use of the wealth he pointed out to me  to this the elder brother replied that wealth ill won was seldom well spent while martin presumptuously declared that the possession of all the treasures of the harz would not make the slightest alteration on his habits morals or character  his brother entreated martin to talk less wildly upon the subject and with some difficulty contrived to withdraw his attention by calling it to the consideration of the approaching boarchase this talk brought them to their hut a wretched wigwam situated upon one side of a wild narrow and romantic dell in the recesses of the brockenberg they released their sister from attending upon the operation of charring the wood which requires constant attention and divided among themselves the duty of watching it by night according to their custom one always waking while his brothers slept  max waldeck the eldest watched during the first two hours of the night and was considerably alarmed by observing upon the opposite bank of the glen or valley a huge fire surrounded by some figures that appeared to wheel around it with antic gestures max at first bethought him of calling up his brothers but recollecting the daring character of the youngest and finding it impossible to wake the elder without also disturbing martinconceiving also what he saw to be an illusion of the demon sent perhaps in consequence of the venturous expressions used by martin on the preceding evening he thought it best to betake himself to the safeguard of such prayers as he could murmur over and to watch in great terror and annoyance this strange and alarming apparition after blazing for some time the fire faded gradually away into darkness and the rest of maxs watch was only disturbed by the remembrance of its terrors  george now occupied the place of max who had retired to rest the phenomenon of a huge blazing fire upon the opposite bank of the glen again presented itself to the eye of the watchman it was surrounded as before by figures which distinguished by their opaque forms being between the spectator and the red glaring light moved and fluctuated around it as if engaged in some mystical ceremony george though equally cautious was of a bolder character than his elder brother he resolved to examine more nearly the object of his wonder and accordingly after crossing the rivulet which divided the glen he climbed up the opposite bank and approached within an arrows flight of the fire which blazed apparently with the same fury as when he first witnessed it  the appearance of the assistants who surrounded it resembled those phantoms which are seen in a troubled dream and at once confirmed the idea he had entertained from the first that they did not belong to the human world amongst these strange unearthly forms george waldeck distinguished that of a giant overgrown with hair holding an uprooted fir in his hand with which from time to time he seemed to stir the blazing fire and having no other clothing than a wreath of oak leaves around his forehead and loins georges heart sunk within him at recognising the wellknown apparition of the harz demon as he had been often described to him by the ancient shepherds and huntsmen who had seen his form traversing the mountains he turned and was about to fly but upon second thoughts blaming his own cowardice he recited mentally the verse of the psalmist all good angels praise the lord which is in that country supposed powerful as an exorcism and turned himself once more towards the place where he had seen the fire but it was no longer visible  the pale moon alone enlightened the side of the valley and when george with trembling steps a moist brow and hair bristling upright under his colliers cap came to the spot on which the fire had been so lately visible marked as it was by a scathed oaktree there appeared not on the heath the slightest vestiges of what he had seen the moss and wild flowers were unscorched and the branches of the oaktree which had so lately appeared enveloped in wreaths of flame and smoke were moist with the dews of midnight  george returned to his hut with trembling steps and arguing like his elder brother resolved to say nothing of what he had seen lest he should awake in martin that daring curiosity which he almost deemed to be allied with impiety  it was now martins turn to watch the household cock had given his first summons and the night was wellnigh spent upon examining the state of the furnace in which the wood was deposited in order to its being coked or charred he was surprised to find that the fire had not been sufficiently maintained for in his excursion and its consequences george had forgot the principal object of his watch martins first thought was to call up the slumberers but observing that both his brothers slept unwontedly deep and heavily he respected their repose and set himself to supply the furnace with fuel without requiring their aid what he heaped upon it was apparently damp and unfit for the purpose for the fire seemed rather to decay than revive martin next went to collect some boughs from a stack which had been carefully cut and dried for this purpose but when he returned he found the fire totally extinguished this was a serious evil and threatened them with loss of their trade for more than one day the vexed and mortified watchman set about to strike a light in order to rekindle the fire but the tinder was moist and his labour proved in this respect also ineffectual he was now about to call up his brothers for circumstances seemed to be pressing when flashes of light glimmered not only through the window but through every crevice of the rudely built hut and summoned him to behold the same apparition which had before alarmed the successive watches of his brethren his first idea was that the muhllerhaussers their rivals in trade and with whom they had had many quarrels might have encroached upon their bounds for the purpose of pirating their wood and he resolved to awake his brothers and be revenged on them for their audacity but a short reflection and observation on the gestures and manner of those who seemed to work in the fire induced him to dismiss this belief and although rather sceptical in such matters to conclude that what he saw was a supernatural phenomenon but be they men or fiends said the undaunted forester that busy themselves yonder with such fantastical rites and gestures i will go and demand a light to rekindle our furnace he relinquished at the same time the idea of awaking his brethren there was a belief that such adventures as he was about to undertake were accessible only to one person at a time he feared also that his brothers in their scrupulous timidity might interfere to prevent his pursuing the investigation he had resolved to commence and therefore snatching his boarspear from the wall the undaunted martin waldeck set forth on the adventure alone  with the same success as his brother george but with courage far superior martin crossed the brook ascended the hill and approached so near the ghostly assembly that he could recognise in the presiding figure the attributes of the harz demon a cold shuddering assailed him for the first time in his life but the recollection that he had at a distance dared and even courted the intercourse which was now about to take place confirmed his staggering courage and pride supplying what he wanted in resolution he advanced with tolerable firmness towards the fire the figures which surrounded it appearing still more wild fantastical and supernatural the more near he approached to the assembly he was received with a loud shout of discordant and unnatural laughter which to his stunned ears seemed more alarming than a combination of the most dismal and melancholy sounds that could be imagined who art thou said the giant compressing his savage and exaggerated features into a sort of forced gravity while they were occasionally agitated by the convulsion of the laughter which he seemed to suppress  martin waldeck the forester answered the hardy youthand who are you  the king of the waste and of the mine answered the spectreand why hast thou dared to encroach on my mysteries  i came in search of light to rekindle my fire answered martin hardily and then resolutely asked in his turn what mysteries are those that you celebrate here  we celebrate answered the complaisant demon the wedding of hermes with the black dragonbut take thy fire that thou camest to seek and begone no mortal may look upon us and live  the peasant struck his spearpoint into a large piece of blazing wood which he heaved up with some difficulty and then turned round to regain his hut the shouts of laughter being renewed behind him with treble violence and ringing far down the narrow valley when martin returned to the hut his first care however much astonished with what he had seen was to dispose the kindled coal among the fuel so as might best light the fire of his furnace but after many efforts and all exertions of bellows and fireprong the coal he had brought from the demons fire became totally extinct without kindling any of the others he turned about and observed the fire still blazing on the hill although those who had been busied around it had disappeared as he conceived the spectre had been jesting with him he gave way to the natural hardihood of his temper and determining to see the adventure to an end resumed the road to the fire from which unopposed by the demon he brought off in the same manner a blazing piece of charcoal but still without being able to succeed in lighting his fire impunity having increased his rashness he resolved upon a third experiment and was as successful as before in reaching the fire but when he had again appropriated a piece of burning coal and had turned to depart he heard the harsh and supernatural voice which had before accosted him pronounce these words dare not return hither a fourth time  the attempt to kindle the fire with this last coal having proved as ineffectual as on the former occasions martin relinquished the hopeless attempt and flung himself on his bed of leaves resolving to delay till the next morning the communication of his supernatural adventure to his brothers he was awakened from a heavy sleep into which he had sunk from fatigue of body and agitation of mind by loud exclamations of surprise and joy his brothers astonished at finding the fire extinguished when they awoke had proceeded to arrange the fuel in order to renew it when they found in the ashes three huge metallic masses which their skill for most of the peasants in the harz are practical mineralogists immediately ascertained to be pure gold  it was some damp upon their joyful congratulations when they learned from martin the mode in which he had obtained this treasure to which their own experience of the nocturnal vision induced them to give full credit but they were unable to resist the temptation of sharing in their brothers wealth taking now upon him as head of the house martin waldeck bought lands and forests built a castle obtained a patent of nobility and greatly to the indignation of the ancient aristocracy of the neighbourhood was invested with all the privileges of a man of family his courage in public war as well as in private feuds together with the number of retainers whom he kept in pay sustained him for some time against the odium which was excited by his sudden elevation and the arrogance of his pretensions  and now it was seen in the instance of martin waldeck as it has been in that of many others how little mortals can foresee the effect of sudden prosperity on their own disposition the evil propensities in his nature which poverty had checked and repressed ripened and bore their unhallowed fruit under the influence of temptation and the means of indulgence as deep calls unto deep one bad passion awakened another the fiend of avarice invoked that of pride and pride was to be supported by cruelty and oppression waldecks character always bold and daring but rendered harsh and assuming by prosperity soon made him odious not to the nobles only but likewise to the lower ranks who saw with double dislike the oppressive rights of the feudal nobility of the empire so remorselessly exercised by one who had risen from the very dregs of the people his adventure although carefully concealed began likewise to be whispered abroad and the clergy already stigmatized as a wizard and accomplice of fiends the wretch who having acquired so huge a treasure in so strange a manner had not sought to sanctify it by dedicating a considerable portion to the use of the church surrounded by enemies public and private tormented by a thousand feuds and threatened by the church with excommunication martin waldeck or as we must now call him the baron von waldeck often regretted bitterly the labours and sports of his unenvied poverty but his courage failed him not under all these difficulties and seemed rather to augment in proportion to the danger which darkened around him until an accident precipitated his fall  a proclamation by the reigning duke of brunswick had invited to a solemn tournament all german nobles of free and honourable descent and martin waldeck splendidly armed accompanied by his two brothers and a gallantlyequipped retinue had the arrogance to appear among the chivalry of the province and demand permission to enter the lists this was considered as filling up the measure of his presumption a thousand voices exclaimed we will have no cindersifter mingle in our games of chivalry irritated to frenzy martin drew his sword and hewed down the herald who in compliance with the general outcry opposed his entry into the lists an hundred swords were unsheathed to avenge what was in those days regarded as a crime only inferior to sacrilege or regicide waldeck after defending himself like a lion was seized tried on the spot by the judges of the lists and condemned as the appropriate punishment for breaking the peace of his sovereign and violating the sacred person of a heraldatarms to have his right hand struck from his body to be ignominiously deprived of the honour of nobility of which he was unworthy and to be expelled from the city when he had been stripped of his arms and sustained the mutilation imposed by this severe sentence the unhappy victim of ambition was abandoned to the rabble who followed him with threats and outcries levelled alternately against the necromancer and oppressor which at length ended in violence his brothers for his retinue were fled and dispersed at length succeeded in rescuing him from the hands of the populace when satiated with cruelty they had left him half dead through loss of blood and through the outrages he had sustained they were not permitted such was the ingenious cruelty of their enemies to make use of any other means of removing him excepting such a colliers cart as they had themselves formerly used in which they deposited their brother on a truss of straw scarcely expecting to reach any place of shelter ere death should release him from his misery  when the waldecks journeying in this miserable manner had approached the verge of their native country in a hollow way between two mountains they perceived a figure advancing towards them which at first sight seemed to be an aged man but as he approached his limbs and stature increased the cloak fell from his shoulders his pilgrims staff was changed into an uprooted pinetree and the gigantic figure of the harz demon passed before them in his terrors when he came opposite to the cart which contained the miserable waldeck his huge features dilated into a grin of unutterable contempt and malignity as he asked the sufferer how like you the fire my coals have kindled the power of motion which terror suspended in his two brothers seemed to be restored to martin by the energy of his courage he raised himself on the cart bent his brows and clenching his fist shook it at the spectre with a ghastly look of hate and defiance the goblin vanished with his usual tremendous and explosive laugh and left waldeck exhausted with this effort of expiring nature  the terrified brethren turned their vehicle toward the towers of a convent which arose in a wood of pinetrees beside the road they were charitably received by a barefooted and longbearded capuchin and martin survived only to complete the first confession he had made since the day of his sudden prosperity and to receive absolution from the very priest whom precisely on that day three years he had assisted to pelt out of the hamlet of morgenbrodt the three years of precarious prosperity were supposed to have a mysterious correspondence with the number of his visits to the spectral fire upon the bill  the body of martin waldeck was interred in the convent where he expired in which his brothers having assumed the habit of the order lived and died in the performance of acts of charity and devotion his lands to which no one asserted any claim lay waste until they were reassumed by the emperor as a lapsed fief and the ruins of the castle which waldeck had called by his own name are still shunned by the miner and forester as haunted by evil spirits thus were the miseries attendant upon wealth hastily attained and ill employed exemplified in the fortunes of martin waldeck     chapter nineteenth                   here has been such a stormy encounter                  betwixt my cousin captain and this soldier                  about i know not whatnothing indeed                  competitions degrees and comparatives                           of soldiership                                     a faire qurrell  the attentive audience gave the fair transcriber of the foregoing legend the thanks which politeness required oldbuck alone curled up his nose and observed that miss wardours skill was something like that of the alchemists for she had contrived to extract a sound and valuable moral out of a very trumpery and ridiculous legend it is the fashion as i am given to understand to admire those extravagant fictionsfor me                              i bear an english heart              unused at ghosts and rattling bones to start  under your favour my goot mr oldenbuck said the german miss wardour has turned de story as she does every thing as she touches very pretty indeed but all the history of de harz goblin and how he walks among de desolate mountains wid a great firtree for his walking cane and wid de great green bush around his head and his waistthat is as true as i am an honest man  there is no disputing any proposition so well guaranteed answered the antiquary drily but at this moment the approach of a stranger cut short the conversation  the new comer was a handsome young man about fiveandtwenty in a military undress and bearing in his look and manner a good deal of the martial professionnay perhaps a little more than is quite consistent with the ease of a man of perfect goodbreeding in whom no professional habit ought to predominate he was at once greeted by the greater part of the company my dear hector said miss mintyre as she rose to take his hand  hector son of priam whence comest thou said the antiquary  from fife my liege answered the young soldier and continued when he had politely saluted the rest of the company and particularly sir arthur and his daughteri learned from one of the servants as i rode towards monkbarns to pay my respects to you that i should find the present company in this place and i willingly embrace the opportunity to pay my respects to so many of my friends at once  and to a new one also my trusty trojan said oldbuck mr lovel this is my nephew captain mintyrehector i recommend mr lovel to your acquaintance  the young soldier fixed his keen eye upon lovel and paid his compliment with more reserve than cordiality and as our acquaintance thought his coldness almost supercilious he was equally frigid and haughty in making the necessary return to it and thus a prejudice seemed to arise between them at the very commencement of their acquaintance  the observations which lovel made during the remainder of this pleasure party did not tend to reconcile him with this addition to their society captain mintyre with the gallantry to be expected from his age and profession attached himself to the service of miss wardour and offered her on every possible opportunity those marks of attention which lovel would have given the world to have rendered and was only deterred from offering by the fear of her displeasure with forlorn dejection at one moment and with irritated susceptibility at another he saw this handsome young soldier assume and exercise all the privileges of a cavaliere servente he handed miss wardours gloves he assisted her in putting on her shawl he attached himself to her in the walks had a hand ready to remove every impediment in her path and an arm to support her where it was rugged or difficult his conversation was addressed chiefly to her and where circumstances permitted it was exclusively so all this lovel well knew might be only that sort of egotistical gallantry which induces some young men of the present day to give themselves the air of engrossing the attention of the prettiest women in company as if the others were unworthy of their notice but he thought he observed in the conduct of captain mintyre something of marked and peculiar tenderness which was calculated to alarm the jealousy of a lover miss wardour also received his attentions and although his candour allowed they were of a kind which could not be repelled without some strain of affectation yet it galled him to the heart to witness that she did so  the heartburning which these reflections occasioned proved very indifferent seasoning to the dry antiquarian discussions with which oldbuck who continued to demand his particular attention was unremittingly persecuting him and he underwent with fits of impatience that amounted almost to loathing a course of lectures upon monastic architecture in all its styles from the massive saxon to the florid gothic and from that to the mixed and composite architecture of james the firsts time when according to oldbuck all orders were confounded and columns of various descriptions arose side by side or were piled above each other as if symmetry had been forgotten and the elemental principles of art resolved into their primitive confusion what can be more cutting to the heart than the sight of evils said oldbuck in rapturous enthusiasm which we are compelled to behold while we do not possess the power of remedying them lovel answered by an involulatary groan i see my dear young friend and most congenial spirit that you feel these enormities almost as much as i do have you ever approached them or met them without longing to tear to deface what is so dishonourable  dishonourable echoed lovelin what respect dishonourable  i mean disgraceful to the arts  where how  upon the portico for example of the schools of oxford where at immense expense the barbarous fantastic and ignorant architect has chosen to represent the whole five orders of architecture on the front of one building  by such attacks as these oldbuck unconscious of the torture he was giving compelled lovel to give him a share of his attentionas a skilful angler by means of his line maintains an influence over the most frantic movements of his agonized prey  they were now on their return to the spot where they had left the carriages and it is inconceivable how often in the course of that short walk lovel exhausted by the unceasing prosing of his worthy companion mentally bestowed on the devil or any one else that would have rid him of hearing more of them all the orders and disorders of architecture which had been invented or combined from the building of solomons temple downwards a slight incident occurred however which sprinkled a little patience on the heat of his distemperature  miss wardour and her selfelected knight companion rather preceded the others in the narrow path when the young lady apparently became desirous to unite herself with the rest of the party and to break off her teteatete with the young officer fairly made a pause until mr oldbuck came up i wished to ask you a question mr oldbuck concerning the date of these interesting ruins  it would be doing injustice to miss wardours savoir faire to suppose she was not aware that such a question would lead to an answer of no limited length the antiquary starting like a warhorse at the trumpet sound plunged at once into the various arguments for and against the date of 1273 which had been assigned to the priory of st ruth by a late publication on scottish architectural antiquities he raked up the names of all the priors who had ruled the institution of the nobles who had bestowed lands upon it and of the monarchs who had slept their last sleep among its roofless courts as a train which takes fire is sure to light another if there be such in the vicinity the baronet catching at the name of one of his ancestors which occurred in oldbucks disquisition entered upon an account of his wars his conquests and his trophies and worthy dr blattergowl was induced from the mention of a grant of lands cum decimis inclusis tam vicariis quam garbalibus et nunquan antea separatis to enter into a long explanation concerning the interpretation given by the teind court in the consideration of such a clause which had occurred in a process for localling his last augmentation of stipend the orators like three racers each pressed forward to the goal without much regarding how each crossed and jostled his competitors mr oldbuck harangued the baronet declaimed mr blattergowl prosed and laid down the law while the latin forms of feudal grants were mingled with the jargon of blazonry and the yet more barbarous phraseology of the teind court of scotland he was exclaimed oldbuck speaking of the prior adhemar indeed an exemplary prelate and from his strictness of morals rigid execution of penance joined to the charitable disposition of his mind and the infirmities endured by his great age and ascetic habits  here he chanced to cough and sir arthur burst in or rather continuedwas called popularly hellinharness he carried a shield gules with a sable fess which we have since disused and was slain at the battle of vernoil in france after killing six of the english with his own  decreet of certification proceeded the clergyman in that prolonged steady prosing tone which however overpowered at first by the vehemence of competition promised in the long run to obtain the ascendancy in this strife of narratorsdecreet of certification having gone out and parties being held as confessed the proof seemed to be held as concluded when their lawyer moved to have it opened up on the allegation that they had witnesses to bring forward that they had been in the habit of carrying the ewes to lamb on the teindfree land which was a mere evasion for  but here the baronet and mr oldbuck having recovered their wind and continued their respective harangues the three strands of the conversation to speak the language of a ropework were again twined together into one undistinguishable string of confusion  yet howsoever uninteresting this piebald jargon might seem it was obviously miss wardours purpose to give it her attention in preference to yielding captain mintyre an opportunity of renewing their private conversation so that after waiting for a little time with displeasure ill concealed by his haughty features he left her to enjoy her bad taste and taking his sister by the arm detained her a little behind the rest of the party  so i find mary that your neighbour has neither become more lively nor less learned during my absence  we lacked your patience and wisdom to instruct us hector  thank you my dear sister but you have got a wiser if not so lively an addition to your society than your unworthy brotherpray who is this mr lovel whom our old uncle has at once placed so high in his good graceshe does not use to be so accessible to strangers  mr lovel hector is a very gentlemanlike young man  aythat is to say he bows when he comes into a room and wears a coat that is whole at the elbows  no brother it says a great deal more it says that his manners and discourse express the feelings and education of the higher class  but i desire to know what is his birth and his rank in society and what is his title to be in the circle in which i find him domesticated  if you mean how he comes to visit at monkbarns you must ask my uncle who will probably reply that he invites to his own house such company as he pleases and if you mean to ask sir arthur you must know that mr lovel rendered miss wardour and him a service of the most important kind  what that romantic story is true thenand pray does the valorous knight aspire as is befitting on such occasions to the hand of the young lady whom he redeemed from peril it is quite in the rule of romance i am aware and i did think that she was uncommonly dry to me as we walked together and seemed from time to time as if she watched whether she was not giving offence to her gallant cavalier  dear hector said his sister if you really continue to nourish any affection for miss wardour  if marywhat an if was there  i own i consider your perseverance as hopeless  and why hopeless my sage sister asked captain mintyre miss wardour in the state of her fathers affairs cannot pretend to much fortuneand as to family i trust that of mlntyre is not inferior  but hector continued his sister sir arthur always considers us as members of the monkbarns family  sir arthur may consider what he pleases answered the highlander scornfully but any one with common sense will consider that the wife takes rank from the husband and that my fathers pedigree of fifteen unblemished descents must have ennobled my mother if her veins had been filled with printers ink  for gods sake hector replied his anxious sister take care of yourself a single expression of that kind repeated to my uncle by an indiscreet or interested eavesdropper would lose you his favour for ever and destroy all chance of your succeeding to his estate  be it so answered the heedless young man i am one of a profession which the world has never been able to do without and will far less endure to want for half a century to come and my good old uncle may tack his good estate and his plebeian name to your apronstring if he pleases mary and you may wed this new favourite of his if you please and you may both of you live quiet peaceable wellregulated lives if it pleases heaven my part is takenill fawn on no man for an inheritance which should be mine by birth  miss mintyre laid her hand on her brothers arm and entreated him to suppress his vehemence who she said injures or seeks to injure you but your own hasty temperwhat dangers are you defying but those you have yourself conjured upour uncle has hitherto been all that is kind and paternal in his conduct to us and why should you suppose he will in future be otherwise than what he has ever been since we were left as orphans to his care  he is an excellent old gentleman i must own replied mintyre and i am enraged at myself when i chance to offend him but then his eternal harangues upon topics not worth the spark of a flinthis investigations about invalided pots and pans and tobaccostoppers past serviceall these things put me out of patience i have something of hotspur in me sister i must confess  too much too much my dear brother into how many risks and forgive me for saying some of them little creditable has this absolute and violent temper led you do not let such clouds darken the time you are now to pass in our neighbourhood but let our old benefactor see his kinsman as he isgenerous kind and lively without being rude headstrong and impetuous  well answered captain mintyre i am schooledgoodmanners be my speed ill do the civil thing by your new friendill have some talk with this mr lovel  with this determination in which he was for the time perfectly sincere he joined the party who were walking before them the treble disquisition was by this time ended and sir arthur was speaking on the subject of foreign news and the political and military situation of the country themes upon which every man thinks himself qualified to give an opinion an action of the preceding year having come upon the tapis lovel accidentally mingling in the conversation made some assertion concerning it of the accuracy of which captain mintyre seemed not to be convinced although his doubts were politely expressed  you must confess yourself in the wrong here hector said his uncle although i know no man less willing to give up an argument but you were in england at the time and mr lovel was probably concerned in the affair  i am speaking to a military man then said mintyre may i inquire to what regiment mr lovel belongsmr lovel gave him the number of the regiment it happens strangely that we should never have met before mr lovel i know your regiment very well and have served along with them at different times  a blush crossed lovels countenance i have not lately been with my regiment he replied i served the last campaign upon the staff of general sir  indeed that is more wonderful than the other circumstancefor although i did not serve with general sir yet i had an opportunity of knowing the names of the officers who held situations in his family and i cannot recollect that of lovel  at this observation lovel again blushed so deeply as to attract the attention of the whole company while a scornful laugh seemed to indicate captain mintyres triumph there is something strange in this said oldbuck to himself but i will not readily give up my phoenix of postchaise companionsall his actions language and bearing are those of a gentleman  lovel in the meanwhile had taken out his pocketbook and selecting a letter from which he took off the envelope he handed it to mlntyre you know the generals hand in all probabilityi own i ought not to show these exaggerated expressions of his regard and esteem for me the letter contained a very handsome compliment from the officer in question for some military service lately performed captain mintyre as he glanced his eye over it could not deny that it was written in the generals hand but drily observed as he returned it that the address was wanting the address captain mintyre answered lovel in the same tone shall be at your service whenever you choose to inquire after it  i certainly shall not fail to do so rejoined the soldier  come come exclaimed oldbuck what is the meaning of all this have we got hiren herewell have no swaggering youngsters are you come from the wars abroad to stir up domestic strife in our peaceful land are you like bulldog puppies forsooth that when the bull poor fellow is removed from the ring fall to brawl among themselves worry each other and bite honest folks shins that are standing by  sir arthur trusted he said the young gentlemen would not so far forget themselves as to grow warm upon such a trifling subject as the back of a letter  both the disputants disclaimed any such intention and with high colour and flashing eyes protested they were never so cool in their lives but an obvious damp was cast over the partythey talked in future too much by the rule to be sociable and lovel conceiving himself the object of cold and suspicious looks from the rest of the company and sensible that his indirect replies had given them permission to entertain strange opinions respecting him made a gallant determination to sacrifice the pleasure he had proposed in spending the day at knockwinnock  he affected therefore to complain of a violent headache occasioned by the heat of the day to which he had not been exposed since his illness and made a formal apology to sir arthur who listening more to recent suspicion than to the gratitude due for former services did not press him to keep his engagement more than goodbreeding exactly demanded  when lovel took leave of the ladies miss wardours manner seemed more anxious than he had hitherto remarked it she indicated by a glance of her eye towards captain mintyre perceptible only by lovel the subject of her alarm and hoped in a voice greatly under her usual tone it was not a less pleasant engagement which deprived them of the pleasure of mr lovels company no engagement had intervened he assured her it was only the return of a complaint by which he had been for some time occasionally attacked  the best remedy in such a case is prudence and ievery friend of mr lovels will expect him to employ it  lovel bowed low and coloured deeply and miss wardour as if she felt that she had said too much turned and got into the carriage lovel had next to part with oldbuck who during this interval had with caxons assistance been arranging his disordered periwig and brushing his coat which exhibited some marks of the rude path they had traversed what man said oldbuck you are not going to leave us on account of that foolish hectors indiscreet curiosity and vehemence why he is a thoughtless boya spoiled child from the time he was in the nurses armshe threw his coral and bells at my head for refusing him a bit of sugar and you have too much sense to mind such a shrewish boy aequam servare mentem is the motto of our friend horace ill school hector by and by and put it all to rights but lovel persisted in his design of returning to fairport  the antiquary then assumed a graver tonetake heed young man to your present feelings your life has been given you for useful and valuable purposes and should be reserved to illustrate the literature of your country when you are not called upon to expose it in her defence or in the rescue of the innocent private war a practice unknown to the civilised ancients is of all the absurdities introduced by the gothic tribes the most gross impious and cruel let me hear no more of these absurd quarrels and i will show you the treatise upon the duello which i composed when the townclerk and provost mucklewhame chose to assume the privileges of gentlemen and challenged each other i thought of printing my essay which is signed pacificator but there was no need as the matter was taken up by the towncouncil of the borough  but i assure you my dear sir there is nothing between captain mintyre and me that can render such respectable interference necessary  see it be so for otherwise i will stand second to both parties  so saying the old gentleman got into the chaise close to which miss mintyre had detained her brother upon the same principle that the owner of a quarrelsome dog keeps him by his side to prevent his fastening upon another but hector contrived to give her precaution the slip for as he was on horseback he lingered behind the carriages until they had fairly turned the corner in the road to knockwinnock and then wheeling his horses head round gave him the spur in the opposite direction  a very few minutes brought him up with lovel who perhaps anticipating his intention had not put his horse beyond a slow walk when the clatter of hoofs behind him announced captain mlntyre the young soldier his natural heat of temper exasperated by the rapidity of motion reined his horse up suddenly and violently by lovels side and touching his hat slightly inquired in a very haughty tone of voice what am i to understand sir by your telling me that your address was at my service  simply sir replied lovel that my name is lovel and that my residence is for the present fairport as you will see by this card  and is this all the information you are disposed to give me  i see no right you have to require more  i find you sir in company with my sister said the young soldier and i have a right to know who is admitted into miss mintyres society  i shall take the liberty of disputing that right replied lovel with a manner as haughty as that of the young soldieryou find me in society who are satisfied with the degree of information on my affairs which i have thought proper to communicate and you a mere stranger have no right to inquire further  mr lovel if you served as you say you have  if interrupted lovelif i have served as i say i have  yes sir such is my expressionif you have so served you must know that you owe me satisfaction either in one way or other  if that be your opinion i shall be proud to give it to you captain mintyre in the way in which the word is generally used among gentlemen  very well sir rejoined hector and turning his horse round galloped off to overtake his party  his absence had already alarmed them and his sister having stopped the carriage had her neck stretched out of the window to see where he was  what is the matter with you now said the antiquary riding to and fro as your neck were upon the wagerwhy do you not keep up with the carriage  i forgot my glove sir said hector  forgot your glovei presume you meant to say you went to throw it downbut i will take order with you my young gentlemanyou shall return with me this night to monkbarns so saying he bid the postilion go on     chapter twentieth                           if you fail honour here                  never presume to serve her any more                  bid farewell to the integrity of armes                     and the honourable name of soldier             fall from you like a shivered wreath of laurel             by thunder struck from a desertlesse forehead                                     a faire quarrell  early the next morning a gentleman came to wait upon mr lovel who was up and ready to receive him he was a military gentleman a friend of captain mintyres at present in fairport on the recruiting service lovel and he were slightly known to each other i presume sir said mr lesley such was the name of the visitor that you guess the occasion of my troubling you so early  a message from captain mintyre i presume  the same he holds himself injured by the manner in which you declined yesterday to answer certain inquiries which he conceived himself entitled to make respecting a gentleman whom he found in intimate society with his family  may i ask if you mr lesley would have inclined to satisfy interrogatories so haughtily and unceremoniously put to you  perhaps notand therefore as i know the warmth of my friend mintyre on such occasions i feel very desirous of acting as peacemaker from mr lovels very gentlemanlike manners every one must strongly wish to see him repel all that sort of dubious calumny which will attach itself to one whose situation is not fully explained if he will permit me in friendly conciliation to inform captain mintyre of his real name for we are led to conclude that of lovel is assumed  i beg your pardon sir but i cannot admit that inference  or at least said lesley proceeding that it is not the name by which mr lovel has been at all times distinguishedif mr lovel will have the goodness to explain this circumstance which in my opinion he should do in justice to his own character i will answer for the amicable arrangement of this unpleasant business  which is to say mr lesley that if i condescend to answer questions which no man has a right to ask and which are now put to me under penalty of captain mintyres resentment captain mintyre will condescend to rest satisfied mr lesley i have just one word to say on this subjecti have no doubt my secret if i had one might be safely entrusted to your honour but i do not feel called upon to satisfy the curiosity of any one captain mintyre met me in society which of itself was a warrant to all the world and particularly ought to be such to him that i was a gentleman he has in my opinion no right to go any further or to inquire the pedigree rank or circumstances of a stranger who without seeking any intimate connection with him or his chances to dine with his uncle or walk in company with his sister  in that case captain mintyre requests you to be informed that your farther visits at monkbarns and all connection with miss mintyre must be dropt as disagreeable to him  i shall certainly said lovel visit mr oldbuck when it suits me without paying the least respect to his nephews threats or irritable feelings i respect the young ladys name too much though nothing can be slighter than our acquaintance to introduce it into such a discussion  since that is your resolution sir answered lesley captain mintyre requests that mr lovel unless he wishes to be announced as a very dubious character will favour him with a meeting this evening at seven at the thorntree in the little valley close by the ruins of st ruth  most unquestionably i will wait upon him there is only one difficultyi must find a friend to accompany me and where to seek one on this short notice as i have no acquaintance in fairporti will be on the spot howevercaptain mintyre may be assured of that  lesley had taken his hat and was as far as the door of the apartment when as if moved by the peculiarity of lovels situation he returned and thus addressed him mr lovel there is something so singular in all this that i cannot help again resuming the argument you must be yourself aware at this moment of the inconvenience of your preserving an incognito for which i am convinced there can be no dishonourable reason still this mystery renders it difficult for you to procure the assistance of a friend in a crisis so delicatenay let me add that many persons will even consider it as a piece of quixotry in mintyre to give you a meeting while your character and circumstances are involved in such obscurity  i understand your innuendo mr lesley rejoined lovel and though i might be offended at its severity i am not so because it is meant kindly but in my opinion he is entitled to all the privileges of a gentleman to whose charge during the time he has been known in the society where he happens to move nothing can be laid that is unhandsome or unbecoming for a friend i dare say i shall find some one or other who will do me that good turn and if his experience be less than i could wish i am certain not to suffer through that circumstance when you are in the field for my antagonist  i trust you will not said lesley but as i must for my own sake be anxious to divide so heavy a responsibility with a capable assistant allow me to say that lieutenant taffrils gunbrig is come into the roadstead and he himself is now at old caxons where he lodges i think you have the same degree of acquaintance with him as with me and as i am sure i should willingly have rendered you such a service were i not engaged on the other side i am convinced he will do so at your first request  at the thorntree then mr lesley at seven this eveningthe arms i presume are pistols  exactly mintyre has chosen the hour at which he can best escape from monkbarnshe was with me this morning by five in order to return and present himself before his uncle was up goodmorning to you mr lovel and lesley left the apartment  lovel was as brave as most men but none can internally regard such a crisis as now approached without deep feelings of awe and uncertainty in a few hours he might be in another world to answer for an action which his calmer thought told him was unjustifiable in a religious point of view or he might be wandering about in the present like cain with the blood of his brother on his head and all this might be saved by speaking a single word yet pride whispered that to speak that word now would be ascribed to a motive which would degrade him more low than even the most injurious reasons that could be assigned for his silence every one miss wardour included must then he thought account him a mean dishonoured poltroon who gave to the fear of meeting captain mintyre the explanation he had refused to the calm and handsome expostulations of mr lesley mintyres insolent behaviour to himself personally the air of pretension which he assumed towards miss wardour and the extreme injustice arrogance and incivility of his demands upon a perfect stranger seemed to justify him in repelling his rude investigation in short he formed the resolution which might have been expected from so young a manto shut the eyes namely of his calmer reason and follow the dictates of his offended pride with this purpose he sought lieutenant taffril  the lieutenant received him with the good breeding of a gentleman and the frankness of a sailor and listened with no small surprise to the detail which preceded his request that he might be favoured with his company at his meeting with captain mintyre when he had finished taffril rose up and walked through his apartment once or twice this is a most singular circumstance he said and really  i am conscious mr taffril how little i am entitled to make my present request but the urgency of circumstances hardly leaves me an alternative  permit me to ask you one question asked the sailoris there anything of which you are ashamed in the circumstances which you have declined to communicate  upon my honour no there is nothing but what in a very short time i trust i may publish to the whole world  i hope the mystery arises from no false shame at the lowness of your friends perhaps or connections  no on my word replied lovel  i have little sympathy for that folly said taffrilindeed i cannot be supposed to have any for speaking of my relations i may be said to have come myself from before the mast and i believe i shall very soon form a connection which the world will think low enough with a very amiable girl to whom i have been attached since we were nextdoor neighbours at a time when i little thought of the good fortune which has brought me forward in the service  i assure you mr taffril replied lovel whatever were the rank of my parents i should never think of concealing it from a spirit of petty pride but i am so situated at present that i cannot enter on the subject of my family with any propriety  it is quite enough said the honest sailorgive me your hand ill see you as well through this business as i can though it is but an unpleasant one after allbut what of that our own honour has the next call on us after our countryyou are a lad of spirit and i own i think mr hector mintyre with his long pedigree and his airs of family very much of a jackanapes his father was a soldier of fortune as i am a sailorhe himself i suppose is little better unless just as his uncle pleases and whether one pursues fortune by land or sea makes no great difference i should fancy  none in the universe certainly answered lovel  well said his new ally we will dine together and arrange matters for this rencounter i hope you understand the use of the weapon  not particularly lovel replied  i am sorry for thatmintyre is said to be a marksman  i am sorry for it also said lovel both for his sake and my own i must then in selfdefence take my aim as well as i can  well added taffril i will have our surgeons mate on the fielda good clever young fellow at caulking a shothole i will let lesley who is an honest fellow for a landsman know that he attends for the benefit of either party is there anything i can do for you in case of an accident  i have but little occasion to trouble you said lovel this small billet contains the key of my escritoir and my very brief secret there is one letter in the escritoir digesting a temporary swelling of the heart as he spoke which i beg the favour of you to deliver with your own hand  i understand said the sailor nay my friend never be ashamed for the matteran affectionate heart may overflow for an instant at the eyes if the ship were clearing for action and depend on it whatever your injunctions are dan taffril will regard them like the bequest of a dying brother but this is all stuffwe must get our things in fighting order and you will dine with me and my little surgeons mate at the graemesarms over the way at four oclock  agreed said lovel  agreed said taffril and the whole affair was arranged  it was a beautiful summer evening and the shadow of the solitary thorntree was lengthening upon the short greensward of the narrow valley which was skirted by the woods that closed around the ruins of st ruth    supposed to have been suggested by the old abbey of arbroath in  forfarshire  illustration st ruth arbroath abbey  lovel and lieutenant taffril with the surgeon came upon the ground with a purpose of a nature very uncongenial to the soft mild and pacific character of the hour and scene the sheep which during the ardent heat of the day had sheltered in the breaches and hollows of the gravelly bank or under the roots of the aged and stunted trees had now spread themselves upon the face of the hill to enjoy their evenings pasture and bleated to each other with that melancholy sound which at once gives life to a landscape and marks its solitudetaffril and lovel came on in deep conference having for fear of discovery sent their horses back to the town by the lieutenants servant the opposite party had not yet appeared on the field but when they came upon the ground there sat upon the roots of the old thorn a figure as vigorous in his decay as the mossgrown but strong and contorted boughs which served him for a canopy it was old ochiltree this is embarrassing enough said lovelhow shall we get rid of this old fellow  here father adam cried taffril who knew the mendicant of yoreheres halfacrown for you you must go to the four horseshoes yonderthe little inn you know and inquire for a servant with blue and yellow livery if he is not come youll wait for him and tell him we shall be with his master in about an hours time at any rate wait there till we come backandget off with youcome come weigh anchor  i thank ye for your awmous said ochiltree pocketing the piece of money but i beg your pardon mr taffrili canna gang your errand een now  why not man what can hinder you  i wad speak a word wi young mr lovel  with me answered lovel what would you say with me come say on and be brief  the mendicant led him a few paces aside are ye indebted onything to the laird o monkbarns  indebtedno not iwhat of thatwhat makes you think so  ye maun ken i was at the shirras the day for god help me i gang about a gates like the troubled spirit and wha suld come whirling there in a postchaise but monkbarns in an unco carfufflenow its no a little thing that will make his honour take a chaise and posthorse twa days rinnin  well well but what is all this to me  ou yese hear yese hear weel monkbarns is closeted wi the shirra whatever puir folk may be left thereoutye needna doubt thatthe gentlemen are aye unco civil amang themsells  for heavens sake my old friend  canna ye bid me gang to the deevil at ance mr lovel it wad be mair purpose faard than to speak o heaven in that impatient gate  but i have private business with lieutenant taffril here  weel weel a in gude time said the beggari can use a little wee bit freedom wi mr daniel taffrilmonys the peery and the tap i worked for him langsyne for i was a worker in wood as weel as a tinkler  you are either mad adam or have a mind to drive me mad  nane o the twa said edie suddenly changing his manner from the protracted drawl of the mendicant to a brief and decided tone the shirra sent for his clerk and as the lad is rather light o the tongue i fand it was for drawing a warrant to apprehend youi thought it had been on a fugie warrant for debt for a body kens the laird likes naebody to pit his hand in his pouchbut now i may haud my tongue for i see the mintyre lad and mr lesley coming up and i guess that monkbarnss purpose was very kind and that yours is muckle waur than it should be  the antagonist now approached and saluted with the stern civility which befitted the occasion what has this old fellow to do here said mintyre  i am an auld fallow said edie but i am also an auld soldier o your fathers for i served wi him in the 42d  serve where you please you have no title to intrude on us said mintyre orand he lifted his cane in terrorem though without the idea of touching the old man  but ochiltrees courage was roused by the insult haud down your switch captain mintyre i am an auld soldier as i said before and ill take muckle frae your fathers son but no a touch o the wand while my pikestaff will haud thegither  well well i was wrongi was wrong said mintyre heres a crown for yougo your wayswhats the matter now  the old man drew himself up to the full advantage of his uncommon height and in despite of his dress which indeed had more of the pilgrim than the ordinary beggar looked from height manner and emphasis of voice and gesture rather like a grey palmer or eremite preacher the ghostly counsellor of the young men who were around him than the object of their charity his speech indeed was as homely as his habit but as bold and unceremonious as his erect and dignified demeanour what are ye come here for young men he said addressing himself to the surprised audience are ye come amongst the most lovely works of god to break his laws have ye left the works of man the houses and the cities that are but clay and dust like those that built themand are ye come here among the peaceful hills and by the quiet waters that will last whiles aught earthly shall endure to destroy each others lives that will have but an unco short time by the course of nature to make up a lang account at the close ot o sirs hae ye brothers sisters fathers that hae tended ye and mothers that hae travailed for ye friends that hae cad ye like a piece o their ain heart and is this the way ye tak to make them childless and brotherless and friendless ohon its an ill feight whar he that wins has the warst ot think ont bairns im a puir manbut im an auld man tooand what my poverty takes awa frae the weight o my counsel grey hairs and a truthfu heart should add it twenty times gang hame gang hame like gude ladsthe french will be ower to harry us ane o thae days and yell hae feighting eneugh and maybe auld edie will hirple out himsell if he can get a fealdyke to lay his gun ower and may live to tell you whilk o ye does the best where theres a good cause afore ye  there was something in the undaunted and independent manner hardy sentiment and manly rude elocution of the old man that had its effect upon the party and particularly on the seconds whose pride was uninterested in bringing the dispute to a bloody arbitrament and who on the contrary eagerly watched for an opportunity to recommend reconciliation  upon my word mr lesley said taffril old adam speaks like an oracle our friends here were very angry yesterday and of course very foolishtoday they should be cool or at least we must be so in their behalf i think the word should be forget and forgive on both sidesthat we should all shake hands fire these foolish crackers in the air and go home to sup in a body at the graemesarms  i would heartily recommend it said lesley for amidst a great deal of heat and irritation on both sides i confess myself unable to discover any rational ground of quarrel  gentlemen said mintyre very coldly all this should have been thought of before in my opinion persons that have carried this matter so far as we have done and who should part without carrying it any farther might go to supper at the graemesarms very joyously but would rise the next morning with reputations as ragged as our friend here who has obliged us with a rather unnecessary display of his oratory i speak for myself that i find myself bound to call upon you to proceed without more delay  and i said lovel as i never desired any have also to request these gentlemen to arrange preliminaries as fast as possible  bairns bairns cried old ochiltree but perceiving he was no longer attended tomadmen i should saybut your blood be on your heads and the old man drew off from the ground which was now measured out by the seconds and continued muttering and talking to himself in sullen indignation mixed with anxiety and with a strong feeling of painful curiosity without paying farther attention to his presence or remonstrances mr lesley and the lieutenant made the necessary arrangements for the duel and it was agreed that both parties should fire when mr lesley dropped his handkerchief  the fatal sign was given and both fired almost in the same moment captain mintyres ball grazed the side of his opponent but did not draw blood that of lovel was more true to the aim mintyre reeled and fell raising himself on his arm his first exclamation was it is nothingit is nothinggive us the other pistols but in an instant he said in a lower tone i believe i have enoughand whats worse i fear i deserve it mr lovel or whatever your name is fly and save yourselfbear all witness i provoked this matter then raising himself again on his arm he added shake hands loveli believe you to be a gentlemanforgive my rudeness and i forgive you my deathmy poor sister  the surgeon came up to perform his part of the tragedy and lovel stood gazing on the evil of which he had been the active though unwilling cause with a dizzy and bewildered eye he was roused from his trance by the grasp of the mendicant why stand you gazing on your deedwhats doomed is doomedwhats done is past recalling but awa awa if ye wad save your young blood from a shamefu deathi see the men out by yonder that are come ower late to part yebut out and alack sune eneugh and ower sune to drag ye to prison  he is righthe is right exclaimed taffril you must not attempt to get on the highroadget into the wood till night my brig will be under sail by that time and at three in the morning when the tide will serve i shall have the boat waiting for you at the musselcrag awayaway for heavens sake  o yes fly fly repeated the wounded man his words faltering with convulsive sobs  come with me said the mendicant almost dragging him off the captains plan is the bestill carry ye to a place where ye might be concealed in the meantime were they to seek ye wi sleuthhounds  go go again urged lieutenant taffrilto stay here is mere madness  it was worse madness to have come hither said lovel pressing his handbut farewell and he followed ochiltree into the recesses of the wood     chapter twentyfirst                        the lord abbot had a soul                subtile and quick and searching as the fire                by magic stairs he went as deep as hell                and if in devils possession gold be kept          he brought some sure from thencetis hid in caves                         known save to me to none                                    the wonder of a kingdome  lovel almost mechanically followed the beggar who led the way with a hasty and steady pace through bush and bramble avoiding the beaten path and often turning to listen whether there were any sounds of pursuit behind them they sometimes descended into the very bed of the torrent sometimes kept a narrow and precarious path that the sheep which with the sluttish negligence towards property of that sort universal in scotland were allowed to stray in the copse had made along the very verge of its overhanging banks from time to time lovel had a glance of the path which he had traversed the day before in company with sir arthur the antiquary and the young ladies dejected embarrassed and occupied by a thousand inquietudes as he then was what would he now have given to regain the sense of innocence which alone can counterbalance a thousand evils yet then such was his hasty and involuntary reflection even then guiltless and valued by all around me i thought myself unhappy what am i now with this young mans blood upon my handsthe feeling of pride which urged me to the deed has now deserted me as the actual fiend himself is said to do those whom he has tempted to guilt even his affection for miss wardour sunk for the time before the first pangs of remorse and he thought he could have encountered every agony of slighted love to have had the conscious freedom from bloodguiltiness which he possessed in the morning  these painful reflections were not interrupted by any conversation on the part of his guide who threaded the thicket before him now holding back the sprays to make his path easy now exhorting him to make haste now muttering to himself after the custom of solitary and neglected old age words which might have escaped lovels ear even had he listened to them or which apprehended and retained were too isolated to convey any connected meaninga habit which may be often observed among people of the old mans age and calling  at length as lovel exhausted by his late indisposition the harrowing feelings by which he was agitated and the exertion necessary to keep up with his guide in a path so rugged began to flag and fall behind two or three very precarious steps placed him on the front of a precipice overhung with brushwood and copse here a cave as narrow in its entrance as a foxearth was indicated by a small fissure in the rock screened by the boughs of an aged oak which anchored by its thick and twisted roots in the upper part of the cleft flung its branches almost straight outward from the cliff concealing it effectually from all observation it might indeed have escaped the attention even of those who had stood at its very opening so uninviting was the portal at which the beggar entered but within the cavern was higher and more roomy cut into two separate branches which intersecting each other at right angles formed an emblem of the cross and indicated the abode of an anchoret of former times there are many caves of the same kind in different parts of scotland i need only instance those of gorton near rosslyn in a scene well known to the admirers of romantic nature  the light within the eave was a dusky twilight at the entrance which failed altogether in the inner recesses few folks ken o this place said the old man to the best omy knowledge theres just twa living by mysell and thats jingling jock and the lang linker i have had mony a thought that when i fand mysell auld and forfairn and no able to enjoy gods blessed air ony langer i wad drag mysell here wi a pickle aitmeal and see theres a bit bonny dropping well that popples that selfsame gate simmer and winterand i wad een streek mysell out here and abide my removal like an auld dog that trails its useless ugsome carcass into some bush or bracken no to gie living things a scunner wi the sight ot when its deaday and then when the dogs barked at the lone farmstead the gudewife wad cry whisht stirra thatll be auld edie and the bits o weans wad up puir things and toddle to the door to pu in the auld bluegown that mends a their bonnydiesbut there wad be nae mair word o edie i trow  he then led lovel who followed him unresistingly into one of the interior branches of the cave here he said is a bit turnpikestair that gaes up to the auld kirk abune some folks say this place was howkit out by the monks lang syne to hide their treasure in and some said that they used to bring things into the abbey this gate by night that they durstna sae weel hae brought in by the main port and in open dayand some said that ane o them turned a saint or aiblins wad hae had folk think sae and settled him down in this saint ruths cell as the auld folks aye cad it and garrd big the stair that he might gang up to the kirk when they were at the divine service the laird o monkbarns wad hae a hantle to say about it as he has about maist things if he kend only about the place but whether it was made for mans devices or gods service i have seen ower muckle sin done in it in my day and far ower muckle have i been partaker ofay even here in this dark cove mony a gudewifes been wondering what for the red cock didna craw her up in the morning when hes been roasting puir fallow in this dark holeand ohon i wish that and the like o that had been the warst ot whiles they wad hae heard the din we were making in the very bowels o the earth when sanders aikwood that was forester in thae days the father o ringan that now is was gaun daundering about the wood at een to see after the lairds game and whiles he wad hae seen a glance o the light frae the door o the cave flaughtering against the hazels on the other bankand then siccan stories as sanders had about the worricows and gyrecarlins that haunted about the auld was at een and the lights that he had seen and the cries that he had heard when there was nae mortal ee open but his ain and eh as he wad thrum them ower and ower to the like o me ayont the ingle at een and as i wad gie the auld silly carle grane for grane and tale for tale though i kend muckle better about it than ever he did ay aythey were daft days thaebut they were a vanity and waurand its fitting that they wha hae led a light and evil life and abused charity when they were young suld aiblins come to lack it when they are auld  while ochiltree was thus recounting the exploits and tricks of his earlier life with a tone in which glee and compunction alternately predominated his unfortunate auditor had sat down upon the hermits seat hewn out of the solid rock and abandoned himself to that lassitude both of mind and body which generally follows a course of events that have agitated both the effect of his late indisposition which had much weakened his system contributed to this lethargic despondency the puir bairn said auld edie an he sleeps in this damp hole hell maybe wauken nae mair or catch some sair disease its no the same to him as to the like o us that can sleep ony gate an anes our wames are fu sit up maister lovel lad after as come and gane i dare say the captainlad will do weel eneughand after a ye are no the first that has had this misfortune i hae seen mony a man killed and helped to kill them mysell though there was nae quarrel between usand if it isna wrang to kill folk we have nae quarrel wi just because they wear another sort of a cockade and speak a foreign language i canna see but a man may have excuse for killing his ain mortal foe that comes armed to the fair field to kill him i dinna say its rightgod forbidor that it isna sinfu to take away what ye canna restore and thats the breath of man whilk is in his nostrils but i say it is a sin to be forgiven if its repented of sinfu men are we a but if ye wad believe an auld grey sinner that has seen the evil o his ways there is as much promise atween the twa boards o the testament as wad save the warst o us could we but think sae  with such scraps of comfort and of divinity as he possessed the mendicant thus continued to solicit and compel the attention of lovel until the twilight began to fade into night now said ochiltree i will carry ye to a mair convenient place where i hae sat mony a time to hear the howlit crying out of the ivy tod and to see the moonlight come through the auld windows o the ruins there can be naebody come here after this time o night and if they hae made ony search thae blackguard shirraofficers and constables it will hae been ower lang syne od they are as great cowards as ither folk wi a their warrants and kings keysi hae gien some o them a gliff in my day when they were coming rather ower near mebut lauded be grace for it they canna stir me now for ony waur than an auld man and a beggar and my badge is a gude protection and then miss isabella wardour is a tower o strength ye kenlovel sighedaweel dinna be cast downbowls may a row right yetgie the lassie time to ken her mind shes the wale o the country for beauty and a gude friend o minei gang by the bridewell as safe as by the kirk on a sabbathdeil ony o them daur hurt a hair o auld edies head now i keep the crown o the causey when i gae to the borough and rub shouthers wi a bailie wi as little concern as an he were a brock   the kings keys are in law phrase the crowbars and hammers used to force doors and locks in execution of the kings warrant  while the mendicant spoke thus he was busied in removing a few loose stones in one angle of the eave which obscured the entrance of the staircase of which he had spoken and led the way into it followed by lovel in passive silence  the airs free eneugh said the old man the monks took care o that for they werena a langbreathed generation i reckon they hae contrived queer tirliewirlie holes that gang out to the open air and keep the stair as caller as a kailblade  lovel accordingly found the staircase well aired and though narrow it was neither ruinous nor long but speedily admitted them into a narrow gallery contrived to run within the side wall of the chancel from which it received air and light through apertures ingeniously hidden amid the florid ornaments of the gothic architecture  this secret passage ance gaed round great part o the biggin said the beggar and through the wa o the place ive heard monkbarns ca the refractory meaning probably refectory and so awa to the priors ain house its like he could use it to listen what the monks were saying at mealtimeand then he might come ben here and see that they were busy skreighing awa wi the psalms doun below there and then when he saw a was right and tight he might step awa and fetch in a bonnie lass at the cove yonderfor they were queer hands the monks unless mony lees is made on them but our folk were at great pains lang syne to big up the passage in some parts and pu it down in others for fear o some uncanny body getting into it and finding their way down to the cove it wad hae been a fashious job thatby my certie some o our necks wad hae been ewking  they now came to a place where the gallery was enlarged into a small circle sufficient to contain a stone seat a niche constructed exactly before it projected forward into the chancel and as its sides were latticed as it were with perforated stonework it commanded a full view of the chancel in every direction and was probably constructed as edie intimated to be a convenient watchtower from which the superior priest himself unseen might watch the behaviour of his monks and ascertain by personal inspection their punctual attendance upon those rites of devotion which his rank exempted him from sharing with them as this niche made one of a regular series which stretched along the wall of the chancel and in no respect differed from the rest when seen from below the secret station screened as it was by the stone figure of st michael and the dragon and the open tracery around the niche was completely hid from observation the private passage confined to its pristine breadth had originally continued beyond this seat but the jealous precautions of the vagabonds who frequented the cave of st ruth had caused them to build it carefully up with hewn stones from the ruin  we shall be better here said edie seating himself on the stone bench and stretching the lappet of his blue gown upon the spot when he motioned lovel to sit down beside himwe shall be better here than doun below the airs free and mild and the savour of the wallflowers and siccan shrubs as grow on thae ruined was is far mair refreshing than the damp smell doun below yonder they smell sweetest by nighttime thae flowers and theyre maist aye seen about rained buildings now maister lovel can ony o you scholars gie a gude reason for that  lovel replied in the negative  i am thinking resumed the beggar that theyll be like mony folks gude gifts that often seem maist gracious in adversityor maybe its a parable to teach us no to slight them that are in the darkness of sin and the decay of tribulation since god sends odours to refresh the mirkest hour and flowers and pleasant bushes to clothe the ruined buildings and now i wad like a wise man to tell me whether heaven is maist pleased wi the sight we are looking uponthae pleasant and quiet lang streaks o moonlight that are lying sae still on the floor o this auld kirk and glancing through the great pillars and stanchions o the carved windows and just dancing like on the leaves o the dark ivy as the breath o wind shakes iti wonder whether this is mair pleasing to heaven than when it was lighted up wi lamps and candles nae doubt and roughies and wi the mirth and the frankincent that they speak of in the holy scripture and wi organs assuredly and men and women singers and sackbuts and dulcimers and a instruments o musici wonder if that was acceptable or whether it is of these grand parafle o ceremonies that holy writ says it is an abomination to me   links or torches  i am thinking maister lovel if twa puir contrite spirits like yours and mine fand grace to make our petition  here lovel laid his hand eagerly on the mendicants arm sayinghush i heard some one speak  i am dull o hearing answered edie in a whisper but were surely safe herewhere was the sound  lovel pointed to the door of the chancel which highly ornamented occupied the west end of the building surmounted by the carved window which let in a flood of moonlight over it  they can be nane o our folk said edie in the same low and cautious tone theres but twa o them kens o the place and theyre mony a mile off if they are still bound on their weary pilgrimage ill never think its the officers here at this time o night i am nae believer in auld wives stories about ghaists though this is gey like a place for thembut mortal or of the other world here they cometwa men and a light  and in very truth while the mendicant spoke two human figures darkened with their shadows the entrance of the chancelwhich had before opened to the moonlit meadow beyond and the small lantern which one of them displayed glimmered pale in the clear and strong beams of the moon as the evening star does among the lights of the departing day the first and most obvious idea was that despite the asseverations of edie ochiltree the persons who approached the ruins at an hour so uncommon must be the officers of justice in quest of lovel but no part of their conduct confirmed the suspicion a touch and a whisper from the old man warned lovel that his best course was to remain quiet and watch their motions from their present place of concealment should anything appear to render retreat necessary they had behind them the private staircase and cavern by means of which they could escape into the wood long before any danger of close pursuit they kept themselves therefore as still as possible and observed with eager and anxious curiosity every accent and motion of these nocturnal wanderers  after conversing together some time in whispers the two figures advanced into the middle of the chancel and a voice which lovel at once recognised from its tone and dialect to be that of dousterswivel pronounced in a louder but still a smothered tone indeed mine goot sir dere cannot be one finer hour nor season for dis great purpose you shall see mine goot sir dat it is all one bibblebabble dat mr oldenbuck says and dat he knows no more of what he speaks than one little child mine soul he expects to get as rich as one jew for his poor dirty one hundred pounds which i care no more about by mine honest wort than i care for an hundred stivers but to you my most munificent and reverend patron i will show all de secrets dat art can showay de secret of de great pymander  illustration the ruins of st ruth  that other ane whispered edie maun be according to a likelihood sir arthur wardouri ken naebody but himsell wad come here at this time at een wi that german blackguardane wad think hes bewitched himhe gars him een trow that chalk is cheese lets see what they can be doing  this interruption and the low tone in which sir arthur spoke made lovel lose all sir arthurs answer to the adept excepting the last three emphatic words very great expense to which dousterswivel at once repliedexpensesto be suredere must be de great expenses you do not expect to reap before you do sow de seed de expense is de seedde riches and de mine of goot metal and now de great big chests of plate they are de cropvary goot crop too on mine wort now sir arthur you have sowed

because dere is a thwarting power in de house of ascendency  but dousterswivel said the simple baronet does not this look like magici am a true though unworthy son of the episcopal church and i will have nothing to do with the foul fiend  bah bahnot a bit magic in it at allnot a bitit is all founded on de planetary influence and de sympathy and force of numbers i will show you much finer dan dis i do not say dere is not de spirit in it because of de suffumigation but if you are not afraid he shall not be invisible  i have no curiosity to see him at all said the baronet whose courage seemed from a certain quaver in his accent to have taken a fit of the ague  dat is great pity said dousterswivel i should have liked to show you de spirit dat guard dis treasure like one fierce watchdogbut i know how to manage himyou would not care to see him  not at all answered the baronet in a tone of feigned indifference i think we have but little time  you shall pardon me my patron it is not yet twelve and twelve precise is just our planetary hours and i could show you de spirit vary well in de meanwhile just for pleasure you see i would draw a pentagon within a circle which is no trouble at

circle be no quite just or de beholder be de frightened coward and not hold de sword firm and straight towards him de great hunter will take his advantage and drag him exorcist out of de circle and throttle him dat does happens  well then dousterswivel with every confidence in my courage and your skill we will dispense with this apparition and go on to the business of the night  with all mine heartit is just one thing to meand now it is de timehold you de sword till i kindle de little what you call chip  dousterswivel accordingly set fire to a little pile of chips touched and prepared with some bituminous substance to make them burn fiercely and when the flame was at the highest and lightened with its shortlived glare all the ruins around the german flung in a handful of perfumes which produced a strong and pungent odour the exorcist and his pupil both were so much affected as to cough and sneeze heartily and as the vapour floated around the pillars of the building and penetrated every crevice it produced the same effect on the beggar and lovel  was that an echo said the baronet astonished at the sternutation which resounded from above ordrawing close to the adept can it be the spirit you talked of ridiculing our attempt upon his hidden treasures  nnno muttered the german who began to partake of his pupils terrors i hope not  here a violent of sneezing which the mendicant was unable to suppress and which could not be considered by any means as the dying fall of an echo accompanied by a grunting halfsmothered cough confounded the two treasureseekers lord have mercy on us said the baronet  alle guten geistern loben den herrn ejaculated the terrified adept i was begun to think he continued after a moments silence that this would be de bestermost done in de daylightwe was bestermost to go away just now  you juggling villain said the baronet in whom these expressions awakened a suspicion that overcame his terrors connected as it was with the sense of desperation arising from the apprehension of impending ruinyou juggling mountebank this is some legerdemain trick of yours to get off from the performance of your promise as you have so often done before but before heaven i will this night know what i have trusted to when i suffered you to fool me on to my ruin go on thencome fairy come fiend you shall show me that treasure or confess yourself a knave and an impostor or by the faith of a desperate and ruined man ill send you where you shall see spirits enough  the treasurefinder trembling between his terror for the supernatural beings by whom he supposed himself to be surrounded and for his life which seemed to be at the mercy of a desperate man could only bring out mine patron this is not the allerbestmost usage consider mine honoured sir that de spirits  here edie who began to enter into the humour of the scene uttered an extraordinary howl being an exaltation and a prolongation of the most deplorable whine in which he was accustomed to solicit charity  dousterswivel flung himself on his kneesdear sir arthurs let us go or let me go  no you cheating scoundrel said the knight unsheathing the sword which he had brought for the purposes of the exorcism that shift shall not serve youmonkbarns warned me long since of your juggling pranksi will see this treasure before you leave this place or i will have you confess yourself an impostor or by heaven ill run this sword through you though all the spirits of the dead should rise around us  for de lofe of heaven be patient mine honoured patron and you shall hafe all de treasure as i knows ofyes you shall indeedbut do not speak about de spiritsit makes dem angry  edie ochiltree here prepared himself to throw in another groan but was restrained by lovel who began to take a more serious interest as he observed the earnest and almost desperate demeanour of sir arthur dousterswivel having at once before his eyes the fear of the foul fiend and the violence of sir arthur played his part of a conjuror extremely ill hesitating to assume the degree of confidence necessary to deceive the latter lest it should give offence to the invisible cause of his alarm however after rolling his eyes muttering and sputtering german exorcisms with contortions of his face and person rather flowing from the impulse of terror than of meditated fraud he at length proceeded to a corner of the building where a flat stone lay upon the ground bearing upon its surface the effigy of an armed warrior in a recumbent posture carved in basrelief he muttered to sir arthur mine patrons it is heregot save us all  sir arthur who after the first moment of his superstitious fear was over seemed to have bent up all his faculties to the pitch of resolution necessary to carry on the adventure lent the adept his assistance to turn over the stone which by means of a lever that the adept had provided their joint force with difficulty effected no supernatural light burst forth from below to indicate the subterranean treasury nor was there any apparition of spirits earthly or infernal but when dousterswivel had with great trepidation struck a few strokes with a mattock and as hastily thrown out a shovelful or two of earth for they came provided with the tools necessary for digging something was heard to ring like the sound of a falling piece of metal and dousterswivel hastily catching up the substance which produced it and which his shovel had thrown out along with the earth exclaimed on mine dear wort mine patrons dis is allit is indeed i mean all we can do tonightand he gazed round him with a cowering and fearful glance as if to see from what corner the avenger of his imposture was to start forth  let me see it said sir arthur and then repeated still more sternly i will be satisfiedi will judge by mine own eyes he accordingly held the object to the light of the lantern it was a small case or casketfor lovel could not at the distance exactly discern its shape which from the baronets exclamation as he opened it he concluded was filled with coin ay said the baronet this is being indeed in good luck and if it omens proportional success upon a larger venture the venture shall be made that six hundred of goldiewords added to the other incumbent claims must have been ruin indeed if you think we can parry it by repeating this experimentsuppose when the moon next changesi will hazard the necessary advance come by it how i may  oh mine good patrons do not speak about all dat said dousterswivel as just now but help me to put de shtone to de rights and let us begone our own ways and accordingly so soon as the stone was replaced he hurried sir arthur who was now resigned once more to his guidance away from a spot where the germans guilty conscience and superstitious fears represented goblins as lurking behind each pillar with the purpose of punishing his treachery  saw onybody eer the like o that said edie when they had disappeared like shadows through the gate by which they had enteredsaw ony creature living eer the like o thatbut what can we do for that puir doited deevil of a knightbaronet od he showed muckle mair spunk too than i thought had been in himi thought he wad hae sent cauld iron through the vagabondsir arthur wasna half sae bauld at bessiesapron yon nightbut then his blood was up even now and that makes an unco difference i hae seen mony a man wad hae felled another an anger him that wadna muckle hae liked a clink against crummieshorn yon time but whats to be done  i suppose said lovel his faith in this fellow is entirely restored by this deception which unquestionably he had arranged beforehand  what the silleray aytrust him for thatthey that hide ken best where to find he wants to wile him out o his last guinea and then escape to his ain country the landlouper i wad likeit weel just to hae come in at the clippingtime and gien him a lounder wi my pikestaff he wad hae taen it for a bennison frae some o the auld dead abbots but its best no to be rash sticking disna gang by strength but by the guiding o the gally ise be upsides wi him ae day  what if you should inform mr oldbuck said lovel  ou i dinna kenmonkbarns and sir arthur are like and yet theyre no like neither monkbarns has whiles influence wi him and whiles sir arthur cares as little about him as about the like o me monkbarns is no that ower wise himsell in some thingshe wad believe a bodle to be an auld roman coin as he cas it or a ditch to be a camp upon ony leasing that idle folk made about it i hae garrd him trow mony a queer tale mysell gude forgie me but wi a that he has unco little sympathy wi ither folks and hes snell and dure eneugh in casting up their nonsense to them as if he had nane o his ain hell listen the hale day an yell tell him about tales o wallace and blind harry and davie lindsay but ye maunna speak to him about ghaists or fairies or spirits walking the earth or the like o thathe had amaist flung auld caxon out o the window and he might just as weel hae flung awa his best wig after him for threeping he had seen a ghaist at the humlockknowe now if he was taking it up in this way he wad set up the tothers birse and maybe do mair ill nor gudehes done that twice or thrice about thae minewarks ye wad thought sir arthur had a pleasure in gaun on wi them the deeper the mair he was warned against it by monkbarns  what say you then said lovel to letting miss wardour know the circumstance  ou puir thing how could she stop her father doing his pleasureand besides what wad it help theres a sough in the country about that six hundred pounds and theres a writer chield in edinburgh has been driving the spurrowels o the law up to the head into sir arthurs sides to gar him pay it and if he canna he maun gang to jail or flee the country hes like a desperate man and just catches at this chance as a he has left to escape utter perdition so what signifies plaguing the puir lassie about what canna be helped and besides to say the truth i wadna like to tell the secret o this place its unco convenient ye see yoursell to hae a hidinghole o anes ain and though i be out o the line o needing ane een now and trust in the power o grace that ill neer do onything to need ane again yet naebody kens what temptation ane may be gien ower toand to be brief i downa bide the thought of anybody kennin about the placethey say keep a thing seven year an yell aye find a use fortand maybe i may need the cove either for mysell or for some ither body  this argument in which edie ochiltree notwithstanding his scraps of morality and of divinity seemed to take perhaps from old habit a personal interest could not be handsomely controverted by lovel who was at that moment reaping the benefit of the secret of which the old man appeared to be so jealous  this incident however was of great service to lovel as diverting his mind from the unhappy occurrence of the evening and considerably rousing the energies which had been stupefied by the first view of his calamity he reflected that it by no means necessarily followed that a dangerous wound must be a fatal onethat he had been hurried from the spot even before the surgeon had expressed any opinion of captain mintyres situationand that he had duties on earth to perform even should the very worst be true which if they could not restore his peace of mind or sense of innocence would furnish a motive for enduring existence and at the same time render it a course of active benevolencesuch were lovels feelings when the hour arrived when according to edies calculationwho by some train or process of his own in observing the heavenly bodies stood independent of the assistance of a watch or timekeeperit was fitting they should leave their hidingplace and betake themselves to the seashore in order to meet lieutenant taffrils boat according to appointment  they retreated by the same passage which had admitted them to the priors secret seat of observation and when they issued from the grotto into the wood the birds which began to chirp and even to sing announced that the dawn was advanced this was confirmed by the light and amber clouds that appeared over the sea as soon as their exit from the copse permitted them to view the horizonmorning said to be friendly to the muses has probably obtained this character from its effect upon the fancy and feelings of mankind even to those who like lovel have spent a sleepless and anxious night the breeze of the dawn brings strength and quickening both of mind and body it was therefore with renewed health and vigour that lovel guided by the trusty mendicant brushed away the dew as he traversed the downs which divided the den of st ruth as the woods surrounding the ruins were popularly called from the seashore  the first level beam of the sun as his brilliant disk began to emerge from the ocean shot full upon the little gunbrig which was lyingto in the offingclose to the shore the boat was already waiting taffril himself with his naval cloak wrapped about him seated in the stern he jumped ashore when he saw the mendicant and lovel approach and shaking the latter heartily by the hand begged him not to be cast down mintyres wound he said was doubtful but far from desperate his attention had got lovels baggage privately sent on board the brig and he said he trusted that if lovel chose to stay with the vessel the penalty of a short cruise would be the only disagreeable consequence of his rencontre as for himself his time and motions were a good deal at his own disposal he said excepting the necessary obligation of remaining on his station  we will talk of our farther motions said lovel as we go on board  then turning to edie he endeavoured to put money into his hand i think said edie as he tendered it back again the hale folk here have either gane daft or they hae made a vow to rain my trade as they say ower muckle water drowns the miller i hae had mair gowd offered me within this twa or three weeks than i ever saw in my life afore keep the siller ladyell hae need ot ise warrant ye and i hae nane my claes is nae great things and i get a blue gown every year and as mony siller groats as the king god bless him is years auldyou and i serve the same master ye ken captain taffril theres rigging provided forand my meat and drink i get for the asking in my rounds or at an orra time i can gang a day without it for i make it a rule never to pay for naneso that a the siller i need is just to buy tobacco and sneeshin and maybe a dram at a time in a cauld day though i am nae dramdrinker to be a gaberlunziesae take back your gowd and just gie me a lilywhite shilling  upon these whims which he imagined intimately connected with the honour of his vagabond profession edie was flint and adamant not to be moved by rhetoric or entreaty and therefore lovel was under the necessity of again pocketing his intended bounty and taking a friendly leave of the mendicant by shaking him by the hand and assuring him of his cordial gratitude for the very important services which he had rendered him recommending at the same time secrecy as to what they had that night witnessedye needna doubt that said ochiltree i never telld tales out o yon cove in my life though mony a queer thing i hae seen int  the boat now put off the old man remained looking after it as it made rapidly towards the brig under the impulse of six stout rowers and lovel beheld him again wave his blue bonnet as a token of farewell ere he turned from his fixed posture and began to move slowly along the sands as if resuming his customary perambulations      volume two    contents  chapter first  chapter second  chapter third  chapter fourth

remember where these lines are to be found perhaps in bishop halls satires they occur in book iv satire iii  about a week after the adventures commemorated in our last chapter mr oldbuck descending to his breakfastparlour found that his womankind were not upon duty his toast not made and the silver jug which was wont to receive his libations of mum not duly aired for its reception  this confounded hotbrained boy he said to himself now that he begins to get out of danger i can tolerate this life no longer all goes to sixes and sevensan universal saturnalia seems to be proclaimed in my peaceful and orderly family i ask for my sisterno answer i call i shouti invoke my inmates by more names than the romans gave to their deitiesat length jenny whose shrill voice i have heard this halfhour lilting in the tartarean regions of the kitchen condescends to hear me and reply but without coming up stairs so the conversation must be continued at the top of my lungs here he again began to hollow aloudjenny wheres miss oldbuck  miss grizzys in the captains room  umphi thought soand wheres my niece  miss marys making the captains tea  umph i supposed as much againand wheres caxon  awa to the town about the captains fowlinggun and his settingdog  and who the devils to dress my periwig you silly jadewhen you knew that miss wardour and sir arthur were coming here early after breakfast how could you let caxon go on such a tomfools errand  me what could i hinder himyour honour wadna hae us contradict the captain een now and him maybe deeing  dying said the alarmed antiquaryeh what has he been worse  na hes no nae waur that i ken of   it is i believe a piece of freemasonry or a point of conscience among the scottish lower orders never to admit that a patient is doing better the closest approach to recovery which they can be brought to allow is that the pairty inquired after is nae waur  then he must be betterand what good is a dog and a gun to do here but the one to destroy all my furniture steal from my larder and perhaps worry the cat and the other to shoot somebody through the head he has had gunning and pistolling enough to serve him one while i should think  here miss oldbuck entered the parlour at the door of which oldbuck was carrying on this conversation he bellowing downward to jenny and she again screaming upward in reply  dear brother said the old lady yell cry yoursell as hoarse as a corbieis that the way to skreigh when theres a sick person in the house  upon my word the sick persons like to have all the house to himself i have gone without my breakfast and am like to go without my wig and i must not i suppose presume to say i feel either hunger or cold for fear of disturbing the sick gentleman who lies six rooms off and who feels himself well enough to send for his dog and gun though he knows i detest such implements ever since our elder brother poor williewald marched out of the world on a pair of damp feet caught in the kittlefittingmoss but that signifies nothing i suppose i shall be expected by and by to lend a hand to carry squire hector out upon his litter while he indulges his sportsmanlike propensities by shooting my pigeons or my turkeysi think any of the ferae naturae are safe from him for one while  miss mintyre now entered and began to her usual mornings task of arranging her uncles breakfast with the alertness of one who is too late in setting about a task and is anxious to make up for lost time but this did not avail her take care you silly womankindthat mums too near the firethe bottle will burst and i suppose you intend to reduce the toast to a cinder as a burntoffering for juno or what do you call herthe female dog there with some such pantheon kind of a name that your wise brother has in his first moments of mature reflection ordered up as a fitting inmate of my house i thank him and meet company to aid the rest of the womankind of my household in their daily conversation and intercourse with him  dear uncle dont be angry about the poor spaniel shes been tied up at my brothers lodgings at fairport and shes broke her chain twice and came running down here to him and you would not have us beat the faithful beast away from the doorit moans as if it had some sense of poor hectors misfortune and will hardly stir from the door of his room  why said his uncle they said caxon had gone to fairport after his dog and gun  o dear sir no answered miss mintyre it was to fetch some dressings that were wanted and hector only wished him to bring out his gun as he was going to fairport at any rate  well then it is not altogether so foolish a business considering what a mess of womankind have been about itdressings quothaand who is to dress my wigbut i suppose jenny will undertakecontinued the old bachelor looking at himself in the glassto make it somewhat decent and now let us set to breakfastwith what appetite we may well may i say to hector as sir isaac newton did to his dog diamond when the animal i detest dogs flung down the taper among calculations which had occupied the philosopher for twenty years and consumed the whole mass of materialsdiamond diamond thou little knowest the mischief thou hast done  i assure you sir replied his niece my brother is quite sensible of the rashness of his own behaviour and allows that mr lovel behaved very handsomely  and much good that will do when he has frightened the lad out of the country i tell thee mary hectors understanding and far more that of feminity is inadequate to comprehend the extent of the loss which he has occasioned to the present age and to posterityaureum quidem opusa poem on such a subject with notes illustrative of all that is clear and all that is dark and all that is neither dark nor clear but hovers in dusky twilight in the region of caledonian antiquities i would have made the celtic panegyrists look about them fingal as they conceitedly term finmaccoul should have disappeared before my search rolling himself in his cloud like the spirit of loda such an opportunity can hardly again occur to an ancient and greyhaired man and to see it lost by the madcap spleen of a hotheaded boy but i submitheavens will be done  thus continued the antiquary to maunder as his sister expressed it during the whole time of breakfast while despite of sugar and honey and all the comforts of a scottish morning teatable his reflections rendered the meal bitter to all who heard them but they knew the nature of the man monkbarnss bark said miss griselda oldbuck in confidential intercourse with miss rebecca blattergowl is muckle waur than his bite  in fact mr oldbuck had suffered in mind extremely while his nephew was in actual danger and now felt himself at liberty upon his returning health to indulge in complaints respecting the trouble he had been put to and the interruption of his antiquarian labours listened to therefore in respectful silence by his niece and sister he unloaded his discontent in such grumblings as we have rehearsed venting many a sarcasm against womankind soldiers dogs and guns all which implements of noise discord and tumult as he called them he professed to hold in utter abomination  this expectoration of spleen was suddenly interrupted by the noise of a carriage without when shaking off all sullenness at the sound oldbuck ran nimbly up stairs and down stairs for both operations were necessary ere he could receive miss wardour and her father at the door of his mansion  a cordial greeting passed on both sides and sir arthur referring to his previous inquiries by letter and message requested to be particularly informed of captain mintyres health  better than he deserves was the answerbetter than he deserves for disturbing us with his vixen brawls and breaking gods peace and the kings  the young gentleman sir arthur said had been imprudent but he understood they were indebted to him for the detection of a suspicious character in the young man lovel  no more suspicious than his own answered the antiquary eager in his favourites defencethe young gentleman was a little foolish and headstrong and refused to answer hectors impertinent interrogatories that is all lovel sir arthur knows how to choose his confidants betteray miss wardour you may look at mebut it is very trueit was in my bosom that he deposited the secret cause of his residence at fairport and no stone should have been left unturned on my part to assist him in the pursuit to which he had dedicated himself  on hearing this magnanimous declaration on the part of the old antiquary miss wardour changed colour more than once and could hardly trust her own ears for of all confidants to be selected as the depositary of love affairsand such she naturally supposed must have been the subject of communicationnext to edie ochiltree oldbuck seemed the most uncouth and extraordinary nor could she sufficiently admire or fret at the extraordinary combination of circumstances which thus threw a secret of such a delicate nature into the possession of persons so unfitted to be entrusted with it she had next to fear the mode of oldbucks entering upon the affair with her father for such she doubted not was his intention she well knew that the honest gentleman however vehement in his prejudices had no great sympathy with those of others and she had to fear a most unpleasant explosion upon an eclaircissement taking place between them it was therefore with great anxiety that she heard her father request a private interview and observed oldbuck readily arise and show the way to his library she remained behind attempting to converse with the ladies of monkbarns but with the distracted feelings of macbeth when compelled to disguise his evil conscience by listening and replying to the observations of the attendant thanes upon the storm of the preceding night while his whole soul is upon the stretch to listen for the alarm of murder which he knows must be instantly raised by those who have entered the sleeping apartment of duncan but the conversation of the two virtuosi turned on a subject very different from that which miss wardour apprehended  mr oldbuck said sir arthur when they had after a due exchange of ceremonies fairly seated themselves in the sanctum sanctorum of the antiquaryyou who know so much of my family matters may probably be surprised at the question i am about to put to you  why sir arthur if it relates to money i am very sorry but  it does relate to money matters mr oldbuck  really then sir arthur continued the antiquary in the present state of the moneymarketand stocks being so low  you mistake my meaning mr oldbuck said the baronet i wished to ask your advice about laying out a large sum of money to advantage  the devil exclaimed the antiquary and sensible that his involuntary ejaculation of wonder was not over and above civil he proceeded to qualify it by expressing his joy that sir arthur should have a sum of money to lay out when the commodity was so scarce and as for the mode of employing it said he pausing the funds are low at present as i said before and there are good bargains of land to be had but had you not better begin by clearing off encumbrances sir arthurthere is the sum in the personal bondand the three notes of hand continued he taking out of the righthand drawer of his cabinet a certain red memorandumbook of which sir arthur from the experience of former frequent appeals to it abhorred the very sightwith the interest thereon amounting altogether tolet me see  to about a thousand pounds said sir arthur hastily you told me the amount the other day  but theres another terms interest due since that sir arthur and it amounts errors excepted to eleven hundred and thirteen pounds seven shillings five pennies and threefourths of a penny sterlingbut look over the summation yourself  i daresay you are quite right my dear sir said the baronet putting away the book with his hand as one rejects the oldfashioned civility that presses food upon you after you have eaten till you nauseate perfectly right i dare say and in the course of three days or less you shall have the full valuethat is if you choose to accept it in bullion  bullion i suppose you mean lead what the deuce have we hit on the vein then at last but what could i do with a thousand pounds worth and upwards of lead the former abbots of trotcosey might have roofed their church and monastery with it indeedbut for me  by bullion said the baronet i mean the precious metalsgold and silver  ay indeedand from what eldorado is this treasure to be imported  not far from hence said sir arthur significantly and naow i think of it you shall see the whole process on one small condition  and what is that craved the antiquary  why it will be necessary for you to give me your friendly assistance by advancing one hundred pounds or thereabouts  mr oldbuck who had already been grasping in idea the sum principal and interest of a debt which he had long regarded as wellnigh desperate was so much astounded at the tables being so unexpectedly turned upon him that he could only reecho in an accent of wo and surprise the words advance one hundred pounds  yes my good sir continued sir arthur but upon the best possible security of being repaid in the course of two or three days  there was a pauseeither oldbucks nether jaw had not recovered its position so as to enable him to utter a negative or his curiosity kept him silent  i would not propose to you continued sir arthur to oblige me thus far if i did not possess actual proofs of the reality of those expectations which i now hold out to you and i assure you mr oldbuck that in entering fully upon this topic it is my purpose to show my confidence in you and my sense of your kindness on many former occasions  mr oldbuck professed his sense of obligation but carefully avoided committing himself by any promise of farther assistance  mr dousterswivel said sir arthur having discovered  here oldbuck broke in his eyes sparkling with indignation sir arthur i have so often warned you of the knavery of that rascally quack that i really wonder you should quote him to me  but listenlisten interrupted sir arthur in his turn it will do you no harm in short dousterswivel persuaded me to witness an experiment which he had made in the ruins of st ruthand what do you think we found  another spring of water i suppose of which the rogue had beforehand taken care to ascertain the situation and source  no indeeda casket of gold and silver coinshere they are  with that sir arthur drew from his pocket a large rams horn with a copper cover containing a considerable quantity of coins chiefly silver but with a few gold pieces intermixed the antiquarys eyes glistened as he eagerly spread them out on the table  upon my wordscotch english and foreign coins of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and some of them rariet rarioresetiam rarissimi here is the bonnetpiece of james v the unicorn of james iiay and the gold festoon of queen mary with her head and the dauphins and these were really found in the ruins of st ruth  most assuredlymy own eyes witnessed it  well replied oldbuck but you must tell me the whenthe wherethe how  the when answered sir arthur was at midnight the last full moonthe where as i have told you in the ruins of st ruths priorythe how was by a nocturnal experiment of dousterswivel accompanied only by myself  indeed said oldbuck and what means of discovery did you employ  only a simple suffumigation said the baronet accompanied by availing ourselves of the suitable planetary hour  simple suffumigation simple nonsensificationplanetary hour planetary fiddlestick sapiens dominabitur astris my dear sir arthur that fellow has made a gull of you above ground and under ground and he would have made a gull of you in the air too if he had been by when you was craned up the devils turnpike yonder at halketheadto be sure the transformation would have been then peculiarly apropos  well mr oldbuck i am obliged to you for your indifferent opinion of my discernment but i think you will give me credit for having seen what i say i saw  certainly sir arthur said the antiquaryto this extent at least that i know sir arthur wardour will not say he saw anything but what he thought he saw  well then replied the baronet as there is a heaven above us mr oldbuck i saw with my own eyes these coins dug out of the chancel of st ruth at midnight and as to dousterswivel although the discovery be owing to his science yet to tell the truth i do not think he would have had firmness of mind to have gone through with it if i had not been beside him  ay indeed said oldbuck in the tone used when one wishes to hear the end of a story before making any comment  yes truly continued sir arthuri assure you i was upon my guardwe did hear some very uncommon sounds that is certain proceeding from among the ruins  oh you did said oldbuck an accomplice hid among them i suppose  not a jot said the baronetthe sounds though of a hideous and preternatural character rather resembled those of a man who sneezes violently than any otherone deep groan i certainly heard besides and dousterswivel assures me that he beheld the spirit peolphan the great hunter of the northlook for him in your nicolaus remigius or petrus thyracus mr oldbuckwho mimicked the motion of snufftaking and its effects  these indications however singular as proceeding from such a personage seem to have been apropos to the matter said the antiquary for you see the case which includes these coins has all the appearance of being an oldfashioned scottish snuffmill but you persevered in spite of the terrors of this sneezing goblin  why i think it probable that a man of inferior sense or consequence might have given way but i was jealous of an imposture conscious of the duty i owed to my family in maintaining my courage under every contingency and therefore i compelled dousterswivel by actual and violent threats to proceed with what he was about to doand sir the proof of his skill and honesty is this parcel of gold and silver pieces out of which i beg you to select such coins or medals as will best suit your collection  why sir arthur since you are so good and on condition you will permit me to mark the value according to pinkertons catalogue and appreciation against your account in my red book i will with pleasure select  nay said sir arthur wardour i do not mean you should consider them as anything but a gift of friendship and least of all would i stand by the valuation of your friend pinkerton who has impugned the ancient and trustworthy authorities upon which as upon venerable and mossgrown pillars the credit of scottish antiquities reposed  ay ay rejoined oldbuck you mean i suppose mair and boece the jachin and boaz not of history but of falsification and forgery and notwithstanding all you have told me i look on your friend dousterswivel to be as apocryphal as any of them  why then mr oldbuck said sir arthur not to awaken old disputes i suppose you think that because i believe in the ancient history of my country i have neither eyes nor ears to ascertain what modern events pass before me  pardon me sir arthur rejoined the antiquary but i consider all the affectation of terror which this worthy gentleman your coadjutor chose to play off as being merely one part of his trick or mystery and with respect to the gold or silver coins they are so mixed and mingled in country and date that i cannot suppose they could be any genuine hoard and rather suppose them to be like the purses upon the table of hudibrass lawyer                         money placed for show                    like nesteggs to make clients lay                    and for his false opinions pay  it is the trick of all professions my dear sir arthur pray may i ask you how much this discovery cost you  about ten guineas  and you have gained what is equivalent to twenty in actual bullion and what may be perhaps worth as much more to such fools as ourselves who are willing to pay for curiosity this was allowing you a tempting profit on the first hazard i must needs admit and what is the next venture he proposes  an hundred and fifty poundsi have given him onethird part of the money and i thought it likely you might assist me with the balance  i should think that this cannot be meant as a parting blowis not of weight and importance sufficient he will probably let us win this hand also as sharpers manage a raw gamestersir arthur i hope you believe i would serve you  certainly mr oldbuck i think my confidence in you on these occasions leaves no room to doubt that  well then allow me to speak to dousterswivel if the money can be advanced usefully and advantageously for you why for old neighbourhoods sake you shall not want it but if as i think i can recover the treasure for you without making such an advance you will i presume have no objection  unquestionably i can have none whatsoever  then where is dousterswivel continued the antiquary  to tell you the truth he is in my carriage below but knowing your prejudice against him  i thank heaven i am not prejudiced against any man sir arthur it is systems not individuals that incur my reprobation he rang the bell jenny sir arthur and i offer our compliments to mr dousterswivel the gentleman in sir arthurs carriage and beg to have the pleasure of speaking with him here  jenny departed and delivered her message it had been by no means a part of the project of dousterswivel to let mr oldbuck into his supposed mystery he had relied upon sir arthurs obtaining the necessary accommodation without any discussion as to the nature of the application and only waited below for the purpose of possessing himself of the deposit as soon as possible for he foresaw that his career was drawing to a close but when summoned to the presence of sir arthur and mr oldbuck he resolved gallantly to put confidence in his powers of impudence of which the reader may have observed his natural share was very liberal     chapter second                            and this doctor              your sooty smokybearded compeer he              will close you so much gold in a bolts head              and on a turn convey in the stead another              with sublimed mercury that shall burst i the heat                       and all fly out in fumo                                         the alchemist  how do you do goot mr oldenbuck and i do hope your young gentleman captain mintyre is getting better again ach it is a bat business when young gentlemens will put lead balls into each others body  lead adventures of all kinds are very precarious mr dousterswivel but i am happy to learn continued the antiquary from my friend sir arthur that you have taken up a better trade and become a discoverer of gold  ach mr oldenbuck mine goot and honoured patron should not have told a word about dat little matter for though i have all relianceyes indeed on goot mr oldenbucks prudence and discretion and his great friendship for sir arthur wardouryet my heavens it is an great ponderous secret  more ponderous than any of the metal we shall make by it i fear answered oldbuck  dat is just as you shall have de faith and de patience for de grand experimentif you join wid sir arthur as he is put one hundred and fiftysee here is one fifty in your dirty fairport banknoteyou put one other hundred and fifty in de dirty notes and you shall have de pure gold and silver i cannot tell how much  nor any one for you i believe said the antiquary but hark you mr dousterswivel suppose without troubling this same sneezing spirit with any farther fumigations we should go in a body and having fair daylight and our good consciences to befriend us using no other conjuring implements than good substantial pickaxes and shovels fairly trench the area of the chancel in the ruins of st ruth from one end to the other and so ascertain the existence of this supposed treasure without putting ourselves to any farther expensethe ruins belong to sir arthur himself so there can be no objectiondo you think we shall succeed in this way of managing the matter  bahyou will not find one copper thimblebut sir arthur will do his pleasure i have showed him how it is possiblevery possibleto have de great sum of money for his occasionsi have showed him de real experiment if he likes not to believe goot mr oldenbuck it is nothing to herman dousterswivelhe only loses de money and de gold and de silversdat is all  sir arthur wardour cast an intimidated glance at oldbuck who especially when present held notwithstanding their frequent difference of opinion no ordinary influence over his sentiments in truth the baronet felt what he would not willingly have acknowledged that his genius stood rebuked before that of the antiquary he respected him as a shrewd penetrating sarcastic characterfeared his satire and had some confidence in the general soundness of his opinions he therefore looked at him as if desiring his leave before indulging his credulity dousterswivel saw he was in danger of losing his dupe unless he could make some favourable impression on the adviser  i know my goot mr oldenbuck it is one vanity to speak to you about de spirit and de goblin but look at this curious horni know you know de curiosity of all de countries and how de great oldenburgh horn as they keep still in the museum at copenhagen was given to de duke of oldenburgh by one female spirit of de wood now i could not put one trick on you if i were willingyou who know all de curiosity so welland dere it is de horn full of coinsif it had been a box or case i would have said nothing  being a horn said oldbuck does indeed strengthen your argument it was an implement of natures fashioning and therefore much used among rude nations although it may be the metaphorical horn is more frequent in proportion to the progress of civilisation and this present horn he continued rubbing it upon his sleeve is a curious and venerable relic and no doubt was intended to prove a cornucopia or horn of plenty to some one or other but whether to the adept or his patron may be justly doubted  well mr oldenbuck i find you still hard of beliefbut let me assure you de monksh understood de magisterium  let us leave talking of the magisterium mr dousterswivel and think a little about the magistrate are you aware that this occupation of yours is against the law of scotland and that both sir arthur and myself are in the commission of the peace  mine heaven and what is dat to de purpose when i am doing you all de goot i can  why you must know that when the legislature abolished the cruel laws against witchcraft they had no hope of destroying the superstitious feelings of humanity on which such chimeras had been founded and to prevent those feelings from being tampered with by artful and designing persons it is enacted by the ninth of george the second chap 5 that whosoever shall pretend by his alleged skill in any occult or crafty science to discover such goods as are lost stolen or concealed he shall suffer punishment by pillory and imprisonment as a common cheat and impostor  and is dat de laws asked dousterswivel with some agitation  thyself shall see the act replied the antiquary  den gentlemens i shall take my leave of you dat is all i do not like to stand on your what you call pilloryit is very bad way to take de air i think and i do not like your prisons no more where one cannot take de air at all  if such be your taste mr dousterswivel said the antiquary i advise you to stay where you are for i cannot let you go unless it be in the society of a constable and moreover i expect you will attend us just now to the ruins of st ruth and point out the place where you propose to find this treasure  mine heaven mr oldenbuck what usage is this to your old friend when i tell you so plain as i can speak dat if you go now you will not get so much treasure as one poor shabby sixpence  i will try the experiment however and you shall be dealt with according to its successalways with sir arthurs permission  sir arthur during this investigation had looked extremely embarrassed and to use a vulgar but expressive phrase chopfallen oldbucks obstinate disbelief led him strongly to suspect the imposture of dousterswivel and the adepts mode of keeping his ground was less resolute than he had expected yet he did not entirely give him up   mr oldbuck said the baronet you do mr dousterswivel less than justice he has undertaken to make this discovery by the use of his art and by applying characters descriptive of the intelligences presiding over the planetary hour in which the experiment is to be made and you require him to proceed under pain of punishment without allowing him the use of any of the preliminaries which he considers as the means of procuring success  i did not say that exactlyi only required him to be present when we make the search and not to leave us during the interval i fear he may have some intelligence with the intelligences you talk of and that whatever may be now hidden at saint ruth may disappear before we get there  well gentlemens said dousterswivel sullenly i will make no objections to go along with you but i tell you beforehand you shall not find so much of anything as shall be worth your going twenty yard from your own gate  we will put that to a fair trial said the antiquary and the baronets equipage being ordered miss wardour received an intimation from her father that she was to remain at monkbarns until his return from an airing the young lady was somewhat at a loss to reconcile this direction with the communication which she supposed must have passed between sir arthur and the antiquary but she was compelled for the present to remain in a most unpleasant state of suspense  the journey of the treasureseekers was melancholy enough dousterswivel maintained a sulky silence brooding at once over disappointed expectation and the risk of punishment sir arthur whose golden dreams had been gradually fading away surveyed in gloomy prospect the impending difficulties of his situation and oldbuck who perceived that his having so far interfered in his neighbours affairs gave the baronet a right to expect some actual and efficient assistance sadly pondered to what extent it would be necessary to draw open the strings of his purse thus each being wrapped in his own unpleasant ruminations there was hardly a word said on either side until they reached the four horseshoes by which sign the little inn was distinguished they procured at this place the necessary assistance and implements for digging and while they were busy about these preparations were suddenly joined by the old beggar edie ochiltree  the lord bless your honour began the bluegown with the genuine mendicant whine and long life to youweel pleased am i to hear that young captain mintyre is like to be on his legs again sunethink on your poor bedesman the day  aha old truepenny replied the antiquary why thou hast never come to monkbarns since thy perils by rock and floodheres something for thee to buy snuffand fumbling for his purse he pulled out at the same time the horn which enclosed the coins  ay and theres something to pit it in said the mendicant eyeing the rams hornthat looms an auld acquaintance o mine i could take my aith to that sneeshingmull amang a thousandi carried it for mony a year till i niffered it for this tin ane wi auld george glen the dammer and sinker when he took a fancy tillt doun at glenwithershins yonder  ay indeed said oldbuckso you exchanged it with a miner but i presume you never saw it so well filled beforeand opening it he showed the coins  troth ye may swear that monkbarns when it was mine it neer had abune the like o saxpenny worth o black rappee int at ance but i reckon yell be gaun to mak an antic ot as ye hae dune wi mony an orra thing besides od i wish anybody wad mak an antic o me but mony ane will find worth in rousted bits o capper and horn and airn that care unco little about an auld carle o their ain country and kind  you may now guess said oldbuck turning to sir arthur to whose good offices you were indebted the other night to trace this cornucopia of yours to a miner is bringing it pretty near a friend of oursi hope we shall be as successful this morning without paying for it  and whare is your honours gaun the day said the mendicant wi a your picks and shulesod this will be some o your tricks monkbarns yell be for whirling some o the auld monks down by yonder out o their graves afore they hear the last callbut wi your leave ise follow ye at ony rate and see what ye mak ot  the party soon arrived at the ruins of the priory and having gained the chancel stood still to consider what course they were to pursue next the antiquary meantime addressed the adept  pray mr dousterswivel what is your advice in this matter shall we have most likelihood of success if we dig from east to west or from west to eastor will you assist us with your triangular vial of maydew or with your diviningrod of witcheshazelor will you have the goodness to supply us with a few thumping blustering terms of art which if they fail in our present service may at least be useful to those who have not the happiness to be bachelors to still their brawling children withal  mr oldenbuck said dousterswivel doggedly i have told you already that you will make no good work at all and i will find some way of mine own to thank you for your civilities to meyes indeed  if your honours are thinking of tirling the floor said old edie and wad but take a puir bodys advice i would begin below that muckle stane that has the man there streekit out upon his back in the midst ot  i have some reason for thinking favourably of that plan myself said the baronet  and i have nothing to say against it said oldbuck it was not unusual to hide treasure in the tombs of the deceasedmany instances might be quoted of that from bartholinus and others  the tombstone the same beneath which the coins had been found by sir arthur and the german was once more forced aside and the earth gave easy way to the spade  its travelld earth that said edie it howks gae eithlyi ken it weel for ance i wrought a simmer wi auld will winnet the bedral and howkit mair graves than ane in my day but i left him in winter for it was unco cald wark and then it cam a green yule and the folk died thick and fastfor ye ken a green yule makes a fat kirkyard and i never dowed to bide a hard turn o wark in my lifesae aff i gaed and left will to delve his last dwellings by himsell for edie  the diggers were now so far advanced in their labours as to discover that the sides of the grave which they were clearing out had been originally secured by four walls of freestone forming a parallelogram for the reception probably of the coffin  it is worth while proceeding in our labours said the antiquary to sir arthur were it but for curiositys sake i wonder on whose sepulchre they have bestowed such uncommon pains  the arms on the shield said sir arthur and sighed as he spoke it are the same with those on misticots tower supposed to have been built by malcolm the usurper no man knew where he was buried and there is an old prophecy in our family that bodes us no good when his grave shall be discovered  i wot said the beggar i have often heard that when i was a bairn                if malcolm the misticots grave were fun               the lands of knockwinnock were lost and won  oldbuck with his spectacles on his nose had already knelt down on the monument and was tracing partly with his eye partly with his finger the mouldered devices upon the effigy of the deceased warrior it is the knockwinnock arms sure enough he exclaimed quarterly with the coat of wardour  richard called the redhanded wardour married sybil knockwinnock the heiress of the saxon family and by that alliance said sir arthur brought the castle and estate into the name of wardour in the year of god 1150  very true sir arthur and here is the batonsinister the mark of illegitimacy extended diagonally through both coats upon the shield where can our eyes have been that they did not see this curious monument before  na whare was the throughstane that it didna come before our een till eenow said ochiltree for i hae kend this auld kirk man and bairn for saxty lang years and i neer noticed it afore and its nae sic mote neither but what ane might see it in their parritch  all were now induced to tax their memory as to the former state of the ruins in that corner of the chancel and all agreed in recollecting a considerable pile of rubbish which must have been removed and spread abroad in order to make the tomb visible sir arthur might indeed have remembered seeing the monument on the former occasion but his mind was too much agitated to attend to the circumstance as a novelty  while the assistants were engaged in these recollections and discussions the workmen proceeded with their labour they had already dug to the depth of nearly five feet and as the flinging out the soil became more and more difficult they began at length to tire of the job  were down to the till now said one of them and the neer a coffin or onything else is heresome cunninger chiels been afore us i reckonand the labourer scrambled out of the grave  hout lad said edie getting down in his roomlet me try my hand for an auld bedralyere gude seekers but ill finders  so soon as he got into the grave he struck his pikestaff forcibly down it encountered resistance in its descent and the beggar exclaimed like a scotch schoolboy when he finds anything nae halvers and quartershale o mine ain and nane o my neighbours  everybody from the dejected baronet to the sullen adept now caught the spirit of curiosity crowded round the grave and would have jumped into it could its space have contained them the labourers who had begun to flag in their monotonous and apparently hopeless task now resumed their tools and plied them with all the ardour of expectation their shovels soon grated upon a hard wooden surface which as the earth was cleared away assumed the distinct form of a chest but greatly smaller than that of a coffin now all hands were at work to heave it out of the grave and all voices as it was raised proclaimed its weight and augured its value they were not mistaken  when the chest or box was placed on the surface and the lid forced up by a pickaxe there was displayed first a coarse canvas cover then a quantity of oakum and beneath that a number of ingots of silver a general exclamation hailed a discovery so surprising and unexpected the baronet threw his hands and eyes up to heaven with the silent rapture of one who is delivered from inexpressible distress of mind oldbuck almost unable to credit his eyes lifted one piece of silver after another there was neither inscription nor stamp upon them excepting one which seemed to be spanish he could have no doubt of the purity and great value of the treasure before him still however removing piece by piece he examined row by row expecting to discover that the lower layers were of inferior value but he could perceive no difference in this respect and found himself compelled to admit that sir arthur had possessed himself of bullion to the value perhaps of a thousand pounds sterling sir arthur now promised the assistants a handsome recompense for their trouble and began to busy himself about the mode of conveying this rich windfall to the castle of knockwinnock when the adept recovering from his surprise which had equalled that exhibited by any other individual of the party twitched his sleeve and having offered his humble congratulations turned next to oldbuck with an air of triumph  i did tell you my goot friend mr oldenbuck dat i was to seek opportunity to thank you for your civility now do you not think i have found out vary goot way to return thank  why mr dousterswivel do you pretend to have had any hand in our good successyou forget you refused us all aid of your science man and you are here without your weapons that should have fought the battle which you pretend to have gained in our behalf you have used neither charm lamen sigil talisman spell crystal pentacle magic mirror nor geomantic figure where be your periapts and your abracadabras man your mayfern your vervain             your toad your crow your dragon and your panther            your sun your moon your firmament your adrop                 your lato azoch zernich chibrit heautarit            with all your broths your menstrues your materials                       would burst a man to name  ah rare ben jonson long peace to thy ashes for a scourge of the quacks of thy daywho expected to see them revive in our own  the answer of the adept to the antiquarys tirade we must defer to our next chapter     chapter third     clauseyou now shall know the king o the beggars treasure             yesere tomorrow you shall find your harbour             herefail me not for if i live ill fit you                                        the beggars bush  the german determined it would seem to assert the vantageground on which the discovery had placed him replied with great pomp and stateliness to the attack of the antiquary  maister oldenbuck all dis may be very witty and comedy but i have nothing to saynothing at allto people dat will not believe deir own eyesights it is vary true dat i ave not any of de things of de art and it makes de more wonder what i has done dis day but i would ask of you mine honoured and goot and generous patron to put your hand into your righthand waistcoat pocket and show me what you shall find dere  sir arthur obeyed his direction and pulled out the small plate of silver which he had used under the adepts auspices upon the former occasion it is very true said sir arthur looking gravely at the antiquary this is the graduated and calculated sigil by which mr dousterswivel and i regulated our first discovery  pshaw pshaw my dear friend said oldbuck you are too wise to believe in the influence of a trumpery crownpiece beat out thin and a parcel of scratches upon it i tell thee sir arthur that if dousterswivel had known where to get this treasure himself you would not have been lord of the least share of it  in troth please your honour said edie who put in his word on all occasions i think since mr dunkerswivel has had sae muckle merit in discovering a the gear the least ye can do is to gie him that ot thats left behind for his labour for doubtless he that kend where to find sae muckle will hae nae difficulty to find mair  dousterswivels brow grew very dark at this proposal of leaving him to his ain purchase as ochiltree expressed it but the beggar drawing him aside whispered a word or two in his ear to which he seemed to give serious attention  meanwhile sir arthur his heart warm with his good fortune said aloud never mind our friend monkbarns mr dousterswivel but come to the castle tomorrow and ill convince you that i am not ungrateful for the hints you have given me about this matterand the fifty fairport dirty notes as you call them are heartily at your service come my lads get the cover of this precious chest fastened up again  but the cover had in the confusion fallen aside among the rubbish or the loose earth which had been removed from the gravein short it was not to be seen  never mind my good lads tie the tarpaulin over it and get it away to the carriagemonkbarns will you walk i must go back your way to take up miss wardour  and i hope to take up your dinner also sir arthur and drink a glass of wine for joy of our happy adventure besides you should write about the business to the exchequer in case of any interference on the part of the crown as you are lord of the manor it will be easy to get a deed of gift should they make any claim we must talk about it though  and i particularly recommend silence to all who are present said sir arthur looking round all bowed and professed themselves dumb  why as to that said monkbarns recommending secrecy where a dozen of people are acquainted with the circumstance to be concealed is only putting the truth in masquerade for the story will be circulated under twenty different shapes but never mindwe will state the true one to the barons and that is all that is necessary  i incline to send off an express tonight said the baronet  i can recommend your honour to a sure hand said ochiltree little davie mailsetter and the butchers reisting powny  we will talk over the matter as we go to monkbarns said sir arthur my lads to the workpeople come with me to the four horseshoes that i may take down all your namesdousterswivel i wont ask you to go down to monkbarns as the laird and you differ so widely in opinion but do not fail to come to see me tomorrow  dousterswivel growled out an answer in which the words dutymine honoured patronand wait upon sir arthurswere alone distinguishable and after the baronet and his friend had left the ruins followed by the servants and workmen who in hope of reward and whisky joyfully attended their leader the adept remained in a brown study by the side of the open grave  who was it as could have thought this he ejaculated unconsciously mine heiligkeit i have heard of such things and often spoken of such thingsbut sapperment i never thought to see them and if i had gone but two or dree feet deeper down in the earthmein himmel it had been all mine ownso much more as i have been muddling about to get from this fools man  here the german ceased his soliloquy for raising his eyes he encountered those of edie ochiltree who had not followed the rest of the company but resting as usual on his pikestaff had planted himself on the other side of the grave the features of the old man naturally shrewd and expressive almost to an appearance of knavery seemed in this instance so keenly knowing that even the assurance of dousterswivel though a professed adventurer sunk beneath their glances but he saw the necessity of an eclaircissement and rallying his spirits instantly began to sound the mendicant on the occurrences of the day goot maister edies ochiltrees  edie ochiltree nae maisteryour puir bedesman and the kings answered the bluegown  awell den goot edie what do you think of all dis  i was just thinking it was very kind for i darena say very simple o your honour to gie thae twa rich gentles wha hae lands and lairdships and siller without end this grand pose o silver and treasure three times tried in the fire as the scripture expresses it that might hae made yoursell and ony twa or three honest bodies beside as happy and content as the day was lang  indeed edie mine honest friends dat is very true only i did not know dat is i was not sure where to find the gelt myself  what was it not by your honours advice and counsel that monkbarns and the knight of knockwinnock came here then  ahayes but it was by another circumstance i did not know dat dey would have found de treasure mine friend though i did guess by such a tintamarre and cough and sneeze and groan among de spirit one other night here dat there might be treasure and bullion hereabout ach mein himmel the spirit will hone and groan over his gelt as if he were a dutch burgomaster counting his dollars after a great dinner at the stadthaus  and do you really believe the like o that mr dusterdeevila skeelfu man like youhout fie  mein friend answered the adept foreed by circumstances to speak something nearer the truth than he generally used to do i believed it no more than you and no man at all till i did hear them hone and moan and groan myself on de oder night and till i did this day see de cause which was an great chest all full of de pure silver from mexicoand what would you ave nae think den  and what wad ye gie to ony ane said edie that wad help ye to sic another kistfu o silver  givemein himmelone great big quarter of it  now if the secret were mine said the mendicant i wad stand out for a half for you see though i am but a puir ragged body and couldna carry silver or gowd to sell for fear o being taen up yet i could find mony folk would pass it awa for me at unco muckle easier profit than yere thinking on  ach himmelmein goot friend what was it i saidi did mean to say you should have de tree quarter for your half and de one quarter to be my fair half  no no mr dusterdeevil we will divide equally what we find like brother and brother now look at this board that i just flung into the dark aisle out o the way while monkbarns was glowering ower a the silver yonder hes a sharp chiel monkbarnsi was glad to keep the like o this out o his sight yell maybe can read the character better than mei am nae that book learned at least im no that muckle in practice  with this modest declaration of ignorance ochiltree brought forth from behind a pillar the cover of the box or chest of treasure which when forced from its hinges had been carelessly flung aside during the ardour of curiosity to ascertain the contents which it concealed and had been afterwards as it seems secreted by the mendicant there was a word and a number upon the plank and the beggar made them more distinct by spitting upon his ragged blue handkerchief and rubbing off the clay by which the inscription was obscured it was in the ordinary black letter  can ye mak ought ot said edie to the adept  s said the philosopher like a child getting his lesson in the primers t a r c hstarchdat is what de womanwashers put into de neckerchers and de shirt collar  search echoed ochiltree na na mr dusterdeevil ye are mair of a conjuror than a clerkits search man searchsee theres the ye clear and distinct  aha i see it nowit is searchnumber one mein himmel then there must be a number two mein goot friend for search is what you call to seek and dig and this is but number one mine wort there is one great big prize in de wheel for us goot maister ochiltree  aweel it may be sae but we canna howk fort enowwe hae nae shules for they hae taen them a awaand its like some o them will be sent back to fling the earth into the hole and mak a things trig again but an yell sit down wi me a while in the wood ise satisfy your honour that ye hae just lighted on the only man in the country that could hae tauld about malcolm misticot and his hidden treasurebut first well rub out the letters on this board for fear it tell tales  and by the assistance of his knife the beggar erased and defaced the characters so as to make them quite unintelligible and then daubed the board with clay so as to obliterate all traces of the erasure  dousterswivel stared at him in ambiguous silence there was an intelligence and alacrity about all the old mans movements which indicated a person that could not be easily overreached and yet for even rogues acknowledge in some degree the spirit of precedence our adept felt the disgrace of playing a secondary part and dividing winnings with so mean an associate his appetite for gain however was sufficiently sharp to overpower his offended pride and though far more an impostor than a dupe he was not without a certain degree of personal faith even in the gross superstitions by means of which he imposed upon others still being accustomed to act as a leader on such occasions he felt humiliated at feeling himself in the situation of a vulture marshalled to his prey by a carrioncrowlet me however hear this story to an end thought dousterswivel and it will be hard if i do not make mine account in it better as maister edie ochiltrees makes proposes  the adept thus transformed into a pupil from a teacher of the mystic art followed ochiltree in passive acquiescence to the priors oaka spot as the reader may remember at a short distance from the ruins where the german sat down and silence waited the old mans communication  maister dustandsnivel said the narrator its an unco while since i heard this business treated anentfor the lairds of knockwinnock neither sir arthur nor his father nor his grandfatherand i mind a wee bit about them aliked to hear it spoken about nor they dinna like it yetbut nae matter ye may be sure it was clattered about in the kitchen like onything else in a great house though it were forbidden in the haand sae i hae heard the circumstance rehearsed by auld servants in the family and in thir present days when things o that auldwarld sort arena keepit in mind round winter firesides as they used to be i question if theres onybody in the country can tell the tale but mysellaye outtaken the laird though for theres a parchment book about it as i have heard in the charterroom at knockwinnock castle  well all dat is vary wellbut get you on with your stories mine goot friend said dousterswivel  aweel ye see continued the mendicant this was a job in the auld times o rugging and riving through the hale country when it was ilka ane for himsell and god for us awhen nae man wanted property if he had strength to take it or had it langer than he had power to keep it it was just he ower her and she ower him whichever could win upmost a through the east country here and nae doubt through the rest o scotland in the self and same manner  sae in these days sir richard wardour came into the land and that was the first o the name ever was in this country theres been mony o them sin syne and the maist like him they cad hellinharness and the rest o them are sleeping down in yon ruins they were a proud dour set o men but unco brave and aye stood up for the weel o the country god sain them atheres no muckle popery in that wish they cad them the norman wardours though they cam frae the south to this country so this sir richard that they cad redhand drew up wi the auld knockwinnock o that dayfor then they were knockwinnocks of that ilkand wad fain marry his only daughter that was to have the castle and the land laith laith was the lasssybil knockwinnock they cad her that tauld me the talelaith laith was she to gie into the match for she had faen a wee ower thick wi a cousin o her ain that her father had some illwill to and sae it was that after she had been married to sir richard jimp four monthsfor marry him she maun its likeyell no hinder her gieing them a present o a bonny knave bairn then there was siccan a cathro as the like was never seen and shes be burnt and hes be slain was the best words o their mouths but it was a sowdered up again some gait and the bairn was sent awa and bred up near the highlands and grew up to be a fine wanle fallow like mony ane that comes o the wrang side o the blanket and sir richard wi the redhand he had a fair offspring ohis ain and a was lound and quiet till his head was laid in the ground but then down came malcolm misticotsir arthur says it should be misbegot but they aye cad him misticot that spoke ot lang synedown cam this malcolm the lovebegot frae glenisla wi a string o langlegged highlanders at his heels thats aye ready for onybodys mischief and he threeps the castle and lands are his ain as his mothers eldest son and turns a the wardours out to the hill there was a sort of fighting and bludespilling about it for the gentles took different sides but malcolm had the uppermost for a lang time and keepit the castle of knockwinnock and strengthened it and built that muckle tower that they ca misticots tower to this day  mine goot friend old mr edie ochiltree interrupted the german this is all as one like de long histories of a baron of sixteen quarters in mine countries but i would as rather hear of de silver and gold  why ye see continued the mendicant this malcolm was weel helped by an uncle a brother o his fathers that was prior o st ruth here and muckle treasure they gathered between them to secure the succession of their house in the lands of knockwinnock folk said that the monks in thae days had the art of multiplying metalsat ony rate they were very rich at last it came to this that the young wardour that was redhands son challenged misticot to fight with him in the lists as they cad themthats no lists or tailors runds and selvedges o claith but a palinthing they set up for them to fight in like gamecocks aweel misticot was beaten and at his brothers mercybut he wadna touch his life for the blood of knockwinnock that was in baith their veins so malcolm was compelled to turn a monk and he died soon after in the priory of pure despite and vexation naebody ever kennd whare his uncle the prior earded him or what he did wi his gowd and silver for he stood on the right o halie kirk and wad gie nae account to onybody but the prophecy gat abroad in the country that whenever misticots grave was fund out the estate of knockwinnock should be lost and won  ach mine goot old friend maister edie and dat is not so very unlikely if sir arthurs will quarrel wit his goot friends to please mr oldenbuckand so you do tink dat dis golds and silvers belonged to goot mr malcolm mishdigoat  troth do i mr dousterdeevil  and you do believe dat dere is more of dat sorts behind  by my certie do ihow can it be otherwisesearchno ithat is as muckle as to say search and yell find number twa besides yon kist is only silver and i aye heard that misticots pose had muckle yellow gowd int  den mine goot friends said the adept jumping up hastily why do we not set about our little job directly  for twa gude reasons answered the beggar who quietly kept his sitting posturefirst because as i said before we have naething to dig wi for they hae taen awa the picks and shules and secondly because there will be a wheen idle gowks coming to glower at the hole as lang as it is daylight and maybe the laird may send somebody to fill it upand ony way we wad be catched but if you will meet me on this place at twal oclock wi a dark lantern ill hae tools ready and well gang quietly about our job our twa sells and naebody the wiser fort  bebebut mine goot friend said dousterswivel from whose recollection his former nocturnal adventure was not to be altogether erased even by the splendid hopes which edies narrative held forth it is not so goot or so safe to be about goot maister mishdigoats grabe at dat time of nightyou have forgot how i told you de spirits did hone and mone dere i do assure you dere is disturbance dere  if yere afraid of ghaists answered the mendicant coolly ill do the job mysell and bring your share o the siller to ony place you like to appoint  nonomine excellent old mr edietoo much trouble for youi will not have dati will come myselfand it will be bettermost for mine old friend it was i herman dousterswivel discovered maister mishdigoats grave when i was looking for a place as to put away some little trumpery coins just to play one little trick on my dear friend sir arthur for a little sport and pleasures yes i did take some what you call rubbish and did discover maister mishdigoats own monumentsh its like dat he meant i should be his heirsso it would not be civility in me not to come mineself for mine inheritance  at twal oclock then said the mendicant we meet under this tree ill watch for a while and see that naebody meddles wi the graveits only saying the lairds forbade itthen get my bit supper frae ringan the poinder up by and leave to sleep in his barn and ill slip out at night and neer be mist  do so mine goot maister edie and i will meet you here on this very place though all de spirits should moan and sneeze deir very brains out  so saying he shook hands with the old man and with this mutual pledge of fidelity to their appointment they separated for the present     chapter fourth                            see thou shake the bags                  of hoarding abbots angels imprisoned                          set thou at liberty                 bell book and candle shall not drive me back                         if gold and silver beckon to come on                                               king john  the night set in stormy with wind and occasional showers of rain eh sirs said the old mendicant as he took his place on the sheltered side of the large oaktree to wait for his associateeh sirs but human natures a wilful and wilyard thingis it not an unco lucre o gain wad bring this dousterdivel out in a blast o wind like this at twal oclock at night to thir wild gousty wasand amna i a bigger fule than himsell to bide here waiting for him  having made these sage reflections he wrapped himself close in his cloak and fixed his eye on the moon as she waded amid the stormy and dusky clouds which the wind from time to time drove across her surface the melancholy and uncertain gleams that she shot from between the passing shadows fell full upon the rifted arches and shafted windows of the old building which were thus for an instant made distinctly visible in their ruinous state and anon became again a dark undistinguished and shadowy mass the little lake had its share of these transient beams of light and showed its waters broken whitened and agitated under the passing storm which when the clouds swept over the moon were only distinguished by their sullen and murmuring plash against the beach the wooded glen repeated to every successive gust that hurried through its narrow trough the deep and various groan with which the trees replied to the whirlwind and the sound sunk again as the blast passed away into a faint and passing murmur resembling the sighs of an exhausted criminal after the first pangs of his torture are over in these sounds superstition might have found ample gratification for that state of excited terror which she fears and yet loves but such feeling is made no part of ochiltrees composition his mind wandered back to the scenes of his youth  i have kept guard on the outposts baith in germany and america he said to himself in mony a waur night than this and when i kend there was maybe a dozen o their riflemen in the thicket before me but i was aye gleg at my dutynaebody ever catched edie sleeping  as he muttered thus to himself he instinctively shouldered his trusty pikestaff assumed the port of a sentinel on duty and as a step advanced towards the tree called with a tone assorting better with his military reminiscences than his present statestand who goes there  de devil goot edie answered dousterswivel why does you speak so loud as a baarenhauter or what you call a factionaryi mean a sentinel  just because i thought i was a sentinel at that moment answered the mendicant heres an awsome night hae ye brought the lantern and a pock for the siller  ayay mine goot friend said the german here it ismy pair of what you call saddlebag one side will be for you one side for mei will put dem on my horse to save you de trouble as you are old man  have you a horse here then asked edie ochiltree  o yes mine friendtied yonder by de stile responded the adept  weel i hae just ae word to the bargainthere sall nane o my gear gang on your beasts back  what was it as you would be afraid of said the foreigner  only of losing sight of horse man and money again replied the gaberlunzie  does you know dat you make one gentlemans out to be one great rogue  mony gentlemen replied ochiltree can make that out for themselves but whats the sense of quarrellingif ye want to gang on gang onif noill gae back to the gude aitstraw in ringan aikwoods barn that i left wi right illwill enow and ill pit back the pick and shule whar i got them  dousterswivel deliberated a moment whether by suffering edie to depart he might not secure the whole of the expected wealth for his own exclusive use but the want of digging implements the uncertainty whether if he had them he could clear out the grave to a sufficient depth without assistance and above all the reluctance which he felt owing to the experience of the former night to venture alone on the terrors of misticots grave satisfied him the attempt would be hazardous endeavouring therefore to assume his usual cajoling tone though internally incensed he begged his goot friend maister edie ochiltrees would lead the way and assured him of his acquiescence in all such an excellent friend could propose  aweel aweel then said edie tak gude care o your feet amang the lang grass and the loose stones i wish we may get the light keepit in neist wi this fearsome windbut theres a blink o moonlight at times  thus saying old edie closely accompanied by the adept led the way towards the ruins but presently made a full halt in front of them  yere a learned man mr dousterdeevil and ken muckle o the marvellous works o naturenow will ye tell me ae thingdye believe in ghaists and spirits that walk the earthdye believe in them ay or no  now goot mr edie whispered dousterswivel in an expostulatory tone of voice is this a times or a places for such a questions  indeed is it baith the tane and the tother mr dustanshovel for i maun fairly tell ye theres reports that auld misticot walks now this wad be an uncanny night to meet him in and wha kens if he wad be ower weel pleased wi our purpose of visiting his pose  alle guten geistermuttered the adept the rest of the conjuration being lost in a tremulous warble of his voicei do desires you not to speak so mr edie for from all i heard dat one other night i do much believes  now i said ochiltree entering the chancel and flinging abroad his arm with an air of defiance i wadna gie the crack o my thumb for him were he to appear at this moment hes but a disembodied spirit as we are embodied anes  for the lofe of heavens said dousterswivel say nothing at all neither about somebodies or nobodies  aweel said the beggar expanding the shade of the lantern heres the stane and spirit or no spirit ise be a wee bit deeper in the grave and he jumped into the place from which the precious chest had that morning been removed after striking a few strokes he tired or affected to tire and said to his companion im auld and failed now and canna keep at ittime abouts fair play neighbour ye maun get in and tak the shule a bit and shule out the loose earth and then ill tak turn about wi you  dousterswivel accordingly took the place which the beggar had evacuated and toiled with all the zeal that awakened avarice mingled with the anxious wish to finish the undertaking and leave the place as soon as possible could inspire in a mind at once greedy suspicious and timorous  edie standing much at his ease by the side of the hole contented himself with exhorting his associate to labour hard my certie few ever wrought for siccan a days wage an it be butsay the tenth part o the size o the kist no i it will double its value being filled wi gowd instead of silver od ye work as if ye had been bred to pick and shuleye could win your round halfcrown ilka day tak care o your taes wi that stane giving a kick to a large one which the adept had heaved out with difficulty and which edie pushed back again to the great annoyance of his associates shins  thus exhorted by the mendicant dousterswivel struggled and laboured among the stones and stiff clay toiling like a horse and internally blaspheming in german when such an unhallowed syllable escaped his lips edie changed his battery upon him  o dinna swear dinna swear wha kens whals listeningeh gude guide us whats yonhout its just a branch of ivy flightering awa frae the wa when the moon was in it lookit unco like a dead mans arm wi a taper inti thought it was misticot himsell but never mind work you awayfling the earth weel up by out o the gateod if yere no as clean a worker at a grave as win winnet himsell what gars ye stop nowyere just at the very bit for a chance  stop said the german in a tone of anger and disappointment why i am down at de rocks dat de cursed ruins god forgife me is founded upon  weel said the beggar thats the likeliest bit of ony it will be but a muckle throughstane laid doun to kiver the gowdtak the pick tillt and pit mair strength manae gude downright devvel will split it ise warrant yeay that will do od he comes on wi wallaces straiks  in fact the adept moved by edies exhortations fetched two or three desperate blows and succeeded in breaking not indeed that against which he struck which as he had already conjectured was the solid rock but the implement which he wielded jarring at the same time his arms up to the shoulderblades  hurra boysthere goes ringans pickaxe cried edie its a shame o the fairport folk to sell siccan frail gear try the shuleat it again mr dusterdeevil  the adept without reply scrambled out of the pit which was now about six feet deep and addressed his associate in a voice that trembled with anger does you know mr edies ochiltrees who it is you put off your gibes and your jests upon  brawly mr dusterdeevilbrawly do i ken ye and has done mony a day but theres nae jesting in the case for i am wearying to see ae our treasures we should hae had baith ends o the pockmanky filled by this timei hope its bowk eneugh to haud a the gear  look you you base old person said the incensed philosopher if you do put another jest upon me i will cleave your skullpiece with this shovels  and whare wad my hands and my pikestaff be a the time replied edie in a tone that indicated no apprehension hout tout maister dusterdeevil i haena lived sae lang in the warld neither to be shuled out ot that gate what ails ye to be cankered man wi your friends ill wager ill find out the treasure in a minute and he jumped into the pit and took up the spade  i do swear to you said the adept whose suspicions were now fully awake that if you have played me one big trick i will give you one big beating mr edies  hear till him now said ochiltree he kens how to gar folk find out the gearod im thinking hes been drilled that way himsell some day  at this insinuation which alluded obviously to the former scene betwixt himself and sir arthur the philosopher lost the slender remnant of patience he had left and being of violent passions heaved up the truncheon of the broken mattock to discharge it upon the old mans head the blow would in all probability have been fatal had not he at whom it was aimed exclaimed in a stern and firm voice shame to ye mando ye think heaven or earth will suffer ye to murder an auld man that might be your fatherlook behind ye man  dousterswivel turned instinctively and beheld to his utter astonishment a tall dark figure standing close behind him the apparition gave him no time to proceed by exorcism or otherwise but having instantly recourse to the voie de fait took measure of the adepts shoulders three or four times with blows so substantial that he fell under the weight of them and remained senseless for some minutes between fear and stupefaction when he came to himself he was alone in the ruined chancel lying upon the soft and damp earth which had been thrown out of misticots grave he raised himself with a confused sensation of anger pain and terror and it was not until he had sat upright for some minutes that he could arrange his ideas sufficiently to recollect how he came there or with what purpose as his recollection returned he could have little doubt that the bait held out to him by ochiltree to bring him to that solitary spot the sarcasms by which he had provoked him into a quarrel and the ready assistance which he had at hand for terminating it in the manner in which it had ended were all parts of a concerted plan to bring disgrace and damage on herman dousterswivel he could hardly suppose that he was indebted for the fatigue anxiety and beating which he had undergone purely to the malice of edie ochiltree singly but concluded that the mendicant had acted a part assigned to him by some person of greater importance his suspicions hesitated between oldbuck and sir arthur wardour the former had been at no pains to conceal a marked dislike of himbut the latter he had deeply injured and although he judged that sir arthur did not know the extent of his wrongs towards him yet it was easy to suppose he had gathered enough of the truth to make him desirous of revenge ochiltree had alluded to at least one circumstance which the adept had every reason to suppose was private between sir arthur and himself and therefore must have been learned from the former the language of oldbuck also intimated a conviction of his knavery which sir arthur heard without making any animated defence lastly the way in which dousterswivel supposed the baronet to have exercised his revenge was not inconsistent with the practice of other countries with which the adept was better acquainted than with those of north britain with him as with many bad men to suspect an injury and to nourish the purpose of revenge was one and the same movement and before dousterswivel had fairly recovered his legs he had mentally sworn the ruin of his benefactor which unfortunately he possessed too much the power of accelerating  but although a purpose of revenge floated through his brain it was no time to indulge such speculations the hour the place his own situation and perhaps the presence or near neighbourhood of his assailants made selfpreservation the adepts first object the lantern had been thrown down and extinguished in the scuffle the wind which formerly howled so loudly through the aisles of the ruin had now greatly fallen lulled by the rain which was descending very fast the moon from the same cause was totally obscured and though dousterswivel had some experience of the ruins and knew that he must endeavour to regain the eastern door of the chancel yet the confusion of his ideas was such that he hesitated for some time ere he could ascertain in what direction he was to seek it in this perplexity the suggestions of superstition taking the advantage of darkness and his evil conscience began again to present themselves to his disturbed imagination but bah quoth he valiantly to himself it is all nonsense all one part of de damn big trick and imposture devil that one thickskulled scotch baronet as i have led by the nose for five year should cheat herman dousterswivel  as he had come to this conclusion an incident occurred which tended greatly to shake the grounds on which he had adopted it amid the melancholy sough of the dying wind and the plash of the raindrops on leaves and stones arose and apparently at no great distance from the listener a strain of vocal music so sad and solemn as if the departed spirits of the churchmen who had once inhabited these deserted ruins were mourning the solitude and desolation to which their hallowed precincts had been abandoned dousterswivel who had now got upon his feet and was groping around the wall of the chancel stood rooted to the ground on the occurrence of this new phenomenon each faculty of his soul seemed for the moment concentred in the sense of hearing and all rushed back with the unanimous information that the deep wild and prolonged chant which he now heard was the appropriate music of one of the most solemn dirges of the church of rome why performed in such a solitude and by what class of choristers were questions which the terrified imagination of the adept stirred with all the german superstitions of nixies oakkings werwolves hobgoblins black spirits and white blue spirits and grey durst not even attempt to solve  another of his senses was soon engaged in the investigation at the extremity of one of the transepts of the church at the bottom of a few descending steps was a small irongrated door opening as far as he recollected to a sort of low vault or sacristy as he cast his eye in the direction of the sound he observed a strong reflection of red light glimmering through these bars and against the steps which descended to them dousterswivel stood a moment uncertain what to do then suddenly forming a desperate resolution he moved down the aisle to the place from which the light proceeded  illustration the funeral of the countess  fortified with the sign of the cross and as many exorcisms as his memory could recover he advanced to the grate from which unseen he could see what passed in the interior of the vault as he approached with timid and uncertain steps the chant after one or two wild and prolonged cadences died away into profound silence the grate when he reached it presented a singular spectacle in the interior of the sacristy an open grave with four tall flambeaus each about six feet high placed at the four cornersa bier having a corpse in its shroud the arms folded upon the breast rested upon tressels at one side of the grave as if ready to be interreda priest dressed in his cope and stole held open the service bookanother churchman in his vestments bore a holywater sprinkler and two boys in white surplices held censers with incensea man of a figure once tall and commanding but now bent with age or infirmity stood alone and nearest to the coffin attired in deep mourningsuch were the most prominent figures of the group at a little distance were two or three persons of both sexes attired in long mourning hoods and cloaks and five or six others in the same lugubrious dress still farther removed from the body around the walls of the vault stood ranged in motionless order each bearing in his hand a huge torch of black wax the smoky light from so many flambeaus by the red and indistinct atmosphere which it spread around gave a hazy dubious and as it were phantomlike appearance to the outlines of this singular apparition the voice of the priestloud clear and sonorousnow recited from the breviary which he held in his hand those solemn words which the ritual of the catholic church has consecrated to the rendering of dust to dust meanwhile dousterswivel the place the hour and the surprise considered still remained uncertain whether what he saw was substantial or an unearthly representation of the rites to which in former times these walls were familiar but which are now rarely practised in protestant countries and almost never in scotland he was uncertain whether to abide the conclusion of the ceremony or to endeavour to regain the chancel when a change in his position made him visible through the grate to one of the attendant mourners the person who first espied him indicated his discovery to the individual who stood apart and nearest the coffin by a sign and upon his making a sign in reply two of the group detached themselves and gliding along with noiseless steps as if fearing to disturb the service unlocked and opened the grate which separated them from the adept each took him by an arm and exerting a degree of force which he would have been incapable of resisting had his fear permitted him to attempt opposition they placed him on the ground in the chancel and sat down one on each side of him as if to detain him satisfied he was in the power of mortals like himself the adept would have put some questions to them but while one pointed to the vault from which the sound of the priests voice was distinctly heard the other placed his finger upon his lips in token of silence a hint which the german thought it most prudent to obey and thus they detained him until a loud alleluia pealing through the deserted arches of st ruth closed the singular ceremony which it had been his fortune to witness  when the hymn had died away with all its echoes the voice of one of the sable personages under whose guard the adept had remained said in a familiar tone and dialect dear sirs mr dousterswivel is this you could not ye have let us ken an ye had wussed till hae been present at the ceremonymy lord couldna tak it weel your coming blinking and jinking in in that fashion  in de name of all dat is gootness tell me what you are interrupted the german in his turn  what i am why wha should i be but ringan aikwood the knockwinnock poinderand what are ye doing here at this time o night unless ye were come to attend the leddys burial  i do declare to you mine goot poinder aikwood said the german raising himself up that i have been this vary nights murdered robbed

at the lodge and wese see if edies at the barn there was twa wildlooking chaps left the auld kirk when we were coming up wi the corpse thats certain and the priest wha likes ill that ony heretics should look on at our church ceremonies sent twa o the riding saulies after them sae well hear a about it frae them  thus speaking the kindly apparition with the assistance of the mute personage who was his son disencumbered himself of his cloak and prepared to escort dousterswivel to the place of that rest which the adept so much needed  i will apply to the magistrates tomorrow said the adept oder i will have de law put in force against all the peoples  while he thus muttered vengeance against the cause of his injury he tottered from among the ruins supporting himself on ringan and his son whose assistance his state of weakness rendered very necessary  when they were clear of the priory and had gained the little meadow in which it stands dousterswivel could perceive the torches which had caused him so much alarm issuing in irregular procession from the ruins and glancing their light like that of the ignis fatuus on the banks of the lake after moving along the path for some short space with a fluctuating and irregular motion the lights were at once extinguished  we aye put out the torches at the haliecross well on sic occasions said the forester to his guest and accordingly no farther visible sign of the procession offered itself to dousterswivel although his ear could catch the distant and decreasing echo of horses hoofs in the direction towards which the mourners had bent their course     chapter fifth                         o weel may the boatie row                        and better may she speed                       and weel may the boatie row

history i wish i could say that its inside was well arranged decently furnished or tolerably clean on the contrary i am compelled to admit there was confusion there was dilapidationthere was dirt good store yet with all this there was about the inmates luckie mucklebackit and her family an appearance of ease plenty and comfort that seemed to warrant their old sluttish proverb the clartier the cosier a huge fire though the season was summer occupied the hearth and served at once for affording light heat and the means of preparing food the fishing had been successful and the family with customary improvidence had since unlading the cargo continued an unremitting operation of broiling and frying that part of the produce reserved for home consumption and the bones and fragments lay on the wooden trenchers mingled with morsels of broken bannocks and shattered mugs of halfdrunk beer the stout and athletic form of maggie herself bustling here and there among a pack of halfgrown girls and younger children of whom she chucked one now here and another now there with an exclamation of get out o the gate ye little sorrow was strongly contrasted with the passive and halfstupified look and manner of her husbands mother a woman advanced to the last stage of human life who was seated in her wonted chair close by the fire the warmth of which she coveted yet hardly seemed to be sensible ofnow muttering to herself now smiling vacantly to the children as they pulled the strings of her toy or close cap or twitched her blue checked apron with her distaff in her bosom and her spindle in her hand she plied lazily and mechanically the oldfashioned scottish thrift according to the oldfashioned scottish manner the younger children crawling among the feet of the elder watched the progress of grannies spindle as it twisted and now and then ventured to interrupt its progress as it danced upon the floor in those vagaries which the more regulated spinningwheel has now so universally superseded that even the fated princess in the fairy tale might roam through all scotland without the risk of piercing her hand with a spindle and dying of the wound late as the hour was and it was long past midnight the whole family were still on foot and far from proposing to go to bed the dame was still busy broiling carcakes on the girdle and the elder girl the halfnaked mermaid elsewhere commemorated was preparing a pile of findhorn haddocks that is haddocks smoked with green wood to be eaten along with these relishing provisions  while they were thus employed a slight tap at the door

accustomed minnie wants to ken what for the glenallan folk aye bury by candlelight in the ruing of st ruth  the old woman paused in the act of twirling the spindle turned round to the rest of the party lifted her withered trembling and claycoloured hand raised up her ashenhued and wrinkled face which the quick motion of two lightblue eyes chiefly distinguished from the visage of a corpse and as if catching at any touch of association with the living world answered what gars the glenallan family inter their dead by torchlight said the lassieis there a glenallan dead een now  we might be a dead and buried too said maggie for onything ye wad ken about itand then raising her voice to the stretch of her motherinlaws comprehension she added  its the auld countess gudemither  and is she cad hame then at last said the old woman in a voice that seemed to be agitated with much more feeling than belonged to her extreme old age and the general indifference and apathy of her manneris she then called to her last account after her lang race o pride and powero god forgie her  but minnie was asking ye resumed the lesser querist what for the glenallan family aye bury their dead by torchlight  they hae aye dune sae said the grandmother since the time the great earl fell in the sair battle o the harlaw when they say the coronach was cried in ae day from the mouth of the tay to the buck of the cabrach that ye wad hae heard nae other sound but that of lamentation for the great folks that had faen fighting against donald of the isles but the great earls mither was livingthey were a doughty and a dour race the women o the house o glenallanand she wad hae nae coronach cried for her son but had him laid in the silence o midnight in his place o rest without either drinking the dirge or crying the lament she said he had killed enow that day he died for the widows and daughters o the highlanders he had slain to cry the coronach for them they had lost and for her son too and sae she laid him in his gave wi dry eyes and without a groan or a wail and it was thought a proud word o the family and they aye stickit by itand the mair in the latter times because in the nighttime they had mair freedom to perform their popish ceremonies by darkness and in secrecy than in the daylightat least that was the case in my time they wad hae been disturbed in the daytime baith by the law and the commons of fairportthey may be owerlooked now as i have heard the warlds changedi whiles hardly ken whether i am standing or sitting or dead or living  and looking round the fire as if in a state of

she relapsed into silence which she did not break again during the rest of the evening  i wonder what that auld daft beggar carle and our son steenie can be doing out in sic a nicht as this said maggie mucklebackit and her expression of surprise was echoed by her visitor gang awa ane o ye hinnies up to the heugh head and gie them a cry in case theyre within hearing the carcakes will be burnt to a cinder  the little emissary departed but in a few minutes came running back with the loud exclamation eh minnie eh grannie theres a white bogle chasing twa black anes down the heugh  a noise of footsteps followed this singular annunciation and young steenie mucklebackit closely followed by edie ochiltree bounced into the hut they were panting and out of breath the first thing steenie did was to look for the bar of the door which his mother reminded him had been broken up for firewood in the hard winter three years ago for what use she said had the like o them for bars  theres naebody chasing us said the beggar after he had taken his breath were een like the wicked that flee when no one pursueth  troth but we were chased said steenie by a spirit or something little better  it was a man in white on horseback said edie for the soft grund that wadna bear the beast flung him about i wot that weel but i didna think my auld legs could have brought me aff as fast i ran amaist as fast as if i had been at prestonpans   this refers to the flight of the government forces at the battle of prestonpans 1745  hout ye daft gowks said luckie mucklebackit it will hae been some o the riders

the man yonderbut theyll take care o him ye strike ower hard steenie i doubt ye foundered the chield  neer a bit said steenie laughing he has braw broad shouthers and i just took measure o them wi the stang od if i hadna been something short wi him he wad hae knockit your auld hams out lad  weel an i win clear o this scrape said edie ise tempt providence nae mair but i canna think it an unlawfu thing to pit a bit trick on sic a landlouping scoundrel that just lives by tricking honester folk  but what are we to do with this said steenie producing a pocketbook  od guide us man said edie in great alarm what garrd ye touch the gear a very leaf o that pocketbook wad be eneugh to hang us baith  i dinna ken said steenie the book had faen out o his pocket i fancy for i fand it amang my feet when i was graping about to set him on his logs again and i just pat it in my pouch to keep it safe and then came the tramp of horse and you cried rin rin and i had nae mair thought o the book  we maun get it back to the loon some gait or other ye had better take it yoursell i think wi peep o light up to ringan aikwoods i wadna for a hundred pounds it was fund in our hands  steenie undertook to do as he was directed  a bonny night ye hae made ot mr steenie said jenny rintherout who impatient of remaining so long unnoticed now presented herself to the young fishermana bonny night ye hae made ot tramping about wi gaberlunzies and getting yoursell hunted wi worricows when ye suld be sleeping in your bed like your father honest man  this attack called forth a suitable response of rustic raillery from the young fisherman an attack was now commenced upon the carcakes and smoked fish and sustained with great perseverance by assistance of a bicker or two of twopenny ale and a bottle of gin the mendicant then retired to the straw of an outhouse adjoiningthe children had one by one crept into their neststhe old grandmother was deposited in her flockbedsteenie notwithstanding his preceding fatigue had the gallantry to accompany miss rintherout to her own mansion and at what hour he returned the story saith notand the matron of the family having laid the gatheringcoal upon the fire and put things in some sort of order retired to rest the last of the family     chapter sixth                             many great ones           would part with half their states to have the plan                  and credit to beg in the first style                                             beggars bush  old edie was stirring with the lark and his first inquiry was after steenie and the pocketbook the young fisherman had been under the necessity of attending his father before daybreak to avail themselves of the tide but he had promised that immediately on his return the pocketbook with all its contents carefully wrapped up in a piece of sailcloth should be delivered by him to ringan aikwood for dousterswivel the owner  the matron had prepared the morning meal for the family and shouldering her basket of fish tramped sturdily away towards fairport the children were idling round the door for the day was fair and sunshiney the ancient grandame again seated on her wickerchair by the fire had resumed her eternal spindle wholly unmoved by the yelling and screaming of the children and the scolding of the mother which had preceded the dispersion of the family edie had arranged his various bags and was bound for the renewal of his wandering life but first advanced with due courtesy to take his leave of the ancient crone  gude day to ye cummer and mony ane o them i will be back about the foreend oharst and i trust to find ye baith haill and fere  pray that ye may find me in my quiet grave said the old woman in a hollow and sepulchral voice but without the agitation of a single feature  yere auld cummer and sae am i mysell but we maun abide his will well no be forgotten in his good time  nor our deeds neither said the crone whats dune in the body maun be answered in the spirit  i wot thats true and i may weel tak the tale hame to mysell that hae led a misruled and roving life but ye were aye a canny wife were a frailbut ye canna hae sae muckle to bow ye down  less than i might have hadbut mair o far mair than wad sink the stoutest brig eer sailed out o fairport harbourdidna somebody say yestreenat least sae it is borne in on my mind but auld folk hae weak fanciesdid not somebody say that joscelind countess of glenallan was departed frae life  they said the truth whaever said it answered old edie she was buried yestreen by torchlight at st ruths and i like a fule gat a gliff wi seeing the lights and the riders  it was their fashion since the days of the great earl that was killed at harlawthey did it to show scorn that they should die and be buried like other mortals the wives o the house of glenallan wailed nae wail for the husband nor the sister for the brotherbut is she een cad to the lang account  as sure answered edie as we maun a abide it  then ill unlade my mind come ot what will  this she spoke with more alacrity than usually attended her expressions and accompanied her words with an attitude of the hand as if throwing something from her she then raised up her form once tall and still retaining the appearance of having been so though bent with age and rheumatism and stood before the beggar like a mummy animated by some wandering spirit into a temporary resurrection her lightblue eyes wandered to and fro as if she occasionally forgot and again remembered the purpose for which her long and withered hand was searching among the miscellaneous contents of an ample oldfashioned pocket at length she pulled out a small chipbox and opening it took out a handsome ring in which was set a braid of hair composed of two different colours black and light brown twined together encircled with brilliants of considerable value  gudeman she said to ochiltree as ye wad eer deserve mercy ye maun gang my errand to the house of glenallan and ask for the earl  the earl of glenallan cummer ou he winna see ony o the gentles o the country and what likelihood is there that he wad see the like o an auld gaberlunzie  gang your ways and tryand tell him that elspeth o the craigburnfoothell mind me best by that namemaun see him or she be relieved frae her lang pilgrimage and that she sends him that ring in token of the business she wad speak o  ochiltree looked on the ring with some admiration of its apparent value and then carefully replacing it in the box and wrapping it in an old ragged handkerchief he deposited the token in his bosom  weel gudewife he said ise do your bidding or its no be my fault but surely there was never sic a braw propine as this sent to a yerl by an auld fishwife and through the hands of a gaberlunzie beggar  with this reflection edie took up his pikestaff put on his broadbrimmed bonnet and set forth upon his pilgrimage the old woman remained for some time standing in a fixed posture her eyes directed to the door through which her ambassador had departed the appearance of excitation which the conversation had occasioned gradually left her features she sank down upon her accustomed seat and resumed her mechanical labour of the distaff and spindle with her wonted air of apathy  edie ochiltree meanwhile advanced on his journey the distance to glenallan was ten miles a march which the old soldier accomplished in about four hours with the curiosity belonging to his idle trade and animated character he tortured himself the whole way to consider what could be the meaning of this mysterious errand with which he was entrusted or what connection the proud wealthy and powerful earl of glenallan could have with the crimes or penitence of an old doting woman whose rank in life did not greatly exceed that of her messenger he endeavoured to call to memory all that he had ever known or heard of the glenallan family yet having done so remained altogether unable to form a conjecture on the subject he knew that the whole extensive estate of this ancient and powerful family had descended to the countess lately deceased who inherited in a most remarkable degree the stern fierce and unbending character which had distinguished the house of glenallan since they first figured in scottish annals like the rest of her ancestors she adhered zealously to the roman catholic faith and was married to an english gentleman of the same communion and of large fortune who did not survive their union two years the countess was therefore left an early widow with the uncontrolled management of the large estates of her two sons the elder lord geraldin who was to succeed to the title and fortune of glenallan was totally dependent on his mother during her life the second when he came of age assumed the name and arms of his father and took possession of his estate according to the provisions of the countesss marriagesettlement after this period he chiefly resided in england and paid very few and brief visits to his mother and brother and these at length were altogether dispensed with in consequence of his becoming a convert to the reformed religion  but even before this mortal offence was given to its mistress his residence at glenallan offered few inducements to a gay young man like edward geraldin neville though its gloom and seclusion seemed to suit the retired and melancholy habits of his elder brother lord geraldin in the outset of life had been a young man of accomplishment and hopes those who knew him upon his travels entertained the highest expectations of his future career but such fair dawns are often strangely overcast the young nobleman returned to scotland and after living about a year in his mothers society at glenallan house he seemed to have adopted all the stern gloom and melancholy of her character excluded from politics by the incapacities attached to those of his religion and from all lighter avocationas by choice lord geraldin led a life of the strictest retirement his ordinary society was composed of the clergyman of his communion who occasionally visited his mansion and very rarely upon stated occasions of high festival one or two families who still professed the catholic religion were formally entertained at glenallan house but this was all their heretic neighbours knew nothing of the family whatever and even the catholics saw little more than the sumptuous entertainment and solemn parade which was exhibited on those formal occasions from which all returned without knowing whether most to wonder at the stern and stately demeanour of the countess or the deep and gloomy dejection which never ceased for a moment to cloud the features of her son the late event had put him in possession of his fortune and title and the neighbourhood had already begun to conjecture whether gaiety would revive with independence when those who had some occasional acquaintance with the interior of the family spread abroad a report that the earls constitution was undermined by religious austerities and that in all probability he would soon follow his mother to the grave this event was the more probable as his brother had died of a lingering complaint which in the latter years of his life had affected at once his frame and his spirits so that heralds and genealogists were already looking back into their records to discover the heir of this illfated family and lawyers were talking with gleesome anticipation of the probability of a great glenallan cause  as edie ochiltree approached the front of glenallan house an ancient building of great extent the most modern part of which had been designed by the celebrated inigo jones he began to consider in what way he should be most likely to gain access for delivery of his message and after much consideration resolved to send the token to the earl by one of the domestics   supposed to represent glammis castle in forfarshire with which the author was well acquainted  with this purpose he stopped at a cottage where he obtained the means of making up the ring in a sealed packet like a petition addressed forr his hounor the yerl of glenllanthese but being aware that missives delivered at the doors of great houses by such persons as himself do not always make their way according to address edie determined like an old soldier to reconnoitre the ground before he made his final attack as he approached the porters lodge he discovered by the number of poor ranked before it some of them being indigent persons in the vicinity and others itinerants of his own begging professionthat there was about to be a general dole or distribution of charity  a good turn said edie to himself never goes unrewardedill maybe get a good awmous that i wad hae missed but for trotting on this auld wifes errand  accordingly he ranked up with the rest of this ragged regiment assuming a station as near the front as possiblea distinction due as he conceived to his blue gown and badge no less than to his years and experience but he soon found there was another principle of precedence in this assembly to which he had not adverted  are ye a triple man friend that ye press forward sae bauldlyim thinking no for theres nae catholics wear that badge  na na i am no a roman said edie  then shank yoursell awa to the double folk or single folk thats the episcopals or presbyterians yonder its a shame to see a heretic hae sic a lang white beard that would do credit to a hermit  ochiltree thus rejected from the society of the catholic mendicants or those who called themselves such went to station himself with the paupers of the communion of the church of england to whom the noble donor allotted a double portion of his charity but never was a poor occasional conformist more roughly rejected by a highchurch congregation even when that matter was furiously agitated in the days of good queen anne  see to him wi his badge they saidhe hears ane o the kings presbyterian chaplains sough out a sermon on the morning of every birthday and now he would pass himsell for ane o the episcopal church na nawell take care o that  edie thus rejected by rome and prelacy was fain to shelter himself from the laughter of his brethren among the thin group of presbyterians who had either disdained to disguise their religious opinions for the sake of an augmented dole or perhaps knew they could not attempt the imposition without a certainty of detection  the same degree of precedence was observed in the mode of distributing the charity which consisted in bread beef and a piece of money to each individual of all the three classes the almoner an ecclesiastic of grave appearance and demeanour superintended in person the accommodation of the catholic mendicants asking a question or two of each as he delivered the charity and recommending to their prayers the soul of joscelind late countess of glenallan mother of their benefactor the porter distinguished by his long staff headed with silver and by the black gown tufted with lace of the same colour which he had assumed upon the general mourning in the family overlooked the distribution of the dole among the prelatists the lessfavoured kirkfolk were committed to the charge of an aged domestic  as this last discussed some disputed point with the porter his name as it chanced to be occasionally mentioned and then his features struck ochiltree and awakened recollections of former times the rest of the assembly were now retiring when the domestic again approaching the place where edie still lingered said in a strong aberdeenshire accent fat is the auld feelbody deeing that he canna gang avay now that hes gotten baith meat and siller  francis macraw answered edie ochiltree dye no mind fontenoy and keep thegither front and rear  ohon ohon cried francie with a true northcountry yell of recognition naebody could hae said that word but my auld frontrank man edie ochiltree but im sorry to see ye in sic a peer state man  no sae ill aff as ye may think francis but im laith to leave this place without a crack wi you and i kenna when i may see you again for your folk dinna mak protestants welcome and thats ae reason that i hae never been here before  fusht fusht said francie let that flee stick i the wawhen the dirts dry it will rub outand come you awa wi me and ill gie ye something better thau that beef bane man  having then spoke a confidential word with the porter probably to request his connivance and having waited until the almoner had returned into the house with slow and solemn steps francie macraw introduced his old comrade into the court of glenallan house the gloomy gateway of which was surmounted by a huge scutcheon in which the herald and undertaker had mingled as usual the emblems of human pride and of human nothingnessthe countesss hereditary coatofarms with all its numerous quarterings disposed in a lozenge and surrounded by the separate shields of her paternal and maternal ancestry intermingled with scythes hour glasses skulls and other symbols of that mortality which levels all distinctions conducting his friend as speedily as possible along the large paved court macraw led the way through a sidedoor to a small apartment near the servants hall which in virtue of his personal attendance upon the earl of glenallan he was entitled to call his own to produce cold meat of various kinds strong beer and even a glass of spirits was no difficulty to a person of franciss importance who had not lost in his sense of conscious dignity the keen northern prudence which recommended a good understanding with the butler our mendicant envoy drank ale and talked over old stories with his comrade until no other topic of conversation occurring he resolved to take up the theme of his embassy which had for some time escaped his memory  he had a petition to present to the earl he saidfor he judged it prudent to say nothing of the ring not knowing as he afterwards observed how far the manners of a single soldier might have been corrupted by service in a great house   a single soldier means in scotch a private soldier  hout tout man said francie the earl will look at nae petitions but i can giet to the almoner  but it relates to some secret that maybe my lord wad like best to seet himsell  im jeedging thats the very reason that the almoner will be for seeing it the first and foremost  but i hae come a this way on purpose to deliver it francis and ye really maun help me at a pinch  neer speed then if i dinna answered the aberdeenshire man let them be as cankered as they like they can but turn me awa and i was just thinking to ask my discharge and gang down to end my days at inverurie  with this doughty resolution of serving his friend at all ventures since none was to be encountered which could much inconvenience himself francie macraw left the apartment it was long before he returned and when he did his manner indicated wonder and agitation  i am nae seer gin ye be edie ochiltree o carricks company in the fortytwa or gin ye be the deil in his likeness  and what makes ye speak in that gait demanded the astonished mendicant  because my lord has been in sic a distress and surpreese as i neer saw a man in my life but hell see youi got that job cookit he was like a man awa frae himsell for mony minutes and i thought he wad hae swarvt athegitherand fan he cam to himsell he asked fae brought the packetand fat trow ye i said  an auld soger says ediethat does likeliest at a gentles door at a farmers its best to say yere an auld tinkler if ye need ony quarters for maybe the gudewife will hae something to souther  but i said neer ane o the twa answered francis my lord cares as little about the tane as the totherfor hes best to them that can souther up our sins sae i een said the bit paper was brought by an auld man wi a long fite beardhe might be a capeechin freer for fat i kend for he was dressed like an auld palmer sae yell be sent up for fanever he can find mettle to face ye  i wish i was weel through this business thought edie to himself mony folk surmise that the earls no very right in the judgment and wha can say how far he may be offended wi me for taking upon me sae muckle  but there was now no room for retreata bell sounded from a distant part of the mansion and macraw said with a smothered accent as if already in his masters presence thats my lords bellfollow me and step lightly and cannily edie  edie followed his guide who seemed to tread as if afraid of being overheard through a long passage and up a back stair which admitted them into the family apartments they were ample and extensive furnished at such cost as showed the ancient importance and splendour of the family but all the ornaments were in the taste of a former and distant period and one would have almost supposed himself traversing the halls of a scottish nobleman before the union of the crowns the late countess partly from a haughty contempt of the times in which she lived partly from her sense of family pride had not permitted the furniture to be altered or modernized during her residence at glenallan house the most magnificent part of the decorations was a valuable collection of pictures by the best masters whose massive frames were somewhat tarnished by time in this particular also the gloomy taste of the family seemed to predominate there were some fine family portraits by vandyke and other masters of eminence but the collection was richest in the saints and martyrdoms of domenichino velasquez and murillo and other subjects of the same kind which had been selected in preference to landscapes or historical pieces the manner in which these awful and sometimes disgusting subjects were represented harmonized with the gloomy state of the apartmentsa circumstance which was not altogether lost on the old man as he traversed them under the guidance of his quondam fellowsoldier he was about to express some sentiment of this kind but francie imposed silence on him by signs and opening a door at the end of the long picturegallery ushered him into a small antechamber hung with black here they found the almoner with his ear turned to a door opposite that by which they entered in the attitude of one who listens with attention but is at the same time afraid of being detected in the act  the old domestic and churchman started when they perceived each other but the almoner first recovered his recollection and advancing towards macraw said under his breath but with an authoritative tone how dare you approach the earls apartment without knocking and who is this stranger or what has he to do hereretire to the gallery and wait for me there  its impossible just now to attend your reverence answered macraw raising his voice so as to be heard in the next room being conscious that the priest would not maintain the altercation within hearing of his patronthe earls bell has rung  he had scarce uttered the words when it was rung again with greater violence than before and the ecclesiastic perceiving further expostulation impossible lifted his finger at macraw with a menacing attitude as he left the apartment  i telld ye sae said the aberdeen man in a whisper to edie and then proceeded to open the door near which they had observed the chaplain stationed     chapter seventh                               this ring                this little ring with necromantic force                has raised the ghost of pleasure to my fears                conjured the sense of honour and of love                into such shapes they fright me from myself                                      the fatal marriage  the ancient forms of mourning were observed in glenallan house notwithstanding the obduracy with which the members of the family were popularly supposed to refuse to the dead the usual tribute of lamentation it was remarked that when she received the fatal letter announcing the death of her second and as was once believed her favourite son the hand of the countess did not shake nor her eyelid twinkle any more than upon perusal of a letter of ordinary business heaven only knows whether the suppression of maternal sorrow which her pride commanded might not have some effect in hastening her own death it was at least generally supposed that the apoplectic stroke which so soon afterwards terminated her existence was as it were the vengeance of outraged nature for the restraint to which her feelings had been subjected but although lady glenallan forebore the usual external signs of grief she had caused many of the apartments amongst others her own and that of the earl to be hung with the exterior trappings of woe  the earl of glenallan was therefore seated in an apartment hung with black cloth which waved in dusky folds along its lofty walls a screen also covered with black baize placed towards the high and narrow window intercepted much of the broken light which found its way through the stained glass that represented with such skill as the fourteenth century possessed the life and sorrows of the prophet jeremiah the table at which the earl was seated was lighted with two lamps wrought in silver shedding that unpleasant and doubtful light which arises from the mingling of artificial lustre with that of general daylight the same table displayed a silver crucifix and one or two clasped parchment books a large picture exquisitely painted by spagnoletto represented the martyrdom of st stephen and was the only ornament of the apartment  the inhabitant and lord of this disconsolate chamber was a man not past the prime of life yet so broken down with disease and mental misery so gaunt and ghastly that he appeared but a wreck of manhood and when he hastily arose and advanced towards his visitor the exertion seemed almost to overpower his emaciated frame as they met in the midst of the apartment the contrast they exhibited was very striking the hale cheek firm step erect stature and undaunted presence and bearing of the old mendicant indicated patience and content in the extremity of age and in the lowest condition to which humanity can sink while the sunken eye pallid cheek and tottering form of the nobleman with whom he was confronted showed how little wealth power and even the advantages of youth have to do with that which gives repose to the mind and firmness to the frame  the earl met the old man in the middle of the room and having commanded his attendant to withdraw into the gallery and suffer no one to enter the antechamber till he rung the bell awaited with hurried yet fearful impatience until he heard first the door of his apartment and then that of the antechamber shut and fastened by the springbolt when he was satisfied with this security against being overheard lord glenallan came close up to the mendicant whom he probably mistook for some person of a religious order in disguise and said in a hasty yet faltering tone in the name of all our religion holds most holy tell me reverend father what am i to expect from a communication opened by a token connected with such horrible recollections  the old man appalled by a manner so different from what he had expected from the proud and powerful nobleman was at a loss how to answer and in what manner to undeceive him tell me continued the earl in a tone of increasing trepidation and agonytell me do you come to say that all that has been done to expiate guilt so horrible has been too little and too trivial for the offence and to point out new and more efficacious modes of severe penancei will not blench from it fatherlet me suffer the pains of my crime here in the body rather than hereafter in the spirit  edie had now recollection enough to perceive that if he did not interrupt the frankness of lord glenallans admissions he was likely to become the confidant of more than might be safe for him to know he therefore uttered with a hasty and trembling voiceyour lordships honour is mistakeni am not of your persuasion nor a clergyman but with all reverence only puir edie ochiltree the kings bedesman and your honours  this explanation he accompanied by a profound bow after his manner and then drawing himself up erect rested his arm on his staff threw back his long white hair and fixed his eyes upon the earl as he waited for an answer  and you are not then said lord glenallan after a pause of surprise you are not then a catholic priest  god forbid said edie forgetting in his confusion to whom he was speaking i am only the kings bedesman and your honours as i said before  the earl turned hastily away and paced the room twice or thrice as if to recover the effects of his mistake and then coming close up to the mendicant he demanded in a stern and commanding tone what he meant by intruding himself on his privacy and from whence he had got the ring which he had thought proper to send him edie a man of much spirit was less daunted at this mode of interrogation than he had been confused by the tone of confidence in which the earl had opened their conversation to the reiterated question from whom he had obtained the ring he answered composedly from one who was better known to the earl than to him  better known to me fellow said lord glenallan what is your meaningexplain yourself instantly or you shall experience the consequence of breaking in upon the hours of family distress  it was auld elspeth mucklebackit that sent me here said the beggar in order to say  you dote old man said the earl i never heard the namebut this dreadful token reminds me  i mind now my lord said ochiltree she tauld me your lordship would be mair familiar wi her if i cad her elspeth o the craigburnfootshe had that name when she lived on your honours land that is your honours worshipful mothers that was thengrace be wi her  ay said the appalled nobleman as his countenance sunk and his cheek assumed a hue yet more cadaverous that name is indeed written in the most tragic page of a deplorable history but what can she desire of me is she dead or living  living my lord and entreats to see your lordship before she dies for she has something to communicate that hangs upon her very soul and she says she canna flit in peace until she sees you  not until she sees mewhat can that mean but she is doting with age and infirmity i tell thee friend i called at her cottage myself not a twelvemonth since from a report that she was in distress and she did not even know my face or voice  if your honour wad permit me said edie to whom the length of the conference restored a part of his professional audacity and native talkativenessif your honour wad but permit me i wad say under correction of your lordships better judgment that auld elspeths like some of the ancient ruined strengths and castles that ane sees amang the hills there are mony parts of her mind that appear as i may say laid waste and decayed but then theres parts that look the steever and the stronger and the grander because they are rising just like to fragments amaong the ruins o the rest shes an awful woman  she always was so said the earl almost unconsciously echoing the observation of the mendicant she always was different from other womenlikest perhaps to her who is now no more in her temper and turn of mindshe wishes to see me then  before she dies said edie she earnestly entreats that pleasure  it will be a pleasure to neither of us said the earl sternly yet she shall be gratified she lives i think on the seashore to the southward of fairport  just between monkbarns and knockwinnock castle but nearer to monkbarns your lordships honour will ken the laird and sir arthur doubtless  a stare as if he did not comprehend the question was lord glenallans answer edie saw his mind was elsewhere and did not venture to repeat a query which was so little germain to the matter  are you a catholic old man demanded the earl  no my lord said ochiltree stoutly for the remembrance of the unequal division of the dole rose in his mind at the moment i thank heaven i am a good protestant  he who can conscientiously call himself good has indeed reason to thank heaven be his form of christianity what it willbut who is he that shall dare to do so  not i said edie i trust to beware of the sin of presumption  what was your trade in your youth continued the earl  a soldier my lord and mony a sair days kemping ive seen i was to have been made a sergeant but  a soldier then you have slain and burnt and sacked and spoiled  i winna say replied edie that i have been better than my neighboursits a rough tradewars sweet to them that never tried it  and you are now old and miserable asking from precarious charity the food which in your youth you tore from the hand of the poor peasant  i am a beggar it is true my lord but i am nae just sae miserable neither for my sins i hae had grace to repent of them if i might say sae and to lay them where they may be better borne than by me and for my food naebody grudges an auld man a bit and a drinksae i live as i can and am contented to die when i am cad upon  and thus then with little to look back upon that is pleasant or praiseworthy in your past lifewith less to look forward to on this side of eternity you are contented to drag out the rest of your existence go begone and in your age and poverty and weariness never envy the lord of such a mansion as this either in his sleeping or waking momentshere is something for thee  the earl put into the old mans hand five or six guineas edie would perhaps have stated his scruples as upon other occasions to the amount of the benefaction but the tone of lord glenallan was too absolute to admit of either answer or dispute the earl then called his servantsee this old man safe from the castlelet no one ask him any questionsand you friend begone and forget the road that leads to my house  that would be difficult for me said edie looking at the gold which he still held in his hand that would be een difficult since your honour has gien me such gade cause to remember it  lord glenallan stared as hardly comprehending the old mans boldness in daring to bandy words with him and with his hand made him another signal of departure which the mendicant instantly obeyed     chapter eighth                  for he was one in all their idle sport                and like a monarch ruled their little court                the pliant bow he formed the flying ball                the bat the wicket were his labours all                                          crabbes village  francis macraw agreeably to the commands of his master attended the mendicant in order to see him fairly out of the estate without permitting him to have conversation or intercourse with any of the earls dependents or domestics but judiciously considering that the restriction did not extend to himself who was the person entrusted with the convoy he used every measure in his power to extort from edie the nature of his confidential and secret interview with lord glenallan but edie had been in his time accustomed to crossexamination and easily evaded those of his quondam comrade the secrets of grit folk said ochiltree within himself are just like the wild beasts that are shut up in cages keep them hard and fast sneaked up and its a very weel or betterbut ance let them out they will turn and rend you i mind how ill dugald gunn cam aff for letting loose his tongue about the majors leddy and captain bandilier  francis was therefore foiled in his assaults upon the fidelity of the mendicant and like an indifferent chessplayer became at every unsuccessful movement more liable to the counterchecks of his opponent  sae ye uphauld ye had nae particulars to say to my lord but about yer ain matters  ay and about the wee bits o things i had brought frae abroad said edie i kend you popist folk are unco set on the relics that are fetched frae farkirks and sae forth  troth my lord maun be turned feel outright said the domestic an he puts himsell into sic a carfuffle for onything ye could bring him edie  i doubtna ye may say true in the main neighbour replied the beggar but maybe hes had some hard play in his younger days francis and that whiles unsettles folk sair  troth edie and ye may say thatand since its like yell neer come back to the estate or if ye dee that yell no find me there ise een tell you he had a heart in his young time sae wrecked and rent that its a wonder it hasna broken outright lang afore this day  ay say ye sae said ochiltree that maun hae been about a woman i reckon  troth and ye hae guessed it said franciejeest a cusin o his nainmiss eveline neville as they suld hae cad herthere was a sough in the country about it but it was hushed up as the grandees were concernedits mair than twenty years syneay it will be threeandtwenty  ay i was in america then said the mendicant and no in the way to hear the country clashes  there was little clash about it man replied macraw he liked this young leddy ana suld hae married her but his mother fand it out and then the deil gaed oer jock webster at last the peer lass clodded hersell oer the scaur at the craigburnfoot into the sea and there was an end ot  an end ot wi the puir leddy said the mendicant but as i reckon nae end ot wi the yerl  nae end ot till his life makes an end answered the aberdonian  but what for did the auld countess forbid the marriage continued the persevering querist  fat forshe maybe didna weel ken for fat hersell for she gard a bow to her bidding right or wrangbut it was kend the young leddy was inclined to some o the heresies of the countrymair by token she was sib to him nearer than our churchs rule admits of sae the leddy was driven to the desperate act and the yerl has never since held his head up like a man  weel away replied ochiltreeits een queer i neer heard this tale afore  its een queer that ye heard it now for deil ane o the servants durst hae spoken ot had the auld countess been living eh man edie but she was a trimmerit wad hae taen a skeely man to hae squared wi herbut shes in her grave and we may loose our tongues a bit fan we meet a friendbut fare ye weel ediei maun be back to the eveningservice an ye come to inverurie maybe sax months awa dinna forget to ask after francie macraw  what one kindly pressed the other as firmly promised and the friends having thus parted with every testimony of mutual regard the domestic of lord glenallan took his road back to the seat of his master leaving ochiltree to trace onward his habitual pilgrimage  it was a fine summer evening and the worldthat is the little circle which was all in all to the individual by whom it was trodden lay before edie ochiltree for the choosing of his nights quarters when he had passed the less hospitable domains of glenallan he had in his option so many places of refuge for the evening that he was nice and even fastidious in the choice ailie sims public was on the roadside about a mile before him but there would be a parcel of young fellows there on the saturday night and that was a bar to civil conversation other gudemen and gudewives as the farmers and their dames are termed in scotland successively presented themselves to his imagination but one was deaf and could not hear him another toothless and could not make him hear a third had a cross temper and a fourth an illnatured housedog at monkbarns or knockwinnock he was sure of a favourable and hospitable reception but they lay too distant to be conveniently reached that night  i dinna ken how it is said the old man but i am nicer about my quarters this night than ever i mind having been in my life i think having seen a the braws yonder and finding out ane may be happier without them has made me proud o my ain lotbut i wuss it bode me gude for pride goeth before destruction at ony rate the warst barn eer man lay in wad be a pleasanter abode than glenallan house wi a the pictures and black velvet and silver bonnywawlies belonging to it sae ill een settle at ance and put in for ailie sims  as the old man descended the hill above the little hamlet to which he was bending his course the setting sun had relieved its inmates from their labour and the young men availing themselves of the fine evening were engaged in the sport of longbowls on a patch of common while the women and elders looked on the shout the laugh the exclamations of winners and losers came in blended chorus up the path which ochiltree was descending and awakened in his recollection the days when he himself had been a keen competitor and frequently victor in games of strength and agility these remembrances seldom fail to excite a sigh even when the evening of life is cheered by brighter prospects than those of our poor mendicant at that time of day was his natural reflection i would have thought as little about ony auld palmering body that was coming down the edge of kinblythemont as ony o thae stalwart young chiels does eenow about auld edie ochiltree  he was however presently cheered by finding that more importance was attached to his arrival than his modesty had anticipated a disputed cast had occurred between the bands of players and as the gauger favoured the one party and the schoolmaster the other the matter might be said to be taken up by the higher powers the miller and smith also had espoused different sides and considering the vivacity of two such disputants there was reason to doubt whether the strife might be amicably terminated but the first person who caught a sight of the mendicant exclaimed ah here comes auld edie that kens the rules of a country games better than ony man that ever drave a bowl or threw an axletree or putted a stane eitherlets hae nae quarrelling callantswell stand by auld edies judgment  edie was accordingly welcomed and installed as umpire with a general shout of gratulation with all the modesty of a bishop to whom the mitre is proffered or of a new speaker called to the chair the old man declined the high trust and responsibility with which it was proposed to invest him and in requital for his selfdenial and humility had the pleasure of receiving the reiterated assurances of young old and middleaged that he was simply the best qualified person for the office of arbiter in the haill countryside thus encouraged he proceeded gravely to the execution of his duty and strictly forbidding all aggravating expressions on either side he heard the smith and gauger on one side the miller and schoolmaster on the other as junior and senior counsel edies mind however was fully made up on the subject before the pleading began like that of many a judge who must nevertheless go through all the forms and endure in its full extent the eloquence and argumentation of the bar for when all had been said on both sides and much of it said over oftener than once our senior being well and ripely advised pronounced the moderate and healing judgment that the disputed cast was a drawn one and should therefore count to neither party this judicious decision restored concord to the field of players they began anew to arrange their match and their bets with the clamorous mirth usual on such occasions of village sport and the more eager were already stripping their jackets and committing them with their coloured handkerchiefs to the care of wives sisters and mistresses but their mirth was singularly interrupted  on the outside of the group of players began to arise sounds of a description very different from those of sportthat sort of suppressed sigh and exclamation with which the first news of calamity is received by the hearers began to be heard indistinctly a buzz went about among the women of eh sirs sae young and sae suddenly summonedit then extended itself among the men and silenced the sounds of sportive mirth  all understood at once that some disaster had happened in the country and each inquired the cause at his neighbour who knew as little as the querist at length the rumour reached in a distinct shape the ears of edie ochiltree who was in the very centre of the assembly the boat of mucklebackit the fisherman whom we have so often mentioned had been swamped at sea and four men had perished it was affirmed including mucklebackit and his son rumour had in this however as in other cases gone beyond the truth the boat had indeed been overset but stephen or as he was called steenie mucklebackit was the only man who had been drowned although the place of his residence and his mode of life removed the young man from the society of the country folks yet they failed not to pause in their rustic mirth to pay that tribute to sudden calamity which it seldom fails to receive in cases of infrequent occurrence to ochiltree in particular the news came like a knell the rather that he had so lately engaged this young mans assistance in an affair of sportive mischief and though neither loss nor injury was designed to the german adept yet the work was not precisely one in which the latter hours of life ought to be occupied  misfortunes never come alone while ochiltree pensively leaning upon his staff added his regrets to those of the hamlet which bewailed the young mans sudden death and internally blamed himself for the transaction in which he had so lately engaged him the old mans collar was seized by a peaceofficer who displayed his baton in his right hand and exclaimed in the kings name  the gauger and schoolmaster united their rhetoric to prove to the constable and his assistant that he had no right to arrest the kings bedesman as a vagrant and the mute eloquence of the miller and smith which was vested in their clenched fists was prepared to give highland bail for their arbiter his blue gown they said was his warrant for travelling the country  but his blue gown answered the officer is nae protection for assault robbery and murder and my warrant is against him for these crimes  murder said edie murder wha did i eer murder  mr german doustercivil the agent at glenwithershins miningworks  murder doustersnivelhout hes living and lifelike man  nae thanks to you if he be he had a sair struggle for his life if a be true he tells and ye maun answer fort at the bidding of the law  the defenders of the mendicant shrunk back at hearing the atrocity of the charges against him but more than one kind hand thrust meat and bread and pence upon edie to maintain him in the prison to which the officers were about to conduct him  thanks to ye god bless ye a bairnsive gotten out o mony a snare when i was waur deserving o deliverancei shall escape like a bird from the fowler play out your play and never mind mei am mair grieved for the puir lad thats gane than for aught they can do to me  accordingly the unresisting prisoner was led off while he mechanically accepted and stored in his wallets the alms which poured in on every hand and ere he left the hamlet was as deepladen as a government victualler the labour of bearing this accumulating burden was however abridged by the officer procuring a cart and horse to convey the old man to a magistrate in order to his examination and committal  the disaster of steenie and the arrest of edie put a stop to the sports of the village the pensive inhabitants of which began to speculate upon the vicissitudes of human affairs which had so suddenly consigned one of their comrades to the grave and placed their master of the revels in some danger of being hanged the character of dousterswivel being pretty generally known which was in his case equivalent to being pretty generally detested there were many speculations upon the probability of the accusation being malicious but all agreed that if edie ochiltree behoved in all events to suffer upon this occasion it was a great pity he had not better merited his fate by killing dousterswivel outright     chapter ninth                 who is heone that for the

and the poor young fellow steenie mucklebackit is to be buried this morning said our old friend the antiquary as he exchanged his quilted nightgown for an oldfashioned black coat in lieu of the snuffcoloured vestment which he ordinarily wore and i presume it is expected that i should attend the funeral  ou ay answered the faithful caxon officiously brushing the white threads and specks from his patrons habit the body god help us was sae broken against the rocks that theyre fain to hurry the burial the seas a kittle cast as i tell my daughter puir thing when i want her to get up her spirits the sea says i jenny is as uncertain a calling  as the calling of an old periwigmaker thats robbed of his business by crops and the powdertax caxon thy topics of consolation are as ill chosen as they are foreign to the present purpose quid mihi cum faemina what have i to do with thy womankind who have enough and to spare of mine owni pray of you again am i expected by these poor people to attend the funeral of their son  ou doubtless your honour is expected answered caxon weel i wot ye are expected ye ken in this country ilka gentleman is wussed to be sae civil as to see the corpse aff his grounds ye needna gang higher than the loanheadits no expected your honour suld leave the land its just a kelso convoy a step and a half ower the doorstane  a kelso convoy echoed the inquisitive antiquary and why a kelso convoy more than any other  dear sir answered caxon how should i ken its just a byword  caxon answered oldbuck thou art a mere periwigmakerhad i asked ochiltree the question he would have had a legend ready made to my hand  my business replied caxon with more animation than he commonly displayed is with the outside of your honours head as ye are accustomed to say  true caxon true and it is no reproach to a thatcher that he is not an upholsterer  he then took out his memorandumbook and wrote down kelso convoysaid to be a step and a half over the threshold authoritycaxonquaere whence derived mem to write to dr graysteel upon the subject  having made this entry he resumedand truly as to this custom of the landlord attending the body of the peasant i approve it caxon it comes from ancient times and was founded deep in the notions of mutual aid and dependence between the lord and cultivator of the soil and herein i must say the feudal systemas also in its courtesy towards womankind in which it exceededherein i say the feudal usages mitigated and softened the sternness of classical times no man caxon ever heard of a spartan attending the funeral of a helotyet i dare be sworn that john of the girnelye have heard of him caxon  ay ay sir answered caxon naebody can hae been lang in your honours company without hearing of that gentleman  well continued the antiquary i would bet a trifle there was not a kolb kerl or bondsman or peasant ascriptus glebae died upon the monks territories down here but john of the girnel saw them fairly and decently interred  ay but if it like your honour they say he had mair to do wi the births than the burials ha ha ha with a gleeful chuckle  good caxon very goodwhy you shine this morning  and besides added caxon slyly encouraged by his patrons approbation they say too that the catholic priests in thae times gat something for ganging about to burials  right caxon right as my glove by the by i fancy that phrase comes from the custom of pledging a glove as the signal of irrefragable faith right i say as my glove caxonbut we of the protestant ascendency have the more merit in doing that duty for nothing which cost money in the reign of that empress of superstition whom spenser caxon terms in his allegorical phrase                    the daughter of that woman blind                     abessa daughter of corecca slow  but why talk i of these things to theemy poor lovel has spoiled me and taught me to speak aloud when it is much the same as speaking to myself wheres my nephew hector mintyre  hes in the parlour sir wi the leddies  very well said the antiquary i will betake me thither  now monkbarns said his sister on his entering the parlour ye maunna be angry  my dear uncle began miss mintyre  whats the meaning of all this said oldbuck in alarm of some impending bad news and arguing upon the supplicating tone of the ladies as a fortress apprehends an attack from the very first flourish of the trumpet which announces the summonswhats all thiswhat do you bespeak my patience for  no particular matter i should hope sir said hector who with his arm in a sling was seated at the breakfast tablehowever whatever it may amount to i am answerable for it as i am for much more trouble that i have occasioned and for which i have little more than thanks to offer  no no heartily welcome heartily welcomeonly let it be a warning to you said the antiquary against your fits of anger which is a short madnessira furor brevisbut what is this new disaster  my dog sir has unfortunately thrown down  if it please heaven not the lachrymatory from clochnaben interjected oldbuck  indeed uncle said the young lady i am afraidit was that which stood upon the sideboardthe poor thing only meant to eat the pat of fresh butter  in which she has fully succeeded i presume for i see that on the table is salted but that is nothingmy lachrymatory the main pillar of my theory on which i rested to show in despite of the ignorant obstinacy of maccribb that the romans had passed the defiles of these mountains and left behind them traces of their arts and arms is goneannihilatedreduced to such fragments as might be the shreds of a brokenflowerpot                              hector i love thee                   but never more be officer of mine  why really sir i am afraid i should make a bad figure in a regiment of your raising  at least hector i would have you despatch your camp train and travel expeditus or relictis impedimentis you cannot conceive how i am annoyed by this beastshe commits burglary i believe for i heard her charged with breaking into the kitchen after all the doors were locked and eating up a shoulder of mutton our readers if they chance to remember jenny rintherouts precaution of leaving the door open when she went down to the fishers cottage will probably acquit poor juno of that aggravation of guilt which the lawyers call a claustrum fregit and which makes the distinction between burglary and privately stealing   i am truly sorry sir said hector that juno has committed so much disorder but jack muirhead the breaker was never able to bring her under command she has more travel than any bitch i ever knew but  then hector i wish the bitch would travel herself out of my grounds  we will both of us retreat tomorrow or today but i would not willingly part from my mothers brother in unkindness about a paltry pipkin  o brother brother ejaculated miss mintyre in utter despair at this vituperative epithet  why what would you have me call it continued hector it was just such a thing as they use in egypt to cool wine or sherbet or wateri brought home a pair of themi might have brought home twenty  what said oldbuck shaped such as that your dog threw down  yes sir much such a sort of earthen jar as that which was on the sideboard they are in my lodgings at fairport we brought a parcel of them to cool our wine on the passagethey answer wonderfully well if i could think they would in any degree repay your loss or rather that they could afford you pleasure i am sure i should be much honoured by your accepting them  indeed my dear boy i should be highly gratified by possessing them to trace the connection of nations by their usages and the similarity of the implements which they employ has been long my favourite study everything that can illustrate such connections is most valuable to me  well sir i shall be much gratified by your acceptance of them and a few trifles of the same kind and now am i to hope you have forgiven me  o my dear boy you are only thoughtless and foolish  but junoshe is only thoughtless too i assure youthe breaker tells me she has no vice or stubbornness  well i grant juno also a free pardonconditioned that you will imitate her in avoiding vice and stubbornness and that henceforward she banish herself forth of monkbarns parlour  then uncle said the soldier i should have been very sorry and ashamed to propose to you anything in the way of expiation of my own sins or those of my follower that i thought worth your acceptance but now as all is forgiven will you permit the orphannephew to whom you have been a father to offer you a trifle which i have been assured is really curious and which only the cross accident of my wound has prevented my delivering to you before i got it from a french savant to whom i rendered some service after the alexandria affair  the captain put a small ringcase into the antiquarys hands which when opened was found to contain an antique ring of massive gold with a cameo most beautifully executed bearing a head of cleopatra the antiquary broke forth into unrepressed ecstasy shook his nephew cordially by the hand thanked him an hundred times and showed the ring to his sister and niece the latter of whom had the tact to give it sufficient admiration but miss griselda though she had the same affection for her nephew had not address enough to follow the lead  its a bonny thing she said monkbarns and i dare say a valuable but its out omy wayye ken i am nae judge o sic matters  there spoke all fairport in one voice exclaimed oldbuck it is the very spirit of the borough has infected us all i think i have smelled the smoke these two days that the wind has stuck like a remora in the northeastand its prejudices fly farther than its vapours believe me my dear hector were i to walk up the high street of fairport displaying this inestimable gem in the eyes of each one i met no human creature from the provost to the towncrier would stop to ask me its history but if i carried a bale of linen cloth under my arm i could not penetrate to the horsemarket ere i should be overwhelmed with queries about its precise texture and price oh one might parody their brutal ignorance in the words of gray                     weave the warp and weave the woof                    the windingsheet of wit and sense                    dull garment of defensive proof                   gainst all that doth not gather pence  the most remarkable proof of this peaceoffering being quite acceptable was that while the antiquary was in full declamation juno who held him in awe according to the remarkable instinct by which dogs instantly discover those who like or dislike them had peeped several times into the room and encountering nothing very forbidding in his aspect had at length presumed to introduce her full person and finally becoming bold by impunity she actually ate up mr oldbucks toast as looking first at one then at another of his audience he repeated with selfcomplacency                    weave the warp and weave the woof  you remember the passage in the fatal sisters which by the way is not so fine as in the originalbut heyday my toast has vanishedi see which wayah thou type of womankind no wonder they take offence at thy generic appellationso saying he shook his fist at juno who scoured out of the parlourhowever as jupiter according to homer could not rule juno in heaven and as jack muirhead according to hector mintyre has been equally unsuccessful on earth i suppose she must have her own way and this mild censure the brother and sister justly accounted a full pardon for junos offences and sate down well pleased to the morning meal  when breakfast was over the antiquary proposed to his nephew to go down with him to attend the funeral the soldier pleaded the want of a mourning habit  o that does not signifyyour presence is all that is requisite i assure you you will see something that will entertainno thats an improper phrasebut that will interest you from the resemblances which i will point out betwixt popular customs on such occasions and those of the ancients  heaven forgive me thought mintyrei shall certainly misbehave and lose all the credit i have so lately and accidentally gained  when they set out schooled as he was by the warning and entreating looks of his sister the soldier made his resolution strong to give no offence by evincing inattention or impatience but our best resolutions are frail when opposed to our predominant inclinations our antiquaryto leave nothing unexplained had commenced with the funeral rites of the ancient scandinavians when his nephew interrupted him in a discussion upon the age of hills to remark that a large seagull which flitted around them had come twice within shot this error being acknowledged and pardoned oldbuck resumed his disquisition  these are circumstances you ought to attend to and be familiar with my dear hector for in the strange contingencies of the present war which agitates every corner of europe there is no knowing where you may be called upon to serve if in norway for example or denmark or any part of the ancient scania or scandinavia as we term it what could be more convenient than to have at your fingers ends the history and antiquities of that ancient country the officina gentium the mother of modern europe the nursery of those heroes                 stern to inflict and stubborn to endure                          who smiled in death  how animating for example at the conclusion of a weary march to find yourself in the vicinity of a runic monument and discover that you have pitched your tent beside the tomb of a hero  i am afraid sir our mess would be better supplied if it chanced to be in the neighbourhood of a good poultryyard  alas that you should say so no wonder the days of cressy and agincourt are no more when respect for ancient valour has died away in the breasts of the british soldiery  by no means sirby no manner of means i dare say that edward and henry and the rest of these heroes thought of their dinner however before they thought of examining an old tombstone but i assure you we are by no means insensible to the memoir of our fathers fame i used often of an evening to get old rory malpin to sing us songs out of ossian about the battles of fingal and lamon mor and magnus and the spirit of muirartach  and did you believe asked the aroused antiquary did you absolutely believe that stuff of macphersons to be really ancient you simple boy  believe it sirhow could i but believe it when i have heard the songs sung from my infancy  but not the same as macphersons english ossianyoure not absurd enough to say that i hope said the antiquary his brow darkening with wrath  but hector stoutly abode the storm like many a sturdy celt he imagined the honour of his country and native language connected with the authenticity of these popular poems and would have fought kneedeep or forfeited life and land rather than have given up a line of them he therefore undauntedly maintained that rory malpin could repeat the whole book from one end to anotherand it was only upon crossexamination that he explained an assertion so general by adding at least if he was allowed whisky enough he could repeat as long as anybody would hearken to him  ay ay said the antiquary and that i suppose was not very long  why we had our duty sir to attend to and could not sit listening all night to a piper  but do you recollect now said oldbuck setting his teeth firmly together and speaking without opening them which was his custom when contradicteddo you recollect now any of these verses you thought so beautiful and interestingbeing a capital judge no doubt of such things  i dont pretend to much skill uncle but its not very reasonable to be angry with me for admiring the antiquities of my own country more than those of the harolds harfagers and hacos you are so fond of  why these sirthese mighty and unconquered gothswere your ancestors the barebreeched celts whom theysubdued and suffered only to exist like a fearful people in the crevices of the rocks were but their mancipia and serfs  hectors brow now grew red in his turn sir he said i dont understand the meaning of mancipia and serfs but i conceive that such names are very improperly applied to scotch highlanders no man but my mothers brother dared to have used such language in my presence and i pray you will observe that i consider it as neither hospitable handsome kind nor generous usage towards your guest and your kinsman my ancestors mr oldbuck  were great and gallant chiefs i dare say hector and really i did not mean to give you such immense offence in treating a point of remote antiquity a subject on which i always am myself cool deliberate and unimpassioned but you are as hot and hasty as if you were hector and achilles and agamemnon to boot  i am sorry i expressed myself so hastily uncle especially to you who have been so generous and good but my ancestors  no more about it lad i meant them no affrontnone  im glad of it sir for the house of mintyre  peace be with them all every man of them said the antiquary but to return to our subjectdo you recollect i say any of those poems which afforded you such amusement  very hard this thought mintyre that he will speak with such glee of everything which is ancient excepting my family then after some efforts at recollection he added aloud yes siri think i do remember some lines but you do not understand the gaelic language  and will readily excuse hearing it but you can give me some idea of the sense in our own vernacular idiom  i shall prove a wretched interpreter said mintyre running over the original well garnished with aghes aughs and oughs and similar gutterals and then coughing and hawking as if the translation stuck in his throat at length having premised that the poem was a dialogue between the poet oisin or ossian and patrick the tutelar saint of ireland and that it was difficult if not impossible to render the exquisite felicity of the first two or three lines he said the sense was to this purpose                        patrick the psalmsinger             since you will not listen to one of my stories                       though you never heard it before                              i am sorry to tell you                   you are little better than an ass  good good exclaimed the antiquary but go on why this is after all the most admirable foolingi dare say the poet was very right what says the saint  he replies in character said mintyre but you should hear malpin sing the original the speeches of ossian come in upon a strong deep bassthose of patrick are upon a tenor key  like malpins drone and small pipes i suppose said oldbuck well pray go on  well then patrick replies to ossian                       upon my word son of fingal                      while i am warbling the psalms                      the clamour of your old womens tales                      disturbs my devotional exercises  excellentwhy this is better and better i hope saint patrick sung better than blattergowls precentor or it would be hangchoice between the poet and psalmist but what i admire is the courtesy of these two eminent persons towards each other it is a pity there should not be a word of this in macphersons translation  if you are sure of that said mintyre gravely he must have taken very unwarrantable liberties with his original  it will go near to be thought so shortlybut pray proceed  then said mintyre this is the answer of ossian                       dare you compare your psalms                             you son of a  son of a what exclaimed oldbuck  it means i think said the young soldier with some reluctance son of a female dog                             do you compare your psalms                 to the tales of the barearmd fenians  are you sure you are translating that last epithet correctly hector  quite sure sir answered hector doggedly  because i should have thought the nudity might have been quoted as existing in a different part of the body  disdaining to reply to this insinuation hector proceeded in his recitation                          i shall think it no great harm              to wring your bald head from your shoulders  but what is that yonder exclaimed hector interrupting himself  one of the herd of proteus said the antiquarya phoca or seal lying asleep on the beach  upon which mintyre with the eagerness of a young sportsman totally forgot both ossian patrick his uncle and his wound and exclaimingi shall have her i shall have her snatched the walkingstick out of the hand of the astonished antiquary at some risk of throwing him down and set off at full speed to get between the animal and the sea to which element having caught the alarm she was rapidly retreating  not sancho when his master interrupted his account of the combatants of pentapolin with the naked arm to advance in person to the charge of the flock of sheep stood more confounded than oldbuck at this sudden escapade of his nephew  is the devil in him was his first exclamation to go to disturb the brute that was never thinking of himthen elevating his voice hectornephewfoollet alone the phocalet alone the phoca they bite i tell you like furies he minds me no more than a post therethere they are at itgad the phoca has the best of it i am glad to see it said he in the bitterness of his heart though really alarmed for his nephews safetyi am glad to see it with all my heart and spirit  in truth the seal finding her retreat intercepted by the lightfooted soldier confronted him manfully and having sustained a heavy blow without injury she knitted her brows as is the fashion of the animal when incensed and making use at once of her forepaws and her unwieldy strength wrenched the weapon out of the assailants hand overturned him on the sands and scuttled away into the sea without doing him any farther injury captain mintyre a good deal out of countenance at the issue of his exploit just rose in time to receive the ironical congratulations of his uncle upon a single combat worthy to be commemorated by ossian himself since said the antiquary your magnanimous opponent has fled though not upon eagles wings from the foe that was lowegad she walloped away with all the grace of triumph and has carried my stick off also by way of spolia opima  mintyre had little to answer for himself except that a highlander could never pass a deer a seal or a salmon where there was a possibility of having a trial of skill with them and that he had forgot one of his arms was in a sling he also made his fall an apology for returning back to monkbarns and thus escape the farther raillery of his uncle as well as his lamentations for his walkingstick  i cut it he said in the classic woods of hawthornden when i did not expect always to have been a bachelori would not have given it for an ocean of sealso hector hectorthy namesake was born to be the prop of troy and thou to be the plague of monkbarns     chapter tenth               tell me not of it friendwhen the young weep          their tears are lukewarm brinefrom your old eyes              sorrow falls down like haildrops of the north              chilling the furrows of our withered cheeks               cold as our hopes and hardened as our feeling           theirs as they fall sink sightlessours recoil              heap the fair plain and bleaken all before us                                old play  the antiquary being now alone hastened his pace which had been retarded by these various discussions and the rencontre which had closed them and soon arrived before the halfdozen cottages at musselcrag they had now in addition to their usual squalid and uncomfortable appearance the melancholy attributes of the house of mourning the boats were all drawn up on the beach and though the day was fine and the season favourable the chant which is used by the fishers when at sea was silent as well as the prattle of the children and the shrill song of the mother as she sits mending her nets by the door a few of the neighbours some in their antique and wellsaved suits of black others in their ordinary clothes but all bearing an expression of mournful sympathy with distress so sudden and unexpected stood gathered around the door of mucklebackits cottage waiting till the body was lifted as the laird of monkbarns approached they made way for him to enter doffing their hats and bonnets as he passed with an air of melancholy courtesy and he returned their salutes in the same manner  in the inside of the cottage was a scene which our wilkie alone could have painted with that exquisite feeling of nature that characterises his enchanting productions  the body was laid in its coffin within the wooden bedstead which the young fisher had occupied while alive at a little distance stood the father whose rugged weatherbeaten countenance shaded by his grizzled hair had faced many a stormy night and nightlike day he was apparently revolving his loss in his mind with that strong feeling of painful grief peculiar to harsh and rough characters which almost breaks forth into hatred against the world and all that remain in it after the beloved object is withdrawn the old man had made the most desperate efforts to save his son and had only been withheld by main force from renewing them at a moment when without the possibility of assisting the sufferer he must himself have perished all this apparently was boiling in his recollection his glance was directed sidelong towards the coffin as to an object on which he could not stedfastly look and yet from which he could not withdraw his eyes his answers to the necessary questions which were occasionally put to him were brief harsh and almost fierce his family had not yet dared to address to him a word either of sympathy or consolation his masculine wife virago as she was and absolute mistress of the family as she justly boasted herself on all ordinary occasions was by this great loss terrified into silence and submission and compelled to hide from her husbands observation the bursts of her female sorrow as he had rejected food ever since the disaster had happened not daring herself to approach him she had that morning with affectionate artifice employed the youngest and favourite child to present her husband with some nourishment his first action was to put it from him with an angry violence that frightened the child his next to snatch up the boy and devour him with kisses yell be a bra fallow an ye be spared patiebut yell nevernever can bewhat he was to mehe has sailed the coble wi me since he was ten years auld and there wasna the like o him drew a net betwixt this and buchannessthey say folks maun submiti will try  and he had been silent from that moment until compelled to answer the necessary questions we have already noticed such was the disconsolate state of the father  in another corner of the cottage her face covered by her apron which was flung over it sat the motherthe nature of her grief sufficiently indicated by the wringing of her hands and the convulsive agitation of the bosom which the covering could not conceal two of her gossips officiously whispering into her ear the commonplace topic of resignation under irremediable misfortune seemed as if they were endeavouring to stun the grief which they could not console  the sorrow of the children was mingled with wonder at the preparations they beheld around them and at the unusual display of wheaten bread and wine which the poorest peasant or fisher offers to the guests on these mournful occasions and thus their grief for their brothers death was almost already lost in admiration of the splendour of his funeral  but the figure of the old grandmother was the most remarkable of the sorrowing group seated on her accustomed chair with her usual air of apathy and want of interest in what surrounded her she seemed every now and then mechanically to resume the motion of twirling her spindle then to look towards her bosom for the distaff although both had been laid aside she would then cast her eyes about as if surprised at missing the usual implements of her industry and appear struck by the black colour of the gown in which they had dressed her and embarrassed by the number of persons by whom she was surrounded then finally she would raise her head with a ghastly look and fix her eyes upon the bed which contained the coffin of her grandson as if she had at once and for the first time acquired sense to comprehend her inexpressible calamity these alternate feelings of embarrassment wonder and grief seemed to succeed each other more than once upon her torpid features but she spoke not a wordneither had she shed a tearnor did one of the family understand either from look or expression to what extent she comprehended the uncommon bustle around her thus she sat among the funeral assembly like a connecting link between the surviving mourners and the dead corpse which they bewaileda being in whom the light of existence was already obscured by the encroaching shadows of death  when oldbuck entered this house of mourning he was received by a general and silent inclination of the head and according to the fashion of scotland on such occasions wine and spirits and bread were offered round to the guests elspeth as these refreshments were presented surprised and startled the whole company by motioning to the person who bore them to stop then taking a glass in her hand she rose up and as the smile of dotage played upon her shrivelled features she pronounced with a hollow and tremulous voice wishing a your healths sirs and often may we hae such merry meetings  all shrunk from the ominous pledge and set down the untasted liquor with a degree of shuddering horror which will not surprise those who know how many superstitions are still common on such occasions among the scottish vulgar but as the old woman tasted the liquor she suddenly exclaimed with a sort of shriek whats thisthis is winehow should there be wine in my sons houseay she continued with a suppressed groan i mind the sorrowful cause now and dropping the glass from her hand she stood a moment gazing fixedly on the bed in which the coffin of her grandson was deposited and then sinking gradually into her seat she covered her eyes and forehead with her withered and pallid hand  at this moment the clergyman entered the cottage mr blattergowl though a dreadful proser particularly on the subject of augmentations localities teinds and overtures in that session of the general assembly to which unfortunately for his auditors he chanced one year to act as moderator was nevertheless a good man in the old scottish presbyterian phrase godward and manward no divine was more attentive in visiting the sick and afflicted in catechising the youth in instructing the ignorant and in reproving the erring and hence notwithstanding impatience of his prolixity and prejudices personal or professional and notwithstanding moreover a certain habitual contempt for his understanding especially on affairs of genius and taste on which blattergowl was apt to be diffuse from his hope of one day fighting his way to a chair of rhetoric or belles lettres notwithstanding i say all the prejudices excited against him by these circumstances our friend the antiquary looked with great regard and respect on the said blattergowl though i own he could seldom even by his sense of decency and the remonstrances of his womankind be hounded out as he called it to hear him preach but he regularly took shame to himself for his absence when blattergowl came to monkbarns to dinner to which he was always invited of a sunday a mode of testifying his respect which the proprietor probably thought fully as agreeable to the clergyman and rather more congenial to his own habits  to return from a digression which can only serve to introduce the honest clergyman more particularly to our readers mr blattergowl had no sooner entered the hut and received the mute and melancholy salutations of the company whom it contained than he edged himself towards the unfortunate father and seemed to endeavour to slide in a few words of condolence or of consolation but the old man was incapable as yet of receiving either he nodded however gruffly and shook the clergymans hand in acknowledgment of his good intentions but was either unable or unwilling to make any verbal reply  the minister next passed to the mother moving along the floor as slowly silently and gradually as if he had been afraid that the ground would like unsafe ice break beneath his feet or that the first echo of a footstep was to dissolve some magic spell and plunge the hut with all its inmates into a subterranean abyss the tenor of what he had said to the poor woman could only be judged by her answers as halfstifled by sobs illrepressed and by the covering which she still kept over her countenance she faintly answered at each pause in his speechyes sir yesyere very gudeyere very gudenae doubt nae doubtits our duty to submitbut oh dear my poor steenie the pride o my very heart that was sae handsome and comely and a help to his family and a comfort to us a and a pleasure to a that lookit on himoh my bairn my bairn my bairn what for is thou lying thereand eh what for am i left to greet for ye  there was no contending with this burst of sorrow and natural affection oldbuck had repeated recourse to his snuffbox to conceal the tears which despite his shrewd and caustic temper were apt to start on such occasions the female assistants whimpered the men held their bonnets to their faces and spoke apart with each other the clergyman meantime addressed his ghostly consolation to the aged grandmother at first she listened or seemed to listen to what he said with the apathy of her usual unconsciousness but as in pressing this theme he approached so near to her ear that the sense of his words became distinctly intelligible to her though unheard by those who stood more distant her countenance at once assumed that stern and expressive cast which characterized her intervals of intelligence she drew up her head and body shook her head in a manner that showed at least impatience if not scorn of his counsel and waved her hand slightly but with a gesture so expressive as to indicate to all who witnessed it a marked and disdainful rejection of the ghostly consolation proffered to her the minister stepped back as if repulsed and by lifting gently and dropping his hand seemed to show at once wonder sorrow and compassion for her dreadful state of mind the rest of the company sympathized and a stifled whisper went through them indicating how much her desperate and determined manner impressed them with awe and even horror  in the meantime the funeral company was completed by the arrival of one or two persons who had been expected from fairport the wine and spirits again circulated and the dumb show of greeting was anew interchanged the grandame a second time took a glass in her hand drank its contents and exclaimed with a sort of laughha ha i hae tasted wine twice in ae daywhan did i that before think ye cummersnever sinceand the transient glow vanishing from her countenance she set the glass down and sunk upon the settle from whence she had risen to snatch at it  as the general amazement subsided mr oldbuck whose heart bled to witness what he considered as the errings of the enfeebled intellect struggling with the torpid chill of age and of sorrow observed to the clergyman that it was time to proceed with the ceremony the father was incapable of giving directions but the nearest relation of the family made a sign to the carpenter who in such cases goes through the duty of the undertaker to proceed in his office the creak of the screwnails presently announced that the lid of the last mansion of mortality was in the act of being secured above its tenant the last act which separates us for ever even from the mortal relies of the person we assemble to mourn has usually its effect upon the most indifferent selfish and hardhearted with a spirit of contradiction which we may be pardoned for esteeming narrowminded the fathers of the scottish kirk rejected even on this most solemn occasion the form of an address to the divinity lest they should be thought to give countenance to the rituals of rome or of england with much better and more liberal judgment it is the present practice of most of the scottish clergymen to seize this opportunity of offering a prayer and exhortation suitable to make an impression upon the living while they are yet in the very presence of the relics of him whom they have but lately seen such as they themselves and who now is such as they must in their time become but this decent and praiseworthy practice was not adopted at the time of which i am treating or at least mr blattergowl did not act upon it and the ceremony proceeded without any devotional exercise  the coffin covered with a pall and supported upon handspikes by the nearest relatives now only waited the father to support the head as is customary two or three of these privileged persons spoke to him but he only answered by shaking his hand and his head in token of refusal with better intention than judgment the friends who considered this as an act of duty on the part of the living and of decency towards the deceased would have proceeded to enforce their request had not oldbuck interfered between the distressed father and his wellmeaning tormentors and informed them that he himself as landlord and master to the deceased would carry his head to the grave in spite of the sorrowful occasion the hearts of the relatives swelled within them at so marked a distinction on the part of the laird and old alison breck who was present among other fishwomen swore almost aloud his honour monkbarns should never want sax warp of oysters in the season of which fish he was understood to be fond if she should gang to sea and dredge for them hersell in the foulest wind that ever blew and such is the temper of the scottish common people that by this instance of compliance with their customs and respect for their persons mr oldbuck gained more popularity than by all the sums which he had yearly distributed in the parish for purposes of private or general charity  the sad procession now moved slowly forward preceded by the beadles or saulies with their batonsmiserablelooking old men tottering as if on the edge of that grave to which they were marshalling another and clad according to scottish guise with threadbare black coats and huntingcaps decorated with rusty crape monkbarns would probably have remonstrated against this superfluous expense had he been consulted but in doing so he would have given more offence than he gained popularity by condescending to perform the office of chiefmourner of this he was quite aware and wisely withheld rebuke where rebuke and advice would have been equally unavailing in truth the scottish peasantry are still infected with that rage for funeral ceremonial which once distinguished the grandees of the kingdom so much that a sumptuary law was made by the parliament of scotland for the purpose of restraining it and i have known many in the lowest stations who have denied themselves not merely the comforts but almost the necessaries of life in order to save such a sum of money as might enable their surviving friends to bury them like christians as they termed it nor could their faithful executors be prevailed upon though equally necessitous to turn to the use and maintenance of the living the money vainly wasted upon the interment of the dead  the procession to the churchyard at about halfamiles distance was made with the mournful solemnity usual on these occasionsthe body was consigned to its parent earthand when the labour of the gravediggers had filled up the trench and covered it with fresh sod mr oldbuck taking his hat off saluted the assistants who had stood by in melancholy silence and with that adieu dispersed the mourners  the clergyman offered our antiquary his company to walk homeward but mr oldbuck had been so much struck with the deportment of the fisherman and his mother that moved by compassion and perhaps also in some degree by that curiosity which induces us to seek out even what gives us pain to witness he preferred a solitary walk by the coast for the purpose of again visiting the cottage as he passed     chapter eleventh                what is this secret sin this untold tale               that art cannot extract nor penance cleanse                     her muscles hold their place               nor discomposed nor formed to steadiness                no sudden flushing and no faltering lip                                      mysterious mother  the coffin had been borne from the place where it rested the mourners in regular gradation according to their rank or their relationship to the deceased had filed from the cottage while the younger male children were led along to totter after the bier of their brother and to view with wonder a ceremonial which they could hardly comprehend the female gossips next rose to depart and with consideration for the situation of the parents carried along with them the girls of the family to give the unhappy pair time and opportunity to open their hearts to each other and soften their grief by communicating it but their kind intention was without effect the last of them had darkened the entrance of the cottage as she went out and drawn the door softly behind her when the father first ascertaining by a hasty glance that no stranger remained started up clasped his hands wildly above his head uttered a cry of the despair which he had hitherto repressed and in all the impotent impatience of grief half rushed half staggered forward to the bed on which the coffin had been deposited threw himself down upon it and smothering as it were his head among the bedclothes gave vent to the full passion of his sorrow it was in vain that the wretched mother terrified by the vehemence of her husbands afflictionaffliction still more fearful as agitating a man of hardened manners and a robust framesuppressed her own sobs and tears and pulling him by the skirts of his coat implored him to rise and remember that though one was removed he had still a wife and children to comfort and support the appeal came at too early a period of his anguish and was totally unattended to he continued to remain prostrate indicating by sobs so bitter and violent that they shook the bed and partition against which it rested by clenched hands which grasped the bedclothes and by the vehement and convulsive motion of his legs how deep and how terrible was the agony of a fathers sorrow  o what a day is this what a day is this said the poor mother her womanish affliction already exhausted by sobs and tears and now almost lost in terror for the state in which she beheld her husbando what an hour is this and naebody to help a poor lone womano gudemither could ye but speak a word to himwad ye but bid him be comforted  to her astonishment and even to the increase of her fear her husbands mother heard and answered the appeal she rose and walked across the floor without support and without much apparent feebleness and standing by the bed on which her son had extended himself she said rise up my son and sorrow not for him that is beyond sin and sorrow and temptation sorrow is for those that remain in this vale of sorrow and darknessi wha dinna sorrow and wha canna sorrow for ony ane hae maist need that ye should a sorrow for me  the voice of his mother not heard for years as taking part in the active duties of life or offering advice or consolation produced its effect upon her son he assumed a sitting posture on the side of the bed and his appearance attitude and gestures changed from those of angry despair to deep grief and dejection the grandmother retired to her nook the mother mechanically took in her hand her tattered bible and seemed to read though her eyes were drowned with tears  they were thus occupied when a loud knock was heard at the door  hegh sirs said the poor mother wha is that can be coming in that gate eenowthey canna hae heard o our misfortune im sure  the knock being repeated she rose and opened the door saying querulously whatna gaits that to disturb a sorrowfu house  a tall man in black stood before her whom she instantly recognised to be lord glenallan is there not he said an old woman lodging in this or one of the neighbouring cottages called elspeth who was long resident at craigburnfoot of glenallan  its my gudemither my lord said margaret but she canna see onybody eenowohon were dreeing a sair weirdwe hae had a heavy dispensation  god forbid said lord glenallan that i should on light occasion disturb your sorrowbut my days are numberedyour motherinlaw is in the extremity of age and if i see her not today we may never meet on this side of time  and what answered the desolate mother wad ye see at an auld woman broken down wi age and sorrow and heartbreak gentle or semple shall not darken my door the day my bairns been carried out a corpse  while she spoke thus indulging the natural irritability of disposition and profession which began to mingle itself with her grief when its first uncontrolled bursts were gone by she held the door about onethird part open and placed herself in the gap as if to render the visitors entrance impossible but the voice of her husband was heard from withinwhas that maggie what for are ye steaking them outlet them come in it doesna signify an auld ropes end wha comes in or wha gaes out o this house frae this time forward  the woman stood aside at her husbands command and permitted lord glenallan to enter the hut the dejection exhibited in his broken frame and emaciated countenance formed a strong contrast with the effects of grief as they were displayed in the rude and weatherbeaten visage of the fisherman and the masculine features of his wife he approached the old woman as she was seated on her usual settle and asked her in a tone as audible as his voice could make it are you elspeth of the craigburnfoot of glenallan  wha is it that asks about the unhallowed residence of that evil woman was the answer returned to his query  the unhappy earl of glenallan  earlearl of glenallan  he who was called william lord geraldin said the earl and whom his mothers death has made earl of glenallan  open the bole said the old woman firmly and hastily to her daughterinlaw open the bole wi speed that i may see if this be the right lord geraldinthe son of my mistresshim that i received in my arms within the hour after he was bornhim that has reason to curse me that i didna smother him before the hour was past  the window which had been shut in order that a gloomy twilight might add to the solemnity of the funeral meeting was opened as she commanded and threw a sudden and strong light through the smoky and misty atmosphere of the stifling cabin falling in a stream upon the chimney the rays illuminated in the way that rembrandt would have chosen the features of the unfortunate nobleman and those of the old sibyl who now standing upon her feet and holding him by one hand peered anxiously in his features with her lightblue eyes and holding her long and withered forefinger within a small distance of his face moved it slowly as if to trace the outlines and reconcile what she recollected with that she now beheld as she finished her scrutiny she said with a deep sigh its a sairsair change and whas fault is itbut thats written down where it will be rememberedits written on tablets of brass with a pen of steel where all is recorded that is done in the fleshand what she said after a pause what is lord geraldin seeking from a poor auld creature like me thats dead already and only belongs sae far to the living that she isna yet laid in the moulds  nay answered lord glenallan in the name of heaven why was it that you requested so urgently to see meand why did you back your request by sending a token which you knew well i dared not refuse  as he spoke thus he took from his purse the ring which edie ochiltree had delivered to him at glenallan house the sight of this token produced a strange and instantaneous effect upon the old woman the palsy of fear was immediately added to that of age and she began instantly to search her pockets with the tremulous and hasty agitation of one who becomes first apprehensive of having lost something of great importancethen as if convinced of the reality of her fears she turned to the earl and demanded and how came ye by it thenhow came ye by it i thought i had kept it sae securelywhat will the countess say  you know said the earl at least you must have heard that my mother is dead  dead are ye no imposing upon me has she left a at last lands and lordship and lineages  all all said the earl as mortals must leave all human vanities  i mind now answered elspethi heard of it before but there has been sic distress in our house since and my memory is sae muckle impaired but ye are sure your mother the lady countess is gane hame  the earl again assured her that her former mistress was no more  then said elspeth it shall burden my mind nae langerwhen she lived wha dared to speak what it would hae displeased her to hae had noised abroad but shes ganeand i will confess all  then turning to her son and daughterinlaw she commanded them imperatively to quit the house and leave lord geraldin for so she still called him alone with her but maggie mucklebackit her first burst of grief being over was by no means disposed in her own house to pay passive obedience to the commands of her motherinlaw an authority which is peculiarly obnoxious to persons in her rank of life and which she was the more astonished at hearing revived when it seemed to have been so long relinquished and forgotten  it was an unco thing she said in a grumbling tone of voicefor the rank of lord glenallan was somewhat imposingit was an unco thing to bid a mother leave her ain house wi the tear in her ee the moment her eldest son had been carried a corpse out at the door ot  the fisherman in a stubborn and sullen tone added to the same purpose this is nae day for your auldwarld stories mother my lord if he be a lord may ca some other dayor he may speak out what he has gotten to say if he likes it theres nane here will think it worth their while to listen to him or you either but neither for laird or loon gentle or semple will i leave my ain house to pleasure onybody on the very day my poor  here his voice choked and he could proceed no farther but as he had risen when lord glenallan came in and had since remained standing he now threw himself doggedly upon a seat and remained in the sullen posture of one who was determined to keep his word  but the old woman whom this crisis seemed to repossess in all those powers of mental superiority with which she had once been eminently gifted arose and advancing towards him said with a solemn voice my son as ye wad shun hearing of your mothers shameas ye wad not willingly be a witness of her guiltas ye wad deserve her blessing and avoid her curse i charge ye by the body that bore and that nursed ye to leave me at freedom to speak with lord geraldin what nae mortal ears but his ain maun listen to obey my words that when ye lay the moulds on my headand oh that the day were comeye may remember this hour without the reproach of having disobeyed the last earthly command that ever your mother wared on you  the terms of this solemn charge revived in the fishermans heart the habit of instinctive obedience in which his mother had trained him up and to which he had submitted implicitly while her powers of exacting it remained entire the recollection mingled also with the prevailing passion of the moment for glancing his eye at the bed on which the dead body had been laid he muttered to himself he never disobeyed me in reason or out o reason and what for should i vex her then taking his reluctant spouse by the arm he led her gently out of the cottage and latched the door behind them as he left it  as the unhappy parents withdrew lord glenallan to prevent the old woman from relapsing into her lethargy again pressed her on the subject of the communication which she proposed to make to him  ye will have it sune eneugh she repliedmy minds clear eneugh now and there is noti think there is nota chance of my forgetting what i have to say my dwelling at craigburnfoot is before my een as it were present in realitythe green bank with its selvidge just where the burn met wi the seathe twa little barks wi their sails furled lying in the natural cove which it formedthe high cliff that joined it with the pleasuregrounds of the house of glenallan and hung right ower the streamah yesi may forget that i had a husband and have lost him that i hae but ane alive of our four fair sonsthat misfortune upon misfortune has devoured our illgotten wealththat they carried the corpse of my sons eldestborn frae the house this morningbut i never can forget the days i spent at bonny craigburnfoot  you were a favourite of my mother said lord glenallan desirous to bring her back to the point from which she was wandering  i was i wasye needna mind me o that she brought me up abune my station and wi knowledge mair than my fellowsbut like the tempter of auld wi the knowledge of gude she taught me the knowledge of evil  for gods sake elspeth said the astonished earl proceed if you can to explain the dreadful hints you have thrown out i well know you are confidant to one dreadful secret which should split this roof even to hear it namedbut speak on farther  i will she saidi willjust bear wi me for a littleand again she seemed lost in recollection but it was no longer tinged with imbecility or apathy she was now entering upon the topic which had long loaded her mind and which doubtless often occupied her whole soul at times when she seemed dead to all around her and i may add as a remarkable fact that such was the intense operation of mental energy upon her physical powers and nervous system that notwithstanding her infirmity of deafness each word that lord glenallan spoke during this remarkable conference although in the lowest tone of horror or agony fell as full and distinct upon elspeths ear as it could have done at any period of her life she spoke also herself clearly distinctly and slowly as if anxious that the intelligence she communicated should be fully understood concisely at the same time and with none of the verbiage or circumlocutory additions natural to those of her sex and condition in short her language bespoke a better education as well as an uncommonly firm and resolved mind and a character of that sort from which great virtues or great crimes may be naturally expected the tenor of her communication is disclosed in the following chapter     chapter twelfth                      remorseshe neer forsakes us             a bloodhound staunchshe tracks our rapid step             through the wild labyrinth of youthful frenzy             unheard perchance until old age hath tamed us          then in our lair when time hath chilled our joints              and maimed our hope of combat or of flight              we hear her deepmouthed bay announcing all              of wrath and wo and punishment that bides us                                             old play  i need not tell you said the old woman addressing the earl of glenallan that i was the favourite and confidential attendant of joscelind countess of glenallan whom god assoilziehere she crossed herselfand i think farther ye may not have forgotten that i shared her regard for mony years i returned it by the maist sincere attachment but i fell into disgrace frae a trifling act of disobedience reported to your mother by ane that thought and she wasna wrang that i was a spy upon her actions and yours  i charge thee woman said the earl in a voice trembling with passion name not her name in my hearing  i must returned the penitent firmly and calmly or how can you understand me  the earl leaned upon one of the wooden chairs of the hut drew his hat over his face clenched his hands together set his teeth like one who summons up courage to undergo a painful operation and made a signal to her to proceed  i say then she resumed that my disgrace with my mistress was chiefly owing to miss eveline neville then bred up in glenallan house as the daughter of a cousingerman and intimate friend of your father that was gane there was muckle mystery in her historybut wha dared to inquire farther than the countess liked to tellall in glenallan house loved miss nevilleall but twa your mother and mysellwe baith hated her  god for what reason since a creature so mild so gentle so formed to inspire affection never walked on this wretched world  it may hae been sae rejoined elspeth but your mother hated a that cam of your fathers familya but himsell her reasons related to strife which fell between them soon after her marriage the particulars are naething to this purpose but oh doubly did she hate eveline neville when she perceived that there was a growing kindness atween you and that unfortunate young leddy ye may mind that the countesss dislike didna gang farther at first than just showing o the cauld shoutherat least it wasna seen farther but at the lang run it brak out into such downright violence that miss neville was even fain to seek refuge at knockwinnock castle with sir arthurs leddy wha god sain her was then wi the living  you rend my heart by recalling these particularsbut go onand may my present agony be accepted as additional penance for the involuntary crime  she had been absent some months continued elspeth when i was ae night watching in my hut the return of my husband from fishing and shedding in private those bitter tears that my proud spirit wrung frae me whenever i thought on my disgrace the sneck was drawn and the countess your mother entered my dwelling i thought i had seen a spectre for even in the height of my favour this was an honour she had never done me and she looked as pale and ghastly as if she had risen from the grave she sat down and wrung the draps from her hair and cloakfor the night was drizzling and her walk had been through the plantations that were a loaded with dew i only mention these things that you may understand how weel that night lives in my memoryand weel it may i was surprised to see her but i durstna speak first mair than if i had seen a phantom na i durst not my lord i that hae seen mony sights of terror and never shook at them sae after a silence she said elspeth cheyne for she always gave me my maiden name are not ye the daughter of that reginald cheyne who died to save his master lord glenallan on the field of sheriffmuir and i answered her as proudly as hersell nearlyas sure as you are the daughter of that earl of glenallan whom my father saved that day by his own death  here she made a deep pause  and what followedwhat followedfor heavens sake good womanbut why should i use that wordyet good or bad i command you to tell me  and little i should value earthly command answered elspeth were there not a voice that has spoken to me sleeping and waking that drives me forward to tell this sad tale aweel my lordthe countess said to me my son loves eveline nevillethey are agreedthey are plighted should they have a son my right over glenallan mergesi sink from that moment from a countess into a miserable stipendiary dowager i who brought lands and vassals and high blood and ancient fame to my husband i must cease to be mistress when my son has an heirmale but i care not for thathad he married any but one of the hated nevilles i had been patient but for themthat they and their descendants should enjoy the right and honours of my ancestors goes through my heart like a twoedged dirk and this girli detest herand i answered for my heart kindled at her words that her hate was equalled by mine  wretch exclaimed the earl in spite of his determination to preserve silencewretched woman what cause of hate could have arisen from a being so innocent and gentle  i hated what my mistress hated as was the use with the liege vassals of the house of glenallan for though my lord i married under my degree yet an ancestor of yours never went to the field of battle but an ancestor of the frail demented auld useless wretch wha now speaks with you carried his shield before him but that was not a continued the beldam her earthly and evil passions rekindling as she became heated in her narrationthat was not a i hated miss eveline neville for her ain sake i brought her frae england and during our whole journey she gecked and scorned at my northern speech and habit as her southland leddies and kimmers had done at the boardingschool as they cald itand strange as it may seem she spoke of an affront offered by a heedless schoolgirl without intention with a degree of inveteracy which at such a distance of time a mortal offence would neither have authorized or excited in any wellconstituted mindyes she scorned and jested at mebut let them that scorn the tartan fear the dirk  she paused and then went onbut i deny not that i hated her mair than she deserved my mistress the countess persevered and said elspeth cheyne this unruly boy will marry with the false english blood were days as they have been i could throw her into the massymore of glenallan and fetter him in the keep of strathbonnel   massamora an ancient name for a dungeon derived from the moorish language perhaps as far back as the time of the crusades  but these times are past and the authority which the nobles of the land should exercise is delegated to quibbling lawyers and their baser dependants hear me elspeth cheyne if you are your fathers daughter as i am mine i will find means that they shall not marry she walks often to that cliff that overhangs your dwelling to look for her lovers boatye may remember the pleasure ye then took on the sea my lordlet him find her forty fathom lower than he expectsyes ye may stare and frown and clench your hand but as sure as i am to face the only being i ever fearedand oh that i had feared him mairthese were your mothers words what avails it to me to lie to youbut i wadna consent to stain my hand with bloodthen she said by the religion of our holy church they are ower sibb thegither but i expect nothing but that both will become heretics as well as disobedient reprobatesthat was her addition to that argument and then as the fiend is ever ower busy wi brains like mine that are subtle beyond their use and station i was unhappily permitted to addbut they might be brought to think themselves sae sibb as no christian law will permit their wedlock  here the earl of glenallan echoed her words with a shriek so piercing as almost to rend the roof of the cottageah then eveline neville was not thethe  the daughter ye would say of your father continued elspeth nobe it a torment or be it a comfort to youken the truth she was nae mair a daughter of your fathers house than i am  woman deceive me notmake me not curse the memory of the parent i have so lately laid in the grave for sharing in a plot the most cruel the most infernal  bethink ye my lord geraldin ere ye curse the memory of a parent thats gane is there none of the blood of glenallan living whose faults have led to this dreadfu catastrophe  mean you my brotherhe too is gone said the earl  no replied the sibyl i mean yoursell lord geraldin had you not transgressed the obedience of a son by wedding eveline neville in secret while a guest at knockwinnock our plot might have separated you for a time but would have left at least your sorrows without remorse to canker them but your ain conduct had put poison in the weapon that we threw and it pierced you with the mair force because ye cam rushing to meet it had your marriage been a proclaimed and acknowledged action our stratagem to throw an obstacle into your way that couldna be got ower neither wad nor could hae been practised against ye  great heaven said the unfortunate noblemanit is as if a film fell from my obscured eyes yes i now well understand the doubtful hints of consolation thrown out by my wretched mother tending indirectly to impeach the evidence of the horrors of which her arts had led me to believe myself guilty  she could not speak mair plainly answered elspeth without confessing her ain fraudand she would have submitted to be torn by wild horses rather than unfold what she had done and if she had still lived so would i for her sake they were stout hearts the race of glenallan male and female and sae were a that in auld times cried their gatheringword of clochnabenthey stood shouther to shouthernae man parted frae his chief for love of gold or of gain or of right or of wrang the times are changed i hear now  the unfortunate nobleman was too much wrapped up in his own confused and distracted reflections to notice the rude expressions of savage fidelity in which even in the latest ebb of life the unhappy author of his misfortunes seemed to find a stern and stubborn source of consolation  great heaven he exclaimed i am then free from a guilt the most horrible with which man can be stained and the sense of which however involuntary has wrecked my peace destroyed my health and bowed me down to an untimely grave accept he fervently uttered lifting his eyes upwards accept my humble thanks if i live miserable at least i shall not die stained with that unnatural guiltand thouproceed if thou hast more to tellproceed while thou hast voice to speak it and i have powers to listen  yes answered the beldam the hour when you shall hear and i shall speak is indeed passing rapidly away death has crossed your brow with his finger and i find his grasp turning every day coulder at my heart interrupt me nae mair with exclamations and groans and accusations but hear my tale to an end and thenif ye be indeed sic a lord of glenallan as i hae heard of in my daymake your merrymen gather the thorn and the brier and the green hollin till they heap them as high as the houseriggin and burn burn burn the auld witch elspeth and a that can put ye in mind that sic a creature ever crawled upon the land  go on said the earl go oni will not again interrupt you  he spoke in a halfsuffocated yet determined voice resolved that no irritability on his part should deprive him of this opportunity of acquiring proofs of the wonderful tale he then heard but elspeth had become exhausted by a continuous narration of such unusual length the subsequent part of her story was more broken and though still distinctly intelligible in most parts had no longer the lucid conciseness which the first part of her narrative had displayed to such an astonishing degree lord glenallan found it necessary when she had made some attempts to continue her narrative without success to prompt her memory by demandingwhat proofs she could propose to bring of the truth of a narrative so different from that which she had originally told  the evidence she replied of eveline nevilles real birth was in the countesss possession with reasons for its being for some time kept privatethey may yet be found if she has not destroyed them in the left hand drawer of the ebony cabinet that stood in the dressingroom these she meant to suppress for the time until you went abroad again when she trusted before your return to send miss neville back to her ain country or to get her settled in marriage  but did you not show me letters of my fathers which seemed to me unless my senses altogether failed me in that horrible moment to avow his relationship toto the unhappy  we did and with my testimony how could you doubt the fact or her either but we suppressed the true explanation of these letters and that was that your father thought it right the young leddy should pass for his daughter for a while on account osome family reasons that were amang them  but wherefore when you learned our union was this dreadful artifice persisted in  it wasna she replied till lady glenallan had communicated this fause tale that she suspected ye had actually made a marriagenor even then did you avow it sae as to satisfy her whether the ceremony had in verity passed atween ye or nobut ye remember o ye canna but remember weel what passed in that awfu meeting  woman you swore upon the gospels to the fact which you now disavow  i didand i wad hae taen a yet mair holy pledge on it if there had been anei wad not hae spared the blood of my body or the guilt of my soul to serve the house of glenallan  wretch do you call that horrid perjury attended with consequences yet more dreadfuldo you esteem that a service to the house of your benefactors  i served her wha was then the head of glenallan as she required me to serve her the cause was between god and her consciencethe manner between god and mineshe is gane to her account and i maun follow have i taulds you a  no answered lord glenallanyou have yet more to tellyou have to tell me of the death of the angel whom your perjury drove to despair stained as she thought herself with a crime so horrible speak truthwas that dreadfulwas that horrible incidenthe could scarcely articulate the wordswas it as reported or was it an act of yet further though not more atrocious cruelty inflicted by others  i understand you said elspeth but report spoke truthour false witness was indeed the cause but the deed was her ain distracted act on that fearfu disclosure when ye rushed frae the countesss presence and saddled your horse and left the castle like a fireflaught the countess hadna yet discovered your private marriage she hadna fund out that the union which she had framed this awfu tale to prevent had een taen place ye fled from the house as if the fire o heaven was about to fa upon it and miss neville atween reason and the want ot was put under sure ward but the ward sleept and the prisoner wakedthe window was openthe way was before herthere was the cliff and there was the seao when will i forget that  and thus died said the earl even so as was reported  no my lord i had gane out to the covethe tide was in and it flowed as yell remember to the foot o that cliffit was a great convenience that for my husbands tradewhere am i wanderingi saw a white object dart frae the tap o the cliff like a seamaw through the mist and then a heavy flash and sparkle of the waters showed me it was a human creature that had faen into the waves i was bold and strong and familiar with the tide i rushed in and grasped her gown and drew her out and carried her on my shouthersi could hae carried twa sic thencarried her to my hut and laid her on my bed neighbours cam and brought help but the words she uttered in her ravings when she got back the use of speech were such that i was fain to send them awa and get up word to glenallan house the countess sent down her spanish servant teresaif ever there was a fiend on earth in human form that woman was ane she and i were to watch the unhappy leddy and let no other person approachgod knows what teresas part was to hae beenshe tauld it not to mebut heaven took the conclusion in its ain hand the poor leddy she took the pangs of travail before her time bore a male child and died in the arms of meof her mortal enemy ay ye may weepshe was a sightly creature to see tobut think ye if i didna mourn her then that i can mourn her now na na i left teresa wi the dead corpse and newborn babe till i gaed up to take the countesss commands what was to be done late as it was i cad her up and she gard me ca up your brother  my brother  yes lord geraldin een your brother that some said she aye wished to be her heir at ony rate he was the person maist concerned in the succession and heritance of the house of glenallan  and is it possible to believe then that my brother out of avarice to grasp at my inheritance would lend himself to such a base and dreadful stratagem  your mother believed it said the old beldam with a fiendish laughit was nae plot of my making but what they did or said i will not say because i did not hear lang and sair they consulted in the black wainscot dressingroom and when your brother passed through the room where i was waiting it seemed to me and i have often thought sae since syne that the fire of hell was in his cheek and een but he had left some of it with his mother at ony rate she entered the room like a woman demented and the first words she spoke were elspeth cheyne did you ever pull a newbudded flower i answered as ye may believe that i often had then said she ye will ken the better how to blight the spurious and heretical blossom that has sprung forth this night to disgrace my fathers noble housesee hereand she gave me a golden bodkinnothing but gold must shed the blood of glenallan this child is already as one of the dead and since thou and teresa alone ken that it lives let it be dealt upon as ye will answer to me and she turned away in her fury and left me with the bodkin in my handhere it is that and the ring of miss neville are a i hae preserved of my illgotten gearfor muckle was the gear i got and weel hae i keepit the secret but no for the gowd or gear either  her long and bony hand held out to lord glenallan a gold bodkin down which in fancy he saw the blood of his infant trickling  wretch had you the heart  i kenna if i could hae had it or no i returned to my cottage without feeling the ground that i trode on but teresa and the child were gane a that was alive was ganenaething left but the lifeless corpse  and did you never learn my infants fate  i could but guess i have tauld ye your mothers purpose and i ken teresa was a fiend she was never mair seen in scotland and i have heard that she returned to her ain land a dark curtain has faen ower the past and the few that witnessed ony part of it could only surmise something of seduction and suicide you yourself  i knowi know it all answered the earl  you indeed know all that i can sayand now heir of glenallan can you forgive me  illustration lord glenallen and elspeth  ask forgiveness of god and not of man said the earl turning away  and how shall i ask of the pure and unstained what is denied to me by a sinner like mysell if i hae sinned hae i not sufferedhae i had a days peace or an hours rest since these lang wet locks of hair first lay upon my pillow at craigburnfoothas not my house been burned wi my bairn in the cradlehave not my boats been wrecked when a others weatherd the galehave not a that were near and dear to me dreed penance for my sinhas not the fire had its share o themthe winds had their partthe sea had her partand oh she added with a lengthened groan looking first upwards towards heaven and then bending her eyes on the flooro that the earth would take her part thats been lang lang wearying to be joined to it  lord glenallan had reached the door of the cottage but the generosity of his nature did not permit him to leave the unhappy woman in this state of desperate reprobation may god forgive thee wretched woman he said as sincerely as i doturn for mercy to him who can alone grant mercy and may your prayers be heard as if they were mine owni will send a religious man  na nanae priest nae priest she ejaculated and the door of the cottage opening as she spoke prevented her from proceeding     chapter thirteenth            still in his dead hand clenched remain the strings               that thrill his fathers hearteen as the limb           lopped off and laid in grave retains they tell us               strange commerce with the mutilated stump           whose nerves are twinging still in maimed existence                                            old play  the antiquary as we informed the reader in the end of the thirtyfirst chapter tenth had shaken off the company of worthy mr blattergowl although he offered to entertain him with an abstract of the ablest speech he had ever known in the teind court delivered by the procurator for the church in the remarkable case of the parish of gatherem resisting this temptation our senior preferred a solitary path which again conducted him to the cottage of mucklebackit when he came in front of the fishermans hut he observed a man working intently as if to repair a shattered boat which lay upon the beach and going up to him was surprised to find it was mucklebackit himself i am glad he said in a tone of sympathyi am glad saunders that you feel yourself able to make this exertion  and what would ye have me to do answered the fisher gruffly unless i wanted to see four children starve because ane is drowned its weel wi you gentles that can sit in the house wi handkerchers at your een when ye lose a friend but the like o us maun to our wark again if our hearts were beating as hard as my hammer  without taking more notice of oldbuck he proceeded in his labour and the antiquary to whom the display of human nature under the influence of agitating passions was never indifferent stood beside him in silent attention as if watching the progress of the work he observed more than once the mans hard features as if by the force of association prepare to accompany the sound of the saw and hammer with his usual symphony of a rude tune hummed or whistledand as often a slight twitch of convulsive expression showed that ere the sound was uttered a cause for suppressing it rushed upon his mind at length when he had patched a considerable rent and was beginning to mend another his feelings appeared altogether to derange the power of attention necessary for his work the piece of wood which he was about to nail on was at first too long then he sawed it off too short then chose another equally ill adapted for the purpose at length throwing it down in anger after wiping his dim eye with his quivering hand he exclaimed there is a curse either on me or on this auld black bitch of a boat that i have hauled up high and dry and patched and clouted sae mony years that she might drown my poor steenie at the end of them an be dd to her and he flung his hammer against the boat as if she had been the intentional cause of his misfortune then recollecting himself he added yet what needs ane be angry at her that has neither soul nor sensethough i am no that muckle better mysell shes but a rickle o auld rotten deals nailed thegither and warped wi the wind and the seaand i am a dour carle battered by foul weather at sea and land till i am maist as senseless as hersell she maun be mended though again the morning tidethats a thing o necessity  thus speaking he went to gather together his instruments and attempt to resume his labourbut oldbuck took him kindly by the arm come come he said saunders there is no work for you this dayill send down shavings the carpenter to mend the boat and he may put the days work into my accountand you had better not come out tomorrow but stay to comfort your family under this dispensation and the gardener will bring you some vegetables and meal from monkbarns  i thank ye monkbarns answered the poor fisher i am a plainspoken man and hae little to say for mysell i might hae learned fairer fashions frae my mither lang syne but i never saw muckle gude they did her however i thank ye ye were aye kind and neighbourly whatever folk says o your being near and close and i hae often said in thae times when they were ganging to raise up the puir folk against the gentlesi hae often said neer a man should steer a hair touching to monkbarns while steenie and i could wag a fingerand so said steenie too and monkbarns when ye laid his head in the grave and mony thanks for the respect ye saw the mouls laid on an honest lad that likit you weel though he made little phrase about it  oldbuck beaten from the pride of his affected cynicism would not willingly have had any one by on that occasion to quote to him his favourite maxims of the stoic philosophy the large drops fell fast from his own eyes as he begged the father who was now melted at recollecting the bravery and generous sentiments of his son to forbear useless sorrow and led him by the arm towards his own home where another scene awaited our antiquary  as he entered the first person whom he beheld was lord glenallan mutual surprise was in their countenances as they saluted each otherwith haughty reserve on the part of mr oldbuck and embarrassment on that of the earl  my lord glenallan i think said mr oldbuck  yesmuch changed from what he was when he knew mr oldbuck  i do not mean said the antiquary to intrude upon your lordshipi only came to see this distressed family  and you have found one sir who has still greater claims on your compassion  my compassion lord glenallan cannot need my compassion if lord glenallan could need it i think he would hardly ask it  our former acquaintance said the earl  is of such ancient date my lordwas of such short duration and was connected with circumstances so exquisitely painful that i think we may dispense with renewing it  so saying the antiquary turned away and left the hut but lord glenallan followed him into the open air and in spite of a hasty good morning my lord requested a few minutes conversation and the favour of his advice in an important matter  your lordship will find many more capable to advise you my lord and by whom your intercourse will be deemed an honour for me i am a man retired from business and the world and not very fond of raking up the past events of my useless lifeand forgive me if i say i have particular pain in reverting to that period of it when i acted like a fool and your lordship likehe stopped short  like a villain you would say said lord glenallanfor such i must have appeared to you  my lordmy lord i have no desire to hear your shrift said the antiquary  but sir if i can show you that i am more sinned against than sinning that i have been a man miserable beyond the power of description and who looks forward at this moment to an untimely grave as to a haven of rest you will not refuse the confidence which accepting your appearance at this critical moment as a hint from heaven i venture thus to press on you  assuredly my lord i shall shun no longer the continuation of this extraordinary interview  i must then recall to you our occasional meetings upwards of twenty years since at knockwinnock castleand i need not remind you of a lady who was then a member of that family  the unfortunate miss eveline neville my lord i remember it well  towards whom you entertained sentiments  very different from those with which i before and since have regarded her sex her gentleness her docility her pleasure in the studies which i pointed out to her attached my affections more than became my age though that was not then much advancedor the solidity of my character but i need not remind your lordship of the various modes in which you indulged your gaiety at the expense of an awkward and retired student embarrassed by the expression of feelings so new to him and i have no doubt that the young lady joined you in the welldeserved ridiculeit is the way of womankind i have spoken at once to the painful circumstances of my addresses and their rejection that your lordship may be satisfied everything is full in my memory and may so far as i am concerned tell your story without scruple or needless delicacy  i will said lord glenallan but first let me say you do injustice to the memory of the gentlest and kindest as well as to the most unhappy of women to suppose she could make a jest of the honest affection of a man like you frequently did she blame me mr oldbuck for indulging my levity at your expensemay i now presume you will excuse the gay freedoms which then offended youmy state of mind has never since laid me under the necessity of apologizing for the inadvertencies of a light and happy temper  my lord you are fully pardoned said mr oldbuck you should be aware that like all others i was ignorant at the time that i placed myself in competition with your lordship and understood that miss neville was in a state of dependence which might make her prefer a competent independence and the hand of an honest manbut i am wasting timei would i could believe that the views entertained towards her by others were as fair and honest as mine  mr oldbuck you judge harshly  not without cause my lord when i only of all the magistrates of this countyhaving neither like some of them the honour to be connected with your powerful familynor like others the meanness to fear it when i made some inquiry into the manner of miss nevilles deathi shake you my lord but i must be plaini do own i had every reason to believe that she had met most unfair dealing and had either been imposed upon by a counterfeit marriage or that very strong measures had been adopted to stifle and destroy the evidence of a real union and i cannot doubt in my own mind that this cruelty on your lordships part whether coming of your own free will or proceeding from the influence of the late countess hurried the unfortunate young lady to the desperate act by which her life was terminated  you are deceived mr oldbuck into conclusions which are not just however naturally they flow from the circumstances believe me i respected you even when i was most embarrassed by your active attempts to investigate our family misfortunes you showed yourself more worthy of miss neville than i by the spirit with which you persisted in vindicating her reputation even after her death but the firm belief that your wellmeant efforts could only serve to bring to light a story too horrible to be detailed induced me to join my unhappy mother in schemes to remove or destroy all evidence of the legal union which had taken place between eveline and myself and now let us sit down on this bankfor i feel unable to remain longer standingand have the goodness to listen to the extraordinary discovery which i have this day made  they sate down accordingly and lord glenallan briefly narrated his unhappy family historyhis concealed marriagethe horrible invention by which his mother had designed to render impossible that union which had already taken place he detailed the arts by which the countess having all the documents relative to miss nevilles birth in her hands had produced those only relating to a period during which for family reasons his father had consented to own that young lady as his natural daughter and showed how impossible it was that he could either suspect or detect the fraud put upon him by his mother and vouched by the oaths of her attendants teresa and elspeth i left my paternal mansion he concluded as if the furies of hell had driven me forth and travelled with frantic velocity i knew not whither nor have i the slightest recollection of what i did or whither i went until i was discovered by my brother i will not trouble you with an account of my sickbed and recovery or how long afterwards i ventured to inquire after the sharer of my misfortunes and heard that her despair had found a dreadful remedy for all the ills of life the first thing that roused me to thought was hearing of your inquiries into this cruel business and you will hardly wonder that believing what i did believe i should join in those expedients to stop your investigation which my brother and mother had actively commenced the information which i gave them concerning the circumstances and witnesses of our private marriage enabled them to baffle your zeal the clergyman therefore and witnesses as persons who had acted in the matter only to please the powerful heir of glenallan were accessible to his promises and threats and were so provided for that they had no objections to leave this country for another for myself mr oldbuck pursued this unhappy man from that moment i considered myself as blotted out of the book of the living and as having nothing left to do with this world my mother tried to reconcile me to life by every arteven by intimations which i can now interpret as calculated to produce a doubt of the horrible tale she herself had fabricated but i construed all she said as the fictions of maternal affection i will forbear all reproach she is no moreand as her wretched associate said she knew not how the dart was poisoned or how deep it must sink when she threw it from her hand but mr oldbuck if ever during these twenty years there crawled upon earth a living being deserving of your pity i have been that man my food has not nourished memy sleep has not refreshed memy devotions have not comforted meall that is cheering and necessary to man has been to me converted into poison the rare and limited intercourse which i have held with others has been most odious to me i felt as if i were bringing the contamination of unnatural and inexpressible guilt among the gay and the innocent there have been moments when i had thoughts of another descriptionto plunge into the adventures of war or to brave the dangers of the traveller in foreign and barbarous climatesto mingle in political intrigue or to retire to the stern seclusion of the anchorites of our religionall these are thoughts which have alternately passed through my mind but each required an energy which was mine no longer after the withering stroke i had received i vegetated on as i could in the same spotfancy feeling judgment and health gradually decaying like a tree whose bark has been destroyedwhen first the blossoms fade then the boughs until its state resembles the decayed and dying trunk that is now before you do you now pity and forgive me  my lord answered the antiquary much affected my pitymy forgiveness you have not to ask for your dismal story is of itself not only an ample excuse for whatever appeared mysterious in your conduct but a narrative that might move your worst enemies and i my lord was never of the number to tears and to sympathy but permit me to ask what you now mean to do and why you have honoured me whose opinion can be of little consequence with your confidence on this occasion  mr oldbuck answered the earl as i could never have foreseen the nature of that confession which i have heard this day i need not say that i had no formed plan of consulting you or any one upon affairs the tendency of which i could not even have suspected but i am without friends unused to business and by long retirement unacquainted alike with the laws of the land and the habits of the living generation and when most unexpectedly i find myself immersed in the matters of which i know least i catch like a drowning man at the first support that offers you are that support mr oldbuck i have always heard you mentioned as a man of wisdom and intelligencei have known you myself as a man of a resolute and independent spiritand there is one circumstance said he which ought to combine us in some degreeour having paid tribute to the same excellence of character in poor eveline you offered yourself to me in my need and you were already acquainted with the beginning of my misfortunes to you therefore i have recourse for advice for sympathy for support  you shall seek none of them in vain my lord said oldbuck so far as my slender ability extendsand i am honoured by the preference whether it arises from choice or is prompted by chance but this is a matter to be ripely considered may i ask what are your principal views at present  to ascertain the fate of my child said the earl be the consequences what they may and to do justice to the honour of eveline which i have only permitted to be suspected to avoid discovery of the yet more horrible taint to which i was made to believe it liable  and the memory of your mother  must bear its own burden answered the earl with a sigh better that she were justly convicted of deceit should that be found necessary than that others should be unjustly accused of crimes so much more dreadful  then my lord said oldbuck our first business must be to put the information of the old woman elspeth into a regular and authenticated form  that said lord glenallan will be at present i fear impossible she is exhausted herself and surrounded by her distressed family tomorrow perhaps when she is aloneand yet i doubt from her imperfect sense of right and wrong whether she would speak out in any ones presence but my own i am too sorely fatigued  then my lord said the antiquary whom the interest of the moment elevated above points of expense and convenience which had generally more than enough of weight with him i would propose to your lordship instead of returning fatigued as you are so far as to glenallan house or taking the more uncomfortable alternative of going to a bad inn at fairport to alarm all the busybodies of the towni would propose i say that you should be my guest at monkbarns for this night by tomorrow these poor people will have renewed their outofdoors vocationfor sorrow with them affords no respite from labourand we will visit the old woman elspeth alone and take down her examination  after a formal apology for the encroachment lord glenallan agreed to go with him and underwent with patience in their return home the whole history of john of the girnel a legend which mr oldbuck was never known to spare any one who crossed his threshold  the arrival of a stranger of such note with two saddlehorses and a servant in black which servant had holsters on his saddlebow and a coronet upon the holsters created a general commotion in the house of monkbarns jenny rintherout scarce recovered from the hysterics which she had taken on hearing of poor steenies misfortune chased about the turkeys and poultry cackled and screamed louder than they did and ended by killing onehalf too many miss griselda made many wise reflections on the hotheaded wilfulness of her brother who had occasioned such devastation by suddenly bringing in upon them a papist nobleman and she ventured to transmit to mr blattergowl some hint of the unusual slaughter which had taken place in the bassecour which brought the honest clergyman to inquire how his friend monkbarns had got home and whether he was not the worse of being at the funeral at a period so near the ringing of the bell for dinner that the antiquary had no choice left but to invite him to stay and bless the meat miss mintyre had on her part some curiosity to see this mighty peer of whom all had heard as an eastern caliph or sultan is heard of by his subjects and felt some degree of timidity at the idea of encountering a person of whose unsocial habits and stern manners so many stories were told that her fear kept at least pace with her curiosity the aged housekeeper was no less flustered and hurried in obeying the numerous and contradictory commands of her mistress concerning preserves pastry and fruit the mode of marshalling and dishing the dinner the necessity of not permitting the melted butter to run to oil and the danger of allowing junowho though formally banished from the parlour failed not to maraud about the outsettlements of the familyto enter the kitchen  the only inmate of monkbarns who remained entirely indifferent on this momentous occasion was hector mintyre who cared no more for an earl than he did for a commoner and who was only interested in the unexpected visit as it might afford some protection against his uncles displeasure if he harboured any for his not attending the funeral and still more against his satire upon the subject of his gallant but unsuccessful single combat with the phoca or seal  to these the inmates of his household oldbuck presented the earl of glenallan who underwent with meek and subdued civility the prosing speeches of the honest divine and the lengthened apologies of miss griselda oldbuck which her brother in vain endeavoured to abridge before the dinner hour lord glenallan requested permission to retire a while to his chamber mr oldbuck accompanied his guest to the green room which had been hastily prepared for his reception he looked around with an air of painful recollection  i think at length he observed i think mr oldbuck that i have been in this apartment before  yes my lord answered oldbuck upon occasion of an excursion hither from knockwinnockand since we are upon a subject so melancholy you may perhaps remember whose taste supplied these lines from chaucer which now form the motto of the tapestry  i guess said the earl though i cannot recollect she excelled me indeed in literary taste and information as in everything else and it is one of the mysterious dispensations of providence mr oldbuck that a creature so excellent in mind and body should have been cut off in so miserable a manner merely from her having formed a fatal attachment to such a wretch as i am  mr oldbuck did not attempt an answer to this burst of the grief which lay ever nearest to the heart of his guest but pressing lord glenallans hand with one of his own and drawing the other across his shaggy eyelashes as if to brush away a mist that intercepted his sight he left the earl at liberty to arrange himself previous to dinner     chapter fourteenth                             life with you             glows in the brain and dances in the arteries            tis like the wine some joyous guest hath quaffed                  that glads the heart and elevates the fancy                  mine is the poor residuum of the cup              vapid and dull and tasteless only soiling              with its base dregs the vessel that contains it                                             old play  now only think what a man my brother is mr blattergowl for a wise man and a learned man to bring this yerl into our house without speaking a word to a body and theres the distress of thae mucklebackitswe canna get a fin o fishand we hae nae time to send ower to fairport for beef and the muttons but new killedand that silly fliskmahoy jenny rintherout has taen the exies and done naething but laugh and greet the skirl at the tail o the guffaw for twa days successfullyand now we maun ask that strange man thats as grand and as grave as the yerl himsell to stand at the sideboard and i canna gang into the kitchen to direct onything for hes hovering there making some pousowdie for my lord for he doesna eat like ither folk neitherand how to sort the strange servant man at dinner timei am sure mr blattergowl athegither it passes my judgment   pousowdiemiscellaneous mess  truly miss griselda replied the divine monkbarns was inconsiderate he should have taen a day to see the invitation as they do wi the titulars condescendence in the process of valuation and sale but the great man could not have come on a sudden to ony house in this parish where he could have been better served with viversthat i must sayand also that the steam from the kitchen is very gratifying to my nostrilsand if ye have ony household affairs to attend to mrs griselda never make a stranger of mei can amuse mysell very weel with the larger copy of erskines institutes  and taking down from the windowseat that amusing folio the scottish coke upon littleton he opened it as if instinctively at the tenth title of book second of teinds or tythes and was presently deeply wrapped up in an abstruse discussion concerning the temporality of benefices  the entertainment about which miss oldbuck expressed so much anxiety was at length placed upon the table and the earl of glenallan for the first time since the date of his calamity sat at a strangers board surrounded by strangers he seemed to himself like a man in a dream or one whose brain was not fully recovered from the effects of an intoxicating potion relieved as he had that morning been from the image of guilt which had so long haunted his imagination he felt his sorrows as a lighter and more tolerable load but was still unable to take any share in the conversation that passed around him it was indeed of a cast very different from that which he had been accustomed to the bluntness of oldbuck the tiresome apologetic harangues of his sister the pedantry of the divine and the vivacity of the young soldier which savoured much more of the camp than of the court were all new to a nobleman who had lived in a retired and melancholy state for so many years that the manners of the world seemed to him equally strange and unpleasing miss mintyre alone from the natural politeness and unpretending simplicity of her manners appeared to belong to that class of society to which he had been accustomed in his earlier and better days  nor did lord glenallans deportment less surprise the company though a plain but excellent familydinner was provided for as mr blattergowl had justly said it was impossible to surprise miss griselda when her larder was empty and though the antiquary boasted his best port and assimilated it to the falernian of horace lord glenallan was proof to the allurements of both his servant placed before him a small mess of vegetables that very dish the cooking of which had alarmed miss griselda arranged with the most minute and scrupulous neatness he ate sparingly of these provisions and a glass of pure water sparkling from the fountainhead completed his repast such his servant said had been his lordships diet for very many years unless upon the high festivals of the church or when company of the first rank were entertained at glenallan house when he relaxed a little in the austerity of his diet and permitted himself a glass or two of wine but at monkbarns no anchoret could have made a more simple and scanty meal  the antiquary was a gentleman as we have seen in feeling but blunt and careless in expression from the habit of living with those before whom he had nothing to suppress he attacked his noble guest without scruple on the severity of his regimen  a few halfcold greens and potatoesa glass of icecold water to wash them downantiquity gives no warrant for it my lord this house used to be accounted a hospitium a place of retreat for christians but your lordships diet is that of a heathen pythagorean or indian braminnay more severe than either if you refuse these fine apples  i am a catholic you are aware said lord glenallan wishing to escape from the discussion and you know that our church  lays down many rules of mortification proceeded the dauntless antiquary but i never heard that they were quite so rigorously practisedbear witness my predecessor john of the girnel or the jolly abbot who gave his name to this apple my lord  and as he pared the fruit in spite of his sisters o fie monkbarns and the prolonged cough of the minister accompanied by a shake of his huge wig the antiquary proceeded to detail the intrigue which had given rise to the fame of the abbots apple with more slyness and circumstantiality than was at all necessary his jest as may readily be conceived missed fire for this anecdote of conventual gallantry failed to produce the slightest smile on the visage of the earl oldbuck then took up the subject of ossian macpherson and maccribb but lord glenallan had never so much as heard of any of the three so little conversant had he been with modern literature the conversation was now in some danger of flagging or of falling into the hands of mr blattergowl who had just pronounced the formidable word teindfree when the subject of the french revolution was starteda political event on which lord glenallan looked with all the prejudiced horror of a bigoted catholic and zealous aristocrat oldbuck was far from carrying his detestation of its principles to such a length  there were many men in the first constituent assembly he said who held sound whiggish doctrines and were for settling the constitution with a proper provision for the liberties of the people and if a set of furious madmen were now in possession of the government it was he continued what often happened in great revolutions where extreme measures are adopted in the fury of the moment and the state resembles an agitated pendulum which swings from side to side for some time ere it can acquire its due and perpendicular station or it might be likened to a storm or hurricane which passing over a region does great damage in its passage yet sweeps away stagnant and unwholesome vapours and repays in future health and fertility its immediate desolation and ravage  the earl shook his head but having neither spirit nor inclination for debate he suffered the argument to pass uncontested  this discussion served to introduce the young soldiers experiences and he spoke of the actions in which he had been engaged with modesty and at the same time with an air of spirit and zeal which delighted the earl who had been bred up like others of his house in the opinion that the trade of arms was the first duty of man and believed that to employ them against the french was a sort of holy warfare  what would i give said he apart to oldbuck as they rose to join the ladies in the drawingroom what would i give to have a son of such spirit as that young gentlemanhe wants something of address and manner something of polish which mixing in good society would soon give him but with what zeal and animation he expresses himselfhow fond of his professionhow loud in the praise of othershow modest when speaking of himself  hector is much obliged to you my lord replied his uncle gratified yet not so much so as to suppress his consciousness of his own mental superiority over the young soldier i believe in my heart nobody ever spoke half so much good of him before except perhaps the sergeant of his company when was wheedling a highland recruit to enlist with him he is a good lad notwithstanding although he be not quite the hero your lordship supposes him and although my commendations rather attest the kindness than the vivacity of his character in fact his high spirit is a sort of constitutional vehemence which attends him in everything he sets about and is often very inconvenient to his friends i saw him today engage in an animated contest with a phoca or seal sealgh our people more properly call them retaining the gothic guttural gh with as much vehemence as if he had fought against dumouriermarry my lord the phoca had the better as the said dumourier had of some other folks and hell talk with equal if not superior rapture of the good behaviour of a pointer bitch as of the plan of a campaign  he shall have full permission to sport over my grounds said the earl if he is so fond of that exercise  you will bind him to you my lord said monkbarns body and soul give him leave to crack off his birdingpiece at a poor covey of partridges or moorfowl and hes yours for everi will enchant him by the intelligence but o my lord that you could have seen my phoenix lovelthe very prince and chieftain of the youth of this age and not destitute of spirit neitheri promise you he gave my termagant kinsman a quid pro quoa rowland for his oliver as the vulgar say alluding to the two celebrated paladins of charlemagne  after coffee lord glenallan requested a private interview with the antiquary and was ushered to his library  i must withdraw you from your own amiable family he said to involve you in the perplexities of an unhappy man you are acquainted with the world from which i have long been banished for glenallan house has been to me rather a prison than a dwelling although a prison which i had neither fortitude nor spirit to break from  let me first ask your lordship said the antiquary what are your own wishes and designs in this matter  i wish most especially answered lord glenallan to declare my luckless marriage and to vindicate the reputation of the unhappy evelinethat is if you see a possibility of doing so without making public the conduct of my mother  suum cuique tribuito said the antiquary do right to everyone the memory of that unhappy young lady has too long suffered and i think it might be cleared without further impeaching that of your mother than by letting it be understood in general that she greatly disapproved and bitterly opposed the match allforgive me my lordall who ever heard of the late countess of glenallan will learn that without much surprise  but you forget one horrible circumstance mr oldbuck said the earl in an agitated voice  i am not aware of it replied the antiquary  the fate of the infantits disappearance with the confidential attendant of my mother and the dreadful surmises which may be drawn from my conversation with elspeth  if you would have my free opinion my lord answered mr oldbuck and will not catch too rapidly at it as matter of hope i would say that it is very possible the child yet lives for thus much i ascertained by my former inquiries concerning the event of that deplorable evening that a child and woman were carried that night from the cottage at the craigburnfoot in a carriage and four by your brother edward geraldin neville whose journey towards england with these companions i traced for several stages i believed then it was a part of the family compact to carry a child whom you meant to stigmatize with illegitimacy out of that country where chance might have raised protectors and proofs of its rights but i now think that your brother having reason like yourself to believe the child stained with shame yet more indelible had nevertheless withdrawn it partly from regard to the honour of his house partly from the risk to which it might have been exposed in the neighbourhood of the lady glenallan  as he spoke the earl of glenallan grew extremely pale and had nearly fallen from his chairthe alarmed antiquary ran hither and thither looking for remedies but his museum though sufficiently well filled with a vast variety of useless matters contained nothing that could be serviceable on the present or any other occasion as he posted out of the room to borrow his sisters salts he could not help giving a constitutional growl of chagrin and wonder at the various incidents which had converted his mansion first into an hospital for a wounded duellist and now into the sick chamber of a dying nobleman and yet said he i have always kept aloof from the soldiery and the peerage my coenobitium has only next to be made a lyingin hospital and then i trow the transformation will be complete  when he returned with the remedy lord glenallan was much better the new and unexpected light which mr oldbuck had thrown upon the melancholy history of his family had almost overpowered him you think then mr oldbuckfor you are capable of thinking which i am notyou think then that it is possiblethat is not impossiblemy child may yet live  i think said the antiquary it is impossible that it could come to any violent harm through your brothers means he was known to be a gay and dissipated man but not cruel nor dishonourable nor is it possible that if he had intended any foul play he would have placed himself so forward in the charge of the infant as i will prove to your lordship he did  so saying mr oldbuck opened a drawer of the cabinet of his ancestor aldobrand and produced a bundle of papers tied with a black ribband and labelledexaminations etc taken by jonathan oldbuck j p upon the 18th of february 17 a little under was written in a small hand eheu evelina the tears dropped fast from the earls eyes as he endeavoured in vain to unfasten the knot which secured these documents  your lordship said mr oldbuck had better not read these at present agitated as you are and having much business before you you must not exhaust your strength your brothers succession is now i presume your own and it will be easy for you to make inquiry among his servants and retainers so as to hear where the child is if fortunately it shall be still alive  i dare hardly hope it said the earl with a deep sigh why should my brother have been silent to me  nay my lord why should he have communicated to your lordship the existence of a being whom you must have supposed the offspring of  most truethere is an obvious and a kind reason for his being silent if anything indeed could have added to the horror of the ghastly dream that has poisoned my whole existence it must have been the knowledge that such a child of misery existed  then continued the antiquary although it would be rash to conclude at the distance of more than twenty years that your son must needs be still alive because he was not destroyed in infancy i own i think you should instantly set on foot inquiries  it shall be done replied lord glenallan catching eagerly at the hope held out to him the first he had nourished for many yearsi will write to a faithful steward of my father who acted in the same capacity under my brother nevillebut mr oldbuck i am not my brothers heir  indeedi am sorry for that my lordit is a noble estate and the ruins of the old castle of nevillesburgh alone which are the most superb relics of anglonorman architecture in that part of the country are a possession much to be coveted i thought your father had no other son or near relative  he had not mr oldbuck replied lord glenallan but my brother adopted views in politics and a form of religion alien from those which had been always held by our house our tempers had long differed nor did my unhappy mother always think him sufficiently observant to her in short there was a family quarrel and my brother whose property was at his own free disposal availed himself of the power vested in him to choose a stranger for his heir it is a matter which never struck me as being of the least consequencefor if worldly possessions could alleviate misery i have enough and to spare but now i shall regret it if it throws any difficulty in the way of our inquiriesand i bethink me that it may for in case of my having a lawful son of my body and my brother dying without issue my fathers possessions stood entailed upon my son it is not therefore likely that this heir be he who he may will afford us assistance in making a discovery which may turn out so much to his own prejudice  and in all probability the steward your lordship mentions is also in his service said the antiquary  it is most likely and the man being a protestanthow far it is safe to entrust him  i should hope my lord said oldbuck gravely that a protestant may be as trustworthy as a catholic i am doubly interested in the protestant faith my lord my ancestor aldobrand oldenbuck printed the celebrated confession of augsburg as i can show by the original edition now in this house  i have not the least doubt of what you say mr oldbuck replied the earl nor do i speak out of bigotry or intolerance but probably the protestant steward will favour the protestant heir rather than the catholicif indeed my son has been bred in his fathers faithor alas if indeed he yet lives  we must look close into this said oldbuck before committing ourselves i have a literary friend at york with whom i have long corresponded on the subject of the saxon horn that is preserved in the minster there we interchanged letters for six years and have only as yet been able to settle the first line of the inscription i will write forthwith to this gentleman dr dryasdust and be particular in my inquiries concerning the character etc of your brothers heir of the gentleman employed in his affairs and what else may be likely to further your lordships inquiries in the meantime your lordship will collect the evidence of the marriage which i hope can still be recovered  unquestionably replied the earl the witnesses who were formerly withdrawn from your research are still living my tutor who solemnized the marriage was provided for by a living in france and has lately returned to this country as an emigrant a victim of his zeal for loyalty legitimacy and religion  thats one lucky consequence of the french revolution my lordyou must allow that at least said oldbuck but no offence i will act as warmly in your affairs as if i were of your own faith in politics and religion and take my adviceif you want an affair of consequence properly managed put it into the hands of an antiquary for as they are eternally exercising their genius and research upon trifles it is impossible they can be baffled in affairs of importanceuse makes perfectand the corps that is most frequently drilled upon the parade will be most prompt in its exercise upon the day of battle and talking upon that subject i would willingly read to your lordship in order to pass away the time betwixt and supper  i beg i may not interfere with family arrangements said lord glenallan but i never taste anything after sunset  nor i either my lord answered his host notwithstanding it is said to have been the custom of the ancients but then i dine differently from your lordship and therefore am better enabled to dispense with those elaborate entertainments which my womankind that is my sister and niece my lord are apt to place on the table for the display rather of their own housewifery than the accommodation of our wants however a broiled bone or a smoked haddock or an oyster or a slice of bacon of our own curing with a toast and a tankardor something or other of that sort to close the orifice of the stomach before going to bed does not fall under my restriction nor i hope under your lordships  my nosupper is literal mr oldbuck but i will attend you at your meal with pleasure  well my lord replied the antiquary i will endeavour to entertain your ears at least since i cannot banquet your palate what i am about to read to your lordship relates to the upland glens  lord glenallan though he would rather have recurred to the subject of his own uncertainties was compelled to make a sign of rueful civility and acquiescence  the antiquary therefore took out his portfolio of loose sheets and after premising that the topographical details here laid down were designed to illustrate a slight essay upon castrametation which had been read with indulgence at several societies of antiquaries he commenced as follows the subject my lord is the hillfort of quickensbog with the site of which your lordship is doubtless familiarit is upon your storefarm of mantanner in the barony of clochnaben  i think i have heard the names of these places said the earl in answer to the antiquarys appeal  heard the name and the farm brings him six hundred ayearo lord  such was the scarcesubdued ejaculation of the antiquary but his hospitality got the better of his surprise and he proceeded to read his essay with an audible voice in great glee at having secured a patient and as he fondly hoped an interested hearer  quickensbog may at first seem to derive its name from the plant quicken by which scottice we understand couchgrass doggrass or the triticum repens of linnaeus and the common english monosyllable bog by which we mean in popular language a marsh or morassin latin palus but it may confound the rash adopters of the more obvious etymological derivations to learn that the couchgrass or doggrass or to speak scientifically the triticum repens of linnaeus does not grow within a quarter of a mile of this castrum or hillfort whose ramparts are uniformly clothed with short verdant turf and that we must seek a bog or palus at a still greater distance the nearest being that of girdthemear a full halfmile distant the last syllable bog is obviously therefore a mere corruption of the saxon burgh which we find in the various transmutations of burgh burrow brough bruff buff and boff which last approaches very near the sound in questionsince supposing the word to have been originally borgh which is the genuine saxon spelling a slight change such as modern organs too often make upon ancient sounds will produce first bogh and then elisa h or compromising and sinking the guttural agreeable to the common vernacular practice you have either boff or bog as it happens the word quickens requires in like manner to be altereddecomposed as it wereand reduced to its original and genuine sound ere we can discern its real meaning by the ordinary exchange of the qu into wh familiar to the rudest tyro who has opened a book of old scottish poetry we gain either whilkens or whichensborghput we may suppose by way of question as if those who imposed the name struck with the extreme antiquity of the place had expressed in it an interrogation to whom did this fortress belongor it might be whackensburgh from the saxon whacken to strike with the hand as doubtless the skirmishes near a place of such apparent consequence must have legitimated such a derivation etc etc etc  i will be more merciful to my readers than oldbuck was to his guest for considering his opportunities of gaining patient attention from a person of such consequence as lord glenallan were not many he used or rather abused the present to the uttermost     chapter fifteenth                           crabbed age and youth                          cannot live together                          youth is full of

folk i beg pardon for mentioning us twa thegither but it was what he said  the captains a puppy and you are a goose caxon  its very like it may be sae replied the acquiescent barber i am sure your honour kens best  before breakfast lord glenallan who appeared in better spirits than he had evinced in the former evening went particularly through the various circumstances of evidence which the exertions of oldbuck had formerly collected and pointing out the means which he possessed of completing the proof of his marriage expressed his resolution instantly to go through the painful task of collecting and restoring the evidence concerning the birth of eveline neville which elspeth had stated to be in his mothers possession  and yet mr oldbuck he said i feel like a man who receives important tidings ere he is yet fully awake and doubt whether they refer to actual life or are not rather a continuation of his dream this womanthis elspethshe is in the extremity of age and approaching in many respects to dotage have i notit is a hideous questionhave i not been hasty in the admission of her present evidence against that which she formerly gave me to a veryvery different purpose  mr oldbuck paused a moment and then answered with firmnessno my lord i cannot think you have any reason to suspect the truth of what she has told you last from no apparent impulse but the urgency of conscience her confession was voluntary disinterested distinct consistent with itself and with all the other known circumstances of the case i would lose no time however in examining and arranging the other documents to which she has referred and i also think her own statement should be taken down if possible in a formal manner we thought of setting about this together but it will be a relief to your lordship and moreover have a more impartial appearance were i to attempt the investigation alone in the capacity of a magistrate i will do thisat least i will attempt it so soon as i shall see her in a favourable state of mind to undergo an examination  lord glenallan wrung the antiquarys hand in token of grateful acquiescence i cannot express to you he said mr oldbuck how much your countenance and cooperation in this dark and most melancholy business gives me relief and confidence i cannot enough applaud myself for yielding to the sudden impulse which impelled me as it were to drag you into my confidence and which arose from the experience i had formerly of your firmness in discharge of your duty as a magistrate and as a friend to the memory of the unfortunate whatever the issue of these matters may proveand i would fain hope there is a dawn breaking on the fortunes of my house though i shall not live to enjoy its lightbut whatsoever be the issue you have laid my family and me under the most lasting obligation  my lord answered the antiquary i must necessarily have the greatest respect for your lordships family which i am well aware is one of the most ancient in scotland being certainly derived from aymer de geraldin who sat in parliament at perth in the reign of alexander ii and who by the less vouched yet plausible tradition of the country is said to have been descended from the marmor of clochnaben yet with all my veneration for your ancient descent i must acknowledge that i find myself still more bound to give your lordship what assistance is in my limited power from sincere sympathy with your sorrows and detestation at the frauds which have so long been practised upon youbut my lord the matin meal is i see now preparedpermit me to show your lordship the way through the intricacies of my cenobitium which is rather a combination of cells jostled oddly together and piled one upon the top of the other than a regular house i trust you will make yourself some amends for the spare diet of yesterday  but this was no part of lord glenallans system having saluted the company with the grave and melancholy politeness which distinguished his manners his servant placed before him a slice of toasted bread with a glass of fair water being the fare on which he usually broke his fast while the mornings meal of the young soldier and the old antiquary was despatched in much more substantial manner the noise of wheels was heard  your lordships carriage i believe said oldbuck stepping to the window on my word a handsome quadrigafor such according to the best scholium was the vox signata of the romans for a chariot which like that of your lordship was drawn by four horses  and i will venture to say cried hector eagerly gazing from the window that four handsomer or bettermatched bays never were put in harnesswhat fine forehandswhat capital chargers they would make might i ask if they are of your lordships own breeding  iirather believe so said lord glenallan but i have been so negligent of my domestic matters that i am ashamed to say i must apply to calvert looking at the domestic  they are of your lordships own breeding said calvert got by mad tom out of jemina and yarico your lordships brood mares  are there more of the set said lord glenallan  two my lordone rising four the other five off this grass both very handsome  then let dawkins bring them down to monkbarns tomorrow said the earli hope captain mintyre will accept them if they are at all fit for service  captain mintyres eyes sparkled and he was profuse in grateful acknowledgments while oldbuck on the other hand seizing the earls sleeve endeavoured to intercept a present which boded no good to his cornchest and hayloft  my lordmy lordmuch obligedmuch obligedbut hector is a pedestrian and never mounts on horseback in battlehe is a highland soldier moreover and his dress ill adapted for cavalry service even macpherson never mounted his ancestors on horseback though he has the impudence to talk of their being carborneand that my lord is what is running in hectors headit is the vehicular not the equestrian exercise which he envies                  sunt quos curriculo pulverem olympicum                            collegisse juvat  his noddle is running on a curricle which he has neither money to buy nor skill to drive if he had it and i assure your lordship that the possession of two such quadrupeds would prove a greater scrape than any of his duels whether with human foe or with my friend the phoca  you must command us all at present mr oldbuck said the earl politely but i trust you will not ultimately prevent my gratifying my young friend in some way that may afford him pleasure  anything useful my lord said oldbuck but no curriculumi protest he might as rationally propose to keep a quadriga at onceand now i think of it what is that old postchaise from fairport come jingling here fori did not send for it  i did sir said hector rather sulkily for he was not much gratified by his uncles interference to prevent the earls intended generosity nor particularly inclined to relish either the disparagement which he cast upon his skill as a charioteer or the mortifying allusion to his bad success in the adventures of the duel and the seal  you did sir echoed the antiquary in answer to his concise information and pray what may be your business with a postchaise is this splendid equipagethis biga as i may call itto serve for an introduction to a quadriga or a curriculum  really sir replied the young soldier if it be necessary to give you such a specific explanation i am going to fairport on a little business  will you permit me to inquire into the nature of that business hector answered his uncle who loved the exercise of a little brief authority over his relative i should suppose any regimental affairs might be transacted by your worthy deputy the sergeantan honest gentleman who is so good as to make monkbarns his home since his arrival among usi should i say suppose that he may transact any business of yours without your spending a days pay on two doghorses and such a combination of rotten wood cracked glass and leathersuch a skeleton of a postchaise as that before the door  it is not regimental business sir that calls me and since you insist upon knowing i must inform you caxon has brought word this morning that old ochiltree the beggar is to be brought up for examination today previous to his being committed for trial and im going to see that the poor old fellow gets fair playthats all  ayi heard something of this but could not think it serious and pray captain hector who are so ready to be every mans second on all occasions of strife civil or military by land by water or on the seabeach what is your especial concern with old edie ochiltree  he was a soldier in my fathers company sir replied hector and besides when i was about to do a very foolish thing one day he interfered to prevent me and gave me almost as much good advice sir as you could have done yourself  and with the same good effect i dare be sworn for iteh hector come confess it was thrown away  indeed it was sir but i see no reason that my folly should make me less grateful for his intended kindness  bravo hector thats the most sensible thing i ever heard you say but always tell me your plans without reservewhy i will go with you myself man i am sure the old fellow is not guilty and i will assist him in such a scrape much more effectually than you can do besides it will save thee halfaguinea my lada consideration which i heartily pray you to have more frequently before your eyes  lord glenallans politeness had induced him to turn away and talk with the ladies when the dispute between the uncle and nephew appeared to grow rather too animated to be fit for the ear of a stranger but the earl mingled again in the conversation when the placable tone of the antiquary expressed amity having received a brief account of the mendicant and of the accusation brought against him which oldbuck did not hesitate to ascribe to the malice of dousterswivel lord glenallan asked whether the individual in question had not been a soldier formerlyhe was answered in the affirmative  had he not continued his lordship a coarse blue coat or gown with a badgewas he not a tall strikinglooking old man with grey beard and hair who kept his body remarkably erect and talked with an air of ease and independence which formed a strong contrast to his profession  all this is an exact picture of the man refumed oldbuck  why then continued lord glenallan although i fear i can be of no use to him in his present condition yet i owe him a debt of gratitude for being the first person who brought me some tidings of the utmost importance i would willingly offer him a place of comfortable retirement when he is extricated from his present situation  i fear my lord said oldbuck he would have difficulty in reconciling his vagrant habits to the acceptance of your bounty at least i know the experiment has been tried without effect to beg from the public at large he considers as independence in comparison to drawing his whole support from the bounty of an individual he is so far a true philosopher as to be a contemner of all ordinary rules of hours and times when he is hungry he eats when thirsty he drinks when weary he sleeps and with such indifference with respect to the means and appliances about which we make a fuss that i suppose he was never ill dined or ill lodged in his life then he is to a certain extent the oracle of the district through which he travelstheir genealogist their newsman their master of the revels their doctor at a pinch or their divinei promise you he has too many duties and is too zealous in performing them to be easily bribed to abandon his calling but i should be truly sorry if they sent the poor lighthearted old man to lie for weeks in a jail i am convinced the confinement would break his heart  thus finished the conference lord glenallan having taken leave of the ladies renewed his offer to captain mintyre of the freedom of his manors for sporting which was joyously accepted  i can only add he said that if your spirits are not liable to be damped by dull company glenallan house is at all times open to you on two days of the week friday and saturday i keep my apartment which will be rather a relief to you as you will be left to enjoy the society of my almoner mr gladsmoor who is a scholar and a man of the world  hector his heart exulting at the thoughts of ranging through the preserves of glenallan house and over the wellprotected moors of clochnabennay joy of joys the deerforest of strathbonnelmade many acknowledgements of the honour and gratitude he felt mr oldbuck was sensible of the earls attention to his nephew miss mintyre was pleased because her brother was gratified and miss griselda oldbuck looked forward with glee to the potting of whole bags of moorfowl and blackgame of which mr blattergowl was a professed admirer thus which is always the case when a man of rank leaves a private family where he has studied to appear obligingall were ready to open in praise of the earl as soon as he had taken his leave and was wheeled off in his chariot by the four admired bays but the panegyric was cut short for oldbuck and his nephew deposited themselves in the fairport hack which with one horse trotting and the other urged to a canter creaked jingled and hobbled towards that celebrated seaport in a manner that formed a strong contrast to the rapidity and smoothness with which lord glenallans equipage had seemed to vanish from their eyes     chapter sixteenth                yes i love justice wellas well as you do              but since the good dames blind she shall excuse me               if time and reason fitting i prove dumb                   the breath i utter now shall be no means                   to take away from me my breath in future                                           old play  by dint of charity from the townspeople in aid of the load of provisions he had brought with him into durance edie ochiltree had passed a day or twos confinement without much impatience regretting his want of freedom the less as the weather proved broken and rainy  the prison he said wasna sae dooms bad a place as it was cad ye had aye a good roof ower your head to fend aff the weather and if the windows werena glazed it was the mair airy and pleasant for the summer season and there were folk enow to crack wi and he had bread eneugh to eat and what need he fash himsell about the rest ot  the courage of our philosophical mendicant began however to abate when the sunbeams shone fair on the rusty bars of his grated dungeon and a miserable linnet whose cage some poor debtor had obtained permission to attach to the window began to greet them with his whistle  yere in better spirits than i am said edie addressing the bird for i can neither whistle nor sing for thinking o the bonny burnsides and green shaws that i should hae been dandering beside in weather like this but haetheres some crumbs tye an ye are sae merry and troth ye hae some reason to sing an ye kent it for your cage comes by nae faut o your ain and i may thank mysell that i am closed up in this weary place  ochiltrees soliloquy was disturbed by a peaceofficer who came to summon him to attend the magistrate so he set forth in awful procession between two poor creatures neither of them so stout as he was himself to be conducted into the presence of inquisitorial justice the people as the aged prisoner was led along by his decrepit guards exclaimed to each other eh see sic a greyhaired man as that is to have committed a highway robbery wi ae fit in the graveand the children congratulated the officers objects of their alternate dread and sport puggie orrock and jock ormston on having a prisoner as old as themselves  thus marshalled forward edie was presented by no means for the first time before the worshipful bailie littlejohn who contrary to what his name expressed was a tall portly magistrate on whom corporation crusts had not been conferred in vain he was a zealous loyalist of that zealous time somewhat rigorous and peremptory in the execution of his duty and a good deal inflated with the sense of his own power and importanceotherwise an honest wellmeaning and useful citizen  bring him in bring him in he exclaimed upon my word these are awful and unnatural times the very bedesmen and retainers of his majesty are the first to break his laws here has been an old bluegown committing robberyi suppose the next will reward the royal charity which supplies him with his garb pension and begging license by engaging in hightreason or sedition at leastbut bring him in  edie made his obeisance and then stood as usual firm and erect with the side of his face turned a little upward as if to catch every word which the magistrate might address to him to the first general questions which respected only his name and calling the mendicant answered with readiness and accuracy but when the magistrate having caused his clerk to take down these particulars began to inquire whereabout the mendicant was on the night when dousterswivel met with his misfortune edie demurred to the motion can ye tell me now bailie you that understands the law what gude will it do me to answer ony o your questions  goodno good certainly my friend except that giving a true account of yourself if you are innocent may entitle me to set you at liberty  but it seems mair reasonable to me now that you bailie or anybody that has anything to say against me should prove my guilt and no to be bidding me prove my innocence  i dont sit here answered the magistrate to dispute points of law with you i ask you if you choose to answer my question whether you were at ringan aikwood the foresters upon the day i have specified  really sir i dinna feel myself called on to remember replied the cautious bedesman  or whether in the course of that day or night continued the magistrate you saw steven or steenie mucklebackityou knew him i suppose  o brawlie did i ken steenie puir fallow replied the prisonerbut i canna condeshend on ony particular time i have seen him lately  were you at the ruins of st ruth any time in the course of that evening  bailie littlejohn said the mendicant if it be your honours pleasure well cut a lang tale short and ill just tell ye i am no minded to answer ony o thae questionsim ower auld a traveller to let my tongue bring me into trouble  write down said the magistrate that he declines to answer all interrogatories in respect that by telling the truth he might be brought to trouble  na na said ochiltree ill no hae that set down as ony part o my answerbut i just meant to say that in a my memory and practice i never saw ony gude come o answering idle questions  write down said the bailie that being acquainted with judicial interrogatories by long practice and having sustained injury by answering questions put to him on such occasions the declarant refuses  na na bailie reiterated edie ye are no to come in on me that gait neither  dictate the answer yourself then friend said the magistrate and the clerk will take it down from your own mouth  ay ay said ediethats what i ca fair play ise do that without loss o time sae neighbour ye may just write down that edie ochiltree the declarant stands up for the libertyna i maunna say that neitheri am nae libertyboyi hae fought again them in the riots in dublinbesides i have ate the kings bread mony a day stay let me see aywrite that edie ochiltree the bluegown stands up for the prerogativesee that ye spell that word rightits a lang anefor the prerogative of the subjects of the land and winna answer a single word that sall be asked at him this day unless he sees a reason fort put down that young man  then edie said the magistrate since you will give no information on the subject i must send you back to prison till you shall be delivered in due course of law  aweel sir if its heavens will and mans will nae doubt i maun submit replied the mendicant i hae nae great objection to the prison only that a body canna win out ot and if it wad please you as weel bailie i wad gie you my word to appear afore the lords at the circuit or in ony other coart ye like on ony day ye are pleased to appoint  i rather think my good friend answered bailie littlejohn your word might be a slender security where your neck may be in some danger i am apt to think you would suffer the pledge to be forfeited if you could give me sufficient security indeed  at this moment the antiquary and captain mintyre entered the apartmentgood morning to you gentlemen said the magistrate you find me toiling in my usual vocationlooking after the iniquities of the peoplelabouring for the respublica mr oldbuckserving the king our master captain mintyrefor i suppose you know i have taken up the sword  it is one of the emblems of justice doubtless answered the antiquarybut i should have thought the scales would have suited you better bailie especially as you have them ready in the warehouse  very good monkbarnsexcellent but i do not take the sword up as justice but as a soldierindeed i should rather say the musket and bayonetthere they stand at the elbow of my gouty chair for i am scarce fit for drill yeta slight touch of our old acquaintance podagra i can keep my feet however while our sergeant puts me through the manual i should like to know captain mintyre if he follows the regulations correctlyhe brings us but awkwardly to the present and he hobbled towards his weapon to illustrate his doubts and display his proficiency  i rejoice we have such zealous defenders bailie replied mr oldbuck and i dare say hector will gratify you by communicating his opinion on your progress in this new calling why you rival the hecate of the ancients my good sira merchant on the mart a magistrate in the townhouse a soldier on the linksquid non pro patria but my business is with the justice so let commerce and war go slumber  well my good sir said the bailie and what commands have you for me  why heres an old acquaintance of mine called edie ochiltree whom some of your myrmidons have mewed up in jail on account of an alleged assault on that fellow dousterswivel of whose accusation i do not believe one word  the magistrate here assumed a very grave countenance you ought to have been informed that he is accused of robbery as well as assaulta very serious matter indeed it is not often such criminals come under my cognizance  and replied oldbuck you are tenacious of the opportunity of making the very most of such as occur but is this poor old mans case really so very bad  it is rather out of rule said the bailiebut as you are in the commission monkbarns i have no hesitation to show you dousterswivels declaration and the rest of the precognition and he put the papers into the antiquarys hands who assumed his spectacles and sat down in a corner to peruse them  the officers in the meantime had directions to remove their prisoner into another apartment but before they could do so mintyre took an opportunity to greet old edie and to slip a guinea into his hand  lord bless your honour said the old man its a young soldiers gift and it should surely thrive wi an auld ane ise no refuse it though its beyond my rules for if they steek me up here my friends are like eneugh to forget meout osight out omind is a true proverb and it wadna be creditable for me that am the kings bedesman and entitled to beg by word of mouth to be fishing for bawbees out at the jail window wi the fit o a stocking and a string as he made this observation he was conducted out of the apartment  mr dousterswivels declaration contained an exaggerated account of the violence he had sustained and also of his loss  but what i should have liked to have asked him said monkbarns would have been his purpose in frequenting the ruins of st ruth so lonely a place at such an hour and with such a companion as edie ochiltree there is no road lies that way and i do not conceive a mere passion for the picturesque would carry the german thither in such a night of storm and wind depend upon it he has been about some roguery and in all probability hath been caught in a trap of his own settingnec lex justitior ulla  the magistrate allowed there was something mysterious in that circumstance and apologized for not pressing dousterswivel as his declaration was voluntarily emitted but for the support of the main charge he showed the declaration of the aikwoods concerning the state in which dousterswivel was found and establishing the important fact that the mendicant had left the barn in which he was quartered and did not return to it again two people belonging to the fairport undertaker who had that night been employed in attending the funeral of lady glenallan had also given declarations that being sent to pursue two suspicious persons who left the ruins of st ruth as the funeral approached and who it was supposed might have been pillaging some of the ornaments prepared for the ceremony they had lost and regained sight of them more than once owing to the nature of the ground which was unfavourable for riding but had at length fairly lodged them both in mucklebackits cottage and one of the men added that he the declarant having dismounted from his horse and gone close up to the window of the hut he saw the old bluegown and young steenie mucklebackit with others eating and drinking in the inside and also observed the said steenie mucklebackit show a pocketbook to the othersand declarant has no doubt that ochiltree and steenie mucklebackit were the persons whom he and his comrade had pursued as above mentioned and being interrogated why he did not enter the said cottage declares he had no warrant so to do and that as mucklebackit and his family were understood to be roughhanded folk he the declarant had no desire to meddle or make with their affairs causa scientiae patet all which he declares to be truth etc  what do you say to that body of evidence against your friend said the magistrate when he had observed the antiquary had turned the last leaf  why were it in the case of any other person i own i should say it looked prima facie a little ugly but i cannot allow anybody to be in the wrong for beating dousterswivelhad i been an hour younger or had but one single flash of your warlike genius bailie i should have done it myself long ago he is nebulo nebulonum an impudent fraudulent mendacious quack that has cost me a hundred pounds by his roguery and my neighbour sir arthur god knows how much and besides bailie i do not hold him to be a sound friend to government  indeed said bailie littlejohn if i thought that it would alter the question considerably  rightfor in beating him observed oldbuck the bedesman must have shown his gratitude to the king by thumping his enemy and in robbing him he would only have plundered an egyptian whose wealth it is lawful to spoil now suppose this interview in the ruins of st ruth had relation to politicsand this story of hidden treasure and so forth was a bribe from the other side of the water for some great man or the funds destined to maintain a seditious club  my dear sir said the magistrate catching at the idea you hit my very thoughts how fortunate should i be if i could become the humble means of sifting such a matter to the bottomdont you think we had better call out the volunteers and put them on duty  not just yet while podagra deprives them of an essential member of their body but will you let me examine ochiltree  certainly but youll make nothing of him he gave me distinctly to understand he knew the danger of a judicial declaration on the part of an accused person which to say the truth has hanged many an honester man than he is  well but bailie continued oldbuck you have no objection to let me try him  none in the world monkbarns i hear the sergeant belowill rehearse the manual in the meanwhile baby carry my gun and bayonet down to the room belowit makes less noise there when we ground arms and so exit the martial magistrate with his maid behind him bearing his weapons  a good squire that wench for a gouty champion observed oldbuck hector my lad hook on hook ongo with him boykeep him employed man for halfanhour or sobutter him with some warlike termspraise his dress and address  captain mintyre who like many of his profession looked down with infinite scorn on those citizen soldiers who had assumed arms without any professional title to bear them rose with great reluctance observing that he should not know what to say to mr littlejohn and that to see an old gouty shopkeeper attempting the exercise and duties of a private soldier was really too ridiculous  it may be so hector said the antiquary who seldom agreed with any person in the immediate proposition which was laid downit may possibly be so in this and some other instances but at present the country resembles the suitors in a smalldebt court where parties plead in person for lack of cash to retain the professed heroes of the bar i am sure in the one case we never regret the want of the acuteness and eloquence of the lawyers and so i hope in the other we may manage to make shift with our hearts and muskets though we shall lack some of the discipline of you martinets  i have no objection i am sure sir that the whole world should fight if they please if they will but allow me to be quiet said hector rising with dogged reluctance  yes you are a very quiet personage indeed said his uncle whose ardour for quarrelling cannot pass so much as a poor phoca sleeping upon the beach  but hector who saw which way the conversation was tending and hated all allusions to the foil he had sustained from the fish made his escape before the antiquary concluded the sentence     chapter seventeenth              well well at worst tis neither theft nor coinage              granting i knew all that you charge me with             what though the tomb hath borne a second birth              and given the wealth to one that knew not ont                      yet fair exchange was never robbery                          far less pure bounty                                           old play  the antiquary in order to avail himself of the permission given him to question the accused party chose rather to go to the apartment in which ochiltree was detained than to make the examination appear formal by bringing him again into the magistrates office he found the old man seated by a window which looked out on the sea and as he gazed on that prospect large tears found their way as if unconsciously to his eye and from thence trickled down his cheeks and white beard his features were nevertheless calm and composed and his whole posture and mien indicated patience and resignation oldbuck had approached him without being observed and roused him out of his musing by saying kindly i am sorry edie to see you so much cast down about this matter  illustration the antiquary visits edie in prison  the mendicant started dried his eyes very hastily with the sleeve of his gown and endeavouring to recover his usual tone of indifference and jocularity answered but with a voice more tremulous than usual i might weel hae judged monkbarns it was you or the like o you was coming in to disturb mefor its ae great advantage o prisons and courts o justice that ye may greet your een out an ye like and nane o the folk thats concerned about them will ever ask you what its for  well edie replied oldbuck i hope your present cause of distress is not so bad but it may be removed  and i had hoped monkbarns answered the mendicant in a tone of reproach that ye had kend me better than to think that this bit trifling trouble o my ain wad bring tears into my auld een that hae seen far different kind o distressna nabut heres been the puir lass caxons daughter seeking comfort and has gotten unco little theres been nae speerings o taffrils gunbrig since the last gale and folk report on the key that a kings ship had struck on the reef of rattray and a hands lostgod forbid for as sure as you live monkbarns the puir lad lovel that ye liked sae weel must have perished  god forbid indeed echoed the antiquary turning palei would rather monkbarns house were on fire my poor dear friend and coadjutor i will down to the quay instantly  im sure yell learn naething mair than i hae tauld ye sir said ochiltree for the officerfolk here were very civil that is for the like o them and lookit up ae their letters and authorities and could throw nae light ont either ae way or another  it cant be true it shall not be true said the antiquary and i wont believe it if it weretaffrils an excellent sea man and lovel my poor lovel has all the qualities of a safe and pleasant companion by land or by seaone edie whom from the ingenuousness of his disposition i would choose did i ever go a seavoyage which i never do unless across the ferry fragilem mecum solvere phaselum to be the companion of my risk as one against whom the elements could nourish no vengeance no edie it is not and cannot be trueit is a fiction of the idle jade rumour whom i wish hanged with her trumpet about her neck that serves only with its screechowl tones to fright honest folks out of their senseslet me know how you got into this scrape of your own  are ye axing me as a magistrate monkbarns or is it just for your ain satisfaction  for my own satisfaction solely replied the antiquary  put up your pocketbook and your keelyvine pen then for i downa speak out an ye hae writing materials in your handstheyre a scaur to unlearned folk like meod ane o the clerks in the neist room will clink down in black and white as muckle as wad hang a man before ane kens what hes saying  monkbarns complied with the old mans humour and put up his memorandumbook  edie then went with great frankness through the part of the story already known to the reader informing the antiquary of the scene which he had witnessed between dousterswivel and his patron in the ruins of st ruth and frankly confessing that he could not resist the opportunity of decoying the adept once more to visit the tomb of misticot with the purpose of taking a comic revenge upon him for his quackery he had easily persuaded steenie who was a bold thoughtless young fellow to engage in the frolic along with him and the jest had been inadvertently carried a great deal farther than was designed concerning the pocketbook he explained that he had expressed his surprise and sorrow as soon as he found it had been inadvertently brought off and that publicly before all the inmates of the cottage steenie had undertaken to return it the next day and had only been prevented by his untimely fate  the antiquary pondered a moment and then said your account seems very probable edie and i believe it from what i know of the parties but i think it likely that you know a great deal more than you have thought it proper to tell me about this matter of the treasure trovei suspect you have acted the part of the lar familiaris in plautusa sort of brownie edie to speak to your comprehension who watched over hidden treasuresi do bethink me you were the first person we met when sir arthur made his successful attack upon misticots grave and also that when the labourers began to flag you edie were again the first to leap into the trench and to make the discovery of the treasure now you must explain all this to me unless you would have me use you as ill as euclio does staphyla in the aulularia  lordsake sir replied the mendicant what do i ken about your howlowlariaits mair like a dogs language than a mans  you knew however of the box of treasure being there continued oldbuck  dear sir answered edie assuming a countenance of great simplicity what likelihood is there othat dye think sae puir an auld creature as me wad hae kend o sic a like thing without getting some gude out otand ye wot weel i sought nane and gat nane like michael scotts man what concern could i hae wit  thats just what i want you to explain to me said oldbuck for i am positive you knew it was there  your honours a positive man monkbarnsand for a positive man i must needs allow yere often in the right  you allow then edie that my belief is well founded  edie nodded acquiescence  then please to explain to me the whole affair from beginning to end said the antiquary  if it were a secret o mine monkbarns replied the beggar ye suldna ask twice for i hae aye said ahint your back that for a the nonsense maggots that ye whiles take into your head ye are the maist wise and discreet o a our country gentles but ise een be openhearted wi you and tell you that this is a friends secret and that they suld draw me wi wild horses or saw me asunder as they did the children of ammon sooner than i would speak a word mair about the matter excepting this that there was nae ill intended but muckle gude and that the purpose was to serve them that are worth twenty hundred o me but theres nae law i trow that makes it a sin to ken where ither folles siller is if we didna pit hand tilt oursell  oldbuck walked once or twice up and down the room in profound thought endeavouring to find some plausible reason for transactions of a nature so mysteriousbut his ingenuity was totally at fault he then placed himself before the prisoner  this story of yours friend edie is an absolute enigma and would require a second oedipus to solve itwho oedipus was i will tell you some other time if you remind mehowever whether it be owing to the wisdom or to the maggots with which you compliment me i am strongly disposed to believe that you have spoken the truth the rather that you have not made any of those obtestations of the superior powers which i observe you and your comrades always make use of when you mean to deceive folks here edie could not suppress a smile if therefore you will answer me one question i will endeavour to procure your liberation  if yell let me hear the question said edie with the caution of a canny scotchman ill tell you whether ill answer it or no  it is simply said the antiquary did dousterswivel know anything about the concealment of the chest of bullion  he the illfaard loon answered edie with much frankness of manner there wad hae been little speerings ot had dustansnivel kend it was thereit wad hae been butter in the black dogs hause  i thought as much said oldbuck well edie if i procure your freedom you must keep your day and appear to clear me of the bailbond for these are not times for prudent men to incur forfeitures unless you can point out another aulam auri plenam quadrilibremanother search no i  ah said the beggar shaking his head i doubt the birds flown that laid thae golden eggsfor i winna ca her goose though thats the gait it stands in the storybuickbut ill keep my day monkbarns yese no loss a penny by meand troth i wad fain be out again now the weathers fineand then i hae the best chance o hearing the first news o my friends  well edie as the bouncing and thumping beneath has somewhat ceased i presume bailie littlejohn has dismissed his military preceptor and has retired from the labours of mars to those of themisi will have some conversation with himbut i cannot and will not believe any of those wretched news you were telling me  god send your honour may be right said the mendicant as oldbuck left the room  the antiquary found the magistrate exhausted with the fatigues of the drill reposing in his gouty chair humming the air how merrily we live that soldiers be and between each bar comforting himself with a spoonful of mockturtle soup he ordered a similar refreshment for oldbuck who declined it observing that not being a military man he did not feel inclined to break his habit of keeping regular hours for mealssoldiers like you bailie must snatch their food as they find means and time but i am sorry to hear ill news of young taffrils brig  ah poor fellow said the bailie he was a credit to the townmuch distinguished on the first of june  but said oldbuck i am shocked to hear you talk of him in the preterite tense  troth i fear there may be too much reason for it monkbarnsand yet let us hope the best the accident is said to have happened in the rattray reef of rocks about twenty miles to the northward near dirtenalan bayi have sent to inquire about itand your nephew run out himself as if he had been flying to get the gazette of a victory  here hector entered exclaiming as he came in i believe its all a damned liei cant find the least authority for it but general rumour  and pray mr hector said his uncle if it had been true whose fault would it have been that lovel was on board  not mine i am sure answered hector it would have been only my misfortune  indeed said his uncle i should not have thought of that  why sir with all your inclination to find me in the wrong replied the young soldier i suppose you will own my intention was not to blame in this case i did my best to hit lovel and if i had been successful tis clear my scrape would have been his and his scrape would have been mine  and whom or what do you intend to hit now that you are lugging with you that leathern magazine there marked gunpowder  i must be prepared for lord glenallans moors on the twelfth sir said mintyre  ah hector thy great chasse as the french call it would take place best                     omne cum proteus pecus agitaret altos                             visere montes  could you meet but with a martial phoca instead of an unwarlike heathbird  the devil take the seal sir or phoca if you choose to call it so its rather hard one can never hear the end of a little piece of folly like that  well well said oldbuck i am glad you have the grace to be ashamed of itas i detest the whole race of nimrods i wish them all as well matched nay never start off at a jest mani have done with the phocathough i dare say the bailie could tell us the value of sealskins just now  they are up said the magistrate they are well upthe fishing has been unsuccessful lately  we can bear witness to that said the tormenting antiquary who was delighted with the hank this incident had given him over the young sportsman one word more hector and                well hang a sealskin on thy recreant limbs  aha my boy come never mind it i must go to businessbailie a word with you you must take bailmoderate bail you understandfor old ochiltrees appearance  you dont consider what you ask said the bailie the offence is assault and robbery  hush not a word about it said the antiquary i gave you a hint beforei will possess you more fully hereafteri promise you there is a secret  but mr oldbuck if the state is concerned i who do the whole drudgery business here really have a title to be consulted and until i am  hush hush said the antiquary winking and putting his finger to his noseyou shall have the full credit the entire management whenever matters are ripe but this is an obstinate old fellow who will not hear of two people being as yet let into his mystery and he has not fully acquainted me with the clew to dousterswivels devices  aha so we must tip that fellow the alien act i suppose  to say truth i wish you would  say no more said the magistrate it shall forthwith be donehe shall be removed tanquam suspecti think thats one of your own phrases monkbarns  it is classical bailieyou improve  why public business has of late pressed upon me so much that i have been obliged to take my foreman into partnership i have had two several correspondences with the under secretary of stateone on the proposed tax on riga hempseed and the other on putting down political societies so you might as well communicate to me as much as you know of this old fellows discovery of a plot against the state  i will instantly when i am master of it replied oldbucki hate the trouble of managing such matters myself remember however i did not say decidedly a plot against the state i only say i hope to discover by this mans means a foul plot  if it be a plot at all there must be treason in it or sedition at least said the bailiewill you bail him for four hundred merks  four hundred merks for an old bluegown think on the act 1701 regulating bailbondsstrike off a cipher from the sumi am content to bail him for forty merks  well mr oldbuck everybody in fairport is always willing to oblige youand besides i know that you are a prudent man and one that would be as unwilling to lose forty as four hundred merks so i will accept your bail meo periculowhat say you to that law phrase again i had it from a learned counsel i will vouch it my lord he said meo periculo  and i will vouch for edie ochiltree meo periculo in like manner said oldbuck so let your clerk draw out the bailbond and i will sign it  when this ceremony had been performed the antiquary communicated to edie the joyful tidings that he was once more at liberty and directed him to make the best of his way to monkbarns house to which he himself returned with his nephew after having perfected their good work     chapter eighteenth                  full of wise saws and modern instances                                        as you like it  i wish to heaven hector said the antiquary next morning after breakfast you would spare our nerves and not be keeping snapping that arquebuss of yours  well sir im sure im sorry to disturb you said his nephew still handling his fowlingpiecebut its a capital gunits a joe manton that cost forty guineas  a fool and his money are soon parted nephewthere is a joe miller for your joe manton answered the antiquary i am glad you have so many guineas to throw away  every one has their fancy uncleyou are fond of books  ay hector said the uncle and if my collection were yours you would make it fly to the gunsmith the horsemarket the dogbreaker coemptos undique nobiles librosmutare loricis iberis  i could not use your books my dear uncle said the young soldier thats true and you will do well to provide for their being in better hands but dont let the faults of my head fall on my hearti would not part with a cordery that belonged to an old friend to get a set of horses like lord glenallans  i dont think you would ladi dont think you would said his softening relative i love to tease you a little sometimes it keeps up the spirit of discipline and habit of subordinationyou will pass your time happily here having me to command you instead of captain or colonel or knight in arms as milton has it and instead of the french he continued relapsing into his ironical humour you have the gens humida pontifor as virgil says                sternunt se somno diversae in littore phocae  which might be rendered                     here phocae slumber on the beach                   within our highland hectors reach  nay if you grow angry i have done besides i see old edie in the courtyard with whom i have business goodbye hectordo you remember how she splashed into the sea like her master proteus et se jactu dedit aequor in altum  mintyrewaiting however till the door was shutthen gave way to the natural impatience of his temper  my uncle is the best man in the world and in his way the kindest but rather than hear any more about that cursed phoca as he is pleased to call it i would exchange for the west indies and never see his face again  miss mintyre gratefully attached to her uncle and passionately fond of her brother was on such occasions the usual envoy of reconciliation she hastened to meet her uncle on his return before he entered the parlour  well now miss womankind what is the meaning of that imploring countenancehas juno done any more mischief  no uncle but junos master is in such fear of your joking him about the seali assure you he feels it much more than you would wishits very silly of him to be sure but then you can turn everybody so sharply into ridicule  well my dear answered oldbuck propitiated by the compliment i will rein in my satire and if possible speak no more of the phocai will not even speak of sealing a letter but say umph and give a nod to you when i want the waxlighti am not monitoribus asper but heaven knows the most mild quiet and easy of human beings whom sister niece and nephew guide just as best pleases them  with this little panegyric on his own docility mr oldbuck entered the parlour and proposed to his nephew a walk to the musselcrag i have some questions to ask of a woman at mucklebackits cottage he observed and i would willingly have a sensible witness with meso for fault of a better hector i must be contented with you  there is old edie sir or caxoncould not they do better than me answered mintyre feeling somewhat alarmed at the prospect of a long teteatete with his uncle  upon my word young man you turn me over to pretty companions and i am quite sensible of your politeness replied mr oldbuck no sir i intend the old bluegown shall go with menot as a competent witness for he is at present as our friend bailie littlejohn says blessings on his learning tanquam suspectus and you are suspicione major as our law has it  i wish i were a major sir said hector catching only the last and to a soldiers ear the most impressive word in the sentencebut without money or interest there is little chance of getting the step  well well most doughty son of priam said the antiquary be ruled by your friends and theres no saying what may happencome away with me and you shall see what may be useful to you should you ever sit upon a courtmartial sir  i have been on many a regimental courtmartial sir answered captain mintyre but heres a new cane for you  much obliged much obliged  i bought it from our drummajor added mintyre who came into our regiment from the bengal army when it came down the red sea it was cut on the banks of the indus i assure you  upon my word tis a fine ratan and well replaces that which the ph bah what was i going to say  the party consisting of the antiquary his nephew and the old beggar now took the sands towards musselcragthe former in the very highest mood of communicating information and the others under a sense of former obligation and some hope for future favours decently attentive to receive it the uncle and nephew walked together the mendicant about a step and a half behind just near enough for his patron to speak to him by a slight inclination of his neck and without the trouble of turning round petrie in his essay on goodbreeding dedicated to the magistrates of edinburgh recommends upon his own experience as tutor in a family of distinction this attitude to all led captains tutors dependants and bottleholders of every description  thus escorted the antiquary moved along full of his learning like a lordly man of war and every now and then yawing to starboard and larboard to discharge a broadside upon his followers  and so it is your opinion said he to the mendicant that this windfallthis arca auri as plautus has it will not greatly avail sir arthur in his necessities  unless he could find ten times as much said the beggar and that i am sair doubtful ofi heard puggie orrock and the tother thief of a sheriffofficer or messenger speaking about itand things are ill aff when the like o them can speak crousely about ony gentlemans affairs i doubt sir arthur will be in stane was for debt unless theres swift help and certain  you speak like a fool said the antiquarynephew it is a remarkable thing that in this happy country no man can be legally imprisoned for debt  indeed sir said mintyre i never knew that beforethat part of our law would suit some of our mess well  and if they arena confined for debt said ochiltree what ist that tempts sae mony puir creatures to bide in the tolbooth o fairport yonderthey a say they were put there by their creditorsod they maun like it better than i do if theyre there o free will  a very natural observation edie and many of your betters would make the same but it is founded entirely upon ignorance of the feudal system hector be so good as to attend unless you are looking out for another ahem hector compelled himself to give attention at this hint  and you edie it may be useful to you reram cognoscere causas the nature and origin of warrant for caption is a thing haud alienum a scaevolae studiisyou must know then once more that nobody can be arrested in scotland for debt  i haena muckle concern wi that monkbarns said the old man for naebody wad trust a bodle to a gaberlunzie  i prythee peace manas a compulsitor therefore of payment that being a thing to which no debtor is naturally inclined as i have too much reason to warrant from the experience i have had with my ownwe had first the letters of four forms a sort of gentle invitation by which our sovereign lord the king interesting himself as a monarch should in the regulation of his subjects private affairs at first by mild exhortation and afterwards by letters of more strict enjoinment and more hard compulsionwhat do you see extraordinary about that bird hectorits but a seamaw  its a pictarnie sir said edie  well what an if it werewhat does that signify at presentbut i see youre impatient so i will waive the letters of four forms and come to the modern process of diligenceyou suppose now a mans committed to prison because he cannot pay his debt quite otherwise the truth is the king is so good as to interfere at the request of the creditor and to send the debtor his royal command to do him justice within a certain timefifteen days or six as the case may be well the man resists and disobeys what follows why that he be lawfully and rightfully declared a rebel to our gracious sovereign whose command he has disobeyed and that by three blasts of a horn at the marketplace of edinburgh the metropolis of scotland and he is then legally imprisoned not on account of any civil debt but because of his ungrateful contempt of the royal mandate what say you to that hectortheres something you never knew before   the doctrine of monkbarns on the origin of imprisonment for civil debt in scotland may appear somewhat whimsical but was referred to and admitted to be correct by the bench of the supreme scottish court on 5th december 1828 in the case of thom v black in fact the scottish law is in this particular more jealous of the personal liberty of the subject than any other code in europe  no uncle but i own if i wanted money to pay my debts i would rather thank the king to send me some than to declare me a rebel for not doing what i could not do  your education has not led you to consider these things replied his uncle you are incapable of estimating the elegance of the legal fiction and the manner in which it reconciles that duress which for the protection of commerce it has been found necessary to extend towards refractory debtors with the most scrupulous attention to the liberty of the subject  i dont know sir answered the unenlightened hector but if a man must pay his debt or go to jail it signifies but little whether he goes as a debtor or a rebel i should think but you say this command of the kings gives a license of so many daysnow egad were i in the scrape i would beat a march and leave the king and the creditor to settle it among themselves before they came to extremities  so wad i said edie i wad gie them legbail to a certainty  true replied monkbarns but those whom the law suspects of being unwilling to abide her formal visit she proceeds with by means of a shorter and more unceremonious call as dealing with persons on whom patience and favour would be utterly thrown away  ay said ochiltree that will be what they ca the fugiewarrantsi hae some skeel in them theres borderwarrants too in the south country unco rash uncanny thingsi was taen up on ane at saint jamess fair and keepit in the auld kirk at kelso the haill day and night and a cauld goustie place it was ise assure yebut whatna wifes this wi her creel on her back its puir maggie hersell im thinking  it was so the poor womans sense of her loss if not diminished was become at least mitigated by the inevitable necessity of attending to the means of supporting her family and her salutation to oldbuck was made in an odd mixture between the usual language of solicitation with which she plied her customers and the tone of lamentation for her recent calamity  hows a wi ye the day monkbarns i havena had the grace yet to come down to thank your honour for the credit ye did puir steenie wi laying his head in a rath grave puir fallow here she whimpered and wiped her eyes with the corner of her blue apronbut the fishing comes on no that ill though the gudeman hasna had the heart to gang to sea himsell atweel i would fain tell him it wad do

shillings the dozen for i hae nae pith to drive a bargain ennow and maun just tak what ony christian body will gie wi few words and nae flyting  what shall we do hector said oldbuck pausing i got into disgrace with my womankind for making a bad bargain with her before these maritime animals hector are unlucky to our family  pooh sir what would you dogive poor maggie what she asks or allow me to send a dish of fish up to monkbarns  and he held out the money to her but maggie drew back her hand na na captain yere ower young and ower free o your sillerye should never tak a fishwifes first bode

house if ye want crappitheads the day  and so on she paced with her burdengrief gratitude for the sympathy of her betters and the habitual love of traffic and of gain chasing each other through her thoughts  and now that we are before the door of their hut said ochiltree i wad fain ken monkbarns what has gard ye plague yoursell wi me a this length i tell ye sincerely i hae nae pleasure in ganging in there i downa bide to think how the young hae faen on a sides o me and left me an useless auld stump wi hardly a green leaf ont  this old woman said oldbuck sent you on a message to the earl of glenallan did she not  ay said the surprised mendicant how ken ye that sae weel  lord glenallan told me himself answered the antiquary so there is no delationno breach of trust on your part and as he wishes me to take her evidence down on some important family matters i chose to bring you with me because in her situation hovering between dotage and consciousness it is possible that your voice and appearance may awaken trains of recollection which i should otherwise have no means of exciting the human mindwhat are you about hector  i was only whistling for the dog sir replied the captain she always roves too widei knew i should be troublesome to you  not at all not at all said oldbuck resuming the subject of his disquisitionthe human mind is to be treated like a skein of ravelled silk where you must cautiously secure one free end before you can make any progress in disentangling it  i ken naething about that said the gaberlunzie but an my auld acquaintance be hersell or anything like hersell she may come to wind us a pirn its fearsome baith to see and hear her when she wampishes about her arms and gets to her english and speaks as if she were a prent book let abe

made as muckle wark about her making a halfmerk marriage wi simon mucklebackit this saunderss father as if she had been ane o the gentry but she got into favour again and then she lost it again as i hae heard her son say when he was a muckle chield and then they got muckle siller and left the countesss land and settled here but things never throve wi them howsomever shes a weeleducate woman and

elspeth chanting forth an old ballad in a wild and doleful recitative                  the herring loves the merry moonlight                      the mackerel loves the wind                 but the

human nature sae far owertaen as to be skirling at auld sangs on the back of a loss like hers  hush hush said the antiquaryshe has gotten the thread of the story again and as he spoke she sung                they saddled a hundred milkwhite steeds                    they hae bridled a hundred black                with a chafron of steel on each horses head                   and a good knight upon

      their glaives were glancing clear                   their pibrochs rung frae side to side                        would deafen ye to hear                   the great earl in his stirrups stood

that nephew said oldbuckyou observe your gaelic ancestors were not held in high repute formerly by the lowland warriors  i hear said hector a silly old woman sing a silly old song i am surprised sir that you who will not listen to ossians songs of selma can be pleased with such trash i vow i have not seen or heard a worse halfpenny ballad i dont believe you could match it in any pedlars pack in the country i should be ashamed to think that the honour of the highlands could be affected by such doggrel and tossing up his head he snuffed the air indignantly  apparently the old woman heard the sound of their voices for ceasing her song she called out come in sirs come ingoodwill never halted at the doorstane  they entered and found to their surprise elspeth alone sitting ghastly on the hearth like the personification of old age in the hunters song of the owl wrinkled tattered vile dimeyed discoloured torpid   see mrs grant on the highland superstitions vol ii p 260 for this fine

belyve and she dismissed her spindle from her hand to twirl upon the floor and soon seemed exclusively occupied in regulating its motion as unconscious of the presence of the strangers as she appeared indifferent to their rank or business there  i wish said oldbuck she would resume that canticle or legendary fragment i always suspected there was a skirmish of cavalry before the main battle of the harlaw   note h battle of harlaw  if your honour pleases said edie had ye not better proceed to the business that brought us a here ise engage to get ye the sang ony time  i believe you are right ediedo manusi submit but how shall we manage she sits there the very image of dotage speak to her edietry if you can make her recollect having sent you to glenallan house  edie rose accordingly and crossing the floor placed himself in the same position which he had occupied during his former conversation with her im fain to see ye looking sae weel cummer the mair that the black ox has tramped on

for a daft auld carline what for should ony o them dee before meits out o the course o nature ye ken  i think youll make very little of this stupid old woman said hectorwho still nourished perhaps some feelings of the dislike excited by the disparaging mention of his countrymen in her layi think youll make but little of her sir and its wasting our time to sit here and listen to her dotage  hector said the antiquary indignantly if you do not respect her misfortunes respect at least her old age and grey hairs this is the last stage of existence so finely treated by the latin poet                                  omni                membrorum damno major dementia quae nec                nomina servorum nec vultus agnoscit amici                cum queis preterita coenavit nocte nec illos                             quos genuit quos eduxit  thats latin said elspeth rousing herself as if she attended to the lines which the antiquary recited with great pomp of dictionthats latin and she cast a wild glance around herhas there a priest fund me out at last  you see nephew her comprehension is almost equal to your own of that fine passage  i hope you think sir that i knew it to be latin as well as she did  why as to thatbut stay she is about to speak  i will have no priestnone said the beldam with impotent vehemence as i have lived i will dienone shall say that i betrayed my mistress though it were to save my soul  that bespoke a foul conscience said the mendicanti wuss she wad mak a clean breast an it were but for her sake and he again assailed her  weel gudewife i did your errand to the yerl  to what earl i ken nae earli kend a countess ancei wish to heaven i had never kend her for by that acquaintance neighbour their cam and she counted her withered fingers as she spoke first pride then malice then revenge then false witness and murder tirld at the doorpin if he camna ben and werena thae pleasant guests think ye to take up their quarters in ae womans heart i trow there was routh o company  but cummer continued the beggar it wasna the countess of glenallan i meant but her son him that was lord geraldin  i mind it now she said i saw him no that langsyne and

will i maen for that  then drawing her flax from the distaff with the dogged air of one who is resolved to confess nothing she resumed her interrupted occupation  i hae heard said the mendicant taking his cue from what oldbuck had told him of the family historyi hae heard cummer that some ill tongue suld hae come between the earl thats lord geraldin and his young bride  ill tongue she said in hasty alarm and what had she to fear frae an ill tongueshe was gude and fair eneughat least a body said sae but had she keepit her ain tongue aff ither folk she might hae been living like a leddy for a

old woman hastily wha durst say they were marriedwha kend o thatnot the countessnot i if they wedded in secret they were severed in secretthey drank of the fountains of their ain deceit  no wretched beldam exclaimed oldbuck who could keep silence no longer they drank the poison that you and your wicked mistress prepared for them  ha ha she replied i aye thought it would come to this its but sitting silent when they examine metheres nae torture in our days and if there is let them rend meits ill o the vassals mouth that betrays the bread it eats  speak to her edie said the antiquary she knows your voice and answers to it most readily  we shall mak naething mair out o her said ochiltree when she has clinkit hersell down that way and faulded her arms she winna speak a word they say for weeks thegither and besides to my thinking her face is sair changed since we cam in however ise try her ance mair to satisfy your honourso ye canna keep in mind cummer that your auld mistress the countess joscelin has been removed  removed she exclaimed for that name never failed to produce its usual effect upon her then we maun a followa maun ride when she is in the saddle tell them to let lord geraldin ken were on before them bring my hood and scarfye wadna hae me gang in the carriage wi my leddy and my hair in this fashion  she raised her shrivelled arms and seemed busied like a woman who puts on her cloak to go abroad then dropped them slowly and stiffly and the same idea of a journey still floating apparently through her head she proceeded in a hurried and interrupted mannercall miss nevillewhat do you mean by lady geraldin i said eveline neville not lady geraldin theres no lady geraldin tell her that and bid her change her wet gown and no look sae pale bairn what should she do wi a bairnmaidens hae nane i trowteresateresamy lady calls usbring a candlethe grand staircase is as mirk as a yule midnightwe are coming my ladywith these words she sunk back on the settle and from thence sidelong to the floor    note i elspeths death   edie ran to support her but hardly got her in his arms before he said its a owershe has passed away even with that last word  impossible said oldbuck hastily advancing as did his nephew but nothing was more certain she had expired with the last hurried word that left her lips and all that remained before them were the mortal relics of the creature who had so long struggled with an internal sense of concealed guilt joined to all the distresses of age and poverty  god grant that she be gane to a better place said edie as he looked on the lifeless body but oh there was something lying hard and heavy at her heart i have seen mony a ane dee baith in the field o battle and a fairstrae death at hame but i wad rather see them a ower again as sic a fearfu flitting as hers  we must call in the neighbours said oldbuck when he had somewhat recovered his horror and astonishment and give warning of this additional calamity i wish she could have been brought to a confession and though of far less consequence i could have wished to transcribe that metrical fragment but heavens will must be done  they left the hut accordingly and gave the alarm in the hamlet whose matrons instantly assembled to compose the limbs and arrange the body of her who might be considered as the mother of their settlement oldbuck promised his assistance for the funeral  your honour said alison breck who was next in age to the deceased suld send doun something to us for keeping up our hearts at the lykewake for a saunderss gin puir man was drucken out at the burial o steenie and well no get mony to sit drylipped aside the corpse elspeth was unco clever in her young days as i can mind right weel but there was aye a word o her no being that chancy ane suldna speak ill o the deadmair by token o anes cummer and neighbourbut there was queer things said about a leddy and a bairn or she left the craigburnfoot and sae in gude troth it will be a puir lykewake unless your honour sends us something to keep us cracking  you shall have some whisky answered oldbuck the rather that you have preserved the proper word for that ancient custom of watching the dead you observe hector this is genuine teutonic from the gothic leichnam a corpse it is quite erroneously called latewake though brand favours that modern corruption and derivation  i believe said hector to himself my uncle would give away monkbarns to any one who would come to ask it in genuine teutonic not a drop of whisky would the old creatures have got had their president asked it for the use of the latewake  while oldbuck was giving some farther directions and promising assistance a servant of sir arthurs came riding very hard along the sands and stopped his horse when he saw the antiquary there had something he said very particular happened at the castlehe could not or would not explain whatand miss wardour had sent him off express to monkbarns to beg that mr oldbuck would come to them without a moments delay  i am afraid said the antiquary his course also is drawing to a close what can i do  do sir exclaimed hector with his characteristic impatienceget on the horse and turn his head homewardyou will be at knockwinnock castle in ten minutes  he is quite a free goer said the servant dismounting to adjust the girths and stirrupshe only pulls a little if he feels a dead weight on him  i should soon be a dead weight off him my friend said the antiquarywhat the devil nephew are you weary of me or do you suppose me weary of my life that i should get on the back of such a bucephalus as that no no my friend if i am to be at knockwinnock today it must be by walking quietly forward on my own feet which i will do with as little delay as possible captain mintyre may ride that animal himself if he pleases  i have little hope i could be of any use uncle but i cannot think of their distress without wishing to show sympathy at leastso i will ride on before and announce to them that you are comingill trouble you for your spurs my friend  you will scarce need them sir said the man taking them off at the same time and buckling them upon captain mlntyres heels hes very frank to the road  oldbuck stood astonished at this last act of temerity are you mad hector he cried or have you forgotten what is said by quintus curtius with whom as a soldier you must needs be familiarnobilis equus umbra quidem virgae regitur ignavus ne calcari quidem excitari potest which plainly shows that spurs are useless in every case and i may add dangerous in most  but hector who cared little for the opinion of either quintus curtius or of the antiquary upon such a topic only answered with a heedless never fearnever fear sir                with that he gave his able horse the head               and bending forward struck his armed heels               against the panting sides of his poor jade                 up to the rowelhead and starting so                 he seemed in running to devour the way                       staying no longer question  there they go well matched said oldbuck looking after them as they starteda mad horse and a wild boy the two most unruly creatures in christendom and all to get half an hour sooner to a place where nobody wants him for i doubt sir arthurs griefs are beyond the cure of our light horseman it must be the villany of dousterswivel for whom sir arthur has done so much for i cannot help observing that with some natures tacituss maxim holdeth good beneficia eo usque laeta sunt dum videntur exsolvi posse ubi multum antevenere pro gratia odium redditurfrom which a wise man might take a caution not to oblige any man beyond the degree in which he may expect to be requited lest he should make his debtor a bankrupt in gratitude  murmuring to himself such scraps of cynical philosophy our antiquary paced the sands towards knockwinnock but it is necessary we should outstrip him for the purpose of explaining the reasons of his being so anxiously summoned thither     chapter twentieth               so while the goose of whom the fable told                 incumbent brooded oer her eggs of gold              with hand outstretched impatient to destroy                 stole on her secret nest the cruel boy              whose gripe rapacious changed her splendid dream             for wings vain fluttering and for dying scream                                    the loves of the seaweeds  from the time that sir arthur wardour had become possessor of the treasure found in misticots grave he had been in a state of mind more resembling ecstasy than sober sense indeed at one time his daughter had become seriously apprehensive for his intellect for as he had no doubt that he had the secret of possessing himself of wealth to an unbounded extent his language and carriage were those of a man who had acquired the philosophers stone he talked of buying contiguous estates that would have led him from one side of the island to the other as if he were determined to brook no neighbour save the sea he corresponded with an architect of eminence upon a plan of renovating the castle of his forefathers on a style of extended magnificence that might have rivalled that of windsor and laying out the grounds on a suitable scale troops of liveried menials were already in fancy marshalled in his halls andfor what may not unbounded wealth authorize its possessor to aspire tothe coronet of a marquis perhaps of a duke was glittering before his imagination his daughterto what matches might she not look forward even an alliance with the bloodroyal was not beyond the sphere of his hopes his son was already a generaland he himself whatever ambition could dream of in its wildest visions  in this mood if any one endeavoured to bring sir arthur down to the regions of common life his replies were in the vein of ancient pistol                     a fico for the world and worldlings base                    i speak of africa and golden joys  the reader may conceive the amazement of miss wardour when instead of undergoing an investigation concerning the addresses of lovel as she had expected from the long conference of her father with mr oldbuck upon the morning of the fated day when the treasure was discovered the conversation of sir arthur announced an imagination heated with the hopes of possessing the most unbounded wealth but she was seriously alarmed when dousterswivel was sent for to the castle and was closeted with her fatherhis mishap condoled withhis part taken and his loss compensated all the suspicions which she had long entertained respecting this man became strengthened by observing his pains to keep up the golden dreams of her father and to secure for himself under various pretexts as much as possible out of the windfall which had so strangely fallen to sir arthurs share  other evil symptoms began to appear following close on each other letters arrived every post which sir arthur as soon as he had looked at the directions flung into the fire without taking the trouble to open them miss wardour could not help suspecting that these epistles the contents of which seemed to be known to her father by a sort of intuition came from pressing creditors in the meanwhile the temporary aid which he had received from the treasure dwindled fast away by far the greater part had been swallowed up by the necessity of paying the bill of six hundred pounds which had threatened sir arthur with instant distress of the rest some part was given to the adept some wasted upon extravagances which seemed to the poor knight fully authorized by his fullblown hopesand some went to stop for a time the mouths of such claimants as being weary of fair promises had become of opinion with harpagon that it was necessary to touch something substantial at length circumstances announced but too plainly that it was all expended within two or three days after its discovery and there appeared no prospect of a supply sir arthur naturally impatient now taxed dousterswivel anew with breach of those promises through which he had hoped to convert all his lead into gold but that worthy gentlemans turn was now served and as he had grace enough to wish to avoid witnessing the fall of the house which he had undermined he was at the trouble of bestowing a few learned terms of art upon sir arthur that at least he might not be tormented before his time he took leave of him with assurances that he would return to knockwinnock the next morning with such information as would not fail to relieve sir arthur from all his distresses  for since i have consulted in such matters i ave never said mr herman dousterswivel approached so near de arcanum what you call de great mysteryde panchrestade polychrestai do know as much of it as pelaso de taranta or basiliusand either i will bring you in two and tree days de no iii of mr mishdigoat or you shall call me one knave myself and never look me in de face again no more at all  the adept departed with this assurance in the firm resolution of making good the latter part of the proposition and never again appearing before his injured patron sir arthur remained in a doubtful and anxious state of mind the positive assurances of the philosopher with the hard words panchresta basilius and so forth produced some effect on his mind but he had been too often deluded by such jargon to be absolutely relieved of his doubt and he retired for the evening into his library in the fearful state of one who hanging over a precipice and without the means of retreat perceives the stone on which he rests gradually parting from the rest of the crag and about to give way with him  the visions of hope decayed and there increased in proportion that feverish agony of anticipation with which a man educated in a sense of consequence and possessed of opulencethe supporter of an ancient name and the father of two promising childrenforesaw the hour approaching which should deprive him of all the splendour which time had made familiarly necessary to him and send him forth into the world to struggle with poverty with rapacity and with scorn under these dire forebodings his temper exhausted by the sickness of delayed hope became peevish and fretful and his words and actions sometimes expressed a reckless desperation which alarmed miss wardour extremely we have seen on a former occasion that sir arthur was a man of passions lively and quick in proportion to the weakness of his character in other respects he was unused to contradiction and if he had been hitherto in general goodhumoured and cheerful it was probably because the course of his life had afforded no such frequent provocation as to render his irritability habitual  on the third morning after dousterswivels departure the servant as usual laid on the breakfast table the newspaper and letters of the day miss wardour took up the former to avoid the continued illhumour of her father who had wrought himself into a violent passion because the toast was overbrowned  i perceive how it is was his concluding speech on this interesting subjectmy servants who have had their share of my fortune begin to think there is little to be made of me in future but while i am the scoundrels master i will be so and permit no neglectno nor endure a hairsbreadth diminution of the respect i am entitled to exact from them  i am ready to leave your honours service this instant said the domestic upon whom the fault had been charged as soon as you order payment of my wages  sir arthur as if stung by a serpent thrust his hand into his pocket and instantly drew out the money which it contained but which was short of the mans claim what money have you got miss wardour he said in a tone of affected calmness but which concealed violent agitation  miss wardour gave him her purse he attempted to count the bank notes which it contained but could not reckon them after twice miscounting the sum he threw the whole to his daughter and saying in a stern voice pay the rascal and let him leave the house instantly he strode out of the room  the mistress and servant stood alike astonished at the agitation and vehemence of his manner  i am sure maam if i had thought i was particularly wrang i wadna hae made ony answer when sir arthur challenged me i hae been lang in his service and he has been a kind master and you a kind mistress and i wad like ill ye should think i wad start for a hasty word i am sure it was very wrang o me to speak about wages to his honour when maybe he has something to vex him i had nae thoughts o leaving the family in this way  go down stair robert said his mistresssomething has happened to fret my fathergo down stairs and let alick answer the bell  when the man left the room sir arthur reentered as if he had been watching his departure whats the meaning of this he said hastily as he observed the notes lying still on the tableis he not gone am i neither to be obeyed as a master or a father  he is gone to give up his charge to the housekeeper siri thought there was not such instant haste  there is haste miss wardour answered her father interrupting herwhat i do henceforth in the house of my forefathers must be done speedily or never  he then sate down and took up with a trembling hand the basin of tea prepared for him protracting the swallowing of it as if to delay the necessity of opening the postletters which lay on the table and which he eyed from time to time as if they had been a nest of adders ready to start into life and spring upon him  you will be happy to hear said miss wardour willing to withdraw her fathers mind from the gloomy reflections in which he appeared to be plunged you will be happy to hear sir that lieutenant taffrils gunbrig has got safe into leith roadsi observe there had been apprehensions for his safetyi am glad we did not hear them till they were contradicted  and what is taffril and his gunbrig to me  sir said miss wardour in astonishment for sir arthur in his ordinary state of mind took a fidgety sort of interest in all the gossip of the day and country  i say he repeated in a higher and still more impatient key what do i care who is saved or lost its nothing to me i suppose  i did not know you were busy sir arthur and thought as mr taffril is a brave man and from our own country you would be happy to hear  oh i am happyas happy as possibleand to make you happy too you shall have some of my good news in return and he caught up a letter it does not signify which i open firstthey are all to the same tune  he broke the seal hastily ran the letter over and then threw it to his daughter ayi could not have lighted more happilythis places the copestone  miss wardour in silent terror took up the letter read itread it aloud said her father it cannot be read too often it will serve to break you in for other good news of the same kind  she began to read with a faltering voice dear sir  he dears me too you see this impudent drudge of a writers office who a twelvemonth since was not fit company for my second tablei suppose i shall be dear knight with him by and by  dear sir resumed miss wardour but interrupting herself i see the contents are unpleasant sirit will only vex you my reading them aloud  if you will allow me to know my own pleasure miss wardour i entreat you to go oni presume if it were unnecessary i should not ask you to take the trouble  having been of late taken into copartnery continued miss wardour reading the letter by mr gilbert greenhorn son of your late correspondent and man of business girnigo greenhorn esq writer to the signet whose business i conducted as parliamenthouse clerk for many years which business will in future be carried on under the firm of greenhorn and grinderson which i memorandum for the sake of accuracy in addressing your future letters and having had of late favours of yours directed to my aforesaid partner gilbert greenhorn in consequence of his absence at the lamberton races have the honour to reply to your said favours  you see my friend is methodical and commences by explaining the causes which have procured me so modest and elegant a correspondent go oni can bear it  and he laughed that bitter laugh which is perhaps the most fearful expression of mental misery trembling to proceed and yet afraid to disobey miss wardour continued to readi am for myself and partner sorry we cannot oblige you by looking out for the sums you mention or applying for a suspension in the case of goldiebirds bond which would be more inconsistent as we have been employed to act as the said goldiebirds procurators and attorneys in which capacity we have taken out a charge of horning against you as you must be aware by the schedule left by the messenger for the sum of four thousand seven hundred and fiftysix pounds five shillings and sixpence onefourth of a penny sterling which with annualrent and expenses effeiring we presume will be settled during the currency of the charge to prevent further trouble same time i am under the necessity to observe our own account amounting to seven hundred and sixtynine pounds ten shillings and sixpence is also due and settlement would be agreeable but as we hold your rights titledeeds and documents in hypothec shall have no objection to give reasonable timesay till the next money term i am for myself and partner concerned to add that messrs goldiebirds instructions to us are to proceed peremptorie and sine mora of which i have the pleasure to advise you to prevent future mistakes reserving to ourselves otherwise to age as accords i am for self and partner dear sir your obliged humble servant gabriel grinderson for greenhorn and grinderson  ungrateful villain said miss wardour  why noits in the usual rule i suppose the blow could not have been perfect if dealt by another handits all just as it should be answered the poor baronet his affected composure sorely belied by his quivering lip and rolling eyebut heres a postscript i did not noticecome finish the epistle  i have to add not for self but partner that mr greenhorn will accommodate you by taking your service of plate or the bay horses if sound in wind and limb at a fair appreciation in part payment of your accompt  gd confound him said sir arthur losing all command of himself at this condescending proposal his grandfather shod my fathers horses and this descendant of a scoundrelly blacksmith proposes to swindle me out of mine but i will write him a proper answer  and he sate down and began to write with great vehemence then stopped and read aloudmr gilbert greenhornin answer to two letters of a late date i received a letter from a person calling himself grinderson and designing himself as your partner when i address any one i do not usually expect to be answered by deputyi think i have been useful to your father and friendly and civil to yourself and therefore am now surprisedand yet said he stopping short why should i be surprised at that or anything else or why should i take up my time in writing to such a scoundreli shant be always kept in prison i suppose and to break that puppys bones when i get out shall be my first employment  in prison sir said miss wardour faintly  ay in prison to be sure do you make any question about that why mr whats his names fine letter for self and partner seems to be thrown away on you or else you have got four thousand so many hundred pounds with the due proportion of shillings pence and halfpence to pay that aforesaid demand as he calls it  i sir o if i had the meansbut wheres my brotherwhy does he not come and so long in scotland he might do something to assist us  who reginaldi suppose hes gone with mr gilbert greenhorn or some such respectable person to the lamberton racesi have expected him this week past but i cannot wonder that my children should neglect me as well as every other person but i should beg your pardon my love who never either neglected or offended me in your life  and kissing her cheek as she threw her arms round his neck he experienced that consolation which a parent feels even in the most distressed state in the assurance that he possesses the affection of a child  miss wardour took the advantage of this revulsion of feeling to endeavour to soothe her fathers mind to composure she reminded him that he had many friends  i had many once said sir arthur but of some i have exhausted their kindness with my frantic projects others are unable to assist meothers are unwilling it is all over with me i only hope reginald will take example by my folly  should i not send to monkbarns sir said his daughter  to what purpose he cannot lend me such a sum and would not if he could for he knows i am otherwise drowned in debt and he would only give me scraps of misanthropy and quaint ends of latin  but he is shrewd and sensible and was bred to business and i am sure always loved this family  yes i believe he did it is a fine pass we are come to when the affection of an oldbuck is of consequence to a wardour but when matters come to extremity as i suppose they presently willit may be as well to send for him and now go take your walk my dearmy mind is more composed than when i had this cursed disclosure to make you know the worst and may daily or hourly expect it go take your walki would willingly be alone for a little while  when miss wardour left the apartment her first occupation was to avail herself of the half permission granted by her father by despatching to monkbarns the messenger who as we have already seen met the antiquary and his nephew on the seabeach  little recking and indeed scarce knowing where she was wandering chance directed her into the walk beneath the briery bank as it was called a brook which in former days had supplied the castlemoat with water here descended through a narrow dell up which miss wardours taste had directed a natural path which was rendered neat and easy of ascent without the air of being formally made and preserved it suited well the character of the little glen which was overhung with thickets and underwood chiefly of larch and hazel intermixed with the usual varieties of the thorn and brier in this walk had passed that scene of explanation between miss wardour and lovel which was overheard by old edie ochiltree with a heart softened by the distress which approached her family miss wardour now recalled every word and argument which lovel had urged in support of his suit and could not help confessing to herself it was no small subject of pride to have inspired a young man of his talents with a passion so strong and disinterested that he should have left the pursuit of a profession in which he was said to be rapidly rising to bury himself in a disagreeable place like fairport and brood over an unrequited passion might be ridiculed by others as romantic but was naturally forgiven as an excess of affection by the person who was the object of his attachment had he possessed an independence however moderate or ascertained a clear and undisputed claim to the rank in society he was well qualified to adorn she might now have had it in her power to offer her father during his misfortunes an asylum in an establishment of her own these thoughts so favourable to the absent lover crowded in one after the other with such a minute recapitulation of his words looks and actions as plainly intimated that his former repulse had been dictated rather by duty than inclination isabella was musing alternately upon this subject and upon that of her fathers misfortunes when as the path winded round a little hillock covered with brushwood the old bluegown suddenly met her  with an air as if he had something important and mysterious to communicate he doffed his bonnet and assumed the cautious step and voice of one who would not willingly be overheard i hae been wishing muckle to meet wi your leddyshipfor ye ken i darena come to the house for dousterswivel  i heard indeed said miss wardour dropping an alms into the

her to expedition until they reached the castle     chapter twentyfirst                 let those go see who willi like it not                for say he was a slave to rank and pomp                and all the nothings he is now divorced from                  by the hard doom of stern necessity                  yet it is sad to mark his altered brow                  where vanity adjusts her flimsy veil                oer the deep wrinkles of repentant anguish                                          old play  when miss wardour arrived in the court of the castle she was apprized by the first glance that the visit of the officers of the law had already taken place there was confusion and gloom and sorrow and curiosity among the domestics while the retainers of the law went from place to place making an inventory of the goods and chattels falling under their warrant of distress or poinding as it is called in the law of scotland captain mintyre flew to her as struck dumb with the melancholy conviction of her fathers ruin she paused upon the threshold of the gateway  dear miss wardour he said do not make yourself uneasy my uncle is coming immediately and i am sure he will find some way to clear the house of these rascals  alas captain mintyre i fear it will be too late  no answered edie impatientlycould i but get to tannonburgh in the name of heaven captain contrive some way to get me on and yell do this poor ruined family the best days doing that has been done them since redhands daysfor as sure as eer an auld saw came true knockwinnock house and land will be lost and won this day  why what good can you do old man said hector  but robert the domestic with whom sir arthur had been so much displeased in the morning as if he had been watching for an opportunity to display his zeal stepped hastily forward and said to his mistress if you please maam this auld man ochiltree is very skeely and auldfarrant about mony things as the diseases of cows and horse and sic like and i am sure be disna want to be at tannonburgh the day for naething since he insists ont this gate and if your leddyship pleases ill drive him there in the taxedcart in an hours time i wad fain be of some usei could bite my very tongue out when i think on this morning  i am obliged to you robert said miss wardour and if you really think it has the least chance of being useful  in the name of god said the old man yoke the cart robie and if i am no o some use less or mair ill gie ye leave to fling me ower kittlebrig as ye come back again but o man haste ye for times precious this day  robert looked at his mistress as she retired into the house and seeing he was not prohibited flew to the stableyard which was adjacent to the court in order to yoke the carriage for though an old beggar was the personage least likely to render effectual assistance in a case of pecuniary distress yet there was among the common people of edies circle a general idea of his prudence and sagacity which authorized roberts conclusion that he would not so earnestly have urged the necessity of this expedition had he not been convinced of its utility but so soon as the servant took hold of a horse to harness him for the taxedcart an officer touched him on the shouldermy friend you must let that beast alonehes down in the schedule  what said robert am i not to take my masters horse to go my young leddys errand  you must remove nothing here said the man of office or you will be liable for all consequences  what the devil sir said hector who having followed to examine ochiltree more closely on the nature of his hopes and expectations already began to bristle like one of the terriers of his own native mountains and sought but a decent pretext for venting his displeasure have you the impudence to prevent the young ladys servant from obeying her orders  there was something in the air and tone of the young soldier which seemed to argue that his interference was not likely to be confined to mere expostulation and which if it promised finally the advantages of a process of battery and deforcement would certainly commence with the unpleasant circumstances necessary for founding such a complaint the legal officer confronted with him of the military grasped with one doubtful hand the greasy bludgeon which was to enforce his authority and with the other produced his short official baton tipped with silver and having a movable ring upon itcaptain mintyresir i have no quarrel with youbut if you interrupt me in my duty i will break the wand of peace and declare myself deforced  and who the devil cares said hector totally ignorant of the words of judicial action whether you declare yourself divorced or married and as to breaking your wand or breaking the peace or whatever you call it all i know is that i will break your bones if you prevent the lad from harnessing the horses to obey his mistresss orders  i take all who stand here to witness said the messenger that i showed him my blazon and explained my character he that will to cupar maun to cuparand he slid his enigmatical ring from one end of the baton to the other being the appropriate symbol of his having been forcibly interrupted in the discharge of his duty  honest hector better accustomed to the artillery of the field than to that of the law saw this mystical ceremony with great indifference and with like unconcern beheld the messenger sit down to write out an execution of deforcement but at this moment to prevent the wellmeaning hotheaded highlander from running the risk of a severe penalty the antiquary arrived puffing and blowing with his handkerchief crammed under his hat and his wig upon the end of his stick  what the deuce is the matter here he exclaimed hastily adjusting his headgear i have been following you in fear of finding your idle loggerhead knocked against one rock or other and here i find you parted with your bucephalus and quarrelling with sweepclean a messenger hector is a worse foe than a phoca whether it be the phoca barbata or the phoca vitulina of your late conflict  dn the phoca sir said hector whether it be the one or the otheri say dn them both particularly i think you would not have me stand quietly by and see a scoundrel like this because he calls himself a kings messenger forsoothi hope the king has many better for his meanest errandsinsult a young lady of family and fashion like miss wardour  rightly argued hector said the antiquary but the king like other people has now and then shabby errands and in your ear must have shabby fellows to do them but even supposing you unacquainted with the statutes of william the lion in which capite quarto versu quinto this crime of deforcement is termed despectus domini regisa contempt to wit of the king himself in whose name all legal diligence issues could you not have inferred from the information i took so much pains to give you today that those who interrupt officers who come to execute letters of caption are tanquam participes criminis rebellionis seeing that he who aids a rebel is himself quodammodo an accessory to rebellionbut ill bring you out of this scrape  he then spoke to the messenger who upon his arrival had laid aside all thoughts of making a good byjob out of the deforcement and accepted mr oldbucks assurances that the horse and taxedcart should be safely returned in the course of two or three hours  very well sir said the antiquary since you are disposed to be so civil you shall have another job in your own best waya little cast of state politicsa crime punishable per legem juliam mr sweepclean hark thee hither  and after a whisper of five minutes he gave him a slip of paper on receiving which the messenger mounted his horse and with one of his assistants rode away pretty sharply the fellow who remained seemed to delay his operations purposely proceeded in the rest of his duty very slowly and with the caution and precision of one who feels himself overlooked by a skilful and severe inspector  in the meantime oldbuck taking his nephew by the arm led him into the house and they were ushered into the presence of sir arthur wardour who in a flutter between wounded pride agonized apprehension and vain attempts to disguise both under a show of indifference exhibited a spectacle of painful interest  happy to see you mr oldbuckalways happy to see my friends in fair weather or foul said the poor baronet struggling not for composure but for gaietyan affectation which was strongly contrasted by the nervous and protracted grasp of his hand and the agitation of his whole demeanouri am happy to see you you are riding i seei hope in this confusion your horses are taken good care ofi always like to have my friends horses looked afteregad they will have all my care now for you see they are like to leave me none of my ownhe he he eh mr oldbuck  this attempt at a jest was attended by a hysterical giggle which poor sir arthur intended should sound as an indifferent laugh  you know i never ride sir arthur said the antiquary  i beg your pardon but sure i saw your nephew arrive on horseback a short time since we must look after officers horses and his was as handsome a grey charger as i have seen  sir arthur was about to ring the bell when mr oldbuck said my nephew came on your own grey horse sir arthur  mine said the poor baronet mine was it then the sun had been in my eyes well im not worthy having a horse any longer since i dont know my own when i see him  good heaven thought oldbuck how is this man altered from the formal stolidity of his usual mannerhe grows wanton under adversitysed pereunti mille figuraehe then proceeded aloudsir arthur we must necessarily speak a little on business  to be sure said sir arthur but it was so good that i should not know the horse i have ridden these five yearsha ha ha  sir arthur said the antiquary dont let us waste time which is precious we shall have i hope many better seasons for jesting desipere in loco is the maxim of horace i more than suspect this has been brought on by the villany of dousterswivel  dont mention his name sir said sir arthur and his manner entirely changed from a fluttered affectation of gaiety to all the agitation of fury his eyes sparkled his mouth foamed his hands were clenched dont mention his name sir he vociferated unless you would see me go mad in your presence that i should have been such a miserable dolt such an infatuated idiotsuch a beast endowed with thrice a beasts stupidity to be led and driven and spurgalled by such a rascal and under such ridiculous pretencesmr oldbuck i could tear myself when i think of it  i only meant to say answered the antiquary that this fellow is like to meet his reward and i cannot but think we shall frighten something out of him that may be of service to you he has certainly had some unlawful correspondence on the other side of the water  has hehas hehas he indeedthen dn the household goods horses and so forthi will go to prison a happy man mr oldbuck i hope in heaven theres a reasonable chance of his being hanged  why pretty fair said oldbuck willing to encourage this diversion in hopes it might mitigate the feelings which seemed like to overset the poor mans understanding honester men have stretched a rope or the law has been sadly cheatedbut this unhappy business of yourscan nothing be done let me see the charge  he took the papers and as he read them his countenance grew hopelessly dark and disconsolate miss wardour had by this time entered the apartment and fixing her eyes on mr oldbuck as if she meant to read her fate in his looks easily perceived from the change in his eye and the dropping of his netherjaw how little was to be hoped  we are then irremediably ruined mr oldbuck said the young lady  irremediablyi hope notbut the instant demand is very large and others will doubtless pour in  ay never doubt that monkbarns said sir arthur where the slaughter is the eagles will be gathered together i am like a sheep which i have seen fall down a precipice or drop down from sicknessif you had not seen a single raven or hooded crow for a fortnight before he will not lie on the heather ten minutes before halfadozen will be picking out his eyes and he drew his hand over his own and tearing at his heartstrings before the poor devil has time to die but that dd longscented vulture that dogged me so longyou have got him fast i hope  fast enough said the antiquary the gentleman wished to take the wings of the morning and bolt in the what dye call itthe coach and four there but he would have found twigs limed for him at edinburgh as it is he never got so far for the coach being overturnedas how could it go safe with such a jonahhe has had an infernal tumble is carried into a cottage near kittlebrig and to prevent all possibility of escape i have sent your friend sweepclean to bring him back to fairport in nomine regis or to act as his sicknurse at kittlebrig as is most fitting and now sir arthur permit me to have some conversation with you on the present unpleasant state of your affairs that we may see what can be done for their extrication and the antiquary led the way into the library followed by the unfortunate gentleman  they had been shut up together for about two hours when miss wardour interrupted them with her cloak on as if prepared for a journey her countenance was very pale yet expressive of the composure which characterized her disposition  the messenger is returned mr oldbuck  returnedwhat the devil he has not let the fellow go  noi understand he has carried him to confinement and now he is returned to attend my father and says he can wait no longer  a loud wrangling was now heard on the staircase in which the voice of hector predominated you an officer sir and these ragamuffins a party a parcel of beggarly tailor fellowstell yourselves off by nine and we shall know your effective strength  the grumbling voice of the man of law was then heard indistinctly muttering a reply to which hector retortedcome come sir this wont domarch your party as you call them out of this house directly or ill send you and them to the right about presently  the devil take hector said the antiquary hastening to the scene of action his highland blood is up again and we shall have him fighting a duel with the bailiff come mr sweepclean you must give us a little timei know you would not wish to hurry sir arthur  by no means sir said the messenger putting his hat off which he had thrown on to testify defiance of captain mintyres threats but your nephew sir holds very uncivil language and i have borne too much of it already and i am not justified in leaving my prisoner any longer after the instructions i received unless i am to get payment of the sums contained in my diligence and he held out the caption pointing with the awful truncheon which he held in his right hand to the formidable line of figures jotted upon the back thereof  hector on the other hand though silent from respect to his uncle answered this gesture by shaking his clenched fist at the messenger with a frown of highland wrath  foolish boy be quiet said oldbuck and come with me into the room the man is doing his miserable duty and you will only make matters worse by opposing himi fear sir arthur you must accompany this man to fairport there is no help for it in the first instancei will accompany you to consult what further can be donemy nephew will escort miss wardour to monkbarns which i hope she will make her residence until these unpleasant matters are settled  i go with my father mr oldbuck said miss wardour firmlyi have prepared his clothes and my owni suppose we shall have the use of the carriage  anything in reason madam said the messenger i have ordered it out and its at the doori will go on the box with the coachmani have no desire to intrudebut two of the concurrents must attend on horseback  i will attend too said hector and he ran down to secure a horse for himself  we must go then said the antiquary  to jail said the baronet sighing involuntarily and what of that he resumed in a tone affectedly cheerfulit is only a house we cant get out of after allsuppose a fit of the gout and knockwinnock would be the sameay ay monkbarnswell call it a fit of the gout without the dd pain  but his eyes swelled with tears as he spoke and his faltering accent marked how much this assumed gaiety cost him the antiquary wrung his hand and like the indian banians who drive the real terms of an important bargain by signs while they are apparently talking of indifferent matters the hand of sir arthur by its convulsive return of the grasp expressed his sense of gratitude to his friend and the real state of his internal agonythey stepped slowly down the magnificent staircaseevery wellknown object seeming to the unfortunate father and daughter to assume a more prominent and distinct appearance than usual as if to press themselves on their notice for the last time  at the first landingplace sir arthur made an agonized pause and as he observed the antiquary look at him anxiously he said with assumed dignityyes mr oldbuck the descendant of an ancient linethe representative of richard redhand and gamelyn de guardover may be pardoned a sigh when he leaves the castle of his fathers thus poorly escorted when i was sent to the tower with my late father in the year 1745 it was upon a charge becoming our birthupon an accusation of high treason mr oldbuckwe were escorted from highgate by a troop of lifeguards and committed upon a secretary of states warrant and now here i am in my old age dragged from my household by a miserable creature like that pointing to the messenger and for a paltry concern of pounds shillings and pence  at least said oldbuck you have now the company of a dutiful daughter and a sincere friend if you will permit me to say so and that may be some consolation even without the certainty that there can be no hanging drawing or quartering on the present occasion but i hear that choleric boy as loud as ever i hope to god he has got into no new broilit was an accursed chance that brought him here at all  in fact a sudden clamour in which the loud voice and somewhat northern accent of hector was again preeminently distinguished broke off this conversation the cause we must refer to the next chapter     chapter twentysecond             fortune you say flies from usshe but circles            like the fleet seabird round the fowlers skiff                lost in the mist one moment and the next                brushing the white sail with her whiter wing                as if to court the aimexperience watches                                 and has her on the wheel                                                old play  the shout of triumph in hectors warlike tones was not easily distinguished from that of battle but as he rushed up stairs with a packet in his hand exclaiming long life to an old soldier here comes edie with a whole budget of good news it became obvious that his present cause of clamour was of an agreeable nature he delivered the letter to oldbuck shook sir arthur heartily by the hand and wished miss wardour joy with all the frankness of highland congratulation the messenger who had a kind of instinctive terror for captain mintyre drew towards his prisoner keeping an eye of caution on the soldiers motions  dont suppose i shall trouble myself about you you dirty fellow said the soldier theres a guinea for the fright i have given you and here comes an old fortytwo man who is a fitter match for you than i am  the messenger one of those dogs who are not too scornful to eat dirty puddings caught in his hand the guinea which hector chucked at his face and abode warily and carefully the turn which matters were now to take all voices meanwhile were loud in inquiries which no one was in a hurry to answer  what is the matter captain mintyre said sir arthur  ask old edie said hectori only know alls safe and well  what is all this edie said miss wardour to the mendicant  your leddyship maun ask monkbarns for he has gotten the yepistolary correspondensh  god save the king exclaimed the antiquary at the first glance at the contents of his packet and surprised at once out of decorum philosophy and phlegm he skimmed his cocked hat in the air from which it descended not again being caught in its fall by a branch of the chandelier he next looking joyously round laid a grasp on his wig which he perhaps would have sent after the beaver had not edie stopped his hand exclaiming lordsake hes gaun gytemind caxons no here to repair the damage  every person now assailed the antiquary clamouring to know the cause of so sudden a transport when somewhat ashamed of his rapture he fairly turned tail like a fox at the cry of a pack of hounds and ascending the stair by two steps at a time gained the upper landingplace where turning round he addressed the astonished audience as follows  illustration my good friends favete linguis  my good friends favete linguisto give you information i must first according to logicians be possessed of it myself and therefore with your leaves i will retire into the library to examine these paperssir arthur and miss wardour will have the goodness to step into the parlourmr sweepclean secede paulisper or in your own language grant us a supersedere of diligence for five minuteshector draw off your forces and make your beargarden flourish elsewhereand finally be all of good cheer till my return which will be instanter  the contents of the packet were indeed so little expected that the antiquary might be pardoned first his ecstasy and next his desire of delaying to communicate the intelligence they conveyed until it was arranged and digested in his own mind  within the envelope was a letter addressed to jonathan oldbuck esq of monkbarns of the following purport  dear sirto you as my fathers proved and valued friend i venture to address myself being detained here by military duty of a very pressing nature you must by this time be acquainted with the entangled state of our affairs and i know it will give you great pleasure to learn that i am as fortunately as unexpectedly placed in a situation to give effectual assistance for extricating them i understand sir arthur is threatened with severe measures by persons who acted formerly as his agents and by advice of a creditable man of business here i have procured the enclosed writing which i understand will stop their proceedings until their claim shall be legally discussed and brought down to its proper amount i also enclose bills to the amount of one thousand pounds to pay any other pressing demands and request of your friendship to apply them according to your discretion you will be surprised i give you this trouble when it would seem more natural to address my father directly in his own affairs but i have yet had no assurance that his eyes are opened to the character of a person against whom you have often i know warned him and whose baneful influence has been the occasion of these distresses and as i owe the means of relieving sir arthur to the generosity of a matchless friend it is my duty to take the most certain measures for the supplies being devoted to the purpose for which they were destinedand i know your wisdom and kindness will see that it is done my friend as he claims an interest in your regard will explain some views of his own in the enclosed letter the state of the postoffice at fairport being rather notorious i must send this letter to tannonburgh but the old man ochiltree whom particular circumstances have recommended as trustworthy has information when the packet is likely to reach that place and will take care to forward it i expect to have soon an opportunity to apologize in person for the trouble i now give and have the honour to be your very faithful servant  reginald gamelyn wardour edinburgh 6th august 179  the antiquary hastily broke the seal of the enclosure the contents of which gave him equal surprise and pleasure when he had in some measure composed himself after such unexpected tidings he inspected the other papers carefully which all related to businessput the bills into his pocketbook and wrote a short acknowledgment to be despatched by that days post for he was extremely methodical in money mattersand lastly fraught with all the importance of disclosure he descended to the parlour  sweepclean said he as he entered to the officer who stood respectfully at the door you must sweep yourself clean out of knockwinnock castle with all your followers tagrag and bobtail seest thou this paper man  a sist on a bill o suspension said the messenger with a disappointed looki thought it would be a queer thing if ultimate diligence was to be done against sic a gentleman as sir arthurweel sir ise go my ways with my partyand whos to pay my charges  they who employed thee replied oldbuck as thou full well dost knowbut here comes another express this is a day of news i think  this was mr mailsetter on his mare from fairport with a letter for sir arthur another to the messenger both of which he said he was directed to forward instantly the messenger opened his observing that greenhorn and grinderson were good enough men for his expenses and here was a letter from them desiring him to stop the diligence accordingly he immediately left the apartment and staying no longer than to gather his posse together he did then in the phrase of hector who watched his departure as a jealous mastiff eyes the retreat of a repulsed beggar evacuate flanders  sir arthurs letter was from mr greenhorn and a curiosity in its way we give it with the worthy baronets comments  siroh i am dear sir no longer folks are only dear to messrs greenhorn and grinderson when they are in adversitysir i am much concerned to learn on my return from the country where i was called on particular business a bet on the sweepstakes i suppose that my partner had the impropriety in my absence to undertake the concerns of messrs goldiebirds in preference to yours and had written to you in an unbecoming manner i beg to make my most humble apology as well as mr grindersonscome i see he can write for himself and partner tooand trust it is impossible you can think me forgetful of or ungrateful for the constant patronage which my family his family curse him for a puppy have uniformly experienced from that of knockwinnock i am sorry to find from an interview i had this day with mr wardour that he is much irritated and i must own with apparent reason but in order to remedy as much as in me lies the mistake of which he complains pretty mistake indeed to clap his patron into jail i have sent this express to discharge all proceedings against your person or property and at the same time to transmit my respectful apology i have only to add that mr grinderson is of opinion that if restored to your confidence he could point out circumstances connected with messrs goldiebirds present claim which would greatly reduce its amount so so willing to play the rogue on either side and that there is not the slightest hurry in settling the balance of your accompt with us and that i am for mr g as well as myself dear sir o ay he has written himself into an approach to familiarity your much obliged and most humble servant  gilbert greenhorn  well said mr gilbert greenhorn said monkbarns i see now there is some use in having two attorneys in one firm their movements resemble those of the man and woman in a dutch babyhouse when it is fair weather with the client out comes the gentleman partner to fawn like a spaniel when it is foul forth bolts the operative brother to pin like a bulldog well i thank god that my man of business still wears an equilateral cocked hat has a house in the old town is as much afraid of a horse as i am myself plays at golf of a saturday goes to the kirk of a sunday and in respect he has no partner hath only his own folly to apologize for  there are some writers very honest fellows said hector i should like to hear any one say that my cousin donald mintyre strathtudlems seventh son the other six are in the army is not as honest a fellow  no doubt no doubt hector all the mintyres are so they have it by patent manbut i was going to say that in a profession where unbounded trust is necessarily reposed there is nothing surprising that fools should neglect it in their idleness and tricksters abuse it in their knavery but it is the more to the honour of those and i will vouch for many who unite integrity with skill and attention and walk honourably upright where there are so many pitfalls and stumblingblocks for those of a different character to such men their fellow citizens may safely entrust the care of protecting their patrimonial rights and their country the more sacred charge of her laws and privileges  they are best aff however that hae least to do with them said ochiltree who had stretched his neck into the parlour door for the general confusion of the family not having yet subsided the domestics like waves after the fall of a hurricane had not yet exactly regained their due limits but were roaming wildly through the house  aha old truepenny art thou there said the antiquary sir arthur let me bring in the messenger of good luck though he is but a lame one you talked of the raven that scented out the slaughter from afar but heres a blue pigeon somewhat of the oldest and toughest i grant who smelled the good news six or seven miles off flew thither in the taxedcart and returned with the olive branch  ye owe it o to puir robie that drave mepuir fallow said the beggar he doubts hes in disgrace wi my leddy and sir arthur  roberts repentant and bashful face was seen over the mendicants shoulder  in disgrace with me said sir arthurhow sofor the irritation into which he had worked himself on occasion of the toast had been long forgotten o i recollectrobert i was angry and you were wronggo about your work and never answer a master that speaks to you in a passion  nor any one else said the antiquary for a soft answer turneth away wrath  and tell your mother who is so ill with the rheumatism to come down to the housekeeper tomorrow said miss wardour and we will see what can be of service to her  god bless your leddyship said poor robert and his honour sir arthur and the young laird and the house of knockwinnock in a its branches far and nearits been a kind and gude house to the puir this mony hundred years  theresaid the antiquary to sir arthurwe wont disputebut there you see the gratitude of the poor people naturally turns to the civil virtues of your family you dont hear them talk of redhand or hellinharness for me i must say odi accipitrem qui semper vivit in armisso let us eat and drink in peace and be joyful sir knight  a table was quickly covered in the parlour where the party sat joyously down to some refreshment at the request of oldbuck edie ochiltree was permitted to sit by the sideboard in a great leathern chair which was placed in some measure behind a screen  i accede to this the more readily said sir arthur because i remember in my fathers days that chair was occupied by ailshie gourlay who for aught i know was the last privileged fool or jester maintained by any family of distinction in scotland  aweel sir arthur replied the beggar who never hesitated an instant between his friend and his jest mony a wise man sits in a fules seat and mony a fule in a wise mans especially in families o distinction  miss wardour fearing the effect of this speech however worthy of ailsbie gourlay or any other privileged jester upon the nerves of her father hastened to inquire whether ale and beef should not be distributed to the servants and people whom the news had assembled round the castle  surely my love said her father when was it ever otherwise in our families when a siege had been raised  ay a siege laid by saunders sweepclean the bailiff and raised by edie ochiltree the gaberlunzie par nobile fratrum said oldbuck and well pitted against each other in respectability but never mind sir arthur these are such sieges and such reliefs as our time of day admits ofand our escape is not less worth commemorating in a glass of this excellent wineupon my credit it is burgundy i think  were there anything better in the cellar said miss wardour it would be all too little to regale you after your friendly exertions  say you so said the antiquary why then a cup of thanks to you my fair enemy and soon may you be besieged as ladies love best to be and sign terms of capitulation in the chapel of saint winnox  miss wardour blushedhector coloured and then grew pale  sir arthur answered my daughter is much obliged to you monkbarns but unless youll accept of her yourself i really do not know where a poor knights daughter is to seek for an alliance in these mercenary times  me mean ye sir arthur no not i i will claim privilege of the duello and as being unable to encounter my fair enemy myself i will appear by my championbut of this matter hereafter what do you find in the papers there hector that you hold your head down over them as if your nose were bleeding  nothing particular sir but only that as my arm is now almost quite well i think i shall relieve you of my company in a day or two and go to edinburgh i see major neville is arrived there i should like to see him  major whom said his uncle  major neville sir answered the young soldier  and who the devil is major neville demanded the antiquary  o mr oldbuck said sir arthur you must remember his name frequently in the newspapersa very distinguished young officer indeed but i am happy to say that mr mintyre need not leave monkbarns to see him for my son writes that the major is to come with him to knockwinnock and i need not say how happy i shall be to make the young gentlemen acquaintedunless indeed they are known to each other already  no not personally answered hector but i have had occasion to hear a good deal of him and we have several mutual friendsyour son being one of them but i must go to edinburgh for i see my uncle is beginning to grow tired of me and i am afraid  that you will grow tired of him interrupted oldbucki fear thats past praying for but you have forgotten that the ecstatic twelfth of august approaches and that you are engaged to meet one of lord glenallans gamekeepers god knows where to persecute the peaceful feathered creation  true true unclei had forgot that exclaimed the volatile hector but you said something just now that put everything out of my head  an it like your honours said old edie thrusting his white head from behind the screen where he had been plentifully regaling himself with ale and cold meatan it like your honours i can tell ye something that will keep the captain wi us amaist as weel as the poutinghear ye na the french are coming  the french you blockhead answered oldbuckbah  i have not had time said sir arthur wardour to look over my lieutenancy correspondence for the weekindeed i generally make a rule to read it only on wednesdays except in pressing casesfor i do everything by method but from the glance i took of my letters i observed some alarm was entertained  alarm said edie troth theres alarm for the provosts gard the beacon light on the halkethead be sorted up that suld hae been sorted half a year syne in an unco hurry and the council hae named nae less a man than auld caxon himsell to watch the light some say it was out o compliment to lieutenant taffrilfor its neist to certain that hell marry jenny caxonsome say its to please your honour and monkbarns that wear wigsand some say theres some auld story about a periwig that ane o the bailies got and neer paid foronyway there he is sitting cockit up like a skart upon the tap o the craig to skirl when foul weather comes  on mine honour a pretty warder said monkbarns and whats my wig to do all the while  i asked caxon that very question answered ochiltree and he said he could look in ilka morning and giet a touch afore he gaed to his bed for theres another man to watch in the daytime and caxon says hell friz your honours wig as weel sleeping as wauking  this news gave a different turn to the conversation which ran upon national defence and the duty of fighting for the land we live in until it was time to part the antiquary and his nephew resumed their walk homeward after parting from knockwinnock with the warmest expressions of mutual regard and an agreement to meet again as soon as possible     chapter twentythird                nay if she love me not i care not for her               shall i look pale because the maiden blooms               or sigh because she smiles and smiles on others               not i by heaveni hold my peace too dear                     to let it like the plume upon her cap              shake at each nod that her caprice shall dictate                                           old play  hector said his uncle to captain mintyre in the course of their walk homeward i am sometimes inclined to suspect that in one respect you are a fool  if you only think me so in one respect sir i am sure you do me more grace than i expected or deserve  i mean in one particular par excellence answered the antiquary i have sometimes thought that you have cast your eyes upon miss wardour  well sir said mintyre with much composure  well sir echoed his uncledeuce take the fellow he answers me as if it were the most reasonable thing in the world that he a captain in the army and nothing at all besides should marry the daughter of a baronet  i presume to think sir said the young highlander there would be no degradation on miss wardours part in point of family  o heaven forbid we should come on that topicno no equal bothboth on the tableland of gentility and qualified to look down on every roturier in scotland  and in point of fortune we are pretty even since neither of us have got any continued hector there may be an error but i cannot plead guilty to presumption  but here lies the error then if you call it so replied his uncle she wont have you hector  indeed sir  it is very sure hector and to make it double sure i must inform you that she likes another man she misunderstood some words i once said to her and i have since been able to guess at the interpretation she put on them at the time i was unable to account for her hesitation and blushing but my poor hector i now understand them as a deathsignal to your hopes and pretensions so i advise you to beat your retreat and draw off your forces as well as you can for the fort is too well garrisoned for you to storm it  i have no occasion to beat any retreat uncle said hector holding himself very upright and marching with a sort of dogged and offended solemnity no man needs to retreat that has never advanced there are women in scotland besides miss wardour of as good family  and better taste said his uncle doubtless there are hector and though i cannot say but that she is one of the most accomplished as well as sensible girls i have seen yet i doubt much of her merit would be cast away on you a showy figure now with two cross feathers above her noddleone green one blue who would wear a ridinghabit of the regimental complexion drive a gig one day and the next review the regiment on the grey trotting pony which dragged that vehicle hoc erat in votisthese are the qualities that would subdue you especially if she had a taste for natural history and loved a specimen of a phoca  its a little hard sir said hector i must have that cursed seal thrown into my face on all occasionsbut i care little about itand i shall not break my heart for miss wardour she is free to choose for herself and i wish her all happiness  magnanimously resolved thou prop of troy why hector i was afraid of a scene your sister told me you were desperately in love with miss wardour  sir answered the young man you would not have me desperately in love with a woman that does not care about me  well nephew said the antiquary more seriously there is doubtless much sense in what you say yet i would have given a great deal some twenty or twentyfive years since to have been able to think as you do  anybody i suppose may think as they please on such subjects said hector  not according to the old school said oldbuck but as i said before the practice of the modern seems in this case the most prudential though i think scarcely the most interesting but tell me your ideas now on this prevailing subject of an invasion the cry is still they come  hector swallowing his mortification which he was peculiarly anxious to conceal from his uncles satirical observation readily entered into a conversation which was to turn the antiquarys thoughts from miss wardour and the seal when they reached monkbarns the communicating to the ladies the events which had taken place at the castle with the counterinformation of how long dinner had waited before the womankind had ventured to eat it in the antiquarys absence averted these delicate topics of discussion  the next morning the antiquary arose early and as caxon had not yet made his appearance he began mentally to feel the absence of the petty news and small talk of which the experuquier was a faithful reporter and which habit had made as necessary to the antiquary as his occasional pinch of snuff although he held or affected to hold both to be of the same intrinsic value the feeling of vacuity peculiar to such a deprivation was alleviated by the appearance of old ochiltree sauntering beside the clipped yew and holly hedges with the air of a person quite at home indeed so familiar had he been of late that even juno did not bark at him but contented herself with watching him with a close and vigilant eye our antiquary stepped out in his nightgown and instantly received and returned his greeting  they are coming now in good earnest monkbarns i just cam frae fairport to bring ye the news and then ill step away back again the search has just come into the bay and they say shes been chased by a french fleet  the search said oldbuck reflecting a moment oho  ay ay captain taffrils gunbrig the search  what any relation to search no ii said oldbuck catching at the light which the name of the vessel seemed to throw on the mysterious chest of treasure  the mendicant like a man detected in a frolic put his bonnet before his face yet could not help laughing heartilythe deils in you monkbarns for garring odds and evens meet wha thought ye wad hae laid that and that thegither od i am clean catchd now  i see it all said oldbuck as plain as the legend on a medal of high preservationthe box in which the bullion was found belonged to the gunbrig and the treasure to my phoenixedie nodded assentand was buried there that sir arthur might receive relief in his difficulties  by me said edie and twa o the brigs menbut they didna ken its contents and thought it some bit smuggling concern o the captains i watched day and night till i saw it in the right hand and then when that german deevil was glowering at the lid o the kist they liked mutton weel that licked where the yowe lay i think some scottish deevil put it into my head to play him yon ither cantrip now ye see if i had said mair or less to bailie littlejohn i behoved till hae come out wi a this story and vexed would mr lovel hae been to have it brought to lightsae i thought i would stand to onything rather than that  i must say he has chosen his confidant well said oldbuck though somewhat strangely  ill say this for mysell monkbarns answered the mendicant that i am the fittest man in the haill country to trust wi siller for i neither want it nor wish for it nor could use it if i had it but the lad hadna muckle choice in the matter for he thought he was leaving the country for ever i trust hes mistaen in that though and the night was set in when we learned by a strange chance sir arthurs sair distress and lovel was obliged to be on board as the day dawned but five nights afterwards the brig stood into the bay and i met the boat by appointment and we buried the treasure where ye fand it  this was a very romantic foolish exploit said oldbuck why not trust me or any other friend  the blood o your sisters son replied edie was on his hands and him maybe dead outrightwhat time had he to take counselor how could he ask it of you by onybody  you are right but what if dousterswivel had come before you  there was little fear o his coming there without sir arthur he had gotten a sair gliff the night afore and never intended to look near the place again unless he had been brought there sting and ling he kend weel the first pose was o his ain hiding and how could he expect a second he just havered on about it to make the mair o sir arthur  then how said oldbuck should sir arthur have come there unless the german had brought him  umph answered edie drily i had a story about misticot wad hae brought him forty miles or you either besides it was to be thought he would be for visiting the place he fand the first siller inhe kend na the secret o that job in short the siller being in this shape sir arthur in utter difficulties and lovel determined he should never ken the hand that helped himfor that was what he insisted maist uponwe couldna think o a better way to fling the gear in his gate though we simmered it and wintered it eer sae lang and if by ony queer mischance doustercivil had got his claws ont i was instantly to hae informed you or the sheriff o the haill story  well notwithstanding all these wise precautions i think your contrivance succeeded better than such a clumsy one deserved edie but how the deuce came lovel by such a mass of silver ingots  thats just what i canna tell yebut they were put on board wi his things at fairport its like and we stowed them into ane o the ammunitionboxes o the brig baith for concealment and convenience of carriage  lord said oldbuck his recollection recurring to the earlier part of his acquaintance with lovel and this young fellow who was putting hundreds on so strange a hazard i must be recommending a subscription to him and paying his bill at the ferry i never will pay any persons bill again thats certainand you kept up a constant correspondence with lovel i suppose  i just gat ae bit scrape o a pen frae him to say there wad as yesterday fell be a packet at tannonburgh wi letters o great consequence to the knockwinnock folk for they jaloused the opening of our letters at fairportand thats as true i hear mrs mailsetter is to lose her office for looking after other folks business and neglecting her ain  and what do you expect now edie for being the adviser and messenger and guard and confidential person in all these matters  deil haet do i expectexcepting that a the gentles will come to the gaberlunzies burial and maybe yell carry the head yoursell as ye did puir steenie mucklebackitswhat trouble wast to me i was ganging about at ony rateoh but i was blythe when i got out of prison though for i thought what if that weary letter should come when i am closed up here like an oyster and a should gang wrang for want ot and whiles i thought i maun mak a clean breast and tell you a about it but then i couldna weel do that without contravening mr lovels positive orders and i reckon he had to see somebody at edinburgh afore he could do what he wussed to do for sir arthur and his family  well and to your public news edieso they are still coming are they  troth they say sae sir and theres come down strict orders for the forces and volunteers to be alert and theres a clever young officer to come here forthwith to look at our means o defencei saw the bailies lass cleaning his belts and white breeksi gae her a hand for ye maun think she wasna ower clever at it and sae i gat a the news for my pains  and what think you as an old soldier  troth i kennaan they come so mony as they speak o theyll be odds against us but theres mony yauld chields amang thae volunteers and i mauna say muckle about them thats no weel and no very able because i am something that gate mysellbut wese do our best  what so your martial spirit is rising again edie                  even in our ashes glow their wonted fires  i would not have thought you edie had so much to fight for  me no muckle to fight for sirisna there the country to fight for and the burnsides that i gang daundering beside and the hearths othe gudewives that gie me my bit bread and the bits o weans that come toddling to play wi me when i come about a landward towndeil he continued grasping his pikestaff with great emphasis an i had as gude pith as i hae gudewill and a gude cause i should gie some o them a days kemping  bravo bravo edie the countrys in little ultimate danger when the beggars as ready to fight for his dish as the laird for his land  their further conversation reverted to the particulars of the night passed by the mendicant and lovel in the ruins of st ruth by the details of which the antiquary was highly amused  i would have given a guinea he said to have seen the scoundrelly german under the agonies of those terrors which it is part of his own quackery to inspire into others and trembling alternately for the fury of his patron and the apparition of some hobgoblin  troth said the beggar there was time for him to be cowed for ye wad hae thought the very spirit of hellinharness had taken possession o the body o sir arthur but what will come o the landlouper  i have had a letter this morning from which i understand he has acquitted you of the charge he brought against you and offers to make such discoveries as will render the settlement of sir arthurs affairs a more easy task than we apprehendedso writes the sheriff and adds that he has given some private information of importance to government in consideration of which i understand he will be sent back to play the knave in his own country  and a the bonny engines and wheels and the coves and sheughs doun at glenwithershins yonder whats to come o them said edie  i hope the men before they are dispersed will make a bonfire of their gimcracks as an army destroy their artillery when forced to raise a siege and as for the holes edie i abandon them as rattraps for the benefit of the next wise men who may choose to drop the substance to snatch at a shadow  hech sirs guide us a to burn the engines thats a great wastehad ye na better try to get back part o your hundred pounds wi the sale o the materials he continued with a tone of affected condolence  not a farthing said the antiquary peevishly taking a turn from him and making a step or two away then returning halfsmiling at his own pettishness he said get thee into the house edie and remember my counsel never speak to me about a mine nor to my nephew hector about a phoca that is a sealgh as you call it  i maun be ganging my ways back to fairport said the wanderer i want to see what theyre saying there about the invasionbut ill mind what your honour says no to speak to you about a sealgh or to the captain about the hundred pounds that you gied to douster  confound theei desired thee not to mention that to me  dear me said edie with affected surprise weel i thought there was naething but what your honour could hae studden in the way o agreeable conversation unless it was about the praetorian yonder or the bodle that the packman sauld to ye for an auld coin  pshaw pshaw said the antiquary turning from him hastily and retreating into the house  the mendicant looked after him a moment and with a chuckling laugh such as that with which a magpie or parrot applauds a successful exploit of mischief he resumed once more the road to fairport his habits had given him a sort of restlessness much increased by the pleasure he took in gathering news and in a short time he had regained the town which he left in the morning for no reason that he knew himself unless just to hae a bit crack wi monkbarns     chapter twentyfourth                      red glared the beacon on pownell                         on skiddaw there were three                     the bugle horn on moor and fell                         was heard continually                                      james hogg  the watch who kept his watch on the hill and looked towards birnam probably conceived himself dreaming when he first beheld the fated grove put itself into motion for its march to dunsinane even so old caxon as perched in his hut he qualified his thoughts upon the approaching marriage of his daughter and the dignity of being fatherinlaw to lieutenant taffril with an occasional peep towards the signalpost with which his own corresponded was not a little surprised by observing a light in that direction he rubbed his eyes looked again adjusting his observation by a crossstaff which had been placed so as to bear upon the point and behold the light increased like a comet to the eye of the astronomer with fear of change perplexing nations  the lord preserve us said caxon whats to be done now but there will be wiser heads than mine to look to that sae ise een fire the beacon  and he lighted the beacon accordingly which threw up to the sky a long wavering train of light startling the seafowl from their nests and reflected far beneath by the reddening billows of the sea the brother warders of caxon being equally diligent caught and repeated his signal the lights glanced on headlands and capes and inland hills and the whole district was alarmed by the signal of invasion    note j alarms of invasion  our antiquary his head wrapped warm in two double nightcaps was quietly enjoying his repose when it was suddenly broken by the screams of his sister his niece and two maidservants  what the devil is the matter said he starting up in his bed womankind in my room at this hour of nightare ye all mad  the beacon uncle said miss mintyre  the french coming to murder us screamed miss griselda  the beacon the beaconthe french the frenchmurder murder and waur than murdercried the two handmaidens like the chorus of an opera  illustration the antiquary arming  the french said oldbuck starting upget out of the room womankind that you are till i get my things onand hark ye bring me my sword  whilk o them monkbarns cried his sister offering a roman falchion of brass with the one hand and with the other an andrea ferrara without a handle  the langest the langest cried jenny rintherout dragging in a twohanded sword of the twelfth century  womankind said oldbuck in great agitation be composed and do not give way to vain terrorare you sure they are come  sure sure exclaimed jennyower surea the sea fencibles and the land fencibles and the volunteers and yeomanry are on fit and driving to fairport as hard as horse and man can gangand auld mucklebackits gane wi the lavemuckle gude hell dohech sirshell be missed the morn wha wad hae served king and country weel  give me said oldbuck the sword which my father wore in the year fortyfiveit hath no belt or baldrickbut well make shift  so saying he thrust the weapon through the cover of his breeches pocket at this moment hector entered who had been to a neighbouring height to ascertain whether the alarm was actual  where are your arms nephew exclaimed oldbuckwhere is your doublebarrelled gun that was never out of your hand when there was no occasion for such vanities  pooh pooh sir said hector who ever took a fowlingpiece on action i have got my uniform on you seei hope i shall be of more use if they will give me a command than i could be with ten doublebarrels and you sir must get to fairport to give directions for quartering and maintaining the men and horses and preventing confusion  you are right hectorl believe i shall do as much with my head as my hand too but here comes sir arthur wardour who between ourselves is not fit to accomplish much either one way or the other  sir arthur was probably of a different opinion for dressed in his lieutenancy uniform he was also on the road to fairport and called in his way to take mr oldbuck with him having had his original opinion of his sagacity much confirmed by late events and in spite of all the entreaties of the womankind that the antiquary would stay to garrison monkbarns mr oldbuck with his nephew instantly accepted sir arthurs offer  those who have witnessed such a scene can alone conceive the state of bustle in fairport the windows were glancing with a hundred lights which appearing and disappearing rapidly indicated the confusion within doors the women of lower rank assembled and clamoured in the marketplace the yeomanry pouring from their different glens galloped through the streets some individually some in parties of five or six as they had met on the road the drums and fifes of the volunteers beating to arms were blended with the voice of the officers the sound of the bugles and the tolling of the bells from the steeple the ships in the harbour were lit up and boats from the armed vessels added to the bustle by landing men and guns destined to assist in the defence of the place this part of the preparations was superintended by taffril with much activity two or three light vessels had already slipped their cables and stood out to sea in order to discover the supposed enemy  such was the scene of general confusion when sir arthur wardour oldbuck and hector made their way with difficulty into the principal square where the townhouse is situated it was lighted up and the magistracy with many of the neighbouring gentlemen were assembled and here as upon other occasions of the like kind in scotland it was remarkable how the good sense and firmness of the people supplied almost all the deficiencies of inexperience  the magistrates were beset by the quartermasters of the different corps for billets for men and horses let us said bailie littlejohn take the horses into our warehouses and the men into our parloursshare our supper with the one and our forage with the other we have made ourselves wealthy under a free and paternal government and now is the time to show we know its value  a loud and cheerful acquiescence was given by all present and the substance of the wealthy with the persons of those of all ranks were unanimously devoted to the defence of the country  captain mintyre acted on this occasion as military adviser and aidedecamp to the principal magistrate and displayed a degree of presence of mind and knowledge of his profession totally unexpected by his uncle who recollecting his usual insouciance and impetuosity gazed at him with astonishment from time to time as he remarked the calm and steady manner in which he explained the various measures of precaution that his experience suggested and gave directions for executing them he found the different corps in good order considering the irregular materials of which they were composed in great force of numbers and high confidence and spirits and so much did military experience at that moment overbalance all other claims to consequence that even old edie instead of being left like diogenes at sinope to roll his tub when all around were preparing for defence had the duty assigned him of superintending the serving out of the ammunition which he executed with much discretion  two things were still anxiously expectedthe presence of the glenallan volunteers who in consideration of the importance of that family had been formed into a separate corps and the arrival of the officer before announced to whom the measures of defence on that coast had been committed by the commanderinchief and whose commission would entitle him to take upon himself the full disposal of the military force  at length the bugles of the glenallan yeomanry were heard and the earl himself to the surprise of all who knew his habits and state of health appeared at their head in uniform they formed a very handsome and wellmounted squadron formed entirely out of the earls lowland tenants and were followed by a regiment of five hundred men completely equipped in the highland dress whom he had brought down from the upland glens with their pipes playing in the van the clean and serviceable appearance of this band of feudal dependants called forth the admiration of captain mintyre but his uncle was still more struck by the manner in which upon this crisis the ancient military spirit of his house seemed to animate and invigorate the decayed frame of the earl their leader he claimed and obtained for himself and his followers the post most likely to be that of danger displayed great alacrity in making the necessary dispositions and showed equal acuteness in discussing their propriety morning broke in upon the military councils of fairport while all concerned were still eagerly engaged in taking precautions for their defence  at length a cry among the people announced theres the brave major neville come at last with another officer and their postchaise and four drove into the square amidst the huzzas of the volunteers and inhabitants the magistrates with their assessors of the lieutenancy hastened to the door of their townhouse to receive him but what was the surprise of all present but most especially that of the antiquary when they became aware that the handsome uniform and military cap disclosed the person and features of the pacific lovel a warm embrace and a hearty shake of the hand were necessary to assure him that his eyes were doing him justice sir arthur was no less surprised to recognise his son captain wardour in lovels or rather major nevilles company the first words of the young officers were a positive assurance to all present that the courage and zeal which they had displayed were entirely thrown away unless in so far as they afforded an acceptable proof of their spirit and promptitude  the watchman at halkethead said major neville as we discovered by an investigation which we made in our route hither was most naturally misled by a bonfire which some idle people had made on the hill above glenwithershins just in the line of the beacon with which his corresponded  oldbuck gave a conscious look to sir arthur who returned it with one equally sheepish and a shrug of the shoulders  it must have been the machinery which we condemned to the flames in our wrath said the antiquary plucking up heart though not a little ashamed of having been the cause of so much disturbancethe devil take dousterswivel with all my hearti think he has bequeathed us a legacy of blunders and mischief as if he had lighted some train of fireworks at his departure i wonder what cracker will go off next among our shins but yonder comes the prudent caxonhold up your head you assyour betters must bear the blame for youand here take this whatdyecall itgiving him his swordi wonder what i would have said yesterday to any man that would have told me i was to stick such an appendage to my tail  here he found his arm gently pressed by lord glenallan who dragged him into a separate apartment for gods sake who is that young gentleman who is so strikingly like  like the unfortunate eveline interrupted oldbuck i felt my heart warm to him from the first and your lordship has suggested the very cause  but whowho is he continued lord glenallan holding the antiquary with a convulsive grasp  formerly i would have called him lovel but now he turns out to be major neville  whom my brother brought up as his natural sonwhom he made his heir gracious heaven the child of my eveline  hold my lordhold said oldbuck do not give too hasty way to such a presumptionwhat probability is there  probability none there is certainty absolute certainty the agent i mentioned to you wrote me the whole storyi received it yesterday not sooner bring him for gods sake that a fathers eyes may bless him before he departs  i will but for your own sake and his give him a few moments for preparation  and determined to make still farther investigation before yielding his entire conviction to so strange a tale he sought out major neville and found him expediting the necessary measures for dispersing the force which had been assembled  pray major neville leave this business for a moment to captain wardour and to hector with whom i hope you are thoroughly reconciled neville laughed and shook hands with hector across the table and grant me a moments audience  you have a claim on me mr oldbuck were my business more urgent said neville for having passed myself upon you under a false name and rewarding your hospitality by injuring your nephew  you served him as he deserved said oldbuckthough by the way he showed as much good sense as spirit todayegad if he would rub up his learning and read caesar and polybus and the stratagemata polyaeni i think he would rise in the armyand i will certainly lend him a lift  he is heartily deserving of it said neville and i am glad you excuse me which you may do the more frankly when you know that i am so unfortunate as to have no better right to the name of neville by which i have been generally distinguished than to that of lovel under which you knew me  indeed then i trust we shall find out one for you to which you shall have a firm and legal title  siri trust you do not think the misfortune of my birth a fit subject  by no means young man answered the antiquary interrupting himi believe i know more of your birth than you do yourselfand to convince you of it you were educated and known as a natural son of geraldin neville of nevillesburgh in yorkshire and i presume as his destined heir  pardon meno such views were held out to me i was liberally educated and pushed forward in the army by money and interest but i believe my supposed father long entertained some ideas of marriage though he never carried them into effect  you say your supposed fatherwhat leads you to suppose mr geraldin neville was not your real father  i know mr oldbuck that you would not ask these questions on a point of such delicacy for the gratification of idle curiosity i will therefore tell you candidly that last year while we occupied a small town in french flanders i found in a convent near which i was quartered a woman who spoke remarkably good englishshe was a spaniardher name teresa dacunha in the process of our acquaintance she discovered who i was and made herself known to me as the person who had charge of my infancy she dropped more than one hint of rank to which i was entitled and of injustice done to me promising a more full disclosure in case of the death of a lady in scotland during whose lifetime she was determined to keep the secret she also intimated that mr geraldin neville was not my father we were attacked by the enemy and driven from the town which was pillaged with savage ferocity by the republicans the religious orders were the particular objects of their hate and cruelty the convent was burned and several nuns perished among others teresa and with her all chance of knowing the story of my birth tragic by all accounts it must have been  raro antecedentem scelestum or as i may here say scelestam said oldbuck deseruit poenaeven epicureans admitted that and what did you do upon this  i remonstrated with mr neville by letter and to no purpose i then obtained leave of absence and threw myself at his feet conjuring him to complete the disclosure which teresa had begun he refused and on my importunity indignantly upbraided me with the favours he had already conferred i thought he abused the power of a benefactor as he was compelled to admit he had no title to that of a father and we parted in mutual displeasure i renounced the name of neville and assumed that under which you knew me it was at this time when residing with a friend in the north of england who favoured my disguise that i became acquainted with miss wardour and was romantic enough to follow her to scotland my mind wavered on various plans of life when i resolved to apply once more to mr neville for an explanation of the mystery of my birth it was long ere i received an answer you were present when it was put into my hands he informed me of his bad state of health and conjured me for my own sake to inquire no farther into the nature of his connection with me but to rest satisfied with his declaring it to be such and so intimate that he designed to constitute me his heir when i was preparing to leave fairport to join him a second express brought me word that he was no more the possession of great wealth was unable to suppress the remorseful feelings with which i now regarded my conduct to my benefactor and some hints in his letter appearing to intimate there was on my birth a deeper stain than that of ordinary illegitimacy i remembered certain prejudices of sir arthur  and you brooded over these melancholy ideas until you were ill instead of coming to me for advice and telling me the whole story said oldbuck  exactly then came my quarrel with captain mintyre and my compelled departure from fairport and its vicinity  from love and from poetrymiss wardour and the caledoniad  most true  and since that time you have been occupied i suppose with plans for sir arthurs relief  yes sir with the assistance of captain wardour at edinburgh  and edie ochiltree hereyou see i know the whole story but how came you by the treasure  it was a quantity of plate which had belonged to my uncle and was left in the custody of a person at fairport some time before his death he had sent orders that it should be melted down he perhaps did not wish me to see the glenallan arms upon it  well major nevilleor let me say lovel being the name in which i rather delightyou must i believe exchange both of your aliass for the style and title of the honourable william geraldin commonly called lord geraldin  the antiquary then went through the strange and melancholy circumstances concerning his mothers death  i have no doubt he said that your uncle wished the report to be believed that the child of this unhappy marriage was no moreperhaps he might himself have an eye to the inheritance of his brotherhe was then a gay wild young manbut of all intentions against your person however much the evil conscience of elspeth might lead her to inspect him from the agitation in which he appeared teresas story and your own fully acquit him and now my dear sir let me have the pleasure of introducing a son to a father  we will not attempt to describe such a meeting the proofs on all sides were found to be complete for mr neville had left a distinct account of the whole transaction with his confidential steward in a sealed packet which was not to be opened until the death of the old countess his motive for preserving secrecy so long appearing to have been an apprehension of the effect which the discovery fraught with so much disgrace must necessarily produce upon her haughty and violent temper  in the evening of that day the yeomanry and volunteers of glenallan drank prosperity to their young master in a month afterwards lord geraldin was married to miss wardour the antiquary making the lady a present of the

antiquarys perpetual harping upon the story of the phoca people talk of a marriage between miss mintyre and captain wardour but this wants confirmation  the antiquary is a frequent visitor at knockwinnock and glenallan house ostensibly for the sake of completing two essays one on the mailshirt of the great earl and the other on the lefthand gauntlet of hellinharness he regularly inquires whether lord geraldin has commenced the caledoniad and shakes his head at the answers he receives en attendant however he has completed his notes which we believe will be at the service of any one who chooses to make them public without risk or expense to the antiquary     notes to the antiquary  note a p mottoes  it was in correcting the proofsheets of this novel that scott first took to equipping his chapters with mottoes of his own fabrication on one occasion he happened to ask john ballantyne who was sitting by him to hunt for a particular passage in beaumont and fletcher john did as he was bid but did not succeed in discovering the lines hang it johnnie cried scott i believe i can make a motto sooner than you will find one he did so accordingly and from that hour whenever memory failed to suggest an appropriate epigraph he had recourse to the inexhaustible mines of old play or old ballad to which we owe some of the most exquisite verses that ever flowed from his penj g lockhart  see

and those in the north of england was published at london in 1727 folio the author states that in prosecuting his work he made a pretty laborious progress through almost every part of scotland for three years successively gordon was a native of aberdeenshire and had previously spent some years in travelling abroad probably as a tutor he became secretary to the london society of antiquaries in 1736 this office he resigned in 1741 and soon after went out to south carolina with governor glen where he obtained a considerable grant of land on his death about the year 1753 he is said to have left a handsome estate to his familysee literary anecdotes of bowyer by john nichols vol v p 329 etc  note c p praetorium  it may be worth while to mention that the incident of the supposed praetorium actually happened to an antiquary of great learning and acuteness sir john clerk of penicuik one of the barons of the scottish court of exchequer and a parliamentary commissioner for arrangement of the union between england and scotland as many of his writings show sir john was much attached to the study of scottish antiquities he had a small property in dumfriesshire near the roman station on the hill called burrenswark here he received the distinguished english antiquarian roger gale and of course conducted him to see this remarkable spot where the lords of the world have left such decisive marks of their martial labours  an aged shepherd whom they had used as a guide or who had approached them from curiosity listened with mouth agape to the dissertations on foss and vellum ports dextra sinistra and decumana which sir john clerk delivered ex cathedra and his learned visitor listened with the deference to the dignity of a connoisseur on his own ground but when the cicerone proceeded to point out a small hillock near the centre of the enclosure as the praetorium corydons patience could hold no longer and like edie ochiltree he forgot all reverence and broke in with nearly the same wordspraetorium here praetorium there i made the bourock mysell with a flaughterspade the effect of this undeniable evidence on the two lettered sages may be left to the readers imagination  the late excellent and venerable john clerk of eldin the celebrated author of naval tactics used to tell this story with glee and being a younger son of sir johns was perhaps present on the occasion  note d p mr rutherfurds dream  the legend of mrs grizel oldbuck was partly taken from an extraordinary story which happened about seventy years since in the south of scotland so peculiar in its circumstances that it merits being mentioned in this place mr rutherfurd of bowland a gentleman of landed property in the vale of gala was prosecuted for a very considerable sum the accumulated arrears of teind or tithe for which he was said to be indebted to a noble family the titulars lay impropriators of the tithes mr rutherfurd was strongly impressed with the belief that his father had by a form of process peculiar to the law of scotland purchased these lands from the titular and therefore that the present prosecution was groundless but after an industrious search among his fathers papers an investigation of the public records and a careful inquiry among all persons who had transacted law business for his father no evidence could be recovered to support his defence the period was now near at hand when he conceived the loss of his lawsuit to be inevitable and he had formed his determination to ride to edinburgh next day and make the best bargain he could in the way of compromise he went to bed with this resolution and with all the circumstances of the case floating upon his mind had a dream to the following purposehis father who had been many years dead appeared to him he thought and asked him why he was disturbed in his mind in dreams men are not surprised at such apparitions mr rutherfurd thought that he informed his father of the cause of his distress adding that the payment of a considerable sum of money was the more unpleasant to him because he had a strong consciousness that it was not due though he was unable to recover any evidence in support of his belief you are right my son replied the paternal shade i did acquire right to these teinds for payment of which you are now prosecuted the papers relating to the transaction are in the hands of mr a writer or attorney who is now retired from professional business and resides at inveresk near edinburgh he was a person whom i employed on that occasion for a particular reason but who never on any other occasion transacted business on my account it is very possible pursued the vision that mrmay have forgotten a matter which is now of a very old date but you may call it to his recollection by this token that when i came to pay his account there was difficulty in getting change for a portugal piece of gold and that we were forced to drink out the balance at a tavern  mr rutherfurd awakened in the morning with all the words of the vision imprinted on his mind and thought it worth while to ride across the country to inveresk instead of going straight to edinburgh when he came there he waited on the gentleman mentioned in the dream a very old man without saying anything of the vision he inquired whether he remembered having conducted such a matter for his deceased father the old gentleman could not at first bring the circumstance to his recollection but on mention of the portugal piece of gold the whole returned upon his memory he made an immediate search for the papers and recovered themso that mr rutherfurd carried to edinburgh the documents necessary to gain the cause which he was on the verge of losing  the author has often heard this story told by persons who had the best access to know the facts who were not likely themselves to be deceived and were certainly incapable of deception he cannot therefore refuse to give it credit however extraordinary the circumstances may appear the circumstantial character of the information given in the dream takes it out of the general class of impressions of the kind which are occasioned by the fortuitous coincidence of actual events with our sleeping thoughts on the other hand few will suppose that the laws of nature were suspended and a special communication from the dead to the living permitted for the purpose of saving mr rutherfurd a certain number of hundred pounds the authors theory is that the dream was only the recapitulation of information which mr rutherfurd had really received from his father while in life but which at first he merely recalled as a general impression that the claim was settled it is not uncommon for persons to recover during sleep the thread of ideas which they have lost during their waking hours  it may be added that this remarkable circumstance was attended with bad consequences to mr rutherfurd whose health and spirits were afterwards impaired by the attention which he thought himself obliged to pay to the visions of the night  note e p nicksticks  a sort of tally generally used by bakers of the olden time in settling with their customers each family had its own nickstick and for each loaf as delivered a notch was made on the stick accounts in exchequer kept by the same kind of check may have occasioned the antiquarys partiality in priors time the english bakers had the same sort of reckoning                     have you not seen a bakers maid                    between two equal panniers swayd                    her tallies useless lie and

scotts discovery of witchcraft third edition folio london 1665 the appendix is entitled an excellent discourse of the nature and substances of devils and spirits in two books the first by the aforesaid author reginald scott the second now added in this third edition as succedaneous to the former and conducing to the completing of the whole work this second book though stated as succedaneous to the first is in fact entirely at variance with it for the work of reginald scott is a compilation of the absurd and superstitious ideas concerning witches so generally entertained at the time and the pretended conclusion is a serious treatise on the various means of conjuring astral spirits  scotts discovery of witchcraft was first published in the reign of queen elizabeth london 1584  note g p gynecocracy  in the fishing villages on the firths of forth and tay as well as elsewhere in scotland the government is gynecocracy as described in the text in the course of the late war and during the alarm of invasion a fleet of transports entered the firth of forth under the convoy of some ships of war which would reply to no signals a general alarm was excited in consequence of which all the fishers who were enrolled as seafencibles got on board the gunboats which they were to man as occasion should require and sailed to oppose the supposed enemy the foreigners proved to be russians with whom we were then at peace the county gentlemen of midlothian pleased with the zeal displayed by the seafencibles at a critical moment passed a vote for presenting the community of fishers with a silver punchbowl to be used on occasions of festivity but the fisherwomen on hearing what was intended put in their claim to have some separate share in the intended honorary reward the men they said were their husbands it was they who would have been sufferers if their husbands had been killed and it was by their permission and injunctions that they embarked on board the gunboats for the public service they therefore claimed to share the reward in some manner which should distinguish the female patriotism which they had shown on the occasion the gentlemen of the county willingly admitted the claim and without diminishing the value of their compliment to the men they made the females a present of a valuable broach to fasten the plaid of the queen of the fisherwomen for the time  it may be further remarked that these nereids are punctilious among themselves and observe different ranks according to the commodities they deal in one experienced dame was heard to characterise a younger damsel as a puir silly thing who had no ambition and would never she prophesied rise above the musselline of business  note h p battle of harlaw  the great battle of harlaw here and formerly referred to might be said to determine whether the gaelic or the saxon race should be predominant in scotland donald lord of the isles who had at that period the power of an independent sovereign laid claim to the earldom of ross during the regency of robert duke of albany to enforce his supposed right he ravaged the north with a large army of highlanders and islesmen he was encountered at harlaw in the garioch by alexander earl of mar at the head of the northern nobility and gentry of saxon and norman descent the battle was bloody and indecisive but the invader was obliged to retire in consequence of the loss he sustained and afterwards was compelled to make submission to the regent and renounce his pretensions to ross so that all the advantages of the field were gained by the saxons the battle of harlaw was fought 24th july 1411  note i p elspeths death  the concluding circumstance of elspeths death is taken from an incident said to have happened at the funeral of john duke of roxburghe all who were acquainted with that accomplished nobleman must remember that he was not more remarkable for creating and possessing a most curious and splendid library than for his acquaintance with the literary treasures it contained in arranging his books fetching and replacing the volumes which he wanted and carrying on all the necessary intercourse which a man of letters holds with his library it was the dukes custom to employ not a secretary or librarian but a livery servant called archie whom habit had made so perfectly acquainted with the library that he knew every book as a shepherd does the individuals of his flock by what is called headmark and could bring his master whatever volume he wanted and afford all the mechanical aid the duke required in his literary researches to secure the attendance of archie there was a bell hung in his room which was used on no occasion except to call him individually to the dukes study  his grace died in saint jamess square london in the year 1804 the body was to be conveyed to scotland to lie in state at his mansion of fleurs and to be removed from thence to the family burialplace at bowden  at this time archie who had been long attacked by a livercomplaint was in the very last stage of that disease yet he prepared himself to accompany the body of the master whom he had so long and so faithfully waited upon the medical persons assured him he could not survive the journey it signified nothing he said whether he died in england or scotland he was resolved to assist in rendering the last honours to the kind master from whom he had been inseparable for so many years even if he should expire in the attempt the poor invalid was permitted to attend the dukes body to scotland but when they reached fleurs he was totally exhausted and obliged to keep his bed in a sort of stupor which announced speedy dissolution on the morning of the day fixed for removing the dead body of the duke to the place of burial the private bell by which he was wont to summon his attendant to his study was rung violently this might easily happen in the confusion of such a scene although the people of the neighbourhood prefer believing that the bell sounded of its own accord ring however it did and archie roused by the wellknown summons rose up in his bed and faltered in broken accents yes my lord dukeyesi will wait on your grace instantly and with these words on his lips he is said to have fallen back and expired  note j p alarm of invasion  the story of the false alarm at fairport and the consequences are taken from a real incident those who witnessed the state of britain and of scotland in particular from the period that succeeded the war which commenced in 1803 to the battle of trafalgar must recollect those times with feelings which we can hardly hope to make the rising generation comprehend almost every individual was enrolled either in a military or civil capacity for the purpose of contributing to resist the longsuspended threats of invasion which were echoed from every quarter beacons were erected along the coast and all through the country to give the signal for every one to repair to the post where his peculiar duty called him and men of every description fit to serve held themselves in readiness on the shortest summons during this agitating period and on the evening of the 2d february 1804 the person who kept watch on the commanding station of home castle being deceived by some accidental fire in the county of northumberland which he took for the corresponding signallight in that county with which his orders were to communicate lighted up his own beacon the signal was immediately repeated through all the valleys on the english border if the beacon at saint abbs head had been fired the alarm would have run northward and roused all scotland but the watch at this important point judiciously considered that if there had been an actual or threatened descent on our eastern seacoast the alarm would have come along the coast and not from the interior of the country  through the border counties the alarm spread with rapidity and on no occasion when that country was the scene of perpetual and unceasing war was the summons to arms more readily obeyed in berwickshire roxburghshire and selkirkshire the volunteers and militia got under arms with a degree of rapidity and alacrity which considering the distance individuals lived from each other had something in it very surprisingthey poured to the alarmposts on the seacoast in a state so well armed and so completely appointed with baggage provisions etc as was accounted by the best military judges to render them fit for instant and effectual service  there were some particulars in the general alarm which are curious and interesting the men of liddesdale the most remote point to the westward which the alarm reached were so much afraid of being late in the field that they put in requisition all the horses they could find and when they had thus made a forced march out of their own country they turned their borrowed steeds loose to find their way back through the hills and they all got back safe to their own stables another remarkable circumstance was the general cry of the inhabitants of the smaller towns for arms that they might go along with their companions the selkirkshire yeomanry made a remarkable march for although some of the individuals lived at twenty and thirty miles distance from the place where they mustered they were nevertheless embodied and in order in so short a period that they were at dalkeith which was their alarmpost about one oclock on the day succeeding the first signal with men and horses in good order though the roads were in a bad state and many of the troopers must have ridden forty or fifty miles without drawing bridle two members of the corps chanced to be absent from their homes and in edinburgh on private business the lately married wife of one of these gentlemen and the widowed mother of the other sent the arms uniforms and chargers of the two troopers that they might join their companions at dalkeith the author was very much struck by the answer made to him by the lastmentioned lady when he paid her some compliment on the readiness which she showed in equipping her son with the means of meeting danger when she might have left him a fair excuse for remaining absent sir she replied with the spirit of a roman matron none can know better than you that my son is the only prop by which since his fathers death our family is supported but i would rather see him dead on that hearth than hear that he had been a horses length behind his companions in the defence of his king and country the author mentions what was immediately under his own eye and within his own knowledge but the spirit was universal wherever the alarm reached both in scotland and england  the account of the ready patriotism displayed by the country on this occasion warmed the hearts of scottishmen in every corner of the world it reached the ears of the wellknown dr leyden whose enthusiastic love of scotland and of his own district of teviotdale formed a distinguished part of his character the account which was read to him when on a sickbed stated very truly that the different corps on arriving at their alarmposts announced themselves by their music playing the tunes peculiar to their own districts many of which have been gatheringsignals for centuries it was particularly remembered that the liddesdale men before mentioned entered kelso playing the lively tune                         o wha dare meddle wi me                        and wha dare meddle wi me                        my name it is little jock elliot                        and wha dare meddle wi me  the patient was so delighted with this display of ancient border spirit that he sprung up in his bed and began to sing the old song with such vehemence of action and voice that his attendants ignorant of the cause of excitation concluded that the fever had taken possession of his brain and it was only the entry of another borderer sir john malcolm and the explanation which he was well qualified to give that prevented them from resorting to means of medical coercion  the circumstances of this false alarm and its consequences may be now held of too little importance even for a note upon a work of fiction but at the period when it happened it was hailed by the country as a propitious omen that the national force to which much must naturally have been trusted had the spirit to look in the face the danger which they had taken arms to repel and every one was convinced that on whichever side god might bestow the victory the invaders would meet with the most determined opposition from the children of the soil
