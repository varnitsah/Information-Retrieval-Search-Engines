8328251	twice told tales                     footprints on the seashore                       by nathaniel hawthorne    it must be a spirit much unlike my own which  can keep itself in health and vigor without sometimes stealing from the sultry sunshine of the world to plunge into the cool bath of solitude at  intervals and not infrequent ones the forest and the ocean summon meone with the roar of its waves the other with the murmur of its boughsforth from the  haunts of men  but i must wander many a mile ere i could stand beneath the shadow of even one primeval tree much less be lost among the multitude of hoary trunks and hidden from earth and sky by the mystery  of darksome foliage  nothing is within my daily reach more like a forest than the acre or two of woodland near some suburban farmhouse when therefore the yearning for seclusion becomes a necessity within me i am  drawn to the seashore which extends its line of rude rocks and seldomtrodden sands for leagues around our bay  setting forth at my last ramble on a september  morning i bound myself with a hermits vow to interchange no thoughts with man or woman to share no social pleasure but to derive all that days enjoyment from shore and sea and skyfrom my souls communion with these and from fantasies and recollections or anticipated realities  surely here is enough to feed a human spirit for a single day  farewell then busy world  till your evening lights shall shine along the streettill they gleam upon my seaflushed face as i tread homewardfree me from your ties and let me be a peaceful outlaw  highways and crosspaths are hastily traversed and clambering down a crag i find myself at the extremity of a long beach  how gladly does the spirit leap forth and suddenly enlarge its sense of being to the full extent of the broad blue sunny deep  a greeting and a homage to the sea  i descend over its margin and dip my hand into the wave that meets me and bathe my brow  that farresounding roar is oceans voice of welcome  his salt breath brings a blessing along with it now let us pace togetherthe readers fancy arm in arm with minethis noble beach which extends a mile or more from that craggy promontory to yonder rampart of broken rocks  in front the sea in the rear a precipitous bank the grassy verge of which is breaking away year after year and flings down its tufts of verdure upon the barrenness below  the beach itself is a broad space of sand brown and sparkling with hardly any pebbles intermixed  near the waters edge there is a wet margin which glistens brightly in the sunshine and reflects objects like a mirror and as we tread along the glistening border a dry spot flashes around each footstep but grows moist again as we lift our feet  in some spots the sand receives a complete impression of the sole square toe and all elsewhere it is of such marble firmness that we must stamp heavily to leave a print even of the ironshod heel  along the whole of this extensive beach gambols the surf wave now it makes a feint of dashing onward in a fury yet dies away with a meek murmur and does but kiss the strand now after many such abortive efforts it rears itself up in an unbroken line heightening as it advances without a speck of foam on its green crest  with how fierce a roar it flings itself forward and rushes far up the beach  as i threw my eyes along the edge of the surf i remember that i was startled as robinson crusoe might have been by the sense that human life was within the magic circle of my solitude  afar off in the remote distance of the beach appearing like seanymphs or some airier things such as might tread upon the feathery spray was a group of girls  hardly had i beheld them when they passed into the shadow of the rocks and vanished  to comfort myselffor truly i would fain have gazed a while longeri made acquaintance with a flock of beach birds  these little citizens of the sea and air preceded me by about a stonesthrow along the strand seeking i suppose for food upon its margin  yet with a philosophy which mankind would do well to imitate they drew a continual pleasure from their toil for a subsistence  the sea was each little birds great playmate they chased it downward as it swept back and again ran up swiftly before the impending wave which sometimes overtook them and bore them off their feet  but they floated as lightly as one of their own feathers on the breaking crest  in their airy flutterings they seemed to rest on the evanescent spray  their imageslonglegged little figures with gray backs and snowy bosomswere seen as distinctly as the realities in the mirror of the glistening strand  as i advanced they flew a score or two of yards and again alighting recommenced their dalliance with the surf wave and thus they bore me company along the beach the types of pleasant fantasies till at its extremity they took wing over the ocean and were gone  after forming a friendship with these small surfspirits it is really worth a sigh to find no memorial of them save their multitudinous little tracks in the sand  when we have paced the length of the beach it is pleasant and not unprofitable to retrace our steps and recall the whole mood and occupation of the mind during the former passage  our tracks being all discernible will guide us with an observing consciousness through every unconscious wandering of thought and fancy  here we followed the surf in its reflux to pick up a shell which the sea seemed loath to relinquish  here we found a seaweed with an immense brown leaf and trailed it behind us by its long snakelike stalk  here we seized a live horseshoe by the tail and counted the many claws of the queer monster  here we dug into the sand for pebbles and skipped them upon the surface of the water  here we wet our feet while examining a jellyfish which the waves having just tossed it up now sought to snatch away again  here we trod along the brink of a freshwater brooklet which flows across the beach becoming shallower and more shallow till at last it sinks into the sand and perishes in the effort to bear its little tribute to the main  here some vagary appears to have bewildered us for our tracks go round and round and are confusedly intermingled as if we had found a labyrinth upon the level beach  and here amid our idle pastime we sat down upon almost the only stone that breaks the surface of the sand and were lost in an unlookedfor and overpowering conception of the majesty and awfulness of the great deep  thus by tracking our footprints in the sand we track our own nature in its wayward course and steal a glance upon it when it never dreams of being so observed  such glances always make us wiser  this extensive beach affords room for another pleasant pastime with your staff you may write versesloveverses if they please you bestand consecrate them with a womans name  here too may be inscribed thoughts feelings desires warm outgushings from the hearts secret places which you would not pour upon the sand without the certainty that almost ere the sky has looked upon them the sea will wash them out  stir not hence till the record be effaced  nowfor there is room enough on your canvasdraw huge faceshuge as that of the sphinx on egyptian sandsand fit them with bodies of corresponding immensity and legs which might stride halfway to yonder island childs play becomes magnificent on so grand a scale  but after all the most fascinating employment is simply to write your name in the sand  draw the letters gigantic so that two strides may barely measure them and three for the long strokes  cut deep that the record may be permanent  statesmen and warriors and poets have spent their strength in no better cause than this  is it accomplished  return then in an hour or two and seek for this mighty record of a name  the sea will have swept over it even as time rolls its effacing waves over the names of statesmen and warriors and poets  hark the surf wave laughs at you  passing from the beach i begin to clamber over the crags making my difficult way among the ruins of a rampart shattered and broken by the assaults of a fierce enemy  the rocks rise in every variety of attitude some of them have their feet in the foam and are shagged halfway upward with seaweed some have been hollowed almost into caverns by the unwearied toil of the sea which can afford to spend centuries in wearing away a rock or even polishing a pebble  one huge rock ascends in monumental shape with a face like a giants tombstone on which the veins resemble inscriptions but in an unknown tongue  we will fancy them the forgotten characters of an antediluvian race or else that natures own hand has here recorded a mystery which could i read her language would make mankind the wiser and the happier  how many a thing has troubled me with that same idea pass on and leave it unexplained  here is a narrow avenue which might seem to have been hewn through the very heart of an enormous crag affording passage for the rising sea to thunder back and forth filling it with tumultuous foam and then leaving its floor of black pebbles bare and glistening  in this chasm there was once an intersecting vein of softer stone which the waves have gnawed away piecemeal while the granite walls remain entire on either side  how sharply and with what harsh clamor does the sea rake hack the pebbles as it momentarily withdraws into its own depths  at intervals the floor of the chasm is left nearly dry but anon at the outlet two or three great waves are seen struggling to get in at once two hit the walls athwart while one rushes straight through and all three thunder as if with rage and triumph  they heap the chasm with a snowdrift of foam and spray  while watching this scene i can never rid myself of the idea that a monster endowed with life and fierce energy is striving to burst his way through the narrow pass  and what a contrast to look through the stormy chasm and catch a glimpse of the calm bright sea beyond  many interesting discoveries may be made among these broken cliffs once for example i found a dead seal which a recent tempest had tossed into the nook of the rocks where his shaggy carcass lay rolled in a heap of eelgrass as if the seamonster sought to hide himself from my eye  another time a shark seemed on the point of leaping from the surf to swallow me nor did i wholly without dread approach near enough to ascertain that the maneater had already met his own death from some fisherman in the bay  in the same ramble i encountered a birda large gray birdbut whether a loon or a wild goose or the identical albatross of the ancient mariner was beyond my ornithology to decide  it reposed so naturally on a bed of dry seaweed with its head beside its wing that i almost fancied it alive and trod softly lest it should suddenly spread its wings skyward but the seabird would soar among the clouds no more nor ride upon its native waves so i drew near and pulled out one of its mottled tailfeathers for a remembrance  another day i discovered an immense bone wedged into a chasm of the rocks it was at least ten feet long curved like a cimeter bejewelled with barnacles and small shellfish and partly covered with a growth of seaweed  some leviathan of former ages had used this ponderous mass as a jawbone curiosities of a minuter order may be observed in a deep reservoir which is replenished with water at every tide but becomes a lake among the crags save when the sea is at its height  at the bottom of this rocky basin grow marine plants some of which tower high beneath the water and cast a shadow in the sunshine  small fishes dart to and fro and hide themselves among the seaweed there is also a solitary crab who appears to lead the life of a hermit communing with none of the other denizens of the place and likewise several fivefingersfor i know no other name than that which children give them  if your imagination be at all accustomed to such freaks you may look down into the depths of this pool and fancy it the mysterious depth of ocean  but where are the hulks and scattered timbers of sunken ships where the treasures that old ocean hoardswhere the corroded cannonwhere the corpses and skeletons of seamen who went down in storm and battle  on the day of my last ramble it was a september day yet as warm as summer what should i behold as i approached the abovedescribed basin but three girls sitting on its margin andyes it is veritably solaving their snowy feet in the sunny water  these these are the warm realities of those three visionary shapes that flitted from me on the beach  hark  their merry voices as they toss up the water with their feet  they have not seen me  i must shrink behind this rock and steal away again  in honest truth vowed to solitude as i am there is something in this encounter that makes the heart flutter with a strangely pleasant sensation  i know these girls to be realities of flesh and blood yet glancing at them so briefly they mingle like kindred creatures with the ideal beings of my mind  it is pleasant likewise to gaze down from some high crag and watch a group of children gathering pebbles and pearly shells and playing with the surf as with old oceans hoary beard  nor does it infringe upon my seclusion to see yonder boat at anchor off the shore swinging dreamily to and fro and rising and sinking with the alternate swell while the crewfour gentlemen in roundabout jacketsare busy with their fishinglines but with an inward antipathy and a headlong flight do i eschew the presence of any meditative stroller like myself known by his pilgrim staff his sauntering step his shy demeanor his observant yet abstracted eye  from such a man as if another self had scared me i scramble hastily over the rocks and take refuge in a nook which many a secret hour has given me a right to call my own  i would do battle for it even with the churl that should produce the titledeeds  have not my musings melted into its rocky walls and sandy floor and made them a portion of myself  it is a recess in the line of cliffs walled round by a rough high precipice which almost encircles and shuts in a little space of sand in front the sea appears as between the pillars of a portal  in the rear the precipice is broken and intermixed with earth which gives nourishment not only toclinging and twining shrubs but to trees that gripe the rock with their naked roots and seem to struggle hard for footing and for soil enough to live upon  these are firtrees but oaks hang their heavy branches from above and throw down acorns on the beach and shed their withering foliage upon the waves  at this autumnal season the precipice is decked with variegated splendor trailing wreaths of scarlet flaunt from the summit downward tufts of yellowflowering shrubs and rosebushes with their reddened leaves and glossy seedberries sprout from each crevice at every glance i detect some new light or shade of beauty all contrasting with the stern gray rock  a rill of water trickles down the cliff and fills a little cistern near the base  i drain it at a draught and find it fresh and pure  this recess shall be my dininghall and what the feast  a few biscuits made savory by soaking them in seawater a tuft of samphire gathered from the beach and an apple for the dessert by this time the little rill has filled its reservoir again and as i quaff it i thank god morn heartily than for a civic banquet that he gives me the healthful appetite to make a feast of bread and water  dinner being over i throw myself at length upon the sand and basking in the sunshine let my mind disport itself at will  the walls of this my hermitage have no tongue to tell my follies though i sometimes fancy that they have ears to hear them and a soul to sympathize  there is a magic in this spot  dreams haunt its precincts and flit around me in broad sunlight nor require that sleep shall blindfold me to real objects ere these be visible  here can i frame a story of two lovers and make their shadows live before me and be mirrored in the tranquil water as they tread along the sand leaving no footprints  here should i will it i can summon up a single shade and be myself her lover yes dreamerbut your lonely heart will be the colder for such fancies  sometimes too the past comes back and finds me here and in her train come faces which were gladsome when i knew them yet seem not gladsome now  would that my hidingplace were lonelier so that the past might not find me  get ye all gone old friends and let me listen to the murmur of the seaa melancholy voice but less sad than yours  of what mysteries is it telling  of sunken ships and whereabouts they lie of islands afar and undiscovered whose tawny children are unconscious of other islands and of continents and deem the stars of heaven their nearest neighbors  nothing of all this what then  has it talked for so many ages and meant nothing all the whileno for those ages find utterance in the seas unchanging voice and warn the listener to withdraw his interest from mortal vicissitudes and let the infinite idea of eternity pervade his soul  this is wisdom and therefore will i spend the next halfhour in shaping little boats of driftwood and launching them on voyages across the cove with the feather of a seagull for a sail  if the voice of ages tell me true this is as wise an occupation as to build ships of five hundred tons and launch them forth upon the main bound to far cathay  yet how would the merchant sneer at me  and after all can such philosophy be true  methinks i could find a thousand arguments against it  well then let yonder shaggy rock middeep in the surfsee he is somewhat wrathfulhe rages and roars and foamslet that tall rock be my antagonist and let me exercise my oratory like him of athens who bandied words with an angry sea and got the victory  my maiden speech is a triumphant one for the gentleman in seaweed has nothing to offer in reply save an immitigable roaring  his voice indeed will be heard a long while after mine is hushed once more i shout and the cliffs reverberate the sound  o what joy for a shy man to feel himself so solitary that he may lift his voice to its highest pitch without hazard of a listener but hushbe silent my good friendwhence comes that stifled laughter  it was musicalbut how should there be such music in my solitude  looking upwards i catch a glimpse of three faces peeping from the summit of the cliff like angels between me and their native sky  ah fair girls you may make yourselves merry at my eloquencebut it was my turn to smile when i saw your white feet in the pool  let us keep each others secrets  the sunshine has now passed from my hermitage except a gleam upon the sand just where it meets the sea  a crowd of gloomy fantasies will come and haunt me if i tarry longer here in the darkening twilight of these gray rocks  this is a dismal place in some moods of the mind  climb we therefore the precipice and pause a moment on the brink gazing down into that hollow chamber by the deep where we have been what few can be sufficient to our own pastimeyes say the word outrightselfsufficient to our own happiness  how lonesome looks the recess now and dreary toolike all other spots where happiness has been  there lies my shadow in the departing sunshine with its head upon the sea  i will pelt it with pebbles  a hit a hit i clap my hands in triumph and see  my shadow clapping its unreal hands and claiming the triumph for itself  what a simpleton must i have been all daysince my own shadow makes a mock of my fooleries  homeward homeward  it is time to hasten home  it is time it is time for as the sun sinks over the western wave the sea grows melancholy and the surf has a saddened tone  the distant sails appear astray and not of earth in their remoteness amid the desolate waste  my spirit wanders forth afar but finds no restingplace and comes shivering back  it is time that i were hence  but grudge me not the day that has been spent in seclusion which yet was not solitude since the great sea has been my companion and the little seabirds my friends and the wind has told me his secrets and airy shapes have flitted around me in my hermitage  such companionship works an effect upon a mans character as if he had been admitted to the society of creatures that are not mortal  and when at noontide i tread the crowded streets the influence of this day will still be felt so that i shall walk among men kindly and as a brother with affection and sympathy but yet shall not melt into the indistinguishable mass of humankind  i shall think my own thoughts and feel my own emotions and possess my individuality unviolated  but it is good at the eve of such a day to feel and know that there are men and women in the world  that feeling and that knowledge are mine at this moment for on the shore far below me the fishingparty have landed from their skiff and are cooking their scaly prey by a fire of driftwood kindled in the angle of two rude rocks  the three visionary girls are likewise there  in the deepening twilight while the surf is dashed near their hearth the ruddy gleam of the fire throws a strange air of comfort over the wild cove bestrewn as it is with pebbles and seaweed and exposed to the melancholy main moreover as the smoke climbs up the precipice it brings with it a savory smell from a pan of fried fish and a black kettle of chowder and reminds me that my dinner was nothing but bread and water and a tuft of samphire and an apple  methinks the party night find room for another guest at that flat rock which serves them for a table and if spoons be scarce i could pick up a clamshell on the beach they see me now andthe blessing of a hungry man upon himone of them sends up a hospitable shouthalloo sir solitary come down and sup with us  the ladies wave their handkerchiefs  can i decline no and be it owned after all my solitary joys that this is the sweetest moment of a day by the seashore
