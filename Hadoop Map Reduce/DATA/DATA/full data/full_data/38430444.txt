the brackish waters of the boyne   till your bad master blenched and all was lost   you merchant skipper that leaped overboard   after a ragged hat in biscay bay   you most of all silent and fierce old man   because you were the spectacle that stirred   my fancy and set my boyish lips to say   only the wasteful virtues earn the sun   pardon that for a barren passions sake   although i have come close on fortynine   i have no child i have nothing but a book   nothing but that to prove your blood and mine   january 1914     the grey rock     poets with whom i learned my trade   companions of the cheshire cheese   heres an old story ive remade   imagining twould better please   your ears than stories now in fashion   though you may think i waste my breath   pretending that there can be passion   that has more life in it than death   and though at bottling of your wine   the bowlegged goban had no say   the morals yours because its mine    when cups went round at close of day   is not that how good stories run   somewhere within some hollow hill   if books speak truth in slievenamon   but let that be the gods were still   and sleepy having had their meal   and smoky torches made a glare   on painted pillars on a deal   of fiddles and of flutes hung there   by the ancient holy hands that brought them   from murmuring murias on cups   old goban hammered them and wrought them   and put his pattern round their tops   to hold the wine they buy of him   but from the juice that made them wise   all those had lifted up the dim   imaginations of their eyes   for one that was like woman made   before their sleepy eyelids ran   and trembling with her passion said   come out and dig for a dead man   whos burrowing somewhere in the ground   and mock him to his face and then   hollo him on with horse and hound   for he is the worst of all dead men    we should be dazed and terror struck   if we but saw in dreams that room   those winedrenched eyes and curse our luck   that emptied all our days to come   i knew a woman none could please   because she dreamed when but a child   of men and women made like these   and after when her blood ran wild   had ravelled her own story out   and said in two or in three years   i need must marry some poor lout   and having said it burst in tears   since tavern comrades you have died   maybe your images have stood   mere bone and muscle thrown aside   before that roomful or as good   you had to face your ends when young   twas wine or women or some curse   but never made a poorer song   that you might have a heavier purse   nor gave loud service to a cause   that you might have a troop of friends   you kept the muses sterner laws   and unrepenting faced your ends   and therefore earned the rightand yet   dowson and johnson most i praise   to troop with those the worlds forgot   and copy their proud steady gaze    the danish troop was driven out   between the dawn and dusk she said   although the event was long in doubt   although the king of irelands dead   and half the kings before sundown   all was accomplished                          when this day   murrough the king of irelands son   foot after foot was giving way   he and his best troops back to back   had perished there but the danes ran   stricken with panic from the attack   the shouting of an unseen man   and being thankful murrough found   led by a footsole dipped in blood   that had made prints upon the ground   where by old thorn trees that man stood   and though when he gazed here and there   he had but gazed on thorn trees spoke   who is the friend that seems but air   and yet could give so fine a stroke   thereon a young man met his eye   who said because she held me in   her love and would not have me die   rocknurtured aoife took a pin   and pushing it into my shirt   promised that for a pins sake   no man should see to do me hurt   but there its gone i will not take   the fortune that had been my shame   seeing kings son what wounds you have   twas roundly spoke but when night came   he had betrayed me to his grave   for he and the kings son were dead   id promised him two hundred years   and when for all id done or said   and these immortal eyes shed tears   he claimed his countrys need was most   id save his life yet for the sake   of a new friend he has turned a ghost   what does he care if my heart break   i call for spade and horse and hound   that we may harry him thereon   she cast herself upon the ground   and rent her clothes and made her moan   why are they faithless when their might   is from the holy shades that rove   the grey rock and the windy light   why should the faithfullest heart most love   the bitter sweetness of false faces   why must the lasting love what passes   why are the gods by men betrayed    but thereon every god stood up   with a slow smile and without sound   and stretching forth his arm and cup   to where she moaned upon the ground   suddenly drenched her to the skin   and she with gobans wine adrip   no more remembering what had been   stared at the gods with laughing lip    i have kept my faith though faith was tried   to that rockborn rockwandering foot   and the worlds altered since you died   and i am in no good repute   with the loud host before the sea   that think sword strokes were better meant   than lovers musiclet that be   so that the wandering foots content     the two kings     king eochaid came at sundown to a wood   westward of tara hurrying to his queen   he had outridden his warwasted men   that with empounded cattle trod the mire   and where beech trees had mixed a pale green light   with the groundivys blue he saw a stag   whiter than curds its eyes the tint of the sea   because it stood upon his path and seemed   more hands in height than any stag in the world   he sat with tightened rein and loosened mouth   upon his trembling horse then drove the spur   but the stag stooped and ran at him and passed   rending the horses flank king eochaid reeled   then drew his sword to hold its levelled point   against the stag when horn and steel were met   the horn resounded as though it had been silver   a sweet miraculous terrifying sound   horn locked in sword they tugged and struggled there   as though a stag and unicorn were met   in africa on mountain of the moon   until at last the double horns drawn backward   butted below the single and so pierced   the entrails of the horse dropping his sword   king eochaid seized the horns in his strong hands   and stared into the seagreen eye and so   hither and thither to and fro they trod   till all the place was beaten into mire   the strong thigh and the agile thigh were met   the hands that gathered up the might of the world   and hoof and horn that had sucked in their speed   amid the elaborate wilderness of the air   through bush they plunged and over ivied root   and where the stone struck fire while in the leaves   a squirrel whinnied and a bird screamed out   but when at last he forced those sinewy flanks   against a beech bole he threw down the beast   and knelt above it with drawn knife on the instant   it vanished like a shadow and a cry   so mournful that it seemed the cry of one   who had lost some unimaginable treasure   wandered between the blue and the green leaf   and climbed into the air crumbling away   till all had seemed a shadow or a vision   but for the trodden mire the pool of blood   the disembowelled horse                      king eochaid ran   toward peopled tara nor stood to draw his breath   until he came before the painted wall   the posts of polished yew circled with bronze   of the great door but though the hanging lamps   showed their faint light through the unshuttered windows   nor door nor mouth nor slipper made a noise   nor on the ancient beaten paths that wound   from wellside or from ploughland was there noise   and there had been no sound of living thing   before him or behind but that faroff   on the horizon edge bellowed the herds   knowing that silence brings no good to kings   and mocks returning victory he passed   between the pillars with a beating heart   and saw where in the midst of the great hall   palefaced alone upon a bench edain   sat upright with a sword before her feet   her hands on either side had gripped the bench   her eyes were cold and steady her lips tight   some passion had made her stone hearing a foot   she started and then knew whose foot it was   but when he thought to take her in his arms   she motioned him afar and rose and spoke   i have sent among the fields or to the woods   the fighting men and servants of this house   for i would have your judgment upon one   who is selfaccused if she be innocent   she would not look in any known mans face   till judgment has been given and if guilty   will never look again on known mans face   and at these words he paled as she had paled   knowing that he should find upon her lips   the meaning of that monstrous day                                       then she   you brought me where your brother ardan sat   always in his one seat and bid me care him   through that strange illness that had fixed him there   and should he die to heap his burial mound   and carve his name in ogham eochaid said   he lives he lives and is a healthy man   while i have him and you it matters little   what man you have lost what evil you have found   i bid them make his bed under this roof   and carried him his food with my own hands   and so the weeks passed by but when i said   what is this trouble he would answer nothing   though always at my words his trouble grew   and i but asked the more till he cried out   weary of many questions there are things   that make the heart akin to the dumb stone   then i replied although you hide a secret   hopeless and dear or terrible to think on   speak it that i may send through the wide world   for medicine thereon he cried aloud   day after day you question me and i   because there is such a storm amid my thoughts   i shall be carried in the gust command   forbid beseech and waste my breath then i   although the thing that you have hid were evil   the speaking of it could be no great wrong   and evil must it be if done twere worse   than mound and stone that keep all virtue in   and loosen on us dreams that waste our life   shadows and shows that can but turn the brain   but finding him still silent i stooped down   and whispering that none but he should hear   said if a woman has put this on you   my men whether it please her or displease   and though they have to cross the loughlan waters   and take her in the middle of armed men   shall make her look upon her handiwork   that she may quench the rick she has fired and though   she may have worn silk clothes or worn a crown   shell not be proud knowing within her heart   that our sufficient portion of the world   is that we give although it be brief giving   happiness to children and to men   then he driven by his thought beyond his thought   and speaking what he would not though he would   sighed you even you yourself could work the cure   and at those words i rose and i went out   and for nine days he had food from other hands   and for nine days my mind went whirling round   the one disastrous zodiac muttering   that the immedicable mounds beyond   our questioning beyond our pity even   but when nine days had gone i stood again   before his chair and bending down my head   told him that when orion rose and all   the women of his household were asleep   to gofor hope would give his limbs the power   to an old empty woodmans house thats hidden   close to a clump of beech trees in the wood   westward of tara there to await a friend   that could as he had told her work his cure   and would be no harsh friend                           when night had deepened   i groped my way through boughs and over roots   till oak and hazel ceased and beech began   and found the house a sputtering torch within   and stretched out sleeping on a pile of skins   ardan and though i called to him and tried   to shake him out of sleep i could not rouse him   i waited till the night was on the turn   then fearing that some labourer on his way   to plough or pastureland might see me there   went out              among the ivycovered rocks   as on the blue light of a sword a man   who had unnatural majesty and eyes   like the eyes of some great kite scouring the woods   stood on my path trembling from head to foot   i gazed at him like grouse upon a kite   but with a voice that had unnatural music   a weary wooing and a long he said   speaking of love through other lips and looking   under the eyelids of another for it was my craft   that put a passion in the sleeper there   and when i had got my will and drawn you here   where i may speak to you alone my craft   sucked up the passion out of him again   and left mere sleep hell wake when the sun wakes   push out his vigorous limbs and rub his eyes   and wonder what has ailed him these twelve months   i cowered back upon the wall in terror   but that sweetsounding voice ran on woman   i was your husband when you rode the air   danced in the whirling foam and in the dust   in days you have not kept in memory   being betrayed into a cradle and i come   that i may claim you as my wife again   i was no longer terrified his voice   had half awakened some old memory   yet answered him i am king eochaids wife   and with him have found every happiness   women can find with a most masterful voice   that made the body seem as it were a string   under a bow he cried what happiness   can lovers have that know their happiness   must end at the dumb stone but where we build   our sudden palaces in the still air   pleasure itself can bring no weariness   nor can time waste the cheek nor is there foot   that has grown weary of the whirling dance   nor an unlaughing mouth but mine that mourns   among those mouths that sing their sweethearts praise   your empty bed how should i love i answered   were it not that when the dawn has lit my bed   and shown my husband sleeping there i have sighed   your strength and nobleness will pass away   or how should love be worth its pains were it not   that when he has fallen asleep within my arms   being wearied out i love in man the child   what can they know of love that do not know   she builds her nest upon a narrow ledge   above a windy precipice then he   seeing that when you come to the deathbed   you must return whether you would or no   this human life blotted from memory   why must i live some thirty forty years   alone with all this useless happiness   thereon he seized me in his arms but i   thrust him away with both my hands and cried   never will i believe there is any change   can blot out of my memory this life   sweetened by death but if i could believe   that were a double hunger in my lips   for what is doubly brief                              and now the shape   my hands were pressed to vanished suddenly   i staggered but a beech tree stayed my fall   and clinging to it i could hear the cocks   crow upon tara                     king eochaid bowed his head   and thanked her for her kindness to his brother   for that she promised and for that refused    thereon the bellowing of the empounded herds   rose round the walls and through the bronzeringed door   jostled and shouted those warwasted men   and in the midst king eochaids brother stood   hed heard that din on the horizons edge   and ridden towards it being ignorant     to a wealthy man who promised a second subscription to the dublin municipal gallery if it were proved the

lightly what they gave   but let them be theyre dead and gone   theyre with oleary in the grave     to a friend whose work has come to nothing     now all the truth is out   be secret and take defeat

wind   a curlew answered and suddenly thereupon i thought   that on the lonely height where all are in gods eye   there cannot be confusion of our sound forgot   a single soul that lacks a sweet crystaline cry     to a shade     if you have revisited the town thin shade   whether to look upon your monument   i wonder if the builder has been paid   or happier thoughted when the day is spent   to drink of that salt breath out of the sea   when grey gulls flit about instead of men   and the gaunt houses put on majesty   let these content you and be gone again   for they are at their old tricks yet                                          a man   of your own passionate serving kind who had brought   in his full hands what had they only known   had given their childrens children loftier thought   sweeter emotion working in their veins   like gentle blood has been driven from the place   and insult heaped upon him for his pains   and for his openhandedness disgrace   an old foul mouth that slandered you had set   the pack upon him                       go unquiet wanderer   and gather the glasnevin coverlet   about your head till the dust stops your ear   the time for you to taste of that salt breath   and listen at the corners has not come   you had enough of sorrow before death   away away you are safer in the tomb   september 29th 1914     when helen lived     we have cried in our despair   that men desert   for some trivial affair   or noisy insolent sport   beauty that we have won   from bitterest hours   yet we had we walked within   those topless towers   where helen walked with her boy   had given but as the rest   of the men and women of troy   a word and a jest     the attack on the playboy of the western world 1907     once when midnight smote the air   eunuchs ran through hell and met   from thoroughfare to thoroughfare   while that great juan galloped by   and like these to rail and sweat   staring upon his sinewy thigh     the three beggars     though to my feathers in the wet   i have stood here from break of day   i have not found a thing to eat   for only rubbish comes my way   am i to live on lebeenlone   muttered the old crane of gort   for all my pains on lebeenlone    king guari walked amid his court   the palaceyard and riverside   and there to three old beggars said   you that have wandered far and wide   can ravel out whats in my head   do men who least desire get most   or get the most who most desire   a beggar said they get the most   whom man or devil cannot tire   and what could make their muscles taut   unless desire had made them so   but guari laughed with secret thought   if that be true as it seems true   one of you three is a rich man   for he shall have a thousand pounds   who is first asleep if but he can   sleep before the third noon sounds   and thereon merry as a bird   with his old thoughts king guari went   from riverside and palaceyard   and left them to their argument   and if i win one beggar said   though i am old i shall persuade   a pretty girl to share my bed   the second i shall learn a trade   the third ill hurry to the course   among the other gentlemen   and lay it all upon a horse   the second i have thought again   a farmer has more dignity   one to another sighed and cried   the exorbitant dreams of beggary   that idleness had borne to pride   sang through their teeth from noon to noon   and when the second twilight brought   the frenzy of the beggars moon   they closed their bloodshot eyes for naught   one beggar cried youre shamming sleep   and thereupon their anger grew   till they were whirling in a heap    theyd mauled and bitten the night through   or sat upon their heels to rail   and when old guari came and stood   before the three to end this tale   they were commingling lice and blood   times up he cried and all the three   with bloodshot eyes upon him stared   times up he cried and all the three   fell down upon the dust and snored    maybe i shall be lucky yet   now they are silent said the crane   though to my feathers in the wet   ive stood as i were made of stone   and seen the rubbish run about   its certain there are trout somewhere   and maybe i shall take a trout   if but i do not seem to care     the three hermits     three old hermits took the air   by a cold and desolate sea   first was muttering a prayer   second rummaged for a flea   on a windy stone the third   giddy with his hundredth year   sang unnoticed like a bird   though the door of death is near   and what waits behind the door   three times in a single day   i though upright on the shore   fall asleep when i should pray   so the first but now the second   were but given what we have earned   when all thoughts and deeds are reckoned   so its plain to be discerned   that the shades of holy men   who have failed being weak of will   pass the door of birth again   and are plagued by crowds until   theyve the passion to escape   moaned the other they are thrown   into some most fearful shape   but the second mocked his moan   they are not changed to anything   having loved god once but maybe   to a poet or a king   or a witty lovely lady   while hed rummaged rags and hair   caught and cracked his flea the third   giddy with his hundredth year   sang unnoticed like a bird     beggar to beggar cried     time to put off the world and go somewhere   and find my health again in the sea air   beggar to beggar cried being frenzystruck   and make my soul before my pate is bare    and get a comfortable wife and house   to rid me of the devil in my shoes   beggar to beggar cried being frenzystruck   and the worse devil that is between my thighs    and though id marry with a comely lass   she need not be too comelylet it pass   beggar to beggar cried being frenzystruck   but theres a devil in a lookingglass    nor should she be too rich because the rich   are driven by wealth as beggars by the itch   beggar to beggar cried being frenzystruck   and cannot have a humorous happy speech    and there ill grow respected at my ease   and hear amid the gardens nightly peace   beggar to beggar cried being frenzystruck   the windblown clamor of the barnaclegeese     the well and the tree     the man that i praise   cries out the empty well   lives all his days   where a hand on the bell   can call the milchcows   to the comfortable door of his house   who but an idiot would praise   dry stones in a well    the man that i praise   cries out the leafless tree   has married and stays   by an old hearth and he   on naught has set store   but children and dogs on the floor   who but an idiot would praise   a withered tree     running to paradise     as i came over windy gap   they threw a halfpenny into my cap   for i am running to paradise   and all that i need do is to wish   and somebody puts his hand in the dish   to throw me a bit of salted fish   and there the king is but as the beggar    my brother mourteen is worn out   with skelping his big brawling lout   and i am running to paradise   a poor life do what he can   and though he keep a dog and a gun   a serving maid and a serving man   and there the king is but as the beggar    poor men have grown to be rich men   and rich men grown to be poor again   and i am running to paradise   and many a darling wits grown dull   that tossed a bare heel when at school   now it has filled an old sock full   and there the king is but as the beggar    the wind is old and still at play   while i must hurry upon my way   for i am running to paradise   yet never have i lit on a friend   to take my fancy like the wind   that nobody can buy or bind   and there the king is but as the beggar     the hour before dawn     a onelegged onearmed oneeyed man   a bundle of rags upon a crutch   stumbled on windy cruachan   cursing the wind it was as much   as the one sturdy leg could do   to keep him upright while he cursed   he had counted where long years ago   queen maeves nine maines had been nursed   a pair of lapwings one old sheep   and not a house to the plains edge   when close to his right hand a heap   of grey stones and a rocky ledge   reminded him that he could make   if he but shifted a few stones   a shelter till the daylight broke   but while he fumbled with the stones   they toppled over were it not   i have a lucky wooden shin   i had been hurt and toppling brought   before his eyes where stones had been   a dark deep hole in the rocks face   he gave a gasp and thought to run   being certain it was no right place   but the hell mouth at cruachan   thats stuffed with all thats old and bad   and yet stood still because inside   he had seen a redhaired jolly lad   in some outlandish coat beside   a ladle and a tub of beer   plainly no phantom by his look   so with a laugh at his own fear   he crawled into that pleasant nook   young redhead stretched himself to yawn   and murmured may god curse the night   thats grown uneasy near the dawn   so that it seems even i sleep light   and who are you that wakens me   has one of maeves nine brawling sons   grown tired of his own company   but let him keep his grave for once   i have to find the sleep i have lost   and then at last being wide awake   i took you for a brawling ghost   say what you please but from daybreak   ill sleep another century   the beggar deaf to all but hope   went down upon a hand and knee   and took the wooden ladle up   and would have dipped it in the beer   but the other pushed his hand aside   before you have dipped it in the beer   that sacred goban brewed he cried   id have assurance that you are able   to value beeri will have no fool   dipping his nose into my ladle   because he has stumbled on this hole   in the bad hour before the dawn   if you but drink that beer and say   i will sleep until the winters gone   or maybe to midsummer day   you will sleep that length and at the first   i waited so for that or this   because the weather was acursed   or i had no woman there to kiss   and slept for half a year or so   but year by year i found that less   gave me such pleasure id forgo   even a half hours nothingness   and when at one years end i found   i had not waked a single minute   i chose this burrow under ground   i will sleep away all time within it   my sleep were now nine centuries   but for those mornings when i find   the lapwing at their foolish cries   and the sheep bleating at the wind   as when i also played the fool   the beggar in a rage began   upon his hunkers in the hole   its plain that you are no right man   to mock at everything i love   as if it were not worth the doing   id have a merry life enough   if a good easter wind were blowing   and though the winter wind is bad   i should not be too down in the mouth   for anything you did or said   if but this wind were in the south   but the other cried you long for spring   or that the wind would shift a point   and do not know that you would bring   if time were suppler in the joint   neither the spring nor the south wind   but the hour when you shall pass away   and leave no smoking wick behind   for all life longs for the last day   and theres no man but cocks his ear   to know when michaels trumpet cries   that flesh and bone may disappear   and souls as if they were but sighs   and there be nothing but god left   but i alone being blessed keep   like some old rabbit to my cleft   and wait him in a drunken sleep    he dipped his ladle in the tub   and drank and yawned and stretched him out   the other shouted you would rob   my life of every pleasant thought   and every comfortable thing   and so take that and that thereon   he gave him a great pummelling   but might have pummelled at a stone   for all the sleeper knew or cared   and after heaped the stones again   and cursed and prayed and prayed and cursed   oh god if he got loose and then   in fury and in panic fled   from the hell mouth at cruachan   and gave god thanks that overhead   the clouds were brightening with the dawn     the player queen  song from an unfinished play     my mother dandled me and sang   how young it is how young   and made a golden cradle   that on a willow swung    he went away my mother sang   when i was brought to bed   and all the while her needle pulled   the gold and silver thread    she pulled the thread and bit the thread   and made a golden gown   and wept because she had dreamt that i   was born to wear a crown    when she was got my mother sang   i heard a seamew cry   and saw a flake of the yellow foam   that dropped upon my thigh    how therefore could she help but braid   the gold into my hair   and dream that i should carry   the golden top of care     the realists     hope that you may understand   what can books of men that wive   in a dragonguarded land   paintings of the dolphindrawn   seanymphs in their pearly waggons   do but awake a hope to live   that had gone   with the dragons     i  the witch     toil and grow rich   whats that but to lie   with a foul witch   and after drained dry   to be brought   to the chamber where   lies one long sought   with despair     ii  the peacock     whats riches to him   that has made a great peacock   with the pride of his eye   the windbeaten stonegrey   and desolate threerock   would nourish his whim   live he or die   amid wet rocks and heather   his ghost will be gay   adding feather to feather   for the pride of his eye     the mountain tomb     pour wine and dance if manhood still have pride   bring roses if the rose be yet in bloom   the cataract smokes upon the mountain side   our father rosicross is in his tomb    pull down the blinds bring fiddle and clarionet   that there be no foot silent in the room   nor mouth from kissing nor from wine unwet   our father rosicross is in his tomb    in vain in vain the cataract still cries   the everlasting taper lights the gloom   all wisdom shut into his onyx eyes   our father rosicross sleeps in his tomb     to a child dancing in the wind   i     dance there upon the shore   what need have you to care   for wind or waters roar   and tumble out your hair   that the salt drops have wet   being young you have not known   the fools triumph nor yet   love lost as soon as won   nor the best labourer dead   and all the sheaves to bind   what need have you to dread   the monstrous crying of wind   ii     has no one said those daring   kind eyes should be more learnd   or warned you how despairing   the moths are when they are burned   i could have warned you but you are young   so we speak a different tongue    o you will take whatevers offered   and dream that all the worlds a friend   suffer as your mother suffered   be as broken in the end   but i am old and you are young   and i speak a barbarous tongue     a memory of youth     the moments passed as at a play   i had the wisdom love brings forth   i had my share of mother wit   and yet for all that i could say   and though i had her praise for it   a cloud blown from the cutthroat north   suddenly hid loves moon away    believing every word i said   i praised her body and her mind   till pride had made her eyes grow bright   and pleasure made her cheeks grow red   and vanity her footfall light   yet we for all that praise could find   nothing but darkness overhead    we sat as silent as a stone   we knew though shed not said a word   that even the best of love must die   and had been savagely undone   were it not that love upon the cry   of a most ridiculous little bird   tore from the clouds his marvellous moon     fallen majesty     although crowds gathered once if she but showed her face   and even old mens eyes grew dim this hand alone   like some last courtier at a gypsy camping place   babbling of fallen majesty records whats gone    the lineaments a heart that laughter has made sweet   these these remain but i record whats gone a crowd   will gather and not know it walks the very street   whereon a thing once walked that seemed a burning cloud     friends     now must i these three praise   three women that have wrought   what joy is in my days   one that no passing thought   nor those unpassing cares   no not in these fifteen   many times troubled years   could ever come between   heart and delighted heart   and one because her hand   had strength that could unbind   what none can understand   what none can have and thrive   youths dreamy load till she   so changed me that i live   labouring in ecstasy   and what of her that took   all till my youth was gone   with scarce a pitying look   how should i praise that one   when day begins to break   i count my good and bad   being wakeful for her sake   remembering what she had   what eagle look still shows   while up from my hearts root   so great a sweetness flows   i shake from head to foot     the cold heaven     suddenly i saw the cold and rookdelighting heaven   that seemed as though ice burned and was but the more ice   and thereupon imagination and heart were driven   so wild that every casual thought of that and this   vanished and left but memories that should be out of season   with the hot blood of youth of love crossed long ago   and i took all the blame out of all sense and reason   until i cried and trembled and rocked to and fro   riddled with light ah when the ghost begins to quicken   confusion of the deathbed over is it sent   out naked on the roads as the books say and stricken   by the injustice of the skies for punishment     that the night come     she lived in storm and strife   her soul had such desire   for what proud death may bring   that it could not endure   the common good of life   but lived as twere a king   that packed his marriage day   with banneret and pennon   trumpet and kettledrum   and the outrageous cannon   to bundle time away   that the night come     an appointment     being out of heart with government   i took a broken root to fling   where the proud wayward squirrel went   taking delight that he could spring   and he with that low whinnying sound   that is like laughter sprang again   and so to the other tree at a bound   nor the tame will nor timid brain   bred that fierce tooth and cleanly limb   and threw him up to laugh on the bough   no government appointed him     i  the magi     now as at all times i can see in the minds eye   in their stiff painted clothes the pale unsatisfied ones   appear and disappear in the blue depth of the sky   with all their ancient faces like rainbeaten stones   and all their helms of silver hovering side by side   and all their eyes still fixed hoping to find once more   being by calvarys turbulence unsatisfied   the uncontrollable mystery on the bestial floor     ii  the dolls     a doll in the dollmakers house   looks at the cradle and balls   that is an insult to us   but the oldest of all the dolls   who had seen being kept for show   generations of his sort   outscreams the whole shelf although   theres not a man can report   evil of this place   the man and the woman bring   hither to our disgrace   a noisy and filthy thing   hearing him groan and stretch   the dollmakers wife is aware   her husband has heard the wretch   and crouched by the arm of his chair   she murmurs into his ear   head upon shoulder leant   my dear my dear oh dear   it was an accident     a coat     i made my song a coat   covered with embroideries   out of old mythologies   from heel to throat   but the fools caught it   wore it in the worlds eye   as though theyd wrought it   song let them take it   for theres more enterprise   in walking naked                                             while i from that reedthroated whisperer   who comes at need although not now as once   a clear articulation in the air   but inwardly surmise companions   beyond the fling of the dull asss hoof   ben jonsons phraseand find when june is come   at kylenano under that ancient roof   a sterner conscience and a friendlier home   i can forgive even that wrong of wrongs   those undreamt accidents that have made me   seeing that fame has perished this long while   being but a part of ancient ceremony   notorious till all my priceless things   are but a post the passing dogs defile     from the green helmet and other poems     his dream     i swayed upon the gaudy stern   the butt end of a steering oar   and everywhere that i could turn   men ran upon the shore    and though i would have hushed the crowd   there was no mothers son but said   what is the figure in a shroud   upon a gaudy bed    and fishes bubbling to the brim   cried out upon that thing beneath   it had such dignity of limb   by the sweet name of death    though id my finger on my lip   what could i but take up the song   and fish and crowd and gaudy ship   cried out the whole night long    crying amid the glittering sea   naming it with ecstatic breath   because it had such dignity   by the sweet name of death     a woman homer sung     if any man drew near   when i was young   i thought he holds her dear   and shook with hate and fear   but oh twas bitter wrong   if he could pass her by   with an indifferent eye    whereon i wrote and wrought   and now being grey   i dream that i have brought   to such a pitch my thought   that coming time can say   he shadowed in a glass   what thing her body was    for she had fiery blood   when i was young   and trod so sweetly proud   as twere upon a cloud   a woman homer sung   that life and letters seem   but an heroic dream     the consolation     i had this thought awhile ago   my darling cannot understand   what i have done or what would do   in this blind bitter land    and i grew weary of the sun   until my thoughts cleared up again   remembering that the best i have done   was done to make it plain    that every year i have cried at length   my darling understands it all   because i have come into my strength   and words obey my call    that had she done so who can say   what would have shaken from the sieve   i might have thrown poor words away   and been content to live     no second troy     why should i blame her that she filled my days   with misery or that she would of late   have taught to ignorant men most violent ways   or hurled the little streets upon the great   had they but courage equal to desire   what could have made her peaceful with a mind   that nobleness made simple as a fire   with beauty like a tightened bow a kind   that is not natural in an age like this   being high and solitary and most stern   why what could she have done being what she is   was there another troy for her to burn     reconciliation     some may have blamed you that you took away   the verses that could move them on the day   when the ears being deafened the sight of the eyes blind   with lightning you went from me and i could find   nothing to make a song about but kings   helmets and swords and halfforgotten things   that were like memories of youbut now   well out for the world lives as long ago   and while were in our laughing weeping fit   hurl helmets crowns and swords into the pit   but dear cling close to me since you were gone   my barren thoughts have chilled me to the bone     king and no king     would it were anything but merely voice   the no king cried who after that was king   because he had not heard of anything   that balanced with a word is more than noise   yet old romance being kind let him prevail   somewhere or somehow that i have forgot   though hed but cannonwhereas we that had thought   to have lit upon as clean and sweet a tale   have been defeated by that pledge you gave   in momentary anger long ago   and i that have not your faith how shall i know   that in the blinding light beyond the grave   well find so good a thing as that we have lost   the hourly kindness the days common speech   the habitual content of each with each   when neither soul nor body has been crossed     peace     ah that time could touch a form   that could show what homers age   bred to be a heros wage   were not all her life but storm   would not painters paint a form   of such noble lines i said   such a delicate high head   all that sternness amid charm   all that sweetness amid strength   ah but peace that comes at length   came when time had touched her form     against unworthy praise     o heart be at peace because   nor knave nor dolt can break   whats not for their applause   being for a womans sake   enough if the work has seemed   so did she your strength renew   a dream that a lion had dreamed   till the wilderness cried aloud   a secret between you two   between the proud and the proud    what still you would have their praise   but heres a haughtier text   the labyrinth of her days   that her own strangeness perplexed   and how what her dreaming gave   earned slander ingratitude   from selfsame dolt and knave   aye and worse wrong than these   yet she singing upon her road   half lion half child is at peace     the fascination of whats difficult     the fascination of whats difficult   has dried the sap out of my veins and rent   spontaneous joy and natural content   out of my heart theres something ails our colt   that must as if it had not holy blood   nor on an olympus leaped from cloud to

business management of men   i swear before the dawn comes round again   ill find the stable and pull out the bolt     a drinking song     wine comes in at the mouth   and love comes in at the eye   thats all we shall know for truth   before we grow old and die   i lift the glass to my mouth   i look at you and i sigh     the coming of wisdom with time     though leaves are many the root is one   through all the lying days of my youth   i swayed my leaves and flowers in the sun   now i may wither into the truth     on hearing that the students of our new university have joined the ancient order of hibernians and the agitation against immoral literature     where where but here have pride and truth   that long to give themselves for wage   to shake their wicked sides at youth   restraining reckless middleage     to a poet who would have me praise certain bad poets imitators of his and mine     you say as i have often given tongue   in praise of what anothers said or sung   twere politic to do the like by these   but have you known a dog to praise his fleas     the mask     put off that mask of burning gold   with emerald eyes   o no my dear you make so bold   to find if hearts be wild and wise   and yet not cold    i would but find whats there to find   love or deceit   it was the mask engaged your mind   and after set your heart to beat   not whats behind    but lest you are my enemy   i must enquire   o no my dear let all that be   what matter so there is but fire   in you in me     upon a house shaken by the land agitation     how should the world be luckier if this house   where passion and precision have been one   time out of mind became too ruinous   to breed the lidless eye that loves the sun   and the sweet laughing eagle thoughts that grow   where wings have memory of wings and all   that comes of the best knit to the best although   mean rooftrees were the sturdier for its fall   how should their luck run high enough to reach   the gifts that govern men and after these   to gradual times last gift a written speech   wrought of high laughter loveliness and ease     at the abbey theatre  imitated from ronsard     dear craoibhin aoibhin look into our case   when we are high and airy hundreds say   that if we hold that flight theyll leave the place   while those same hundreds mock another day   because we have made our art of common things   so bitterly youd dream they longed to look   all their lives through into some drift of wings   youve dandled them and fed them from the book   and know them to the bone impart to us   well keep the secreta new trick to please   is there a bridle for this proteus   that turns and changes like his draughty seas   or is there none most popular of men   but when they mock us that we mock again     these are the clouds     these are the clouds about the fallen sun   the majesty that shuts his burning eye   the weak lay hand on what the strong has done   till that be tumbled that was lifted high   and discord follow upon unison   and all things at one common level lie   and therefore friend if your great race were run   and these things came so much the more thereby   have you made greatness your companion   although it be for children that you sigh   these are the clouds about the fallen sun   the majesty that shuts his burning eye     at galway races     there where the

brought me this   thought in that scale of his   why should i be dismayed   though flame had burned the whole   world as it were a coal   now i have seen it weighed   against a soul     all things can

november dayto be sure does not everybody with an intellect know that and maybe when its night with us it is day with them for many a time i have seen the roads lighted before me  wise man  the beggar who wrote that on babylon wall meant that there is a spiritual kingdom that cannot be seen or known till the faculties whereby we master the kingdom of this world wither away like green things in winter a monkish thought the most mischievous thought that ever passed out of a mans mouth  first pupil  if he meant all that i will take an oath that he was spindleshanked and crosseyed and had a lousy itching shoulder and that his heart was crosser than his eyes and that he wrote it out of malice  second pupil  lets come away and find a better subject  fourth pupil  and maybe now youll let me choose  first pupil  come  wise man    were it but true twould alter everything   until the stream of the world had changed its course   and that and all our thoughts had run   into some cloudy thunderous spring   they dream to be its source   aye to some frenzy of the mind   and all that we have done would be undone   our speculation but as the wind                                                              a pause    i have dreamed it twice  first pupil        something has troubled him                                                        pupils go out  wise man    twice have i dreamed it in a morning dream   now nothing serves my pupils but to come   with a like thought reason is growing dim   a moment more and frenzy will beat his drum   and laugh aloud and scream   and i must dance in the dream   no no but it is like a hawk a hawk of the air   it has swooped downand this swoop makes the third   and what can i but tremble like a bird  fool  give me a penny  wise man  that i should dream it twice and after that that they should pick it out  fool  wont you give me a penny  wise man  what do you want what can it matter to you whether the words i am reading are wisdom or sheer folly  fool  such a great wise teacher will not refuse a penny to a fool  wise man  seeing that everybody is a fool when he is asleep and dreaming why do you call me wise  fool  o i knowi know i know what i have seen  wise man  well to see rightly is the whole of wisdom whatever dream be with us  fool  when i went by kilcluan where the bells used to be ringing at the break of every day i could hear nothing but the people snoring in their houses when i went by tubbervanach where the young men used to be climbing the hill to the blessed well they were sitting at the crossroads playing cards when i went by carrigoras where the friars used to be fasting and serving the poor i saw them drinking wine and obeying their wives and when i asked what misfortune had brought all these changes they said it was no misfortune but that it was the wisdom they had learned from your teaching  wise man  and you too have called me wiseyou would be paid for that good opinion doubtlessrun to the kitchen my wife will give you food and drink  fool  thats foolish advice for a wise man to give  wise man  why fool  fool  what is eaten is gonei want pennies for my bag i must buy bacon in the shops and nuts in the market and strong drink for the time the sun is weak and snares to catch the rabbits and the hares and a big pot to cook them in  wise man  i have more to think about than giving pennies to your like so run away  fool  give me a penny and i will bring you luck the fishermen let me sleep among their nets in the loft because i bring them luck and in the summer time the wild creatures let me sleep near their nests and their holes it is lucky even to look at me but it is much more lucky to give me a penny if i was not lucky i would starve  wise man  what are the shears for  fool  i wont tell you if i told you you would drive them away  wise man  drive them away who would i drive away  fool  i wont tell you  wise man  not if i give you a penny  fool  no  wise man  not if i give you two pennies  fool  you will be very lucky if you give me two pennies but i wont tell you  wise man  three pennies  fool  four and i will tell you  wise man  very wellfour but from this out i will not call you teigue the fool  fool  let me come close to you where nobody will hear me but first you must promise not to drive them away wise man nods every day men go out dressed in black and spread great black nets over the hills great black nets  wise man  a strange place that to fish in  fool  they spread them out on the hills that they may catch the feet of the angels but every morning just before the dawn i go out and cut the nets with the shears and the angels fly away  wise man  speaking with excitement ah now i know that you are teigue the fool you say that i am wise and yet i say there are no angels  fool  i have seen plenty of angels  wise man  no no you have not  fool  they are plenty if you but look about you they are like the blades of grass  wise man  they are plenty as the blades of grassi heard that phrase when i was but a child and was told folly  fool  when one gets quiet when one is so quiet that there is not a thought in ones head maybe there is something that wakes up inside one something happy and quiet and then all in a minute one can smell summer flowers and tall people go by happy and laughing but they will not let us look at their faces oh no it is not right that we should look at their faces  wise man  you have fallen asleep upon a hill yet even those that used to dream of angels dream now of other things  fool  i saw one but a moment agothat is because i am lucky it was coming behind me but it was not laughing  wise man  theres nothing but what men can see when they are awake nothing nothing  fool  i knew you would drive them away  wise man    pardon me fool   i had forgotten who i spoke to   well there are your four penniesfool you are called   and all day long they cry come hither fool                                           the fool goes close to him    or else its fool be gone                                            the fool goes further off    or fool stand there                                      the fool straightens himself up    or fool go sit in the corner                                          the fool sits in the corner                              and all the while   what were they all but fools before i came   what are they now but mirrors that seem men   because of my image fool hold up your head                                                         fool does so    what foolish stories they have told of the ghosts   that fumbled with the clothes upon the bed   or creaked and shuffled in the corridor   or else if they were pious bred   of angels from the skies   that coming through the door   or it may be standing there   would solidly out stare   the steadiest eyes with their unnatural eyes   aye on a mans own floor                an angel has come in it should be played by a man if a                   man can be found with the right voice and may wear a                   little golden domino and a halo made of metal or the                   whole face may be a beautiful mask in which case the                        last sentence on page 136 should not be spoken    yet it is strange the strangest thing i have known   that i should still be haunted by the notion   that theres a crisis of the spirit wherein   we get new sight and that they know some trick   to turn our thoughts for their own ends to frenzy   why do you put your finger to your lip   and creep away                                                        fool goes out    wise man sees angel what are you who are you   i think i saw some like you in my dreams   when but a child that thing about your head   that brightness in your hairthat flowery branch   but i have done with dreams i have done with dreams  angel    i am the crafty one that you have called  wise man    how that i called  angel                       i am the messenger  wise man    what message could you bring to one like me  angel turning the hourglass    that you will die when the last grain of sand   has fallen through this glass  wise man                                   i have a wife   children and pupils that i cannot leave   why must i die my time is far away  angel    you have to die because no soul has passed   the heavenly threshold since you have opened school   but grass grows there and rust upon the hinge   and they are lonely that must keep the watch  wise man    and whither shall i go when i am dead  angel    you have denied there is a purgatory   therefore that gate is closed you have denied   there is a heaven and so that gate is closed  wise man    where then for i have said there is no hell  angel    hell is the place of those who have denied   they find there what they planted and what dug   a lake of spaces and a wood of nothing   and wander there and drift and never cease   wailing for substance  wise man                           pardon me blessed angel   i have denied and taught the like to others   but how could i believe before my sight   had come to me  angel                     it is too late for pardon  wise man    had i but met your gaze as now i met it   but how can you that live but where we go   in the uncertainty of dizzy dreams   know why we doubt parting sickness and death   the rotting of the grass tempest and drouth   these are the messengers that came to me   why are you silent you carry in your hands   gods pardon and you will not give it me   why are you silent were i not afraid   id kiss your handsno no the hem of your dress  angel    only when all the world has testified   may soul confound it crying out in joy   and laughing on its lonely precipice   whats dearth and death and sickness to the soul   that knows no virtue but itself nor could it   so trembling with delight and mothernaked   live unabashed if the arguing world stood by  wise man    it is as hard for you to understand   why we have doubted as it is for us   to banish doubtwhat folly have i said   there can be nothing that you do not know   give me a yeara montha weeka day   i would undo what i have donean hour   give me until the sand has run in the glass  angel    though you may not undo what you have done   i have this powerif you but find one soul   before the sands have fallen that still believes   one fish to lie and spawn among the stones   till the great fishers net is full again   you may the purgatorial fire being passed   spring to your peace                                          pupils sing in the distance    who stole your wits away   and where are they gone  wise man                          my pupils come   before you have begun to climb the sky   i shall have found that soul they say they doubt   but what their mothers dinned into their ears   cannot have been so lightly rooted up   besides i can disprove what i once proved   and yet give me some thought some argument   more mighty than my own  angel                            farewellfarewell   for i am weary of the weight of time            angel goes out wise man makes a step to follow and pauses             some of his pupils come in at the other side of the stage  first pupil    master master you must choose the subject               enter other pupils with fool about whom they dance all                  the pupils may have little cushions on which presently                                                  they seat themselves  second pupil    here is a subjectwhere have the fools wits gone singing   who dragged your wits away   where no one knows   or have they run off   on their own pair of shoes  fool  give me a penny  first pupil

old candle end   if you would find them  fourth pupil                            they are up above the clouds  fool  give me a penny give me a penny  first pupil singing    ill find your wits again   come for i saw them roll   to where old badger mumbles   in the black hole  second pupil singing    no but an angel stole them   the night that you were born   and now they are but a rag   on the moons horn  wise man  be silent  first pupil    can you not see that he is troubled                                            all the pupils are seated  wise man    what do you think of when alone at night   do not the things your mothers spoke about   before they took the candle from the bedside   rush up into the mind and master it   till you believe in them against your will  second pupil to first pupil    you answer for us  third pupil in a whisper to first pupil                       be careful what you say   if he persuades you to an argument   he will but turn us all to mockery  first pupil    we had no minds until you made them for us   our bodies only were our mothers work  wise man    you answer with incredible things it is certain   that there is onethough it may be but one   believes in god and in some heaven and hell   in all those things we put into our prayers  first pupil    we thought those things before our minds were born   but that was long agowe are not children  wise man    you are afraid to tell me what you think   because i am hot and angry when i am crossed   i do not blame you for it but have no fear   for if theres one that sat on smiling there   as though my arguments were sweet as milk   yet found them bitter i will thank him for it   if he but speak his mind  first pupil                              there is no one master   there is not one but found them sweet as milk  wise man    the things that have been told us in our childhood   are not so fragile  second pupil                         we are no longer children  third pupil    we all believe in you and in what you have taught  other pupils    all all all all in you nothing but you  wise man    i have deceived youwhere shall i go for words   i have no thoughtsmy mind has been swept bare   the messengers that stand in the fiery cloud   fling themselves out if we but dare to question   and after that the babylonian moon   blots all away  first pupil to other pupils                     i take his words to mean   that visionaries and martyrs when they are raised   above translunary things and there enlightened   as the contention is may lose the light   and flounder in their speech when the eyes open  second pupil    how well he imitates their trick of speech  third pupil    their air of mystery  fourth pupil                          their empty gaze   as though theyd looked upon some winged thing   and would not condescend to mankind after  first pupil    master we have all learnt that truth is learnt   when the intellects deliberate and cold   as it were a polished mirror that reflects   an unchanged world and not when the steel melts   bubbling and hissing till theres naught but fume  wise man    when it is melted when it all fumes up   they walk as when beside those three in the furnace   the form of the fourth  first pupil                            master theres none among us   that has not heard your mockery of these   or thoughts like these and we have not forgot  wise man    something incredible has happenedsome one has come   suddenly like a grey hawk out of the air   and all that i declared untrue is true  first pupil to other pupils    youd think the way he says it that he felt it   theres not a mummer to compare with him   hes something like a man  second pupil                               give us some proof  wise man    what proof have i to give but that an angel   an instant ago was standing on that spot                                                      the pupils rise  third pupil    you dreamed it  wise man                    i was awake as i am now  first pupil to the others    i may be dreaming now for all i know   he wants to show we have no certain proof   of anything in the world  second pupil                              there is this proof   that shows we are awakewe have all one world   while every dreamer has a world of his own   and sees what no one else can  third pupil                                   teigue sees angels   so when the master says he has seen an angel   he may have seen one  first pupil                          both may still be dreamers   unless its proved the angels were alike  second pupil    what sort are the angels teigue  third pupil                  that will prove nothing   unless we are sure prolonged obedience   has made one angel like another angel   as they were eggs  first pupil                       the masters silent now   for he has found that to dispute with us   seeing that he has taught us what we know   is but to reason with himself let us away   and find if there is one believer left  wise man    yes yes find me but one that still believes   the things that we were told when we were children  third pupil    hell mock and maul him  fourth pupil                             from the first i knew   he wanted somebody to argue with                                                              they go  wise man    i have no reason left all dark all dark               pupils return laughing they push forward fourth pupil  first pupil    here master is the very man you want   he said when we were studying the book   that maybe after all the monks were right   and you mistaken and if we but gave him time   hed prove that it was so  fourth pupil                               i never said it  wise man    dear friend dear friend do you believe in god  fourth pupil    master they have invented this to mock me  wise man    you are afraid of me  fourth pupil                          they know well master   that all i said was but to make them argue   theyve pushed me in to make a mock of me   because they knew i could take either side   and beat them at it  wise man                        if you believe in god   you are my souls one friend                                                         pupils laugh                                  mistress or wife   can give us but our good or evil luck   amid the howling world but you shall give   eternity and those sweetthroated things   that drift above the moon                        the pupils look at one another and are silent  second pupil                               how strange he is  wise man    the angel that stood there upon that spot   said that my soul was lost unless i found out   one that believed  fourth pupil                        cease mocking at me master   for i am certain that there is no god   nor immortality and they that said it   made a fantastic tale from a starved dream   to plague our hearts will that content you master  wise man    the giddy glass is emptier every moment   and you stand there debating laughing and wrangling   out of my sight out of my sight i say                                                   he drives them out    ill call my

more rewriting than i have a mind for some merchant in villon i forget the reference was free of the ten and four irish merchants exempted from certain duties by the irish parliament were unless memory deceives me again for i am writing away from books free of the eight and six   poems beginning with that to a wealthy man and ending with that to a shade  during the thirty years or so during which i have been reading irish newspapers three public controversies have stirred my imagination the first was the parnell controversy there were reasons to justify a mans joining either party but there were none to justify on one side or on the other lying accusations forgetful of past service a frenzy of detraction and another was the dispute over the playboy there were reasons for opposing as for supporting that violent laughing thing but none for the lies for the unscrupulous rhetoric spread against it in ireland and from ireland to america the third prepared for the corporations refusal of a building for sir hugh lanes famous collection of pictures  one could respect the argument that dublin with much poverty and many slums could not afford the £22000 the building was to cost the city but not the minds that used it one frenzied man compared the pictures to troy horse which destroyed a city and innumerable correspondents described sir hugh lane and those who had subscribed many thousands to give dublin paintings by corot manet monet degas and renoir as selfseekers selfadvertisers picturedealers logrolling cranks and faddists and one clerical paper told picturedealer lane to take himself and his pictures out of that a member of the corporation said there were irish artists who could paint as good if they had a mind to and another described a halfhour in the temporary gallery in harcourt street as the most dismal of his life some one else asked instead of these eccentric pictures to be given pictures like those beautiful productions displayed in the windows of our city picture shops another thought that we would all be more patriotic if we devoted our energy to fighting the insurance act another would not hang them in his kitchen while yet another described the vogue of french impressionist painting as having gone to such a length among logrolling enthusiasts that they even admired works that were rejected from the salon forty years ago by the finest critics in the world  the first serious opposition began in the irish catholic the chief dublin clerical paper and mr william murphy the organiser of the recent lockout and mr healys financial supporter in his attack upon parnell a man of great influence brought to its support a few days later his newspapers the evening herald and the irish independent the most popular of irish daily papers he replied to my poem to a wealthy man i was thinking of a very different wealthy man from what he described as paudeens point of view and paudeens point of view it was the enthusiasm for sir hugh lanes corotsone paper spelled the name repeatedly crotbeing but an exotic fashion waited some satirist like gilbert who killed the æsthetic craze and as for the rest there were no greater humbugs in the world than art critics and socalled experts as the first avowed reason for opposition the necessities of the poor got but a few lines not so many certainly as the objection of various persons to supply sir hugh lane with a monument at the citys expense and as the gallery was supported by mr james larkin the chief labour leader and important slum workers i assume that the purpose of the opposition was not exclusively charitable  these controversies political literary and artistic have showed that neither religion nor politics can of itself create minds with enough receptivity to become wise or just and generous enough to make a nation other cities have been as stupidsamuel butler laughs at shocked montreal for hiding the discobolus in a cellarbut dublin is the capital of a nation and an ancient race has nowhere else to look for an education goethe in wilhelm meister describes a saintly and naturally gracious woman who getting into a quarrel over some trumpery detail of religious observance growsshe and all her little religious communityangry and vindictive in ireland i am constantly reminded of that fable of the futility of all discipline that is not of the whole being religious irelandand the pious protestants of my childhood were signal examplesthinks of divine things as a round of duties separated from life and not as an element that may be discovered in all circumstance and emotion while political ireland sees the good citizen but as a man who holds to certain opinions and not as a man of good will against all this we have but a few educated men and the remnants of an old traditional culture among the poor both were stronger forty years ago before the rise of our new middle class which showed as its first public event during the nine years of the parnellite split how base at moments of excitement are minds without culture 1914  romantic irelands dead and gone sounds oldfashioned now it seemed true in 1913 but i did not foresee 1916 the late dublin rebellion whatever one can say of its wisdom will long be remembered for its heroism they weighed so lightly what they gave and gave too in some cases without hope of success july 1916   the dolls  the fable for this poem came into my head while i was giving some lectures in dublin i had noticed once again how all thought among us is frozen into something other than human life after i had made the poem i looked up one day into the blue of the sky and suddenly imagined as if lost in the blue of the sky stiff figures in procession i remembered that they were the habitual image suggested by blue sky and looking for a second fable called them the magi complimentary forms to those enraged dolls   the hourglass  a friend suggested to me the subject of this play an irish folktale from lady wildes ancient legends i have for years struggled with something which is charming in the naive legend but a platitude on the stage i did not discover till a year ago that if the wise man humbled himself to the fool and received salvation as his reward so much more powerful are pictures than words no explanatory dialogue could set the matter right i was faintly pleased when i converted a musichall singer and kept him going to mass for six weeks so little responsibility does one feel for those to whom one has never been introduced but i was always ashamed when i saw any friend of my own in the theatre now i have made my philosopher accept gods will whatever it is and find his courage again and helped by the elaboration of verse have so changed the fable that it is not false to my own thoughts of the world                                       printed in the united states of america                                          the following pages contain advertisements of   books

find themselves when they enter into an agreement with an apparition of the sea who demands that they knock off his head and who maintains that after they have done that he will knock off theirs there is a real meaning in the play which it will not take the thoughtful reader long to discover besides this there are a number of shorter poems notably one in which mr yeats answers the critics of the

be said to be responsible in a measure for the revival of interest in poetry in this country   the story of eleusis  by louis v ledoux  this is a lyrical drama in the greek manner dealing with the story of persephone mr ledoux has constructed such a play as might well have held the attention of the assembled mystæ at eleusis it is greek better than this it is also human its beauty and its truthfulness to life will appeal alike to the lover of classical and the lover of modern dramatic poetry                                         the macmillan company   publishers 6466 fifth avenue
