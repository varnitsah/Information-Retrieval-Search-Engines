silver clouds      it moved towards the car and took its seat        beside the daemon shape       obedient to the sweep of aery song                         115        the mighty ministers      unfurled their prismy wings        the magic car moved on      the night was fair innumerable stars        studded heavens dark blue vault                         120        the eastern wave grew pale        with the first smile of morn        the magic car moved on        from the swift sweep of wings      the atmosphere in flaming sparkles flew                    125        and where the burning wheels      eddied above the mountains loftiest peak        was traced a line of lightning      now far above a rock the utmost verge        of the wide earth it flew                                130      the rival of the andes whose dark brow        frowned oer the silver sea      far far below the chariots stormy path        calm as a slumbering babe        tremendous ocean lay                                     135      its broad and silent mirror gave to view        the pale and waning stars        the chariots fiery track        and the grey light of morn        tingeing those fleecy clouds                              140      that cradled in their folds the infant dawn        the chariot seemed to fly      through the abyss of an immense concave      radiant with million constellations tinged        with shades of infinite colour                           145        and semicircled with a belt        flashing incessant meteors         as they approached their goal      the winged shadows seemed to gather speed      the sea no longer was distinguished earth                  150      appeared a vast and shadowy sphere suspended        in the black concave of heaven        with the suns cloudless orb        whose rays of rapid light      parted around the chariots swifter course                 155      and fell like oceans feathery spray        dashed from the boiling surge        before a vessels prow         the magic car moved on        earths distant orb appeared                              160      the smallest light that twinkles in the heavens        whilst round the chariots way      innumerable systems widely rolled        and countless spheres diffused        an ever varying glory                                    165      it was a sight of wonder some were horned      and like the moons argentine crescent hung      in the dark dome of heaven some did shed      a clear mild beam like hesperus while the sea      yet glows with fading sunlight others dashed               170      athwart the night with trains of bickering fire      like sphered worlds to death and ruin driven      some shone like stars and as the chariot passed        bedimmed all other light         spirit of nature here                                    175      in this interminable wilderness      of worlds at whose involved immensity        even soaring fancy staggers        here is thy fitting temple        yet not the lightest leaf                                 180      that quivers to the passing breeze        is less instinct with thee        yet not the meanest worm      that lurks in graves and fattens on the dead        less shares thy eternal breath                           185        spirit of nature thou      imperishable as this glorious scene        here is thy fitting temple       if solitude hath ever led thy steps      to the shore of the immeasurable sea                       190        and thou hast lingered there        until the suns broad orb      seemed resting on the fiery line of ocean        thou must have marked the braided webs of gold        that without motion hang                                  195        over the sinking sphere      thou must have marked the billowy mountain clouds      edged with intolerable radiancy        towering like rocks of jet        above the burning deep                                   200        and yet there is a moment        when the suns highest point      peers like a star oer oceans western edge      when those far clouds of feathery purple gleam      like fairy lands girt by some heavenly sea                 205      then has thy rapt imagination soared      where in the midst of all existing things      the temple of the mightiest daemon stands         yet not the golden islands      that gleam amid yon flood of purple light                  210        nor the feathery curtains      that canopy the suns resplendent couch        nor the burnished ocean waves        paving that gorgeous dome        so fair so wonderful a sight                             215      as the eternal temple could afford      the elements of all that human thought      can frame of lovely or sublime did join      to rear the fabric of the fane nor aught      of earth may image forth its majesty                       220      yet likest evenings vault that faery hall      as heaven low resting on the wave it spread        its floors of flashing light        its vast and azure dome      and on the verge of that obscure abyss                      225      where crystal battlements oerhang the gulf      of the dark world ten thousand spheres diffuse      their lustre through its adamantine gates         the magic car no longer moved        the daemon and the spirit                                 230        entered the eternal gates        those clouds of aery gold        that slept in glittering billows        beneath the azure canopy      with the ethereal footsteps trembled not                   235        while slight and odorous mists      floated to strains of thrilling melody      through the vast columns and the pearly shrines         the daemon and the spirit      approached the overhanging battlement                      240      below lay stretched the boundless universe        there far as the remotest line      that limits swift imaginations flight      unending orbs mingled in mazy motion        immutably fulfilling                                      245        eternal natures law        above below around        the circling systems formed        a wilderness of harmony        each with undeviating aim                                 250      in eloquent silence through the depths of space        pursued its wondrous way       awhile the spirit paused in ecstasy      yet soon she saw as the vast spheres swept by      strange things within their belted orbs appear             255      like animated frenzies dimly moved      shadows and skeletons and fiendly shapes      thronging round human graves and oer the dead      sculpturing records for each memory      in verse such as malignant gods pronounce                 260      blasting the hopes of men when heaven and hell      confounded burst in ruin oer the world      and they did build vast trophies instruments      of murder human bones barbaric gold      skins torn from living men and towers of skulls            265      with sightless holes gazing on blinder heaven      mitres and crowns and brazen chariots stained      with blood and scrolls of mystic wickedness      the sanguine codes of venerable crime      the likeness of a throned king came by                     270      when these had passed bearing upon his brow      a threefold crown his countenance was calm      his eye severe and cold but his right hand      was charged with bloody coin and he did gnaw      by fits with secret smiles a human heart                  275      concealed beneath his robe and motley shapes      a multitudinous throng around him knelt      with bosoms bare and bowed heads and false looks      of true submission as the sphere rolled by      brooking no eye to witness their foul shame                280      which human hearts must feel while human tongues      tremble to speak they did rage horribly      breathing in selfcontempt fierce blasphemies      against the daemon of the world and high      hurling their armed hands where the pure spirit            285      serene and inaccessibly secure      stood on an isolated pinnacle      the flood of ages combating below      the depth of the unbounded universe        above and all around                                     290      necessitys unchanging harmony

for ever on this fairest world      shake pestilence and war or that his slaves      with blasphemy for prayer and human blood      for sacrifice before his shrine for ever                   310
