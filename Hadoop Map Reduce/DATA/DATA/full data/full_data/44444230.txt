44444230	the life adventures and piracies of the famous captain singleton  by daniel defoe     preface  that all defoes novels with the exception of robinson crusoe should have been covered with the dust of neglect for many generations is a plain proof of how much fashions in taste affect the popularity of the british classics it is true that three generations or so ago defoes works were edited by both sir walter scott and hazlitt and that this masterly piece of realism captain singleton was reprinted a few years back in the camelot classics but it is safe to say that out of every thousand readers of robinson crusoe only one or two will have even heard of the memoirs of a cavalier colonel jack moll flanders or captain singleton it is indeed distressing to think that while many scores of thousands of copies of lord lyttons flashy romance paul clifford have been devoured by the public captain singleton has remained unread and almost forgotten but the explanation is simple defoes plain and homely realism soon grew to be thought vulgar by people who themselves aspired to be refined and genteel the rapid spread of popular education in the middle of last century was responsible for a great many aberrations of taste and the works of the two most english of englishmen defoe and hogarth were judged to be hardly fitting for polite society as we may see from lambs essay on hogarth and from an early edition of chamberss cyclopaedia of english literature 1843 where we are told nor is it needful to show how elegant and reflective literature especially tends to moralise to soften and to adorn the soul and life of man unfortunately the taste or circumstances of defoe led him mostly into low life and his characters are such as we cannot sympathise with the whole arcana of roguery and villany seems to have been open to him it might be thought that the good taste which led defoe to write in a style of such pure and unpretending english instead of the inflated manner of vulgar writers would have dictated a more careful selection of his subjects and kept him from wandering so frequently into the low and disgusting purlieus of vice but this moral and tasteful discrimination seems to have been wholly wanting c the forties were the days when critics still talked learnedly of the noble style c the vulgar of sinking or rising with the subject the days when books of beauty were in fashion and rembrandts choice of beggars wrinkled faces and grey hairs for his favourite subjects seemed a low and reprehensible taste in high art though critics today still ingenuously confound an artists subject with his treatment of it and prefer scenes of life to be idealised rather than realised by writers we have advanced a little since the days of the poet montgomery and it would be difficult now to find anybody writing so confidentlyunfortunately the taste or circumstances of defoe led him mostly into low life however much the critic might believe it but let us glance at a few passages in captain singleton which may show us why defoe excels as a realist and why his descriptions of low life are artistically as perfect as any descriptions of higher life in the works of the english novelists take the following description of kidnapping    the woman pretending to take me up in her arms and kiss me and   play with me draws the girl a good way from the house till at   last she makes a fine story to the girl and bids her go back to   the maid and tell her where she was with the child that a   gentlewoman had taken a fancy to the child and was kissing it but   she should not be frightened or to that purpose for they were   but just there and so while the girl went she carried me quite   awaypage 2  now here in a single sentence defoe catches for us the whole soul and character of the situation it seems very simple but it sums up marvellously an exact observation and knowledge of the arts of the gipsy childstealer of her cunning flattery and brassy boldness and we can see the simple little girl running back to the house to tell the nurse that a fine lady was kissing the child and had told her to tell where they were and she should not be frightened c and this picture again calls up the hue and cry after the kidnappers and the fruitless hopes of the parents in a word defoe has condensed in the eight simple lines of his little scene all that is essential to its living truth and let the young writer note that it is ever the sign of the master to do in three words or with three strokes what the ordinary artist does in thirty defoes imagination is so extraordinarily comprehensive in picking out just those little matteroffact details that suggest all the other aspects and that emphasise the character of the scene or situation that he makes us believe in the actuality of whatever he is describing so real so living in every detail is this apocryphal narrative in captain singleton of the crossing of africa by a body of marooned sailors from the coast of mozambique to the gold coast that one would firmly believe defoe was committing to writing the verbal narrative of some adventurer in the flesh if it were not for certain passagessuch as the description of the impossible desert on page 90 which proves that defoe was piecing together his description of an imaginary journey from the geographical records and travellers tales of his contemporaries aided perhaps by the confused yarns of some sailor friends how substantially truthful in spirit and in detail is defoes account of madagascar is proved by the narrative of robert drurys captivity in madagascar published in 1729 the natives themselves as described intimately by drury who lived amongst them for many years would produce just such an effect as defoe describes on rough sailors in their perilous position the method by which defoe compels us to accept improbabilities and lulls our critical sense asleep is well shown in the following passages    thieving lying swearing forswearing joined to the most   abominable lewdness was the stated practice of the ships crew   adding to it that with the most unsufferable boasts of their own   courage they were generally speaking the most complete cowards   that i ever met withpage 7    all the seamen in a body came up to the rail of the quarterdeck   where the captain was walking with some of his officers and   appointing the boatswain to speak for them he went up and falling   on his knees to the captain begged of him in the humblest manner   possible to receive the four men on board again offering to answer   for their fidelity or to have them kept in chains till they came   to lisbon and there to be delivered up to justice rather than as   they said to have them left to be murdered by savages or devoured   by wild beasts it was a great while ere the captain took any notice   of them but when he did he ordered the boatswain to be seized and   threatened to bring him to the capstan for speaking for them   upon this severity one of the seamen bolder than the rest but   still with all possible respect to the captain besought his honour   as he called him that he would give leave to some more of them to   go on shore and die with their companions or if possible to   assist them to resist the barbarianspage 18  now the first passage we have quoted about the cowardice c of the portuguese crew is not in keeping with the second passage which shows the men as wishing to die with their companions but so actual is the scene of the seamen in a body coming up to the rail of the quarterdeck that we cannot but believe the thing happened so just as we believe in all the thousand little details of the imaginary narrative of robinson crusoe this feat of the imagination defoe strengthens in the most artful manner by putting in the mouths of his characters various reflections to substantiate the narrative for example in the description on page 263 of the savages who lined the perilous channel in a halfmoon where the european ship lay we find the afterthoughts are added so naturally that they would carry conviction to any judge or jury    they little thought what service they had done us and how   unwittingly and by the greatest ignorance they had made   themselves pilots to us while we having not sounded the place   might have been lost before we were aware it is true we might   have sounded our new harbour before we had ventured out but i   cannot say for certain whether we should or not for i for my   part had not the least suspicion of what our real case was   however i say perhaps before we had weighed we should have   looked about us a little  turning to the other literary qualities that make defoes novels great if little read classics how delightful are the little satiric touches that add grave weight to the story consider the following my good gipsy mother for some of her worthy actions no doubt happened in process of time to be hanged and as this fell out something too soon for me to be perfected in the strolling trade cp 3 every other word here is dryly satiric and the large free callousness and careless brutality of defoes days with regard to the life of criminals is conveyed in half a sentence and what an amount of shrewd observation is summed up in this one saying upon these foundations william said he was satisfied we might trust them for says william i would as soon trust a man whose interest binds him to be just to me as a man whose principle binds himself p 227 extremely subtle is also this remark why says i did you ever know a pirate repent at this he started a little and returned at the gallows i have known one repent and i hope thou wilt be the second the character of william the quaker pirate is a masterpiece of shrewd humour he is the first quaker brought into english fiction and we know of no other friend in latterday fiction to equal him defoe in his inimitable manner has defined surely and deftly the peculiar characteristics of the sect in this portrait on three separate occasions we find william saving unfortunate natives or defenceless prisoners from the cruel and wicked barbarity of the sailors at page 183 for example the reader will find a most penetrating analysis of the dense stupidity which so often accompanies mans love of bloodshed the sketch of the second lieutenant who was for murdering the negroes to make them tell when he could not make them even understand what he wanted is worthy of tolstoy we have not space here to dwell upon the scores of passages of similar deep insight which make captain singleton a most true and vivid commentary on the life of defoes times but we may call special attention to the passage on page 189 which describe the sale of the negroes to the planters to the description of the awakening of the conscience of captain singleton through terror at the firecloud page 222 and to the extraordinarily picturesque conversation between william and the captive dutchman page 264 finally if the reader wishes to taste defoes flavour in its perfection let him examine carefully those passages in the concluding twenty pages of the book wherein captain singleton is shown as awakening to the wickedness of his past life and the admirable dry reasoning of william by which the quaker prevents him from committing suicide and persuades him to keep his illgotten wealth with a resolution to do what right with it we are able and who knows what opportunity providence may put into our hands as it is without doubt our present business is to go to some place of safety where we may wait his will how admirable is the passage about williams sister the widow with four children who kept a little shop in the minories and that in which the penitent expirates are shown us as hesitating in venice for two years before they durst venture to england for fear of the gallows  captain singleton was published in 1720 a year after robinson crusoe when defoe was fiftynine twenty years before had seen the trueborn englishman and the shortest way with the dissenters and we are told that from june 1687 to almost the very week of his death in 1731 a stream of controversial books and pamphlets poured from his pen commenting upon and marking every important passing event the fecundity of defoe as a journalist alone surpasses that of any great journalist we can name william cobbett not excepted and we may add that the style of captain singleton like that of robinson crusoe is so perfect that there is not a single ineffective passage or

matters of politics and church     the life adventures and piracies of captain singleton   as it is usual for great persons whose lives have been remarkable and whose actions deserve recording to posterity to insist much upon their originals give full accounts of their families and the histories of their ancestors so that i may be methodical i shall do the same though i can look but a very little way into my pedigree as you will see presently  if i may believe the woman whom i was taught to call mother i was a little boy of about two years old very well dressed had a nurserymaid to attend me who took me out on a fine summers evening into the fields towards islington as she pretended to give the child some air a little girl being with her of twelve or fourteen years old that lived in the neighbourhood the maid whether by appointment or otherwise meets with a fellow her sweetheart as i suppose he carries her into a publichouse to give her a pot and a cake and while they were toying in the house the girl plays about with me in her hand in the garden and at the door sometimes in sight sometimes out of sight thinking no harm  at this juncture comes by one of those sort of people who it seems made it their business to spirit away little children this was a hellish trade in those days and chiefly practised where they found little children very well dressed or for bigger children to sell them to the plantations  the woman pretending to take me up in her arms and kiss me and play with me draws the girl a good way from the house till at last she makes a fine story to the girl and bids her go back to the maid and tell her where she was with the child that a gentlewoman had taken a fancy to the child and was kissing of it but she should not be frighted or to that purpose for they were but just there and so while the girl went she carries me quite away  from this time it seems i was disposed of to a beggar woman that wanted a pretty little child to set out her case and after that to a gipsy under whose government i continued till i was about six years old and this woman though i was continually dragged about with her from one part of the country to another yet never let me want for anything and i called her mother though she told me at last she was not my mother but that she bought me for twelve shillings of another woman who told her how she came by me and told her that my name was bob singleton not robert but plain bob for it seems they never knew by what name i was christened  it is in vain to reflect here what a terrible fright the careless hussy was in that lost me what treatment she received from my justly enraged father and mother and the horror these must be in at the thoughts of their child being thus carried away for as i never knew anything of the matter but just what i have related nor who my father and mother were so it would make but a needless digression to talk of it here  my good gipsy mother for some of her worthy actions no doubt happened in process of time to be hanged and as this fell out something too soon for me to be perfected in the strolling trade the parish where i was left which for my life i cant remember took some care of me to be sure for the first thing i can remember of myself afterwards was that i went to a parish school and the minister of the parish used to talk to me to be a good boy and that though i was but a poor boy if i minded my book and served god i might make a good man  i believe i was frequently removed from one town to another perhaps as the parishes disputed my supposed mothers last settlement whether i was so shifted by passes or otherwise i know not but the town where i last was kept whatever its name was must be not far off from the seaside for a master of a ship who took a fancy to me was the first that brought me to a place not far from southampton which i afterwards knew to be bussleton and there i attended the carpenters and such people as were employed in building a ship for him and when it was done though i was not above twelve years old he carried me to sea with him on a voyage to newfoundland  i lived well enough and pleased my master so well that he called me his own boy and i would have called him father but he would not allow it for he had children of his own i went three or four voyages with him and grew a great sturdy boy when coming home again from the banks of newfoundland we were taken by an algerine rover or manofwar which if my account stands right was about the year 1695 for you may be sure i kept no journal  i was not much concerned at the disaster though i saw my master after having been wounded by a splinter in the head during the engagement very barbarously used by the turks i say i was not much concerned till upon some unlucky thing i said which as i remember was about abusing my master they took me and beat me most unmercifully with a flat stick on the soles of my feet so that i could neither go or stand for several days together  but my good fortune was my friend upon this occasion for as they were sailing away with our ship in tow as a prize steering for the straits and in sight of the bay of cadiz the turkish rover was attacked by two great portuguese menofwar and taken and carried into lisbon  as i was not much concerned at my captivity not indeed understanding the consequences of it if it had continued so i was not suitably sensible of my deliverance nor indeed was it so much a deliverance to me as it would otherwise have been for my master who was the only friend i had in the world died at lisbon of his wounds and i being then almost reduced to my primitive state viz of starving had this addition to it that it was in a foreign country too where i knew nobody and could not speak a word of their language however i fared better here than i had reason to expect for when all the rest of our men had their liberty to go where they would i that knew not whither to go stayed in the ship for several days till at length one of the lieutenants seeing me inquired what that young english dog did there and why they did not turn him on shore  i heard him and partly understood what he meant though not what he said and began then to be in a terrible fright for i knew not where to get a bit of bread when the pilot of the ship an old seaman seeing me look very dull came to me and speaking broken english to me told me i must be gone whither must i go said i where you will said he home to your own country if you will how must i go thither said i why have you no friend said he no said i not in the world but that dog pointing to the ships dog who having stolen a piece of meat just before had brought it close by me and i had taken it from him and ate it for he has been a good friend and brought me my dinner  well well says he you must have your dinner will you go with me yes says i with all my heart in short the old pilot took me home with him and used me tolerably well though i fared hard enough and i lived with him about two years during which time he was soliciting his business and at length got to be master or pilot under don garcia de pimentesia de carravallas captain of a portuguese galleon or carrack which was bound to goa in the east indies and immediately having gotten his commission put me on board to look after his cabin in which he had stored himself with abundance of liquors succades sugar spices and other things for his accommodation in the voyage and laid in afterwards a considerable quantity of european goods fine lace and linen and also baize woollen cloth stuffs c under the pretence of his clothes  i was too young in the trade to keep any journal of this voyage though my master who was for a portuguese a pretty good artist prompted me to it but my not understanding the language was one hindrance at least it served me for an excuse however after some time i began to look into his charts and books and as i could write a tolerable hand understood some latin and began to have a little smattering of the portuguese tongue so i began to get a superficial knowledge of navigation but not such as was likely to be sufficient to carry me through a life of adventure as mine was to be in short i learned several material things in this voyage among the portuguese i learned particularly to be an arrant thief and a bad sailor and i think i may say they are the best masters for teaching both these of any nation in the world  we made our way for the east indies by the coast of brazil not that it is in the course of sailing the way thither but our captain either on his own account or by the direction of the merchants went thither first where at all saints bay or as they call it in portugal the rio de todos los santos we delivered near a hundred tons of goods and took in a considerable quantity of gold with some chests of sugar and seventy or eighty great rolls of tobacco every roll weighing at least a hundredweight  here being lodged on shore by my masters order i had the charge of the captains business he having seen me very diligent for my own master and in requital for his mistaken confidence i found means to secure that is to say to steal about twenty moidores out of the gold that was shipped on board by the merchants and this was my first adventure  we had a tolerable voyage from hence to the cape de bona speranza and i was reputed as a mighty diligent servant to my master and very faithful i was diligent indeed but i was very far from honest however they thought me honest which by the way was their very great mistake upon this very mistake the captain took a particular liking to me and employed me frequently on his own occasion and on the other hand in recompense for my officious diligence i received several particular favours from him particularly i was by the captains command made a kind of a steward under the ships steward for such provisions as the captain demanded for his own table he had another steward for his private stores besides but my office concerned only what the captain called for of the ships stores for his private use  however by this means i had opportunity particularly to take care of my masters man and to furnish myself with sufficient provisions to make me live much better than the other people in the ship for the captain seldom ordered anything out of the ships stores as above but i snipt some of it for my own share we arrived at goa in the east indies in about seven months from lisbon and remained there eight more during which time i had indeed nothing to do my master being generally on shore but to learn everything that is wicked among the portuguese a nation the most perfidious and the most debauched the most insolent and cruel of any that pretend to call themselves christians in the world  thieving lying swearing forswearing joined to the most abominable lewdness was the stated practice of the ships crew adding to it that with the most insufferable boasts of their own courage they were generally speaking the most complete cowards that i ever met with and the consequence of their cowardice was evident upon many occasions however there was here and there one among them that was not so bad as the rest and as my lot fell among them it made me have the most contemptible thoughts of the rest as indeed they deserved  i was exactly fitted for their society indeed for i had no sense of virtue or religion upon me i had never heard much of either except what a good old parson had said to me when i was a child of about eight or nine years old nay i was preparing and growing up apace to be as wicked as anybody could be or perhaps ever was fate certainly thus directed my beginning knowing that i had work which i had to do in the world which nothing but one hardened against all sense of honesty or religion could go through and yet even in this state of original wickedness i entertained such a settled abhorrence of the abandoned vileness of the portuguese that i could not but hate them most heartily from the beginning and all my life afterwards they were so brutishly wicked so base and perfidious not only to strangers but to one another so meanly submissive when subjected so insolent or barbarous and tyrannical when superior that i thought there was something in them that shocked my very nature add to this that it is natural to an englishman to hate a coward it all joined together to make the devil and a portuguese equally my aversion  however according to the english proverb he that is shipped with the devil must sail with the devil i was among them and i managed myself as well as i could my master had consented that i should assist the captain in the office as above but as i understood afterwards that the captain allowed my master half a moidore a month for my service and that he had my name upon the ships books also i expected that when the ship came to be paid four months wages at the indies as they it seems always do my master would let me have something for myself  but i was wrong in my man for he was none of that kind he had taken me up as in distress and his business was to keep me so and make his market of me as well as he could which i began to think of after a different manner than i did at first for at first i thought he had entertained me in mere charity upon seeing my distressed circumstances but did not doubt but when he put me on board the ship i should have some wages for my service  but he thought it seems quite otherwise and when i procured one to speak to him about it when the ship was paid at goa he flew into the greatest rage imaginable and called me english dog young heretic and threatened to put me into the inquisition indeed of all the names the fourandtwenty letters could make up he should not have called me heretic for as i knew nothing about religion neither protestant from papist or either of them from a mahometan i could never be a heretic however it passed but a little but as young as i was i had been carried into the inquisition and there if they had asked me if i was a protestant or a catholic i should have said yes to that which came first if it had been the protestant they had asked first it had certainly made a martyr of me for i did not know what  but the very priest they carried with them or chaplain of the ship as we called him saved me for seeing me a boy entirely ignorant of religion and ready to do or say anything they bid me he asked me some questions about it which he found i answered so very simply that he took it upon him to tell them he would answer for my being a good catholic and he hoped he should be the means of saving my soul and he pleased himself that it was to be a work of merit to him so he made me as good a papist as any of them in about a weeks time  i then told him my case about my master how it is true he had taken me up in a miserable case on board a manofwar at lisbon and i was indebted to him for bringing me on board this ship that if i had been left at lisbon i might have starved and the like and therefore i was willing to serve him but that i hoped he would give me some little consideration for my service or let me know how long he expected i should serve him for nothing  it was all one neither the priest nor any one else could prevail with him but that i was not his servant but his slave that he took me in the algerine and that i was a turk only pretended to be an english boy to get my liberty and he would carry me to the inquisition as a turk  this frighted me out of my wits for i had nobody to vouch for me what i was or from whence i came but the good padre antonio for that was his name cleared me of that part by a way i did not understand for he came to me one morning with two sailors and told me they must search me to bear witness that i was not a turk i was amazed at them and frighted and did not understand them nor could i imagine what they intended to do to me however stripping me they were soon satisfied and father antony bade me be easy for they could all witness that i was no turk so i escaped that part of my masters cruelty  and now i resolved from that time to run away from him if i could but there was no doing of it there for there were not ships of any nation in the world in that port except two or three persian vessels from ormus so that if i had offered to go away from him he would have had me seized on shore and brought on board by force so that i had no remedy but patience and this he brought to an end too as soon as he could for after this he began to use me ill and not only to straiten my provisions but to beat and torture me in a barbarous manner for every trifle so that in a word my life began to be very miserable  the violence of this usage of me and the impossibility of my escape from his hands set my head aworking upon all sorts of mischief and in particular i resolved after studying all other ways to deliver myself and finding all ineffectual i say i resolved to murder him with this hellish resolution in my head i spent whole nights and days contriving how to put it in execution the devil prompting me very warmly to the fact i was indeed entirely at a loss for the means for i had neither gun or sword nor any weapon to assault him with poison i had my thoughts much upon but knew not where to get any or if i might have got it i did not know the country word for it or by what name to ask for it  in this manner i quitted the fact intentionally a hundred and a hundred times but providence either for his sake or for mine always frustrated my designs and i could never bring it to pass so i was obliged to continue in his chains till the ship having taken in her loading set sail for portugal  i can say nothing here to the manner of our voyage for as i said i kept no journal but this i can give an account of that having been once as high as the cape of good hope as we call it or cabo de bona speranza as they call it we were driven back again by a violent storm from the wsw which held us six days and nights a great way to the eastward and after that standing afore the wind for several days more we at last came to an anchor on the coast of madagascar  the storm had been so violent that the ship had received a great deal of damage and it required some time to repair her so standing in nearer the shore the pilot my master brought the ship into a very good harbour where we rid in twentysix fathoms water about half a mile from the shore  while the ship rode here there happened a most desperate mutiny among the men upon account of some deficiency in their allowance which came to that height that they threatened the captain to set him on shore and go back with the ship to goa i wished they would with all my heart for i was full of mischief in my head and ready enough to do any so though i was but a boy as they called me yet i prompted the mischief all i could and embarked in it so openly that i escaped very little being hanged in the first and most early part of my life for the captain had some notice that there was a design laid by some of the company to murder him and having partly by money and promises and partly by threatening and torture brought two fellows to confess the particulars and the names of the persons concerned they were presently apprehended till one accusing another no less than sixteen men were seized and put into irons whereof i was one  the captain who was made desperate by his danger resolving to clear the ship of his enemies tried us all and we were all condemned to die the manner of his process i was too young to take notice of but the purser and one of the gunners were hanged immediately and i expected it with the rest i do not remember any great concern i was under about it only that i cried very much for i knew little then of this world and nothing at all of the next  however the captain contented himself with executing these two and some of the rest upon their humble submission and promise of future good behaviour were pardoned but five were ordered to be set on shore on the island and left there of which i was one my master used all his interest with the captain to have me excused but could not obtain it for somebody having told him that i was one of them who was singled out to have killed him when my master desired i might not be set on shore the captain told him i should stay on board if he desired it but then i should be hanged so he might choose for me which he thought best the captain it seems was particularly provoked at my being concerned in the treachery because of his having been so kind to me and of his having singled me out to serve him as i have said above and this perhaps obliged him to give my master such a rough choice either to set me on shore or to have me hanged on board and had my master indeed known what goodwill i had for him he would not have been long in choosing for me for i had certainly determined to do him a mischief the first opportunity i had for it this was therefore a good providence for me to keep me from dipping my hands in blood and it made me more tender afterwards in matters of blood than i believe i should otherwise have been but as to my being one of them that was to kill the captain that i was wronged in for i was not the person but it was really one of them that were pardoned he having the good luck not to have that part discovered  i was now to enter upon a part of independent life a thing i was indeed very ill prepared to manage for i was perfectly loose and dissolute in my behaviour bold and wicked while i was under government and now perfectly unfit to be trusted with liberty for i was as ripe for any villainy as a young fellow that had no solid thought ever placed in his mind could be supposed to be education as you have heard i had none and all the little scenes of life i had passed through had been full of dangers and desperate circumstances but i was either so young or so stupid that i escaped the grief and anxiety of them for want of having a sense of their tendency and consequences  this thoughtless unconcerned temper had one felicity indeed in it that it made me daring and ready for doing any mischief and kept off the sorrow which otherwise ought to have attended me when i fell into any mischief that this stupidity was instead of a happiness to me for it left my thoughts free to act upon means of escape and deliverance in my distress however great it might be whereas my companions in the misery were so sunk by their fear and grief that they abandoned themselves to the misery of their condition and gave over all thought but of their perishing and starving being devoured by wild beasts murdered and perhaps eaten by cannibals and the like  i was but a young fellow about seventeen or eighteen but hearing what was to be my fate i received it with no appearance of discouragement but i asked what my master said to it and being told that he had used his utmost interest to save me but the captain had answered i should either go on shore or be hanged on board which he pleased i then gave over all hope of being received again i was not very thankful in my thoughts to my master for his soliciting the captain for me because i knew that what he did was not in kindness to me so much as in kindness to himself i mean to preserve the wages which he got for me which amounted to above six dollars a month including what the captain allowed him for my particular service to him  when i understood that my master was so apparently kind i asked if i might not be admitted to speak with him and they told me i might if my master would come down to me but i could not be allowed to come up to him so then i desired my master might be spoke to to come to me and he accordingly came to me i fell on my knees to him and begged he would forgive me what i had done to displease him and indeed the resolution i had taken to murder him lay with some horror upon my mind just at that time so that i was once just agoing to confess it and beg him to forgive me but i kept it in he told me he had done all he could to obtain my pardon of the captain but could not and he knew no way for me but to have patience and submit to my fate and if they came to speak with any ship of their nation at the cape he would endeavour to have them stand in and fetch us off again if we might be found  then i begged i might have my clothes on shore with me he told me he was afraid i should have little need of clothes for he did not see how we could long subsist on the island and that he had been told that the inhabitants were cannibals or meneaters though he had no reason for that suggestion and we should not be able to live among them i told him i was not so afraid of that as i was of starving for want of victuals and as for the inhabitants being cannibals i believed we should be more likely to eat them than they us if we could but get at them but i was mightily concerned i said we should have no weapons with us to defend ourselves and i begged nothing now but that he would give me a gun and a sword with a little powder and shot  he smiled and said they would signify nothing to us for it was impossible for us to pretend to preserve our lives among such a populous and desperate nation as the people of this island were i told him that however it would do us this good for we should not be devoured or destroyed immediately so i begged hard for the gun at last he told me he did not know whether the captain would give him leave to give me a gun and if not he durst not do it but he promised to use his interest to obtain it for me which he did and the next day he sent me a gun with some ammunition but told me the captain would not suffer the ammunition to be given us till we were set all on shore and till he was just going to set sail he also sent me the few clothes i had in the ship which indeed were not many  two days after this we were all carried on shore together the rest of my fellowcriminals hearing i had a gun and some powder and shot solicited for liberty to carry the like with them which was also granted them and thus we were set on shore to shift for ourselves  at our first coming into the island we were terrified exceedingly with the sight of the barbarous people whose figure was made more terrible to us than it really was by the report we had of them from the seamen but when we came to converse with them awhile we found they were not cannibals as was reported or such as would fall immediately upon us and eat us up but they came and sat down by us and wondered much at our clothes and arms and made signs to give us some victuals such as they had which was only roots and plants dug out of the ground for the present but they brought us fowls and flesh afterwards in good plenty  this encouraged the other four men that were with me very much for they were quite dejected before but now they began to be very familiar with them and made signs that if they would use us kindly we would stay and live with them which they seemed glad of though they knew little of the necessity we were under to do so or how much we were afraid of them  however upon second thoughts we resolved that we would only stay in that part so long as the ship rid in the bay and then making them believe we were gone with the ship we would go and place ourselves if possible where there were no inhabitants to be seen and so live as we could or perhaps watch for a ship that might be driven upon the coast as we were  the ship continued a fortnight in the roads repairing some damage which had been done her in the late storm and taking in wood and water and during this time the boat coming often on shore the men brought us several refreshments and the natives believing we only belonged to the ship were civil enough we lived in a kind of a tent on the shore or rather a hut which we made with the boughs of trees and sometimes in the night retired to a wood a little out of their way to let them think we were gone on board the ship however we found them barbarous treacherous and villainous enough in their nature only civil from fear and therefore concluded we should soon fall into their hands when the ship was gone  the sense of this wrought upon my fellowsufferers even to distraction and one of them being a carpenter in his mad fit swam off to the ship in the night though she lay then a league to sea and made such pitiful moan to be taken in that the captain was prevailed with at last to take him in though they let him lie swimming three hours in the water before he consented to it  upon this and his humble submission the captain received him and in a word the importunity of this man who for some time petitioned to be taken in though they hanged him as soon as they had him was such as could not be resisted for after he had swam so long about the ship he was not able to reach the shore again and the captain saw evidently that the man must be taken on board or suffered to drown and the whole ships company offering to be bound for him for his good behaviour the captain at last yielded and he was taken up but almost dead with his being so long in the water  when this man was got in he never left importuning the captain and all the rest of the officers in behalf of us that were behind but to the very last day the captain was inexorable when at the time their preparations were making to sail and orders given to hoist the boats into the ship all the seamen in a body came up to the rail of the quarterdeck where the captain was walking with some of his officers and appointing the boatswain to speak for them he went up and falling on his knees to the captain begged of him in the humblest manner possible to receive the four men on board again offering to answer for their fidelity or to have them kept in chains till they came to lisbon and there to be delivered up to justice rather than as they said to have them left to be murdered by savages or devoured by wild beasts it was a great while ere the captain took any notice of them but when he did he ordered the boatswain to be seized and threatened to bring him to the capstan for speaking for them  upon this severity one of the seamen bolder than the rest but still with all possible respect to the captain besought his honour as he called him that he would give leave to some more of them to go on shore and die with their companions or if possible to assist them to resist the barbarians the captain rather provoked than cowed with this came to the barricade of the quarterdeck and speaking very prudently to the men for had he spoken roughly twothirds of them would have left the ship if not all of them he told them it was for their safety as well as his own that he had been obliged to that severity that mutiny on board a ship was the same thing as treason in a kings palace and he could not answer it to his owners and employers to trust the ship and goods committed to his charge with men who had entertained thoughts of the worst and blackest nature that he wished heartily that it had been anywhere else that they had been set on shore where they might have been in less hazard from the savages that if he had designed they should be destroyed he could as well have executed them on board as the other two that he wished it had been in some other part of the world where he might have delivered them up to the civil justice or might have left them among christians but it was better their lives were put in hazard than his life and the safety of the ship and that though he did not know that he had deserved so ill of any of them as that they should leave the ship rather than do their duty yet if any of them were resolved to do so unless he would consent to take a gang of traitors on board who as he had proved before them all had conspired to murder him he would not hinder them nor for the present would he resent their importunity but if there was nobody left in the ship but himself he would never consent to take them on board  this discourse was delivered so well was in itself so reasonable was managed with so much temper yet so boldly concluded with a negative that the greatest part of the men were satisfied for the present however as it put the men into juntos and cabals they were not composed for some hours the wind also slackening towards night the captain ordered not to weigh till next morning  the same night twentythree of the men among whom was the gunners mate the surgeons assistant and two carpenters applying to the chief mate told him that as the captain had given them leave to go on shore to their comrades they begged that he would speak to the captain not to take it ill that they were desirous to go and die with their companions and that they thought they could do no less in such an extremity than go to them because if there was any way to save their lives it was by adding to their numbers and making them strong enough to assist one another in defending themselves against the savages till perhaps they might one time or other find means to make their escape and get to their own country again  the mate told them in so many words that he durst not speak to the captain upon any such design and was very sorry they had no more respect for him than to desire him to go upon such an errand but if they were resolved upon such an enterprise he would advise them to take the longboat in the morning betimes and go off seeing the captain had given them leave and leave a civil letter behind them to the captain and to desire him to send his men on shore for the boat which should be delivered very honestly and he promised to keep their counsel so long  accordingly an hour before day those twentythree men with every man a firelock and a cutlass with some pistols three halberds or halfpikes and good store of powder and ball without any provision but about half a hundred of bread but with all their chests and clothes tools instruments books c embarked themselves so silently that the captain got no notice of it till they were gotten half the way on shore  as soon as the captain heard of it he called for the gunners mate the chief gunner being at the time sick in his cabin and ordered to fire at them but to his great mortification the gunners mate was one of the number and was gone with them and indeed it was by this means they got so many arms and so much ammunition when the captain found how it was and that there was no help for it he began to be a little appeased and made light of it and called up the men and spoke kindly to them and told them he was very well satisfied in the fidelity and ability of those that were now left and that he would give to them for their encouragement to be divided among them the wages which were due to the men that were gone and that it was a great satisfaction to him that the ship was free from such a mutinous rabble who had not the least reason for their discontent  the men seemed very well satisfied and particularly the promise of the wages of those who were gone went a great way with them after this the letter which was left by the men was given to the captain by his boy with whom it seems the men had left it the letter was much to the same purpose of what they had said to the mate and which he declined to say for them only that at the end of their letter they told the captain that as they had no dishonest design so they had taken nothing away with them which was not their own except some arms and ammunition such as were absolutely necessary to them as well for their defence against the savages as to kill fowls or beasts for their food that they might not perish and as there were considerable sums due to them for wages they hoped he would allow the arms and ammunition upon their accounts they told him that as to the ships longboat which they had taken to bring them on shore they knew it was necessary to him and they were very willing to restore it to him and if he pleased to send for it it should be very honestly delivered to his men and not the least injury offered to any of those who came for it nor the least persuasion or invitation made use of to any of them to stay with them and at the bottom of the letter they very humbly besought him that for their defence and for the safety of their lives he would be pleased to send them a barrel of powder and some ammunition and give them leave to keep the mast and sail of the boat that if it was possible for them to make themselves a boat of any kind they might shift off to sea to save themselves in such part of the world as their fate should direct them to  upon this the captain who had won much upon the rest of his men by what he had said to them and was very easy as to the general peace for it was very true that the most mutinous of the men were gone came out to the quarterdeck and calling the men together let them know the substance of the letter and told the men that however they had not deserved such civility from him yet he was not willing to expose them more than they were willing to expose themselves he was inclined to send them some ammunition and as they had desired but one barrel of powder he would send them two barrels and shot or lead and moulds to make shot in proportion and to let them see that he was civiller to them than they deserved he ordered a cask of arrack and a great bag of bread to be sent them for subsistence till they should be able to furnish themselves  the rest of the men applauded the captains generosity and every one of them sent us something or other and about three in the afternoon the pinnace came on shore and brought us all these things which we were very glad of and returned the longboat accordingly and as to the men that came with the pinnace as the captain had singled out such men as he knew would not come over to us so they had positive orders not to bring any one of us on board again upon pain of death and indeed both were so true to our points that we neither asked them to stay nor they us to go  we were now a good troop being in all twentyseven men very well armed and provided with everything but victuals we had two carpenters among us a gunner and which was worth all the rest a surgeon or doctor that is to say he was an assistant to a surgeon at goa and was entertained as a supernumerary with us the carpenters had brought all their tools the doctor all his instruments and medicines and indeed we had a great deal of baggage that is to say on the whole for some of us had little more than the clothes on our backs of whom i was one but i had one thing which none of them had viz i had the twentytwo moidores of gold which i had stole at the brazils and two pieces of eight the two pieces of eight i showed and one moidore and none of them ever suspected that i had any more money in the world having been known to be only a poor boy taken up in charity as you have heard and used like a slave and in the worst manner of a slave by my cruel master the pilot  it will be easy to imagine we four that were left at first were joyful nay even surprised with joy at the coming of the rest though at first we were frighted and thought they came to fetch us back to hang us but they took ways quickly to satisfy us that they were in the same condition with us only with this additional circumstance theirs was voluntary and ours by force  the first piece of news they told us after the short history of their coming away was that our companion was on board but how he got thither we could not imagine for he had given us the slip and we never imagined he could swim so well as to venture off to the ship which lay at so great a distance nay we did not so much as know that he could swim at all and not thinking anything of what really happened we thought he must have wandered into the woods and was devoured or was fallen into the hands of the natives and was murdered and these thoughts filled us with fears enough and of several kinds about its being some time or other our lot to fall into their hands also but hearing how he had with much difficulty been received on board the ship again and pardoned we were much better satisfied than before  being now as i have said a considerable number of us and in condition to defend ourselves the first thing we did was to give every one his hand that we would not separate from one another upon any occasion whatsoever but that we would live and die together that we would kill no food but that we would distribute it in public and that we would be in all things guided by the majority and not insist upon our own resolutions in anything if the majority were against it that we would appoint a captain among us to be our governor or leader during pleasure that while he was in office we would obey him without reserve on pain of death and that every one should take turn but the captain was not to act in any particular thing without advice of the rest and by the majority  having established these rules we resolved to enter into some measures for our food and for conversing with the inhabitants or natives of the island for our supply as for food they were at first very useful to us but we soon grew weary of them being an ignorant ravenous brutish sort of people even worse than the natives of any other country that we had seen and we soon found that the principal part of our subsistence was to be had by our guns shooting of deer and other creatures and fowls of all other sorts of which there is abundance  we found the natives did not disturb or concern themselves much about us nor did they inquire or perhaps know whether we stayed among them or not much less that our ship was gone quite away and had cast us off as was our case for the next morning after we had sent back the longboat the ship stood away to the southeast and in four hours time was out of our sight  the next day two of us went out into the country one way and two another to see what kind of a land we were in and we soon found the country was very pleasant and fruitful and a convenient place enough to live in but as before inhabited by a parcel of creatures scarce human or capable of being made social on any account whatsoever  we found the place full of cattle and provisions but whether we might venture to take them where we could find them or not we did not know and though we were under a necessity to get provisions yet we were loth to bring down a whole nation of devils upon us at once and therefore some of our company agreed to try to speak with some of the country if we could that we might see what course was to be taken with them eleven of our men went on this errand well armed and furnished for defence they brought word that they had seen some of the natives who appeared very civil to them but very shy and afraid seeing their guns for it was easy to perceive that the natives knew what their guns were and what use they were of  they made signs to the natives for some food and they went and fetched several herbs and roots and some milk but it was evident they did not design to give it away but to sell it making signs to know what our men would give them  our men were perplexed at this for they had nothing to barter however one of the men pulled out a knife and showed them and they were so fond of it that they were ready to go together by the ears for the knife the seaman seeing that was willing to make a good market of his knife and keeping them chaffering about it a good while some offered him roots and others milk at last one offered him a goat for it which he took then another of our men showed them another knife but they had nothing good enough for that whereupon one of them made signs that he would go and fetch something so our men stayed three hours for their return when they came back and brought him a smallsized thick short cow very fat and good meat and gave him for his knife  this was a good market but our misfortune was we had no merchandise for our knives were as needful to us as to them and but that we were in distress for food and must of necessity have some these men would not have parted with their knives  however in a little time more we found that the woods were full of living creatures which we might kill for our food and that without giving offence to them so that our men went daily out ahunting and never failed in killing something or other for as to the natives we had no goods to barter and for money all the stock among us would not have subsisted us long however we called a general council to see what money we had and to bring it all together that it might go as far as possible and when it came to my turn i pulled out a moidore and the two dollars i spoke of before  this moidore i ventured to show that they might not despise me too much for adding too little to the store and that they might not pretend to search me and they were very civil to me upon the presumption that i had been so faithful to them as not to conceal anything from them  but our money did us little service for the people neither knew the value or the use of it nor could they justly rate the gold in proportion with the silver so that all our money which was not much when it was all put together would go but a little way with us that is to say to buy us provisions  our next consideration was to get away from this cursed place and whither to go when my opinion came to be asked i told them i would leave that all to them and i told them i had rather they would let me go into the woods to get them some provisions than consult with me for i would agree to whatever they did but they would not agree to that for they would not consent that any of us should go into the woods alone for though we had yet seen no lions or tigers in the woods we were assured there were many in the island besides other creatures as dangerous and perhaps worse as we afterwards found by our own experience  we had many adventures in the woods for our provisions and often met with wild and terrible beasts which we could not call by their names but as they were like us seeking their prey but were themselves good for nothing so we disturbed them as little as possible  our consultations concerning our escape from this place which as i have said we were now upon ended in this only that as we had two carpenters among us and that they had tools almost of all sorts with them we should try to build us a boat to go off to sea with and that then perhaps we might find our way back to goa or land on some more proper place to make our escape the counsels of this assembly were not of great moment yet as they seem to be introductory of many more remarkable adventures which happened under my conduct hereabouts many years after i think this miniature of my future enterprises may not be unpleasant to relate  to the building of a boat i made no objection and away they went to work immediately but as they went on great difficulties occurred such as the want of saws to cut our plank nails bolts and spikes to fasten the timbers hemp pitch and tar to caulk and pay her seams and the like at length one of the company proposed that instead of building a bark or sloop or shallop or whatever they would call it which they found was so difficult they would rather make a large periagua or canoe which might be done with great ease  it was presently objected that we could never make a canoe large enough to pass the great ocean which we were to go over to get to the coast of malabar that it not only would not bear the sea but it would never bear the burden for we were not only twentyseven men of us but had a great deal of luggage with us and must for our provision take in a great deal more  i never proposed to speak in their general consultations before but finding they were at some loss about what kind of vessel they should make and how to make it and what would be fit for our use and what not i told them i found they were at a full stop in their counsels of every kind that it was true we could never pretend to go over to goa on the coast of malabar in a canoe which though we could all get into it and that it would bear the sea well enough yet would not hold our provisions and especially we could not put fresh water enough into it for the voyage and to make such an adventure would be nothing but mere running into certain destruction and yet that nevertheless i was for making a canoe  they answered that they understood all i had said before well enough but what i meant by telling them first how dangerous and impossible it was to make our escape in a canoe and yet then to advise making a canoe that they could not understand  to this i answered that i conceived our business was not to attempt our escape in a canoe but that as there were other vessels at sea besides our ship and that there were few nations that lived on the seashore that were so barbarous but that they went to sea in some boats or other our business was to cruise along the coast of the island which was very long and to seize upon the first we could get that was better than our own and so from that to another till perhaps we might at last get a good ship to carry us wherever we pleased to go  excellent advice says one of them admirable advice says another yes yes says the third which was the gunner the english dog has given excellent advice but it is just the way to bring us all to the gallows the rogue has given us devilish advice indeed to go athieving till from a little vessel we came to a great ship and so we shall turn downright pirates the end of which is to be hanged  you may call us pirates says another if you will and if we fall into bad hands we may be used like pirates but i care not for that ill be a pirate or anything nay ill be hanged for a pirate rather than starve here therefore i think the advice is very good and so they cried all let us have a canoe the gunner overruled by the rest submitted but as we broke up the council he came to me takes me by the hand and looking into the palm of my hand and into my face too very gravely my lad says he thou art born to do a world of mischief thou hast commenced pirate very young but have a care of the gallows young man have a care i say for thou wilt be an eminent thief  i laughed at him and told him i did not know what i might come to hereafter but as our case was now i should make no scruple to take the first ship i came at to get our liberty i only wished we could see one and come at her just while we were talking one of our men that was at the door of our hut told us that the carpenter who it seems was upon a hill at a distance cried out a sail a sail  we all turned out immediately but though it was very clear weather we could see nothing but the carpenter continuing to halloo to us a sail a sail away we run up the hill and there we saw a ship plainly but it was at a very great distance too far for us to make any signal to her however we made a fire upon the hill with all the wood we could get together and made as much smoke as possible the wind was down and it was almost calm but as we thought by a perspective glass which the gunner had in his pocket her sails were full and she stood away large with the wind at ene taking no notice of our signal but making for the cape de bona speranza so we had no comfort from her  we went therefore immediately to work about our intended canoe and having singled out a very large tree to our minds we fell to work with her and having three good axes among us we got it down but it was four days time first though we worked very hard too i do not remember what wood it was or exactly what dimensions but i remember that it was a very large one and we were as much encouraged when we launched it and found it swam upright and steady as we would have been at another time if we had had a good manofwar at our command  she was so very large that she carried us all very very easily and would have carried two or three tons of baggage with us so that we began to consult about going to sea directly to goa but many other considerations checked that thought especially when we came to look nearer into it such as want of provisions and no casks for fresh water no compass to steer by no shelter from the breach of the high sea which would certainly founder us no defence from the heat of the weather and the like so that they all came readily into my project to cruise about where we were and see what might offer  accordingly to gratify our fancy we went one day all out to sea in her together and we were in a very fair way to have had enough of it for when she had us all on board and that we were gotten about half a league to sea there happening to be a pretty high swell of the sea though little or no wind yet she wallowed so in the sea that we all of us thought she would at last wallow herself bottom up so we set all to work to get her in nearer the shore and giving her fresh way in the sea she swam more steady and with some hard work we got her under the land again  we were now at a great loss the natives were civil enough to us and came often to discourse with us one time they brought one whom they showed respect to as a king with them and they set up a long pole between them and us with a great tassel of hair hanging not on the top but something above the middle of it adorned with little chains shells bits of brass and the like and this we understood afterwards was a token of amity and friendship and they brought down to us victuals in abundance cattle fowls herbs and roots but we were in the utmost confusion on our side for we had nothing to buy with or exchange for and as to giving us things for nothing they had no notion of that again as to our money it was mere trash to them they had no value for it so that we were in a fair way to be starved had we had but some toys and trinkets brass chains baubles glass beads or in a word the veriest trifles that a shipload of would not have been worth the freight we might have bought cattle and provisions enough for an army or to victual a fleet of menofwar but for gold or silver we could get nothing  upon this we were in a strange consternation i was but a young fellow but i was for falling upon them with our firearms and taking all the cattle from them and send them to the devil to stop their hunger rather than be starved ourselves but i did not consider that this might have brought ten thousand of them down upon us the next day and though we might have killed a vast number of them and perhaps have frighted the rest yet their own desperation and our small number would have animated them so that one time or other they would have destroyed us all  in the middle of our consultation one of our men who had been a kind of a cutler or worker in iron started up and asked the carpenter if among all his tools he could not help him to a file yes says the carpenter i can but it is a small one the smaller the better says the other upon this he goes to work and first by heating a piece of an old broken chisel in the fire and then with the help of his file he made himself several kinds of tools for his work then he takes three or four pieces of eight and beats them out with a hammer upon a stone till they were very broad and thin then he cuts them out into the shape of birds and beasts he made little chains of them for bracelets and necklaces and turned them into so many devices of his own head that it is hardly to be expressed  when he had for about a fortnight exercised his head and hands at this work we tried the effect of his ingenuity and having another meeting with the natives were surprised to see the folly of the poor people for a little bit of silver cut in the shape of a bird we had two cows and which was our loss if it had been in brass it had been still of more value for one of the bracelets made of chainwork we had as much provision of several sorts as would fairly have been worth in england fifteen or sixteen pounds and so of all the rest thus that which when it was in coin was not worth sixpence to us when thus converted into toys and trifles was worth a hundred times its real value and purchased for us anything we had occasion for  in this condition we lived upwards of a year but all of us began to be very much tired of it and whatever came of it resolved to attempt an escape we had furnished ourselves with no less than three very good canoes and as the monsoons or tradewinds generally affect that country blowing in most parts of this island one six months of a year one way and the other six months another way we concluded we might be able to bear the sea well enough but always when we came to look into it the want of fresh water was the thing that put us off from such an adventure for it is a prodigious length and what no man on earth could be able to perform without water to drink  being thus prevailed upon by our own reason to set the thoughts of that voyage aside we had then but two things before us one was to put to sea the other way viz west and go away for the cape of good hope where first or last we should meet with some of our own country ships or else to put for the mainland of africa and either travel by land or sail along the coast towards the red sea where we should first or last find a ship of some nation or other that would take us up or perhaps we might take them up which bythebye was the thing that always ran in my head  it was our ingenious cutler whom ever after we called silversmith that proposed this but the gunner told him that he had been in the red sea in a malabar sloop and he knew this that if we went into the red sea we should either be killed by the wild arabs or taken and made slaves of by the turks and therefore he was not for going that way  upon this i took occasion to put in my vote again why said i do we talk of being killed by the arabs or made slaves of by the turks are we not able to board almost any vessel we shall meet with in those seas and instead of their taking us we to take them well done pirate said the gunner he that had looked in my hand and told me i should come to the gallows ill say that for him says he he always looks the same way but i think of my conscience it is our only way now dont tell me says i of being a pirate we must be pirates or anything to get fairly out of this cursed place  in a word they concluded all by my advice that our business was to cruise for anything we could see why then said i to them our first business is to see if the people upon this island have no navigation and what boats they use and if they have any better or bigger than ours let us take one of them first indeed all our aim was to get if possible a boat with a deck and a sail for then we might have saved our provisions which otherwise we could not  we had to our great good fortune one sailor among us who had been assistant to the cook he told us that he would find a way how to preserve our beef without cask or pickle and this he did effectually by curing it in the sun with the help of saltpetre of which there was great plenty in the island so that before we found any method for our escape we had dried the flesh of six or seven cows and bullocks and ten or twelve goats and it relished so well that we never gave ourselves the trouble to boil it when we ate it but either broiled it or ate it dry but our main difficulty about fresh water still remained for we had no vessel to put any into much less to keep any for our going to sea  but our first voyage being only to coast the island we resolved to venture whatever the hazard or consequence of it might be and in order to preserve as much fresh water as we could our carpenter made a well athwart the middle of one of our canoes which he separated from the other parts of the canoe so as to make it tight to hold the water and covered so as we might step upon it and this was so large that it held near a hogshead of water very well i cannot better describe this well than by the same kind which the small fishingboats in england have to preserve their fish alive in only that this instead of having holes to let the salt water in was made sound every way to keep it out and it was the first invention i believe of its kind for such an use but necessity is a spur to ingenuity and the mother of invention  it wanted but a little consultation to resolve now upon our voyage the first design was only to coast it round the island as well to see if we could seize upon any vessel fit to embark ourselves in as also to take hold of any opportunity which might present for our passing over to the main and therefore our resolution was to go on the inside or west shore of the island where at least at one point the land stretching a great way to the northwest the distance is not extraordinary great from the island to the coast of africa  such a voyage and with such a desperate crew i believe was never made for it is certain we took the worst side of the island to look for any shipping especially for shipping of other nations this being quite out of the way however we put to sea after taking all our provisions and ammunition bag and baggage on board we had made both mast and sail for our two large periaguas and the other we paddled along as well as we could but when a gale sprung up we took her in tow  we sailed merrily forward for several days meeting with nothing to interrupt us we saw several of the natives in small canoes catching fish and sometimes we endeavoured to come near enough to speak with them but they were always shy and afraid of us making in for the shore as soon as we attempted it till one of our company remembered the signal of friendship which the natives made us from the south part of the island viz of setting up a long pole and put us in mind that perhaps it was the same thing to them as a flag of truce to us so we resolved to try it and accordingly the next time we saw any of their fishingboats at sea we put up a pole in our canoe that had no sail and rowed towards them as soon as they saw the pole they stayed for us and as we came nearer paddled towards us when they came to us they showed themselves very much pleased and gave us some large fish of which we did not know the names but they were very good it was our misfortune still that we had nothing to give them in return but our artist of whom i spoke before gave them two little thin plates of silver beaten as i said before out of a piece of eight they were cut in a diamond square longer one way than the other and a hole punched at one of the longest corners this they were so fond of that they made us stay till they had cast their lines and nets again and gave us as many fish as we cared to have  all this while we had our eyes upon their boats viewed them very narrowly and examined whether any of them were fit for our turn but they were poor sorry things their sail was made of a large mat only one that was of a piece of cotton stuff fit for little and their ropes were twisted flags of no strength so we concluded we were better as we were and let them alone we went forward to the north keeping the coast close on board for twelve days together and having the wind at east and ese we made very fresh way we saw no towns on the shore but often saw some huts by the waterside upon the rocks and always abundance of people about them who we could perceive run together to stare at us  it was as odd a voyage as ever man went we were a little fleet of three ships and an army of between twenty and thirty as dangerous fellows as ever they had amongst them and had they known what we were they would have compounded to give us everything we desired to be rid of us  on the other hand we were as miserable as nature could well make us to be for we were upon a voyage and no voyage we were bound somewhere and nowhere for though we knew what we intended to do we did really not know what we were doing we went forward and forward by a northerly course and as we advanced the heat increased which began to be intolerable to us who were on the water without any covering from heat or wet besides we were now in the month of october or thereabouts in a southern latitude and as we went every day nearer the sun the sun came also every day nearer to us till at last we found ourselves in the latitude of 20 degrees and having passed the tropic about five or six days before that in a few days more the sun would be in the zenith just over our heads  upon these considerations we resolved to seek for a good place to go on shore again and pitch our tents till the heat of the weather abated we had by this time measured half the length of the island and were come to that part where the shore tending away to the northwest promised fair to make our passage over to the mainland of africa much shorter than we expected but notwithstanding that we had good reason to believe it was about 120 leagues  so the heats considered we resolved to take harbour besides our provisions were exhausted and we had not many days store left accordingly putting in for the shore early in the morning as we usually did once in three or four days for fresh water we sat down and considered whether we would go on or take up our standing there but upon several considerations too long to repeat here we did not like the place so we resolved to go on a few days longer  after sailing on nw by n with a fresh gale at se about six days we found at a great distance a large promontory or cape of land pushing out a long way into the sea and as we were exceeding fond of seeing what was beyond the cape we resolved to double it before we took into harbour so we kept on our way the gale continuing and yet it was four days more before we reached the cape but it is not possible to express the discouragement and melancholy that seized us all when we came thither for when we made the headland of the cape we were surprised to see the shore fall away on the other side as much as it had advanced on this side and a great deal more and that in short if we would venture over to the shore of africa it must be from hence for that if we went further the breadth of the sea still increased and to what breadth it might increase we knew not  while we mused upon this discovery we were surprised with very bad weather and especially violent rains with thunder and lightning most unusually terrible to us in this pickle we run for the shore and getting under the lee of the cape run our frigates into a little creek where we saw the land overgrown with trees and made all the haste possible to get on shore being exceeding wet and fatigued with the heat the thunder lightning and rain  here we thought our case was very deplorable indeed and therefore our artist of whom i have spoken so often set up a great cross of wood on the hill which was within a mile of the headland with these words but in the portuguese language  point desperation jesus have mercy  we set to work immediately to build us some huts and to get our clothes dried and though i was young and had no skill in such things yet i shall never forget the little city we built for it was no less and we fortified it accordingly and the idea is so fresh in my thought that i cannot but give a short description of it  our camp was on the south side of a little creek on the sea and under the shelter of a steep hill which lay though on the other side of the creek yet within a quarter of a mile of us nw by n and very happily intercepted the heat of the sun all the after part of the day the spot we pitched on had a little fresh water brook or a stream running into the creek by us and we saw cattle feeding in the plains and low ground east and to the south of us a great way  here we set up twelve little huts like soldiers tents but made of the boughs of trees stuck in the ground and bound together on the top with withies and such other things as we could get the creek was our defence on the north a little brook on the west and the south and east sides were fortified with a bank which entirely covered our huts and being drawn oblique from the northwest to the southeast made our city a triangle behind the bank or line our huts stood having three other huts behind them at a good distance in one of these which was a little one and stood further off we put our gunpowder and nothing else for fear of danger in the other which was bigger we dressed our victuals and put all our necessaries and in the third which was biggest of all we ate our dinners called our councils and sat and diverted ourselves with such conversation as we had one with another which was but indifferent truly at that time  our correspondence with the natives was absolutely necessary and our artist the cutler having made abundance of those little diamondcut squares of silver with these we made shift to traffic with the black people for what we wanted for indeed they were pleased wonderfully with them and thus we got plenty of provisions at first and in particular we got about fifty head of black cattle and goats and our cooks mate took care to cure them and dry them salt and preserve them for our grand supply nor was this hard to do the salt and saltpetre being very good and the sun excessively hot and here we lived about four months  the southern solstice was over and the sun gone back towards the equinoctial when we considered of our next adventure which was to go over the sea of zanguebar as the portuguese call it and to land if possible upon the continent of africa  we talked with many of the natives about it such as we could make ourselves intelligible to but all that we could learn from them was that there was a great land of lions beyond the sea but that it was a great way off we knew as well as they that it was a long way but our people differed mightily about it some said it was 150 leagues others not above 100 one of our men that had a map of the world showed us by his scale that it was not above eighty leagues some said there were islands all the way to touch at some that there were no islands at all for my own part i knew nothing of this matter one way or another but heard it all without concern whether it was near or far off however this we learned from an old man who was blind and led about by a boy that if we stayed till the end of august we should be sure of the wind to be fair and the sea smooth all the voyage  this was some encouragement but staying again was very unwelcome news to us because that then the sun would be returning again to the south which was what our men were very unwilling to at last we called a council of our whole body their debates were too tedious to take notice of only to note that when it came to captain bob for so they called me ever since i had taken state upon me before one of their great princes truly i was on no side it was not one farthing matter to me i told them whether we went or stayed i had no home and all the world was alike to me so i left it entirely to them to determine  in a word they saw plainly there was nothing to be done where we were without shipping that if our business indeed was only to eat and drink we could not find a better place in the world but if our business was to get away and get home into our country we could not find a worse  i confess i liked the country wonderfully and even then had strange notions of coming again to live there and i used to say to them very often that if i had but a ship of twenty guns and a sloop and both well manned i would not desire a better place in the world to make myself as rich as a king  but to return to the consultations they were in about going upon the whole it was resolved to venture over for the main and venture we did madly enough indeed for it was the wrong time of the year to undertake such a voyage in that country for as the winds hang easterly all the months from september to march so they generally hang westerly all the rest of the year and blew right in our teeth so that as soon as we had with a kind of a landbreeze stretched over about fifteen or twenty leagues and as i may say just enough to lose ourselves we found the wind set in a steady fresh gale or breeze from the sea at west wsw or sw by w and never further from the west so that in a word we could make nothing of it  on the other hand the vessel such as we had would not lie close upon a wind if so we might have stretched away nnw and have met with a great many islands in our way as we found afterwards but we could make nothing of it though we tried and by the trying had almost undone us all for stretching away to the north as near the wind as we could we had forgotten the shape and position of the island of madagascar itself how that we came off at the head of a promontory or point of land that lies about the middle of the island and that stretches out west a great way into the sea and that now being run a matter of forty leagues to the north the shore of the island fell off again above 200 miles to the east so that we were by this time in the wide ocean between the island and the main and almost 100 leagues from both  indeed as the winds blew fresh at west as before we had a smooth sea and we found it pretty good going before it and so taking our smallest canoe in tow we stood in for the shore with all the sail we could make this was a terrible adventure for if the least gust of wind had come we had been all lost our canoes being deep and in no condition to make way in a high sea  this voyage however held us eleven days in all and at length having spent most of our provisions and every drop of water we had we spied land to our great joy though at the distance of ten or eleven leagues and as under the land the wind came off like a landbreeze and blew hard against us we were two days more before we reached the shore having all that while excessive hot weather and not a drop of water or any other liquor except some cordial waters which one of our company had a little of left in a case of bottles  this gave us a taste of what we should have done if we had ventured forward with a scant wind and uncertain weather and gave us a surfeit of our design for the main at least until we might have some better vessels under us so we went on shore again and pitched our camp as before in as convenient manner as we could fortifying ourselves against any surprise but the natives here were exceeding courteous and much more civil than on the south part of the island and though we could not understand what they said or they us yet we found means to make them understand that we were seafaring men and strangers and that we were in distress for want of provisions  the first proof we had of their kindness was that as soon as they saw us come on shore and begin to make our habitation one of their captains or kings for we knew not what to call them came down with five or six men and some women and brought us five goats and two young fat steers and gave them to us for nothing and when we went to offer them anything the captain or the king would not let any of them touch it or take anything of us about two hours after came another king or captain with forty or fifty men after him we began to be afraid of him and laid hands upon our weapons but he perceiving it caused two men to go before him carrying two long poles in their hands which they held upright as high as they could which we presently perceived was a signal of peace and these two poles they set up afterwards sticking them up in the ground and when the king and his men came to these two poles they struck all their lances up in the ground and came on unarmed leaving their lances as also their bows and arrows behind them  this was to satisfy us that they were come as friends and we were glad to see it for we had no mind to quarrel with them if we could help it the captain of this gang seeing some of our men making up their huts and that they did it but bunglingly he beckoned to some of his men to go and help us immediately fifteen or sixteen of them came and mingled among us and went to work for us and indeed they were better workmen than we were for they run up three or four huts for us in a moment and much handsomer done than ours  after this they sent us milk plantains pumpkins and abundance of roots and greens that were very good and then took their leave and would not take anything from us that we had one of our men offered the king or captain of these men a dram which he drank and was mightily pleased with it and held out his hand for another which we gave him and in a word after this he hardly failed coming to us two or three times a week always bringing us something or other and one time sent us seven head of black cattle some of which we cured and dried as before  and here i cannot but remember one thing which afterwards stood us in great stead viz that the flesh of their goats and their beef also but especially the former when we had dried and cured it looked red and ate hard and firm as dried beef in holland they were so pleased with it and it was such a dainty to them that at any time after they would trade with us for it not knowing or so much as imagining what it was so that for ten or twelve pounds weight of smokedried beef they would give us a whole bullock or cow or anything else we could desire  here we observed two things that were very material to us even essentially so first we found they had a great deal of earthenware here which they made use of many ways as we did particularly they had long deep earthen pots which they used to sink into the ground to keep the water which they drunk cool and pleasant and the other was that they had larger canoes than their neighbours had  by this we were prompted to inquire if they had no larger vessels than those we saw there or if any other of the inhabitants had not such they signified presently that they had no larger boats than that they showed us but that on the other side of the island they had larger boats and that with decks upon them and large sails and this made us resolve to coast round the whole island to see them so we prepared and victualled our canoe for the voyage and in a word went to sea for the third time  it cost us a month or six weeks time to perform this voyage in which time we went on shore several times for water and provisions and found the natives always very free and courteous but we were surprised one morning early being at the extremity of the northernmost part of the island when one of our men cried out a sail a sail we presently saw a vessel a great way out at sea but after we had looked at it with our perspective glasses and endeavoured all we could to make out what it was we could not tell what to think of it for it was neither ship ketch galley galliot or like anything that we had ever seen before all that we could make of it was that it went from us standing out to sea in a word we soon lost sight of it for we were in no condition to chase anything and we never saw it again but by all that we could perceive of it from what we saw of such things afterwards it was some arabian vessel which had been trading to the coast of mozambique or zanzibar the same place where we afterwards went as you shall hear  i kept no journal of this voyage nor indeed did i all this while understand anything of navigation more than the common business of a foremastman so i can say nothing to the latitudes or distances of any places we were at how long we were going or how far we sailed in a day but this i remember that being now come round the island we sailed up the eastern shore due south as we had done down the western shore due north before  nor do i remember that the natives differed much from one another either in stature or complexion or in their manners their habits their weapons or indeed in anything and yet we could not perceive that they had any intelligence one with another but they were extremely kind and civil to us on this side as well as on the other  we continued our voyage south for many weeks though with several intervals of going on shore to get provisions and water at length coming round a point of land which lay about a league further than ordinary into the sea we were agreeably surprised with a sight which no doubt had been as disagreeable to those concerned as it was pleasant to us this was the wreck of an european ship which had been cast away upon the rocks which in that place run a great way into the sea  we could see plainly at low water a great deal of the ship lay dry even at high water she was not entirely covered and that at most she did not lie above a league from the shore it will easily be believed that our curiosity led us the wind and weather also permitting to go directly to her which we did without any difficulty and presently found that it was a dutchbuilt ship and that she could not have been very long in that condition a great deal of the upper work of her stern remaining firm with the mizzenmast standing her stern seemed to be jammed in between two ridges of the rock and so remained fast all the fore part of the ship having been beaten to pieces  we could see nothing to be gotten out of the wreck that was worth our while but we resolved to go on shore and stay some time thereabouts to see if perhaps we might get any light into the story of her and we were not without hopes that we might hear something more particular about her men and perhaps find some of them on shore there in the same condition that we were in and so might increase our company  it was a very pleasant sight to us when coming on shore we saw all the marks and tokens of a shipcarpenters yard as a launchblock and cradles scaffolds and planks and pieces of planks the remains of the building a ship or vessel and in a word a great many things that fairly invited us to go about the same work and we soon came to understand that the men belonging to the ship that was lost had saved themselves on shore perhaps in their boat and had built themselves a barque or sloop and so were gone to sea again and inquiring of the natives which way they went they pointed to the south and southwest by which we could easily understand they were gone away to the cape of good hope  nobody will imagine we could be so dull as not to gather from hence that we might take the same method for our escape so we resolved first in general that we would try if possible to build us a boat of one kind or other and go to sea as our fate should direct  in order to this our first work was to have the two carpenters search about to see what materials the dutchmen had left behind them that might be of use and in particular they found one that was very useful and which i was much employed about and that was a pitchkettle and a little pitch in it  when we came to set close to this work we found it very laborious and difficult having but few tools no ironwork no cordage no sails so that in short whatever we built we were obliged to be our own smiths ropemakers sailmakers and indeed to practise twenty trades that we knew little or nothing of however necessity was the spur to invention and we did many things which before we thought impracticable that is to say in our circumstances  after our two carpenters had resolved upon the dimensions of what they would build they set us all to work to go off in our boats and split up the wreck of the old ship and to bring away everything we could and particularly that if possible we should bring away the mizzenmast which was left standing which with much difficulty we effected after above twenty days labour of fourteen of our men  at the same time we got out a great deal of ironwork as bolts spikes nails c all of which our artist of whom i have spoken already who was now grown a very dexterous smith made us nails and hinges for our rudder and spikes such as we wanted  but we wanted an anchor and if we had had an anchor we could not have made a cable so we contented ourselves with making some ropes with the help of the natives of such stuff as they made their mats of and with these we made such a kind of cable or towline as was sufficient to fasten our vessel to the shore which we contented ourselves with for that time  to be short we spent four months here and worked very hard too at the end of which time we launched our frigate which in a few words had many defects but yet all things considered it was as well as we could expect it to be  in short it was a kind of sloop of the burthen of near eighteen or twenty tons and had we had masts and sails standing and running rigging as is usual in such cases and other conveniences the vessel might have carried us wherever we could have had a mind to go but of all the materials we wanted this was the worst viz that we had no tar or pitch to pay the seams and secure the bottom and though we did what we could with tallow and oil to make a mixture to supply that part yet we could not bring it to answer our end fully and when we launched her into the water she was so leaky and took in the water so fast that we thought all our labour had been lost for we had much ado to make her swim and as for pumps we had none nor had we any means to make one  but at length one of the natives a black negroman showed us a tree the wood of which being put into the fire sends forth a liquid that is as glutinous and almost as strong as tar and of which by boiling we made a sort of stuff which served us for pitch and this answered our end effectually for we perfectly made our vessel sound and tight so that we wanted no pitch or tar at all this secret has stood me in stead upon many occasions since that time in the same place  our vessel being thus finished out of the mizzenmast of the ship we made a very good mast to her and fitted our sails to it as well as we could then we made a rudder and tiller and in a word everything that our present necessity called upon us for and having victualled her and put as much fresh water on board as we thought we wanted or as we knew how to stow for we were yet without casks we put to sea with a fair wind  we had spent near another year in these rambles and in this piece of work for it was now as our men said about the beginning of our february and the sun went from us apace which was much to our satisfaction for the heats were exceedingly violent the wind as i said was fair for as i have since learned the winds generally spring up to the eastward as the sun goes from them to the north  our debate now was which way we should go and never were men so irresolute some were for going to the east and stretching away directly for the coast of malabar but others who considered more seriously the length of that voyage shook their heads at the proposal knowing very well that neither our provisions especially of water or our vessel were equal to such a run as that is of near 2000 miles without any land to touch at in the way  these men too had all along had a great mind to a voyage for the mainland of africa where they said we should have a fair cast for our lives and might be sure to make ourselves rich which way soever we went if we were but able to make our way through whether by sea or by land  besides as the case stood with us we had not much choice for our way for if we had resolved for the east we were at the wrong season of the year and must have stayed till april or may before we had gone to sea at length as we had the wind at se and ese and fine promising weather we came all into the first proposal and resolved for the coast of africa nor were we long in disputing as to our coasting the island which we were upon for we were now upon the wrong side of the island for the voyage we intended so we stood away to the north and having rounded the cape we hauled away southward under the lee of the island thinking to reach the west point of land which as i observed before runs out so far towards the coast of africa as would have shortened our run almost 100 leagues but when we had sailed about thirty leagues we found the winds variable under the shore and right against us so we concluded to stand over directly for then we had the wind fair and our vessel was but very ill fated to lie near the wind or any way indeed but just before it  having resolved upon it therefore we put into the shore to furnish ourselves again with fresh water and other provisions and about the latter end of march with more courage than discretion more resolution than judgment we launched for the main coast of africa  as for me i had no anxieties about it so that we had but a view of reaching some land or other i cared not what or where it was to be having at this time no views of what was before me nor much thought of what might or might not befall me but with as little consideration as any one can be supposed to have at my age i consented to everything that was proposed however hazardous the thing itself however improbable the success  the voyage as it was undertaken with a great deal of ignorance and desperation so really it was not carried on with much resolution or judgment for we knew no more of the course we were to steer than this that it was anywhere about the west within two or three points n or s and as we had no compass with us but a little brass pocket compass which one of our men had more by accident than otherwise so we could not be very exact in our course  however as it pleased god that the wind continued fair at se and by e we found that nw by w which was right afore it was as good a course for us as any we could go and thus we went on  the voyage was much longer than we expected our vessel also which had no sail that was proportioned to her made but very little way in the sea and sailed heavily we had indeed no great adventures happened in this voyage being out of the way of everything that could offer to divert us and as for seeing any vessel we had not the least occasion to hail anything in all the voyage for we saw not one vessel small or great the sea we were upon being entirely out of the way of all commerce for the people of madagascar knew no more of the shores of africa than we did only that there was a country of lions as they call it that way  we had been eight or nine days under sail with a fair wind when to our great joy one of our men cried out land we had great reason to be glad of the discovery for we had not water enough left for above two or three days more though at a short allowance however though it was early in the morning when we discovered it we made it near night before we reached it the wind slackening almost to a calm and our ship being as i said a very dull sailer  we were sadly baulked upon our coming to the land when we found that instead of the mainland of africa it was only a little island with no inhabitants upon it at least none that we could find nor any cattle except a few goats of which we killed three only however they served us for fresh meat and we found very good water and it was fifteen days more before we reached the main which however at last we arrived at and which was most essential to us as we came to it just as all our provisions were spent indeed we may say they were spent first for we had but a pint of water a day to each man for the last two days but to our great joy we saw the land though at a great distance the evening before and by a pleasant gale in the night were by morning within two leagues of the shore  we never scrupled going ashore at the first place we came at though had we had patience we might have found a very fine river a little farther north however we kept our frigate on float by the help of two great poles which we fastened into the ground to moor her like poles and the little weak ropes which as i said we had made of matting served us well enough to make the vessel fast  as soon as we had viewed the country a little got fresh water and furnished ourselves with some victuals which we found very scarce here we went on board again with our stores all we got for provision was some fowls that we killed and a kind of wild buffalo or bull very small but good meat i say having got these things on board we resolved to sail along the coast which lay nne till we found some creek or river that we might run up into the country or some town or people for we had reason enough to know the place was inhabited because we several times saw fires in the night and smoke in the day every way at a distance from us  at length we came to a very large bay and in it several little creeks or rivers emptying themselves into the sea and we ran boldly into the first creek we came at where seeing some huts and wild people about them on the shore we ran our vessel into a little cove on the north side of the creek and held up a long pole with a white bit of cloth on it for a signal of peace to them we found they understood us presently for they came flocking to us men women and children most of them of both sexes stark naked at first they stood wondering and staring at us as if we had been monsters and as if they had been frighted but we found they inclined to be familiar with us afterwards the first thing we did to try them was we held up our hands to our mouths as if we were to drink signifying that we wanted water this they understood presently and three of their women and two boys ran away up the land and came back in about half a quarter of an hour with several pots made of earth pretty enough and baked i suppose in the sun these they brought us full of water and set them down near the seashore and there left them going back a little that we might fetch them which we did  some time after this they brought us roots and herbs and some fruits which i cannot remember and gave us but as we had nothing to give them we found them not so free as the people in madagascar were however our cutler went to work and as he had saved some iron out of the wreck of the ship he made abundance of toys birds dogs pins hooks and rings and we helped to file them and make them bright for him and when we gave them some of these they brought us all sorts of provisions they had such as goats hogs and cows and we got victuals enough  we were now landed upon the continent of africa the most desolate desert and inhospitable country in the world even greenland and nova zembla itself not excepted with this difference only that even the worst part of it we found inhabited though taking the nature and quality of some of the inhabitants it might have been much better to us if there had been none  and to add to the exclamation i am making on the nature of the place it was here that we took one of the rashest and wildest and most desperate resolutions that ever was taken by man or any number of men in the world this was to travel overland through the heart of the country from the coast of mozambique on the east ocean to the coast of angola or guinea on the western or atlantic ocean a continent of land of at least 1800 miles in which journey we had excessive heats to support unpassable deserts to go over no carriages camels or beasts of any kind to carry our baggage innumerable numbers of wild and ravenous beasts to encounter with such as lions leopards tigers lizards and elephants we had the equinoctial line to pass under and consequently were in the very centre of the torrid zone we had nations of savages to encounter with barbarous and brutish to the last degree hunger and thirst to struggle with and in one word terrors enough to have daunted the stoutest hearts that ever were placed in cases of flesh and blood  yet fearless of all these we resolved to adventure and accordingly made such preparations for our journey as the place we were in would allow us and such as our little experience of the country seemed to dictate to us  it had been some time already that we had been used to tread barefooted upon the rocks the gravel the grass and the sand on the shore but as we found the worst thing for our feet was the walking or travelling on the dry burning sands within the country so we provided ourselves with a sort of shoes made of the skins of wild beasts with the hair inward and being dried in the sun the outsides were thick and hard and would last a great while in short as i called them so i think the term very proper still we made us gloves for our feet and we found them very convenient and very comfortable  we conversed with some of the natives of the country who were friendly enough what tongue they spoke i do not yet pretend to know we talked as far as we could make them understand us not only about our provisions but also about our undertaking and asked them what country lay that way pointing west with our hands they told us but little to our purpose only we thought by all their discourse that there were people to be found of one sort or other everywhere that there were many great rivers many lions and tigers elephants and furious wild cats which in the end we found to be civet cats and the like  when we asked them if any one had ever travelled that way they told us yes some had gone to where the sun sleeps meaning to the west but they could not tell us who they were when we asked for some to guide us they shrunk up their shoulders as frenchmen do when they are afraid to undertake a thing when we asked them about the lions and wild creatures they laughed and let us know that they would do us no hurt and directed us to a good way indeed to deal with them and that was to make some fire which would always fright them away and so indeed we found it  upon these encouragements we resolved upon our journey and many considerations put us upon it which had the thing itself been practicable we were not so much to blame for as it might otherwise be supposed i will name some of them not to make the account too tedious  first we were perfectly destitute of means to work about our own deliverance any other way we were on shore in a place perfectly remote from all european navigation so that we could never think of being relieved and fetched off by any of our own countrymen in that part of the world secondly if we had adventured to have sailed on along the coast of mozambique and the desolate shores of africa to the north till we came to the red sea all we could hope for there was to be taken by the arabs and be sold for slaves to the turks which to all of us was little better than death we could not build anything of a vessel that would carry us over the great arabian sea to india nor could we reach the cape de bona speranza the winds being too variable and the sea in that latitude too tempestuous but we all knew if we could cross this continent of land we might reach some of the great rivers that run into the atlantic ocean and that on the banks of any of those rivers we might there build us canoes which would carry us down if it were thousands of miles so that we could want nothing but food of which we were assured we might kill sufficient with our guns and to add to the satisfaction of our deliverance we concluded we might every one of us get a quantity of gold which if we came safe would infinitely recompense us for our toil  i cannot say that in all our consultations i ever began to enter into the weight and merit of any enterprise we went upon till now my view before was as i thought very good viz that we should get into the arabian gulf or the mouth of the red sea and waiting for some vessel passing or repassing there of which there is plenty have seized upon the first we came at by force and not only have enriched ourselves with her cargo but have carried ourselves to what part of the world we had pleased but when they came to talk to me of a march of 2000 or 3000 miles on foot of wandering in deserts among lions and tigers i confess my blood ran chill and i used all the arguments i could to persuade them against it  but they were all positive and i might as well have held my tongue so i submitted and told them i would keep to our first law to be governed by the majority and we resolved upon our journey the first thing we did was to take an observation and see whereabouts in the world we were which we did and found we were in the latitude of 12 degrees 35 minutes south of the line the next thing was to look on the charts and see the coast of the country we aimed at which we found to be from 8 to 11 degrees south latitude if we went for the coast of angola or in 12 to 29 degrees north latitude if we made for the river niger and the coast of guinea  our aim was for the coast of angola which by the charts we had lying very near the same latitude we were then in our course thither was due west and as we were assured we should meet with rivers we doubted not but that by their help we might ease our journey especially if we could find means to cross the great lake or inland sea which the natives call coalmucoa out of which it is said the river nile has its source or beginning but we reckoned without our host as you will see in the sequel of our story  the next thing we had to consider was how to carry our baggage which we were first of all determined not to travel without neither indeed was it possible for us to do so for even our ammunition which was absolutely necessary to us and on which our subsistence i mean for food as well as our safety and particularly our defence against wild beasts and wild men dependedi say even our ammunition was a load too heavy for us to carry in a country where the heat was such that we should be load enough for ourselves  we inquired in the country and found there was no beast of burthen known among them that is to say neither horses or mules or asses camels or dromedaries the only creature they had was a kind of buffalo or tame bull such a one as we had killed and that some of these they had brought so to their hand that they taught them to go and come with their voices as they called them to them or sent them from them that they made them carry burthens and particularly that they would swim over rivers and lakes upon them the creatures swimming very high and strong in the water  but we understood nothing of the management of guiding such a creature or how to bind a burthen upon them and this last part of our consultation puzzled us extremely at last i proposed a method for them which after some consideration they found very convenient and this was to quarrel with some of the negro natives take ten or twelve of them prisoners and binding them as slaves cause them to travel with us and make them carry our baggage which i alleged would be convenient and useful many ways as well to show us the way as to converse with other natives for us  this counsel was not accepted at first but the natives soon gave them reason to approve it and also gave them an opportunity to put it in practice for as our little traffic with the natives was hitherto upon the faith of their first kindness we found some knavery among them at last for having bought some cattle of them for our toys which as i said our cutler had contrived one of our men differing with his chapman truly they huffed him in their manner and keeping the things he had offered them for the cattle made their fellows drive away the cattle before his face and laugh at him our man crying out loud of this violence and calling to some of us who were not far off the negro he was dealing with threw a lance at him which came so true that if he had not with great agility jumped aside and held up his hand also to turn the lance as it came it had struck through his body and as it was it wounded him in the arm at which the man enraged took up his fuzee and shot the negro through the heart  the others that were near him and all those that were with us at a distance were so terribly frighted first at the flash of fire secondly at the noise and thirdly at seeing their countryman killed that they stood like men stupid and amazed at first for some time but after they were a little recovered from their fright one of them at a good distance from us set up a sudden screaming noise which it seems is the noise they make when they go to fight and all the rest understanding what he meant answered him and ran together to the place where he was and we not knowing what it meant stood still looking upon one another like a parcel of fools  but we were presently undeceived for in two or three minutes more we heard the screaming roaring noise go on from one place to another through all their little towns nay even over the creek to the other side and on a sudden we saw a naked multitude running from all parts to the place where the first man began it as to a rendezvous and in less than an hour i believe there was near 500 of them gotten together armed some with bows and arrows but most with lances which they throw at a good distance so nicely that they will strike a bird flying  we had but a very little time for consultation for the multitude was increasing every moment and i verily believe if we had stayed long they would have been 10000 together in a little time we had nothing to do therefore but to fly to our ship or bark where indeed we could have defended ourselves very well or to advance and try what a volley or two of small shot would do for us  we resolved immediately upon the latter depending upon it that the fire and terror of our shot would soon put them to flight so we drew up all in a line and marched boldly up to them they stood ready to meet us depending i suppose to destroy us all with their lances but before we came near enough for them to throw their lances we halted and standing at a good distance from one another to stretch our line as far as we could we gave them a salute with our shot which besides what we wounded that we knew not of knocked sixteen of them down upon the spot and three more were so lamed that they fell about twenty or thirty yards from them  as soon as we had fired they set up the horridest yell or howling partly raised by those that were wounded and partly by those that pitied and condoled the bodies they saw lie dead that i never heard anything like it before or since  we stood stock still after we had fired to load our guns again and finding they did not stir from the place we fired among them again we killed about nine of them at the second fire but as they did not stand so thick as before all our men did not fire seven of us being ordered to reserve our charge and to advance as soon as the other had fired while the rest loaded again of which i shall speak again presently  as soon as we had fired the second volley we shouted as loud as we could and the seven men advanced upon them and coming about twenty yards nearer fired again and those that were behind having loaded again with all expedition followed but when they saw us advance they ran screaming away as if they were bewitched  when we came up to the field of battle we saw a great number of bodies lying upon the ground many more than we could suppose were killed or wounded nay more than we had bullets in our pieces when we fired and we could not tell what to make of it but at length we found how it was viz that they were frighted out of all manner of sense nay i do believe several of those that were really dead were frighted to death and had no wound about them  of those that were thus frighted as i have said several of them as they recovered themselves came and worshipped us taking us for gods or devils i know not which nor did it much matter to us some kneeling some throwing themselves flat on the ground made a thousand antic gestures but all with tokens of the most profound submission it presently came into my head that we might now by the law of arms take as many prisoners as we would and make them travel with us and carry our baggage as soon as i proposed it our men were all of my mind and accordingly we secured about sixty lusty young fellows and let them know they must go with us which they seemed very willing to do but the next question we had among ourselves was how we should do to trust them for we found the people not like those of madagascar but fierce revengeful and treacherous for which reason we were sure that we should have no service from them but that of mere slaves no subjection that would continue any longer than the fear of us was upon them nor any labour but by violence  before i go any farther i must hint to the reader that from this time forward i began to enter a little more seriously into the circumstance i was in and concerned myself more in the conduct of our affairs for though my comrades were all older men yet i began to find them void of counsel or as i now call it presence of mind when they came to the execution of a thing the first occasion i took to observe this was in their late engagement with the natives when though they had taken a good resolution to attack them and fire upon them yet when they had fired the first time and found that the negroes did not run as they expected their hearts began to fail and i am persuaded if their bark had been near hand they would every man have run away  upon this occasion i began to take upon me a little to hearten them up and to call upon them to load again and give them another volley telling them that i would engage if they would be ruled by me id make the negroes run fast enough i found this heartened them and therefore when they fired a second time i desired them to reserve some of their shot for an attempt by itself as i mentioned above  having fired a second time i was indeed forced to command as i may call it now seigniors said i let us give them a cheer so i opened my throat and shouted three times as our english sailors do on like occasions and now follow me said i to the seven that had not fired and ill warrant you we will make work with them and so it proved indeed for as soon as they saw us coming away they ran as above  from this day forward they would call me nothing but seignior capitanio but i told them i would not be called seignior well then said the gunner who spoke good english you shall be called captain bob and so they gave me my title ever after  nothing is more certain of the portuguese than this take them nationally or personally if they are animated and heartened up by anybody to go before and encourage them by example they will behave well enough but if they have nothing but their own measures to follow they sink immediately these men had certainly fled from a parcel of naked savages though even by flying they could not have saved their lives if i had not shouted and hallooed and rather made sport with the thing than a fight to keep up their courage  nor was there less need of it upon several occasions hereafter and i do confess i have often wondered how a number of men who when they came to the extremity were so ill supported by their own spirits had at first courage to propose and to undertake the most desperate and impracticable attempt that ever men went about in the world  there were indeed two or three indefatigable men among them by whose courage and industry all the rest were upheld and indeed those two or three were the managers of them from the beginning that was the gunner and that cutler whom i call the artist and the third who was pretty well though not like either of them was one of the carpenters these indeed were the life and soul of all the rest and it was to their courage that all the rest owed the resolution they showed upon any occasion but when those saw me take a little upon me as above they embraced me and treated me with particular affection ever after  this gunner was an excellent mathematician a good scholar and a complete sailor and it was in conversing intimately with him that i learned afterwards the grounds of what knowledge i have since had in all the sciences useful for navigation and particularly in the geographical part of knowledge  even in our conversation finding me eager to understand and learn he laid the foundation of a general knowledge of things in my mind gave me just ideas of the form of the earth and of the sea the situation of countries the course of rivers the doctrine of the spheres the motion of the stars and in a word taught me a kind of system of astronomy which i afterwards improved  in an especial manner he filled my head with aspiring thoughts and with an earnest desire after learning everything that could be taught me convincing me that nothing could qualify me for great undertakings but a degree of learning superior to what was usual in the race of seamen he told me that to be ignorant was to be certain of a mean station in the world but that knowledge was the first step to preferment he was always flattering me with my capacity to learn and though that fed my pride yet on the other hand as i had a secret ambition which just at that time fed itself in my mind it prompted in me an insatiable thirst after learning in general and i resolved if ever i came back to europe and had anything left to purchase it i would make myself master of all the parts of learning needful to the making of me a complete sailor but i was not so just to myself afterwards as to do it when i had an opportunity  but to return to our business the gunner when he saw the service i had done in the fight and heard my proposal for keeping a number of prisoners for our march and for carrying our baggage turns to me before them all captain bob says he i think you must be our leader for all the success of this enterprise is owing to you no no said i do not compliment me you shall be our seignior capitanio you shall be general i am too young for it so in short we all agreed he should be our leader but he would not accept of it alone but would have me joined with him and all the rest agreeing i was obliged to comply  the first piece of service they put me upon in this new command was as difficult as any they could think of and that was to manage the prisoners which however i cheerfully undertook as you shall hear presently but the immediate consultation was yet of more consequence and that was first which way we should go and secondly how to furnish ourselves for the voyage with provisions  there was among the prisoners one tall wellshaped handsome fellow to whom the rest seemed to pay great respect and who as we understood afterwards was the son of one of their kings his father was it seems killed at our first volley and he wounded with a shot in his arm and with another just on one of his hips or haunches the shot in his haunch being in a fleshy part bled much and he was half dead with the loss of blood as to the shot in his arm it had broke his wrist and he was by both these wounds quite disabled so that we were once going to turn him away and let him die and if we had he would have died indeed in a few days more but as i found the man had some respect showed him it presently occurred to my thoughts that we might bring him to be useful to us and perhaps make him a kind of commander over them so i caused our surgeon to take him in hand and gave the poor wretch good words that is to say i spoke to him as well as i could by signs to make him understand that we would make him well again  this created a new awe in their minds of us believing that as we could kill at a distance by something invisible to them for so our shot was to be sure so we could make them well again too upon this the young prince for so we called him afterwards called six or seven of the savages to him and said something to them what it was we know not but immediately all the seven came to me and kneeled down to me holding up their hands and making signs of entreaty pointing to the place where one of those lay whom we had killed  it was a long time before i or any of us could understand them but one of them ran and lifted up a dead man pointing to his wound which was in his eyes for he was shot into the head at one of his eyes then another pointed to the surgeon and at last we found it out that the meaning was that he should heal the princes father too who was dead being shot through the head as above  we presently took the hint and would not say we could not do it but let them know the men that were killed were those that had first fallen upon us and provoked us and we would by no means make them alive again and that if any others did so we would kill them too and never let them live any more but that if he the prince would be willing to go with us and do as we should direct him we would not let him die and would make his arm well upon this he bid his men go and fetch a long stick or staff and lay on the ground when they brought it we saw it was an arrow he took it with his left hand for his other was lame with the wound and pointing up at the sun broke the arrow in two and set the point against his breast and then gave it to me this was as i understood afterwards wishing the sun whom they worship might shoot him into the breast with an arrow if ever he failed to be my friend and giving the point of the arrow to me was to be a testimony that i was the man he had sworn to and never was christian more punctual to an oath than he was to this for he was a sworn servant to us for many a weary month after that  when i brought him to the surgeon he immediately dressed the wound in his haunch or buttock and found the bullet had only grazed upon the flesh and passed as it were by it but it was not lodged in the part so that it was soon healed and well again but as to his arm he found one of the bones broken which are in the forepart from the wrist to the elbow and this he set and splintered it up and bound his arm in a sling hanging it about his neck and making signs to him that he should not stir it which he was so strict an observer of that he set him down and never moved one way or other but as the surgeon gave him leave  i took a great deal of pains to acquaint this negro what we intended to do and what use we intended to make of his men and particularly to teach him the meaning of what we said especially to teach him some words such as yes and no and what they meant and to inure him to our way of talking and he was very willing and apt to learn anything i taught him  it was easy to let him see that we intended to carry our provision with us from the first day but he made signs to us to tell us we need not for we should find provision enough everywhere for forty days it was very difficult for us to understand how he expressed forty for he knew no figures but some words that they used to one another that they understood it by at last one of the negroes by his order laid forty little stones one by another to show us how many days we should travel and find provisions sufficient  then i showed him our baggage which was very heavy particularly our powder shot lead iron carpenters tools seamens instruments cases of bottles and other lumber he took some of the things up in his hand to feel the weight and shook his head at them so i told our people they must resolve to divide their things into small parcels and make them portable and accordingly they did so by which means we were fain to leave all our chests behind us which were eleven in number  then he made signs to us that he would procure some buffaloes or young bulls as i called them to carry things for us and made signs too that if we were weary we might be carried too but that we slighted only were willing to have the creatures because at last when they could serve us no farther for carriage we might eat them all up if we had any occasion for them  i then carried him to our bark and showed him what things we had here he seemed amazed at the sight of our bark having never seen anything of that kind before for their boats are most wretched things such as i never saw before having no head or stern and being made only of the skins of goats sewed together with dried guts of goats and sheep and done over with a kind of slimy stuff like rosin and oil but of a most nauseous odious smell and they are poor miserable things for boats the worst that any part of the world ever saw a canoe is an excellent contrivance compared to them  but to return to our boat we carried our new prince into it and helped him over the side because of his lameness we made signs to him that his men must carry our goods for us and showed him what we had he answered si seignior or yes sir for we had taught him that word and the meaning of it and taking up a bundle he made signs to us that when his arm was well he would carry some for us  i made signs again to tell him that if he would make his men carry them we would not let him carry anything we had secured all the prisoners in a narrow place where we had bound them with mat cords and set up stakes like a palisado round them so when we carried the prince on shore we went with him to them and made signs to him to ask them if they were willing to go with us to the country of lions accordingly he made a long speech to them and we could understand by it that he told them if they were willing they must say si seignior telling them what it signified they immediately answered si seignior and clapped their hands looking up to the sun which the prince signified to us was swearing to be faithful but as soon as they had said so one of them made a long speech to the prince and in it we perceived by his gestures which were very antic that they desired something from us and that they were in great concern about it so i asked him as well as i could what it was they desired of us he told us by signs that they desired we should clap our hands to the sun that was to swear that we would not kill them that we would give them chiaruck that is to say bread would not starve them and would not let the lions eat them i told him we would promise all that then he pointed to the sun and clapped his hands signing to me that i should do so too which i did at which all the prisoners fell flat on the ground and rising up again made the oddest wildest cries that ever i heard  i think it was the first time in my life that ever any religious thought affected me but i could not refrain some reflections and almost tears in considering how happy it was that i was not born among such creatures as these and was not so stupidly ignorant and barbarous but this soon went off again and i was not troubled again with any qualms of that sort for a long time after  when this ceremony was over our concern was to get some provisions as well for the present subsistence of our prisoners as ourselves and making signs to our prince that we were thinking upon that subject he made signs to me that if i would let one of the prisoners go to his town he should bring provisions and should bring some beasts to carry our baggage i seemed loth to trust him and supposing that he would run away he made great signs of fidelity and with his own hands tied a rope about his neck offering me one end of it intimating that i should hang him if the man did not come again so i consented and he gave him abundance of instructions and sent him away pointing to the light of the sun which it seems was to tell him at what time he must be back  the fellow ran as if he was mad and held it till he was quite out of sight by which i supposed he had a great way to go the next morning about two hours before the time appointed the black prince for so i always called him beckoning with his hand to me and hallooing after his manner desired me to come to him which i did when pointing to a little hill about two miles off i saw plainly a little drove of cattle and several people with them those he told me by signs were the man he had sent and several more with him and cattle for us  accordingly by the time appointed he came quite to our huts and brought with him a great many cows young runts about sixteen goats and four young bulls taught to carry burthens  this was a supply of provisions sufficient as for bread we were obliged to shift with some roots which we had made use of before we then began to consider of making some large bags like the soldiers knapsacks for their men to carry our baggage in and to make it easy to them and the goats being killed i ordered the skins to be spread in the sun and they were as dry in two days as could be desired so we found means to make such little bags as we wanted and began to divide our baggage into them when the black prince found what they were for and how easy they were of carriage when we put them on he smiled a little and sent away the man again to fetch skins and he brought two natives more with him all loaded with skins better cured than ours and of other kinds such as we could not tell what names to give them  these two men brought the black prince two lances of the sort they use in their fights but finer than ordinary being made of black smooth wood as fine as ebony and headed at the point with the end of a long tooth of some creaturewe could not tell of what creature the head was so firm put on and the tooth so strong though no bigger than my thumb and sharp at the end that i never saw anything like it in any place in the world  the prince would not take them till i gave him leave but made signs that they should give them to me however i gave him leave to take them himself for i saw evident signs of an honourable just principle in him  we now prepared for our march when the prince coming to me and pointing towards the several quarters of the world made signs to know which way we intended to go and when i showed him pointing to the west he presently let me know there was a great river a little further to the north which was able to carry our bark many leagues into the country due west i presently took the hint and inquired for the mouth of the river which i understood by him was above a days march and by our estimation we found it about seven leagues further i take this to be the great river marked by our chartmakers at the northmost part of the coast of mozambique and called there quilloa  consulting thus with ourselves we resolved to take the prince and as many of the prisoners as we could stow in our frigate and go about by the bay into the river and that eight of us with our arms should march by land to meet them on the river side for the prince carrying us to a rising ground had showed us the river very plain a great way up the country and in one place it was not above six miles to it  it was my lot to march by land and be captain of the whole caravan i had eight of our men with me and sevenandthirty of our prisoners without any baggage for all our luggage was yet on board we drove the young bulls with us nothing was ever so tame so willing to work or carry anything the negroes would ride upon them four at a time and they would go very willingly they would eat out of our hand lick our feet and were as tractable as a dog  we drove with us six or seven cows for food but our negroes knew nothing of curing the flesh by salting and drying it till we showed them the way and then they were mighty willing to do so as long as we had any salt to do it with and to carry salt a great way too after we found we should have no more  it was an easy march to the river side for us that went by land and we came thither in a piece of a day being as above no more than six english miles whereas it was no less than five days before they came to us by water the wind in the bay having failed them and the way by reason of a great turn or reach in the river being about fifty miles about  we spent this time in a thing which the two strangers which brought the prince the two lances put into the head of the prisoners viz to make bottles of the goats skins to carry fresh water in which it seems they knew we should come to want and the men did it so dexterously having dried skins fetched them by those two men that before our vessel came up they had every man a pouch like a bladder to carry fresh water in hanging over their shoulders by a thong made of other skins about three inches broad like the sling of a fuzee  our prince to assure us of the fidelity of the men in this march had ordered them to be tied two and two by the wrist as we handcuff prisoners in england and made them so sensible of the reasonableness of it that he made them do it themselves appointing four of them to bind the rest but we found them so honest and particularly so obedient to him that after we were gotten a little further off of their own country we set them at liberty though when he came to us he would have them tied again and they continued so a good while  all the country on the bank of the river was a high land no marshy swampy ground in it the verdure good and abundance of cattle feeding upon it wherever we went or which way soever we looked there was not much wood indeed at least not near us but further up we saw oak cedar and pinetrees some of which were very large  the river was a fair open channel about as broad as the thames below gravesend and a strong tide of flood which we found held us about sixty miles the channel deep nor did we find any want of water for a great way in short we went merrily up the river with the flood and the wind blowing still fresh at e and ene we stemmed the ebb easily also especially while the river continued broad and deep but when we came past the swelling of the tide and had the natural current of the river to go against we found it too strong for us and began to think of quitting our bark but the prince would by no means agree to that for finding we had on board pretty good store of roping made of mats and flags which i described before he ordered all the prisoners which were on shore to come and take hold of those ropes and tow us along by the shore side and as we hoisted our sail too to ease them the men ran along with us at a very great rate  in this manner the river carried us up by our computation near 200 miles and then it narrowed apace and was not above as broad as the thames is at windsor or thereabouts and after another day we came to a great waterfall or cataract enough to fright us for i believe the whole body of water fell at once perpendicularly down a precipice above sixty foot high which made noise enough to deprive men of their hearing and we heard it above ten miles before we came to it  here we were at a full stop and now our prisoners went first on shore they had worked very hard and very cheerfully relieving one another those that were weary being taken into the bark had we had canoes or any boats which might have been carried by mens strength we might have gone two hundred miles more up this river in small boats but our great boat could go no farther  all this way the country looked green and pleasant and was full of cattle and some people we saw though not many but this we observed now that the people did no more understand our prisoners here than we could understand them being it seems of different nations and of different speech we had yet seen no wild beasts or at least none that came very near us except two days before we came to the waterfall when we saw three of the most beautiful leopards that ever were seen standing upon the bank of the river on the north side our prisoners being all on the other side of the water our gunner espied them first and ran to fetch his gun putting a ball extraordinary in it and coming to me now captain bob says he where is your prince so i called him out now says he tell your men not to be afraid tell them they shall see that thing in his hand speak in fire to one of those beasts and make it kill itself  the poor negroes looked as if they had been all going to be killed notwithstanding what their prince said to them and stood staring to expect the issue when on a sudden the gunner fired and as he was a very good marksman he shot the creature with two slugs just in the head as soon as the leopard felt herself struck she reared up on her two hindlegs bolt upright and throwing her forepaws about in the air fell backward growling and struggling and immediately died the other two frighted with the fire and the noise fled and were out of sight in an instant  but the two frighted leopards were not in half the consternation that our prisoners were four or five of them fell down as if they had been shot several others fell on their knees and lifted up their hands to us whether to worship us or pray us not to kill them we did not know but we made signs to their prince to encourage them which he did but it was with much ado that he brought them to their senses nay the prince notwithstanding all that was said to prepare him for it yet when the piece went off he gave a start as if he would have leaped into the river  when we saw the creature killed i had a great mind to have the skin of her and made signs to the prince that he should send some of his men over to take the skin off as soon as he spoke but a word four of them that offered themselves were untied and immediately they jumped into the river and swam over and went to work with him the prince having a knife that we gave him made four wooden knives so clever that i never saw anything like them in my life and in less than an hours time they brought me the skin of the leopard which was a monstrous great one for it was from the ears to the tale about seven foot and near five foot broad on the back and most admirably spotted all over the skin of this leopard i brought to london many years after  we were now all upon a level as to our travelling being unshipped for our bark would swim no farther and she was too heavy to carry on our backs but as we found the course of the river went a great way farther we consulted our carpenters whether we could not pull the bark in pieces and make us three or four small boats to go on with they told us we might do so but it would be very long adoing and that when we had done we had neither pitch or tar to make them sound to keep the water out or nails to fasten the plank but one of them told us that as soon as he could come at any large tree near the river he would make us a canoe or two in a quarter of the time and which would serve us as well for all the uses we could have any occasion for as a boat and such that if we came to any waterfalls we might take them up and carry them for a mile or two by land upon our shoulders  upon this we gave over the thoughts of our frigate and hauling her into a little cove or inlet where a small brook came into the main river we laid her up for those that came next and marched forward we spent indeed two days dividing our baggage and loading our tame buffaloes and our negroes our powder and shot which was the thing we were most careful of we ordered thusfirst the powder we divided into little leather bags that is to say bags of dried skins with the hair inward that the powder might not grow damp and then we put those bags into other bags made of bullocks skins very thick and hard with the hair outward that no wet might come in and this succeeded so well that in the greatest rains we had whereof some were very violent and very long we always kept our powder dry besides these bags which held our chief magazine we divided to every one a quarter of a pound of powder and half a pound of shot to carry always about us which as it was enough for our present use so we were willing to have no weight to carry more than was absolutely necessary because of the heat  we kept still on the bank of the river and for that reason had but very little communication with the people of the country for having also our bark stored with plenty of provisions we had no occasion to look abroad for a supply but now when we came to march on foot we were obliged often to seek out for food the first place we came to on the river that gave us any stop was a little negro town containing about fifty huts and there appeared about 400 people for they all came out to see us and wonder at us when our negroes appeared the inhabitants began to fly to arms thinking there had been enemies coming upon them but our negroes though they could not speak their language made signs to them that they had no weapons and were tied two and two together as captives and that there were people behind who came from the sun and that could kill them all and make them alive again if they pleased but that they would do them no hurt and came with peace as soon as they understood this they laid down their lances and bows and arrows and came and stuck twelve large stakes in the ground as a token of peace bowing themselves to us in token of submission but as soon as they saw white men with beards that is to say with mustachios they ran screaming away as in a fright  we kept at a distance from them not to be too familiar and when we did appear it was but two or three of us at a time but our prisoners made them understand that we required some provisions of them so they brought us some black cattle for they have abundance of cows and buffaloes all over that side of the country as also great numbers of deer our cutler who had now a great stock of things of his handiwork gave them some little knickknacks as plates of silver and of iron cut diamond fashion and cut into hearts and into rings and they were mightily pleased they also brought several fruits and roots which we did not understand but our negroes fed heartily on them and after we had seen them eat them we did so too  having stocked ourselves here with flesh and root as much as we could well carry we divided the burthens among our negroes appointing about thirty to forty pounds weight to a man which we thought indeed was load enough in a hot country and the negroes did not at all repine at it but would sometimes help one another when they began to be weary which did happen now and then though not often besides as most of their luggage was our provision it lightened every day like aesops basket of bread till we came to get a recruitnote when we loaded them we untied their hands and tied them two and two together by one foot  the third day of our march from this place our chief carpenter desired us to halt and set up some huts for he had found out some trees that he liked and resolved to make us some canoes for as he told me he knew we should have marching enough on foot after we left the river and he was resolved to go no farther by land than needs must  we had no sooner given orders for our little camp and given leave to our negroes to lay down their loads but they fell to work to build our huts and though they were tied as above yet they did it so nimbly as surprised us here we set some of the negroes quite at liberty that is to say without tying them having the princes word passed for their fidelity and some of these were ordered to help the carpenters which they did very handily with a little direction and others were sent to see whether they could get any provisions near hand but instead of provisions three of them came in with two bows and arrows and five lances they could not easily make us understand how they came by them only that they had surprised some negro women who were in some huts the men being from home and they had found the lances and bows in the huts or houses the women and children flying away at the sight of them as from robbers we seemed very angry at them and made the prince ask them if they had not killed any of the women or children making them believe that if they had killed anybody we would make them kill themselves too but they protested their innocence so we excused them then they brought us the bows and arrows and lances but at a motion of their black prince we gave them back the bows and arrows and gave them leave to go out to see what they could kill for food and here we gave them the laws of arms viz that if any man appeared to assault them or shoot at them to offer any violence to them they might kill them but that they should not offer to kill or hurt any that offered them peace or laid down their weapons nor any women or children upon any occasion whatsoever these were our articles of war  these two fellows had not been gone out above three or four hours but one of them came running to us without his bow and arrows hallooing and whooping a great while before he came at us okoamo okoamo which it seems was help help the rest of the negroes rose up in a hurry and by twos as they could ran forward towards their fellows to know what the matter was as for me i did not understand it nor any of our people the prince looked as if something unlucky had fallen out and some of our men took up their arms to be ready on occasion but the negroes soon discovered the thing for we saw four of them presently after coming along with a great load of meat upon their backs the case was that the two who went out with their bows and arrows meeting with a great herd of deer in the plain had been so nimble as to shoot three of them and then one of them came running to us for help to fetch them away this was the first venison we had met with in all our march and we feasted upon it very plentifully and this was the first time we began to prevail with our prince to eat his meat dressed our way after which his men were prevailed with by his example but before that they ate most of the flesh they had quite raw  we wished now we had brought some bows and arrows out with us which we might have done and we began to have so much confidence in our negroes and to be so familiar with them that we oftentimes let them go or the greatest part of them untied being well assured they would not leave us and that they did not know what course to take without us but one thing we resolved not to trust them with and that was the charging our guns but they always believed our guns had some heavenly power in them that would send forth fire and smoke and speak with a dreadful noise and kill at a distance whenever we bid them  in about eight days we finished three canoes and in them we embarked our white men and our baggage with our prince and some of the prisoners we also found it needful to keep some of ourselves always on shore not only to manage the negroes but to defend them from enemies and wild beasts abundance of little incidents happened upon this march which it is impossible to crowd into this account particularly we saw more wild beasts now than we did before some elephants and two or three lions none of which kinds we had seen any of before and we found our negroes were more afraid of them a great deal than we were principally because they had no bows and arrows or lances which were the particular weapons they were bred up to the exercise of  but we cured them of their fears by being always ready with our firearms however as we were willing to be sparing of our powder and the killing of any of the creatures now was no advantage to us seeing their skins were too heavy for us to carry and their flesh not good to eat we resolved therefore to keep some of our pieces uncharged and only primed and causing them to flash in the pan the beasts even the lions themselves would always start and fly back when they saw it and immediately march off  we passed abundance of inhabitants upon this upper part of the river and with this observation that almost every ten miles we came to a separate nation and every separate nation had a different speech or else their speech had differing dialects so that they did not understand one another they all abounded in cattle especially on the riverside and the eighth day of this second navigation we met with a little negro town where they had growing a sort of corn like rice which ate very sweet and as we got some of it of the people we made very good cakes of bread of it and making a fire baked them on the ground after the fire was swept away very well so that hitherto we had no want of provisions of any kind that we could desire  our negroes towing our canoes we travelled at a considerable rate and by our own account could not go less than twenty or twentyfive english miles a day and the river continuing to be much of the same breadth and very deep all the way till on the tenth day we came to another cataract for a ridge of high hills crossing the whole channel of the river the water came tumbling down the rocks from one stage to another in a strange manner so that it was a continued link of cataracts from one to another in the manner of a cascade only that the falls were sometimes a quarter of a mile from one another and the noise confused and frightful  we thought our voyaging was at a full stop now but three of us with a couple of our negroes mounting the hills another way to view the course of the river we found a fair channel again after about half a miles march and that it was like to hold us a good way further so we set all hands to work unloaded our cargo and hauled our canoes on shore to see if we could carry them  upon examination we found that they were very heavy but our carpenters spending but one days work upon them hewed away so much of the timber from their outsides as reduced them very much and yet they were as fit to swim as before when this was done ten men with poles took up one of the canoes and made nothing to carry it so we ordered twenty men to each canoe that one ten might relieve the other and thus we carried all our canoes and launched them into the water again and then fetched our luggage and loaded it all again into the canoes and all in an afternoon and the next morning early we moved forward again when we had towed about four days more our gunner who was our pilot began to observe that we did not keep our right course so exactly as we ought the river winding away a little towards the north and gave us notice of it accordingly however we were not willing to lose the advantage of watercarriage at least not till we were forced to it so we jogged on and the river served us for about threescore miles further but then we found it grew very small and shallow having passed the mouths of several little brooks or rivulets which came into it and at length it became but a brook itself  we towed up as far as ever our boats would swim and we went two days the fartherhaving been about twelve days in this last part of the riverby lightening the boats and taking our luggage out which we made the negroes carry being willing to ease ourselves as long as we could but at the end of these two days in short there was not water enough to swim a london wherry  we now set forward wholly by land and without any expectation of more watercarriage all our concern for more water was to be sure to have a supply for our drinking and therefore upon every hill that we came near we clambered up to the highest part to see the country before us and to make the best judgment we could which way to go to keep the lowest grounds and as near some stream of water as we could  the country held verdant well grown with trees and spread with rivers and brooks and tolerably well with inhabitants for about thirty days march after our leaving the canoes during which time things went pretty well with us we did not tie ourselves down when to march and when to halt but ordered those things as our convenience and the health and ease of our people as well our servants as ourselves required  about the middle of this march we came into a low and plain country in which we perceived a greater number of inhabitants than in any other country we had gone through but that which was worse for us we found them a fierce barbarous treacherous people and who at first looked upon us as robbers and gathered themselves in numbers to attack us  our men were terrified at them at first and began to discover an unusual fear and even our black prince seemed in a great deal of confusion but i smiled at him and showing him some of our guns i asked him if he thought that which killed the spotted cat for so they called the leopard in their language could not make a thousand of those naked creatures die at one blow then he laughed and said yes he believed it would well then said i tell your men not to be afraid of these people for we shall soon give them a taste of what we can do if they pretend to meddle with us however we considered we were in the middle of a vast country and we knew not what numbers of people and nations we might be surrounded with and above all we knew not how much we might stand in need of the friendship of these that we were now among so that we ordered the negroes to try all the methods they could to make them friends  accordingly the two men who had gotten bows and arrows and two more to whom we gave the princes two fine lances went foremost with five more having long poles in their hands and after them ten of our men advanced toward the negro town that was next to us and we all stood ready to succour them if there should be occasion  when they came pretty near their houses our negroes hallooed in their screaming way and called to them as loud as they could upon their calling some of the men came out and answered and immediately after the whole town men women and children appeared our negroes with their long poles went forward a little and stuck them all in the ground and left them which in their country was a signal of peace but the other did not understand the meaning of that then the two men with bows laid down their bows and arrows went forward unarmed and made signs of peace to them which at last the other began to understand so two of their men laid down their bows and arrows and came towards them our men made all the signs of friendship to them that they could think of putting their hands up to their mouths as a sign that they wanted provisions to eat and the other pretended to be pleased and friendly and went back to their fellows and talked with them a while and they came forward again and made signs that they would bring some provisions to them before the sun set and so our men came back again very well satisfied for that time  but an hour before sunset our men went to them again just in the same posture as before and they came according to their appointment and brought deers flesh roots and the same kind of corn like rice which i mentioned above and our negroes being furnished with such toys as our cutler had contrived gave them some of them which they seemed infinitely pleased with and promised to bring more provisions the next day  accordingly the next day they came again but our men perceived they were more in number by a great many than before however having sent out ten men with firearms to stand ready and our whole army being in view also we were not much surprised nor was the treachery of the enemy so cunningly ordered as in other cases for they might have surrounded our negroes which were but nine under a show of peace but when they saw our men advance almost as far as the place where they were the day before the rogues snatched up their bows and arrows and came running upon our men like so many furies at which our ten men called to the negroes to come back to them which they did with speed enough at the first word and stood all behind our men as they fled the other advanced and let fly near a hundred of their arrows at them by which two of our negroes were wounded and one we thought had been killed when they came to the five poles that our men had stuck in the ground they stood still awhile and gathering about the poles looked at them and handled them as wondering what they meant we then who were drawn up behind all sent one of our number to our ten men to bid them fire among them while they stood so thick and to put some small shot into their guns besides the ordinary charge and to tell them that we would be up with them immediately  accordingly they made ready but by the time they were ready to fire the black army had left their wandering about the poles and began to stir as if they would come on though seeing more men stand at some distance behind our negroes they could not tell what to make of us but if they did not understand us before they understood us less afterwards for as soon as ever our men found them to begin to move forward they fired among the thickest of them being about the distance of 120 yards as near as we could guess  it is impossible to express the fright the screaming and yelling of those wretches upon this first volley we killed six of them and wounded eleven or twelve i mean as we knew of for as they stood thick and the small shot as we called it scattered among them we had reason to believe we wounded more that stood farther off for our small shot was made of bits of lead and bits of iron heads of nails and such things as our diligent artificer the cutler helped us to  as to those that were killed and wounded the other frighted creatures were under the greatest amazement in the world to think what should hurt them for they could see nothing but holes made in their bodies they knew not how then the fire and noise amazed all their women and children and frighted them out of their wits so that they ran staring and howling about like mad creatures  however all this did not make them fly which was what we wanted nor did we find any of them die as it were with fear as at first so we resolved upon a second volley and then to advance as we did before whereupon our reserved men advancing we resolved to fire only three men at a time and move forward like an army firing in platoon so being all in a line we fired first three on the right then three on the left and so on and every time we killed or wounded some of them but still they did not fly and yet they were so frighted that they used none of their bows and arrows or of their lances and we thought their numbers increased upon our hands particularly we thought so by the noise so i called to our men to halt and bid them pour in one whole volley and then shout as we did in our first fight and so run in upon them and knock them down with our muskets  but they were too wise for that too for as soon as we had fired a whole volley and shouted they all ran away men women and children so fast that in a few moments we could not see one creature of them except some that were wounded and lame who lay wallowing and screaming here and there upon the ground as they happened to fall  upon this we came up to the field of battle where we found we had killed thirtyseven of them among which were three women and had wounded about sixtyfour among which were two women by wounded i mean such as were so maimed as not to be able to go away and those our negroes killed afterwards in a cowardly manner in cold blood for which we were very angry and threatened to make them go to them if they did so again  there was no great spoil to be got for they were all stark naked as they came into the world men and women together some of them having feathers stuck in their hair and others a kind of bracelet about their necks but nothing else but our negroes got a booty here which we were very glad of and this was the bows and arrows of the vanquished of which they found more than they knew what to do with belonging to the killed and wounded men these we ordered them to pick up and they were very useful to us afterwards after the fight and our negroes had gotten bows and arrows we sent them out in parties to see what they could get and they got some provisions but which was better than all the rest they brought us four more young bulls or buffaloes that had been brought up to labour and to carry burthens they knew them it seems by the burthens they had carried having galled their backs for they have no saddles to cover them with in that country  those creatures not only eased our negroes but gave us an opportunity to carry more provisions and our negroes loaded them very hard at this place with flesh and roots such as we wanted very much afterwards  in this town we found a very little young leopard about two spans high it was exceeding tame and purred like a cat when we stroked it with our hands being as i suppose bred up among the negroes like a housedog it was our black prince it seems who making his tour among the abandoned houses or huts found this creature there and making much of him and giving a bit or two of flesh to him the creature followed him like a dog of which more hereafter  among the negroes that were killed in this battle there was one who had a little thin bit or plate of gold about as big as a sixpence which hung by a little bit of a twisted gut upon his forehead by which we supposed he was a man of some eminence among them but that was not all for this bit of gold put us upon searching very narrowly if there was not more of it to be had thereabouts but we found none at all  from this part of the country we went on for about fifteen days and then found ourselves obliged to march up a high ridge of mountains frightful to behold and the first of the kind that we met with and having no guide but our little pocketcompass we had no advantage of information as to which was the best or the worst way but was obliged to choose by what we saw and shift as well as we could we met with several nations of wild and naked people in the plain country before we came to those hills and we found them much more tractable and friendly than those devils we had been forced to fight with and though we could learn little from these people yet we understood by the signs they made that there was a vast desert beyond these hills and as our negroes called them much lion much spotted cat so they called the leopard and they signed to us also that we must carry water with us at the last of these nations we furnished ourselves with as much provisions as we could possibly carry not knowing what we had to suffer or what length we had to go and to make our way as familiar to us as possible i proposed that of the last inhabitants we could find we should make some prisoners and carry them with us for guides over the desert and to assist us in carrying provision and perhaps in getting it too the advice was too necessary to be slighted so finding by our dumb signs to the inhabitants that there were some people that dwelt at the foot of the mountains on the other side before we came to the desert itself we resolved to furnish ourselves with guides by fair means or foul  here by a moderate computation we concluded ourselves 700 miles from the seacoast where we began our black prince was this day set free from the sling his arm hung in our surgeon having perfectly restored it and he showed it to his own countrymen quite well which made them greatly wonder also our two negroes began to recover and their wounds to heal apace for our surgeon was very skilful in managing their cure  having with infinite labour mounted these hills and coming to a view of the country beyond them it was indeed enough to astonish as stout a heart as ever was created it was a vast howling wildernessnot a tree a river or a green thing to be seen for as far as the eye could look nothing but a scalding sand which as the wind blew drove about in clouds enough to overwhelm man and beast nor could we see any end of it either before us which was our way or to the right hand or left so that truly our men began to be discouraged and talk of going back again nor could we indeed think of venturing over such a horrid place as that before us in which we saw nothing but present death  i was as much affected at the sight as any of them but for all that i could not bear the thoughts of going back again i told them we had marched 700 miles of our way and it would be worse than death to think of going back again and that if they thought the desert was not passable i thought we should rather change our course and travel south till we came to the cape of good hope or north to the country that lay along the nile where perhaps we might find some way or other over to the west sea for sure all africa was not a desert  our gunner who as i said before was our guide as to the situation of places told us that he could not tell what to say to going for the cape for it was a monstrous length being from the place where we now were not less than 1500 miles and by his account we were now come a third part of the way to the coast of angola where we should meet the western ocean and find ways enough for our escape home on the other hand he assured us and showed us a map of it that if we went northward the western shore of africa went out into the sea above 1000 miles west so that we should have so much and more land to travel afterwards which land might for aught we knew be as wild barren and desert as this and therefore upon the whole he proposed that we should attempt this desert and perhaps we should not find it so long as we feared and however he proposed that we should see how far our provisions would carry us and in particular our water and we should venture no further than half so far as our water would last and if we found no end of the desert we might come safely back again  this advice was so reasonable that we all approved of it and accordingly we calculated that we were able to carry provisions for fortytwo days but that we could not carry water for above twenty days though we were to suppose it to stink too before that time expired so that we concluded that if we did not come at some water in ten days time we would return but if we found a supply of water we could then travel twentyone days and if we saw no end of the wilderness in that time we would return also  with this regulation of our measures we descended the mountains and it was the second day before we quite reached the plain where however to make us amends we found a fine little rivulet of very good water abundance of deer a sort of creature like a hare but not so nimble but whose flesh we found very agreeable but we were deceived in our intelligence for we found no people so we got no more prisoners to assist us in carrying our baggage  the infinite number of deer and other creatures which we saw here we found was occasioned by the neighbourhood of the waste or desert from whence they retired hither for food and refreshment we stored ourselves here with flesh and roots of divers kinds which our negroes understood better than we and which served us for bread and with as much water as by the allowance of a quart a day to a man for our negroes and three pints a day a man for ourselves and three quarts a day each for our buffaloes would serve us twenty days and thus loaded for a long miserable march we set forwards being all sound in health and very cheerful but not alike strong for so great a fatigue and which was our grievance were without a guide  in the very first entrance of the waste we were exceedingly discouraged for we found the sand so deep and it scalded our feet so much with the heat that after we had as i may call it waded rather than walked through it about seven or eight miles we were all heartily tired and faint even the very negroes laid down and panted like creatures that had been pushed beyond their strength  here we found the difference of lodging greatly injurious to us for as before we always made us huts to sleep under which covered us from the night air which is particularly unwholesome in those hot countries but we had here no shelter no lodging after so hard a march for here were no trees no not a shrub near us and which was still more frightful towards night we began to hear the wolves howl the lions bellow and a great many wild asses braying and other ugly noises which we did not understand  upon this we reflected upon our indiscretion that we had not at least brought poles or stakes in our hands with which we might have as it were palisadoed ourselves in for the night and so we might have slept secure whatever other inconveniences we suffered however we found a way at last to relieve ourselves a little for first we set up the lances and bows we had and endeavoured to bring the tops of them as near to one another as we could and so hung our coats on the top of them which made us a kind of sorry tent the leopards skin and a few other skins we had put together made us a tolerable covering and thus we laid down to sleep and slept very heartily too for the first night setting however a good watch being two of our own men with their fuzes whom we relieved in an hour at first and two hours afterwards and it was very well we did this for they found the wilderness swarmed with raging creatures of all kinds some of which came directly up to the very enclosure of our tent but our sentinels were ordered not to alarm us with firing in the night but to flash in the pan at them which they did and found it effectual for the creatures went off always as soon as they saw it perhaps with some noise or howling and pursued such other game as they were upon  if we were tired with the days travel we were all as much tired with the nights lodging but our black prince told us in the morning he would give us some counsel and indeed it was very good counsel he told us we should be all killed if we went on this journey and through this desert without some covering for us at night so he advised us to march back again to a little riverside where we lay the night before and stay there till we could make us houses as he called them to carry with us to lodge in every night as he began a little to understand our speech and we very well to understand his signs we easily knew what he meant and that we should there make mats for we remembered that we saw a great deal of matting or bass there that the natives make mats ofi say that we should make large mats there for covering our huts or tents to lodge in at night  we all approved this advice and immediately resolved to go back that one days journey resolving though we carried less provisions we would carry mats with us to cover us in the night some of the nimblest of us got back to the river with more ease than we had travelled it the day before but as we were not in haste the rest made a halt encamped another night and came to us the next day  in our return of this days journey our men that made two days of it met with a very surprising thing that gave them some reason to be careful how they parted company again the case was thisthe second day in the morning before they had gone half a mile looking behind them they saw a vast cloud of sand or dust rise in the air as we see sometimes in the roads in summer when it is very dusty and a large drove of cattle are coming only very much greater and they could easily perceive that it came after them and it came on faster as they went from it the cloud of sand was so great that they could not see what it was that raised it and concluded that it was some army of enemies that pursued them but then considering that they came from the vast uninhabited wilderness they knew it was impossible any nation or people that way should have intelligence of them or the way of their march and therefore if it was an army it must be of such as they were travelling that way by accident on the other hand as they knew that there were no horses in the country and that they came on so fast they concluded that it must be some vast collection of wild beasts perhaps making to the hill country for food or water and that they should be all devoured or trampled under foot by their multitude  upon this thought they very prudently observed which way the cloud seemed to point and they turned a little out of their way to the north supposing it might pass by them when they were about a quarter of a mile they halted to see what it might be one of the negroes a nimbler fellow than the rest went back a little and came in a few minutes running as fast as the heavy sands would allow and by signs gave them to know that it was a great herd or drove or whatever it might be called of vast monstrous elephants  as it was a sight our men had never seen they were desirous to see it and yet a little uneasy at the danger too for though an elephant is a heavy unwieldy creature yet in the deep sand which is nothing at all to them they marched at a great rate and would soon have tired our people if they had had far to go and had been pursued by them  our gunner was with them and had a great mind to have gone close up to one of the outermost of them and to have clapped his piece to his ear and to have fired into him because he had been told no shot would penetrate them but they all dissuaded him lest upon the noise they should all turn upon and pursue us so he was reasoned out of it and let them pass which in our peoples circumstances was certainly the right way  they were between twenty and thirty in number but prodigious great ones and though they often showed our men that they saw them yet they did not turn out of their way or take any other notice of them than as we might say just to look at them we that were before saw the cloud of dust they raised but we had thought it had been our own caravan and so took no notice but as they bent their course one point of the compass or thereabouts to the southward of the east and we went due east  west they passed by us at some little distance so that we did not see them or know anything of them till evening when our men came to us and gave us this account of them however this was a useful experiment for our future conduct in passing the desert as you shall hear in its place  we were now upon our work and our black prince was head surveyor for he was an excellent matmaker himself and all his men understood it so that they soon made us near a hundred mats and as every man i mean of the negroes carried one it was no manner of load and we did not carry an ounce of provisions the less the greatest burthen was to carry six long poles besides some shorter stakes but the negroes made an advantage of that for carrying them between two they made the luggage of provisions which they had to carry so much the lighter binding it upon two poles and so made three couple of them as soon as we saw this we made a little advantage of it too for having three or four bags called bottles i mean skins to carry water more than the men could carry we got them filled and carried them this way which was a days water and more for our journey  having now ended our work made our mats and fully recruited our stores of all things necessary and having made us abundance of small ropes of matting for ordinary use as we might have occasion we set forward again having interrupted our journey eight days in all upon this affair to our great comfort the night before we set out there fell a very violent shower of rain the effects of which we found in the sand though the heat of one day dried the surface as much as before yet it was harder at bottom not so heavy and was cooler to our feet by which means we marched as we reckoned about fourteen miles instead of seven and with much more ease  when we came to encamp we had all things ready for we had fitted our tent and set it up for trial where we made it so that in less than an hour we had a large tent raised with an inner and outer apartment and two entrances in one we lay ourselves in the other our negroes having light pleasant mats over us and others at the same time under us also we had a little place without all for our buffaloes for they deserved our care being very useful to us besides carrying forage and water for themselves their forage was a root which our black prince directed us to find not much unlike a parsnip very moist and nourishing of which there was plenty wherever we came this horrid desert excepted  when we came the next morning to decamp our negroes took down the tent and pulled up the stakes and all was in motion in as little time as it was set up in this posture we marched eight days and yet could see no end no change of our prospect but all looking as wild and dismal as at the beginning if there was any alteration it was that the sand was nowhere so deep and heavy as it was the first three days this we thought might be because for six months of the year the winds blowing west as for the other six they blow constantly east the sand was driven violently to the side of the desert where we set out where the mountains lying very high the easterly monsoons when they blew had not the same power to drive it back again and this was confirmed by our finding the like depth of sand on the farthest extent of the desert to the west  it was the ninth day of our travel in this wilderness when we came to the view of a great lake of water and you may be sure this was a particular satisfaction to us because we had not water left for above two or three days more at our shortest allowance i mean allowing water for our return if we had been driven to the necessity of it our water had served us two days longer than expected our buffaloes having found for two or three days a kind of herb like a broad flat thistle though without any prickle spreading on the ground and growing in the sand which they ate freely of and which supplied them for drink as well as forage  the next day which was the tenth from our setting out we came to the edge of this lake and very happily for us we came to it at the south point of it for to the north we could see no end of it so we passed by it and travelled three days by the side of it which was a great comfort to us because it lightened our burthen there being no need to carry water when we had it in view and yet though here was so much water we found but very little alteration in the desert no trees no grass or herbage except that thistle as i called it and two or three more plants which we did not understand of which the desert began to be pretty full  but as we were refreshed with the neighbourhood of this lake of water so we were now gotten among a prodigious number of ravenous inhabitants the like whereof it is most certain the eye of man never saw for as i firmly believe that never man nor body of men passed this desert since the flood so i believe there is not the like collection of fierce ravenous and devouring creatures in the world i mean not in any particular place  for a days journey before we came to this lake and all the three days we were passing by it and for six or seven days march after it the ground was scattered with elephants teeth in such a number as is incredible and as some of them have lain there for some hundreds of years so seeing the substance of them scarce ever decays they may lie there for aught i know to the end of time the size of some of them is it seems to those to whom i have reported it as incredible as the number and i can assure you there were several so heavy as the strongest man among us could not lift as to number i question not but there are enough to load a thousand sail of the biggest ships in the world by which i may be understood to mean that the quantity is not to be conceived of seeing that as they lasted in view for above eighty miles travelling so they might continue as far to the right hand and to the left as far and many times as far for aught we knew for it seems the number of elephants hereabouts is prodigiously great in one place in particular we saw the head of an elephant with several teeth in it but one of the biggest that ever i saw the flesh was consumed to be sure many hundred years before and all the other bones but three of our strongest men could not lift this skull and teeth the great tooth i believe weighed at least three hundredweight and this was particularly remarkable to me that i observed the whole skull was as good ivory as the teeth and i believe altogether weighed at least six hundredweight and though i do not know but by the same rule all the bones of the elephant may be ivory yet i think there is this just objection against it from the example before me that then all the other bones of this elephant would have been there as well as the head  i proposed to our gunner that seeing we had travelled now fourteen days without intermission and that we had water here for our refreshment and no want of food yet nor any fear of it we should rest our people a little and see at the same time if perhaps we might kill some creatures that were proper for food the gunner who had more forecast of that kind than i had agreed to the proposal and added why might we not try to catch some fish out of the lake the first thing we had before us was to try if we could make any hooks and this indeed put our artificer to his trumps however with some labour and difficulty he did it and we catched fresh fish of several kinds how they came there none but he that made the lake and all the world knows for to be sure no human hands ever put any in there or pulled any out before  we not only catched enough for our present refreshment but we dried several large fishes of kinds which i cannot describe in the sun by which we lengthened out our provision considerably for the heat of the sun dried them so effectually without salt that they were perfectly cured dry and hard in one days time  we rested ourselves here five days during which time we had abundance of pleasant adventures with the wild creatures too many to relate one of them was very particular which was a chase between a shelion or lioness and a large deer and though the deer is naturally a very nimble creature and she flew by us like the wind having perhaps about 300 yards the start of the lion yet we found the lion by her strength and the goodness of her lungs got ground of her they passed by us within about a quarter of a mile and we had a view of them a great way when having given them over we were surprised about an hour after to see them come thundering back again on the other side of us and then the lion was within thirty or forty yards of her and both straining to the extremity of their speed when the deer coming to the lake plunged into the water and swam for her life as she had before run for it  the lioness plunged in after her and swam a little way but came back again and when she was got upon the land she set up the most hideous roar that ever i heard in my life as if done in the rage of having lost her prey  we walked out morning and evening constantly the middle of the day we refreshed ourselves under our tent but one morning early we saw another chase which more nearly concerned us than the other for our black prince walking by the side of the lake was set upon by a vast great crocodile which came out of the lake upon him and though he was very light of foot yet it was as much as he could do to get away he fled amain to us and the truth is we did not know what to do for we were told no bullet would enter her and we found it so at first for though three of our men fired at her yet she did not mind them but my friend the gunner a venturous fellow of a bold heart and great presence of mind went up so near as to thrust the muzzle of his piece into her mouth and fired but let his piece fall and ran for it the very moment he had fired it the creature raged a great while and spent its fury upon the gun making marks upon the very iron with its teeth but after some time fainted and died  our negroes spread the banks of the lake all this while for game and at length killed us three deer one of them very large the other two very small there was waterfowl also in the lake but we never came near enough to them to shoot any and as for the desert we saw no fowls anywhere in it but at the lake  we likewise killed two or three civet cats but their flesh is the worst of carrion we saw abundance of elephants at a distance and observed they always go in very good company that is to say abundance of them together and always extended in a fair line of battle and this they say is the way they defend themselves from their enemies for if lions or tigers wolves or any creatures attack them they being drawn in a line sometimes reaching five or six miles in length whatever comes in their way is sure to be trod under foot or beaten in pieces with their trunks or lifted up in the air with their trunks so that if a hundred lions or tigers were coming along if they meet a line of elephants they will always fly back till they see room to pass by the right hand or the left and if they did not it would be impossible for one of them to escape for the elephant though a heavy creature is yet so dexterous and nimble with his trunk that he will not fail to lift up the heaviest lion or any other wild creature and throw him up in the air quite over his back and then trample him to death with his feet we saw several lines of battle thus we saw one so long that indeed there was no end of it to be seen and i believe there might be 2000 elephants in row or line they are not beasts of prey but live upon the herbage of the field as an ox does and it is said that though they are so great a creature yet that a smaller quantity of forage supplies one of them than will suffice a horse  the numbers of this kind of creature that are in those parts are inconceivable as may be gathered from the prodigious quantity of teeth which as i said we saw in this vast desert and indeed we saw a hundred of them to one of any other kind  one evening we were very much surprised we were most of us laid down on our mats to sleep when our watch came running in among us being frighted with the sudden roaring of some lions just by them which it seems they had not seen the night being dark till they were just upon them there was as it proved an old lion and his whole family for there was the lioness and three young lions besides the old king who was a monstrous great one one of the young oneswho were good large wellgrown ones tooleaped up upon one of our negroes who stood sentinel before he saw him at which he was heartily frighted cried out and ran into the tent our other man who had a gun had not presence of mind at first to shoot him but struck him with the buttend of his piece which made him whine a little and then growl at him fearfully but the fellow retired and we being all alarmed three of our men snatched up their guns ran to the tent door where they saw the great old lion by the fire of his eyes and first fired at him but we supposed missed him or at least did not kill him for they went all off but raised a most hideous roar which as if they had called for help brought down a prodigious number of lions and other furious creatures we know not what about them for we could not see them but there was a noise and yelling and howling and all sorts of such wilderness music on every side of us as if all the beasts of the desert were assembled to devour us  we asked our black prince what we should do with them me go says he and fright them all so he snatches up two or three of the worst of our mats and getting one of our men to strike some fire he hangs the mat up at the end of a pole and set it on fire and it blazed abroad a good while at which the creatures all moved off for we heard them roar and make their bellowing noise at a great distance well says our gunner if that will do we need not burn our mats which are our beds to lay under us and our tilting to cover us let me alone says he so he comes back into our tent and falls to making some artificial fireworks and the like and he gave our sentinels some to be ready at hand upon occasion and particularly he placed a great piece of wildfire upon the same pole that the mat had been tied to and set it on fire and that burnt there so long that all the wild creatures left us for that time  however we began to be weary of such company and to be rid of them we set forward again two days sooner than we intended we found now that though the desert did not end nor could we see any appearance of it yet that the earth was pretty full of green stuff of one sort or another so that our cattle had no want and secondly that there were several little rivers which ran into the lake and so long as the country continued low we found water sufficient which eased us very much in our carriage and we went on still sixteen days more without yet coming to any appearance of better soil after this we found the country rise a little and by that we perceived that the water would fail us so for fear of the worst we filled our bladderbottles with water we found the country rising gradually thus for three days continually when on the sudden we perceived that though we had mounted up insensibly yet that we were on the top of a very high ridge of hills though not such as at first  when we came to look down on the other side of the hills we saw to the great joy of all our hearts that the desert was at an end that the country was clothed with green abundance of trees and a large river and we made no doubt but that we should find people and cattle also and here by our gunners account who kept our computations we had marched about 400 miles over this dismal place of horror having been fourandthirty days adoing of it and consequently were come about 1100 miles of our journey  we would willingly have descended the hills that night but it was too late the next morning we saw everything more plain and rested ourselves under the shade of some trees which were now the most refreshing things imaginable to us who had been scorched above a month without a tree to cover us we found the country here very pleasant especially considering that we came from and we killed some deer here also which we found very frequent under the cover of the woods also we killed a creature like a goat whose flesh was very good to eat but it was no goat we found also a great number of fowls like partridge but something smaller and were very tame so that we lived here very well but found no people at least none that would be seen no not for several days journey and to allay our joy we were almost every night disturbed with lions and tigers elephants indeed we saw none here  in three days march we came to a river which we saw from the hills and which we called the golden river and we found it ran northward which was the first stream we had met with that did so it ran with a very rapid current and our gunner pulling out his map assured me that this was either the river nile or run into the great lake out of which the river nile was said to take its beginning and he brought out his charts and maps which by his instruction i began to understand very well and told me he would convince me of it and indeed he seemed to make it so plain to me that i was of the same opinion  but i did not enter into the gunners reason for this inquiry not in the least till he went on with it farther and stated it thusif this is the river nile why should not we build some more canoes and go down this stream rather than expose ourselves to any more deserts and scorching sands in quest of the sea which when we are come to we shall be as much at a loss how to get home as we were at madagascar  the argument was good had there been no objections in the way of a kind which none of us were capable of answering but upon the whole it was an undertaking of such a nature that every one of us thought it impracticable and that upon several accounts and our surgeon who was himself a good scholar and a man of reading though not acquainted with the business of sailing opposed it and some of his reasons i remember were such as thesefirst the length of the way which both he and the gunner allowed by the course of the water and turnings of the river would be at least 4000 miles secondly the innumerable crocodiles in the river which we should never be able to escape thirdly the dreadful deserts in the way and lastly the approaching rainy season in which the streams of the nile would be so furious and rise so highspreading far and wide over all the plain countrythat we should never be able to know when we were in the channel of the river and when not and should certainly be cast away overset or run aground so often that it would be impossible to proceed by a river so excessively dangerous  this last reason he made so plain to us that we began to be sensible of it ourselves so that we agreed to lay that thought aside and proceed in our first course westwards towards the sea but as if we had been loth to depart we continued by way of refreshing ourselves to loiter two days upon this river in which time our black prince who delighted much in wandering up and down came one evening and brought us several little bits of something he knew not what but he found it felt heavy and looked well and showed it to me as what he thought was some rarity i took not much notice of it to him but stepping out and calling the gunner to me i showed it to him and told him what i thought viz that it was certainly gold he agreed with me in that and also in what followed that we would take the black prince out with us the next day and make him show us where he found it that if there was any quantity to be found we would tell our company of it but if there was but little we would keep counsel and have it to ourselves  but we forgot to engage the prince in the secret who innocently told so much to all the rest as that they guessed what it was and came to us to see when we found it was public we were more concerned to prevent their suspecting that we had any design to conceal it and openly telling our thoughts of it we called our artificer who agreed presently that it was gold so i proposed that we should all go with the prince to the place where he found it and if any quantity was to be had we would lie here some time and see what we could make of it  accordingly we went every man of us for no man was willing to be left behind in a discovery of such a nature when we came to the place we found it was on the west side of the river not in the main river but in another small river or stream which came from the west and ran into the other at that place we fell to raking in the sand and washing it in our hands and we seldom took up a handful of sand but we washed some little round lumps as big as a pins head or sometimes as big as a grape stone into our hands and we found in two or three hours time that every one had got some so we agreed to leave off and go to dinner  while we were eating it came into my thoughts that while we worked at this rate in a thing of such nicety and consequence it was ten to one if the gold which was the makebait of the world did not first or last set us together by the ears to break our good articles and our understanding one among another and perhaps cause us to part companies or worse i therefore told them that i was indeed the youngest man in the company but as they had always allowed me to give my opinion in things and had sometimes been pleased to follow my advice so i had something to propose now which i thought would be for all our advantages and i believed they would all like it very well i told them we were in a country where we all knew there was a great deal of gold and that all the world sent ships thither to get it that we did not indeed know where it was and so we might get a great deal or a little we did not know whether but i offered it to them to consider whether it would not be the best way for us and to preserve the good harmony and friendship that had been always kept among us and which was so absolutely necessary to our safety that what we found should be brought together to one common stock and be equally divided at last rather than to run the hazard of any difference which might happen among us from any ones having found more or less than another i told them that if we were all upon one bottom we should all apply ourselves heartily to the work and besides that we might then set our negroes all to work for us and receive equally the fruit of their labour and of our own and being all exactly alike sharers there could be no just cause of quarrel or disgust among us  they all approved the proposal and every one jointly swore and gave their hands to one another that they would not conceal the least grain of gold from the rest and consented that if any one or more should be found to conceal any all that he had should be taken from him and divided among the rest and one thing more was added to it by our gunner from considerations equally good and just that if any one of us by any play bet game or wager won any money or gold or the value of any from another during our whole voyage till our return quite to portugal he should be obliged by us all to restore it again on the penalty of being disarmed and turned out of the company and of having no relief from us on any account whatever this was to prevent wagering and playing for money which our men were apt to do by several means and at several games though they had neither cards nor dice  having made this wholesome agreement we went cheerfully to work and showed our negroes how to work for us and working up the stream on both sides and in the bottom of the river we spent about three weeks time dabbling in the water by which time as it lay all in our way we had gone about six miles and not more and still the higher we went the more gold we found till at last having passed by the side of a hill we perceived on a sudden that the gold stopped and that there was not a bit taken up beyond that place it presently occurred to my mind that it must then be from the side of that little hill that all the gold we found was worked down  upon this we went back to the hill and fell to work with that we found the earth loose and of a yellowish loamy colour and in some places a white hard kind of stone which in describing since to some of our artists they tell me was the spar which is found by ore and surrounds it in the mine however if it had been all gold we had no instrument to force it out so we passed that but scratching into the loose earth with our fingers we came to a surprising place where the earth for the quantity of two bushels i believe or thereabouts crumbled down with little more than touching it and apparently showed us that there was a great deal of gold in it we took it all carefully up and washing it in the water the loamy earth washed away and left the gold dust free in our hands and that which was more remarkable was that when this loose earth was all taken away and we came to the rock or hard stone there was not one grain of gold more to be found  at night we all came together to see what we had got and it appeared we had found in that days heap of earth about fifty pounds weight of gold dust and about thirtyfour pounds weight more in all the rest of our works in the river  it was a happy kind of disappointment to us that we found a full stop put to our work for had the quantity of gold been ever so small yet had any at all come i do not know when we should have given over for having rummaged this place and not finding the least grain of gold in any other place or in any of the earth there except in that loose parcel we went quite back down the small river again working it over and over again as long as we could find anything how small soever and we did get six or seven pounds more the second time then we went into the first river and tried it up the stream and down the stream on the one side and on the other up the stream we found nothing no not a grain down the stream we found very little not above the quantity of half an ounce in two miles working so back we came again to the golden river as we justly called it and worked it up the stream and down the stream twice more apiece and every time we found some gold and perhaps might have done so if we had stayed there till this time but the quantity was at last so small and the work so much the harder that we agreed by consent to give it over lest we should fatigue ourselves and our negroes so as to be quite unfit for our journey  when we had brought all our purchase together we had in the whole three pounds and a half of gold to a man share and share alike according to such a weight and scale as our ingenious cutler made for us to weigh it by which indeed he did by guess but which as he said he was sure was rather more than less and so it proved at last for it was near two ounces more than weight in a pound besides this there was seven or eight pounds weight left which we agreed to leave in his hands to work it into such shapes as we thought fit to give away to such people as we might yet meet with from whom we might have occasion to buy provisions or even to buy friendship or the like and particularly we gave about a pound to our black prince which he hammered and worked by his own indefatigable hand and some tools our artificer lent him into little round bits as round almost as beads though not exact in shape and drilling holes through them put them all upon a string and wore them about his black neck and they looked very well there i assure you but he was many months adoing it and thus ended our first golden adventure  we now began to discover what we had not troubled our heads much about before and that was that let the country be good or bad that we were in we could not travel much further for a considerable time we had been now five months and upwards in our journey and the seasons began to change and nature told us that being in a climate that had a winter as well as a summer though of a different kind from what our country produced we were to expect a wet season and such as we should not be able to travel in as well by reason of the rain itself as of the floods which it would occasion wherever we should come and though we had been no strangers to those wet seasons in the island of madagascar yet we had not thought much of them since we began our travels for setting out when the sun was about the solstice that is when it was at the greatest northern distance from us we had found the benefit of it in our travels but now it drew near us apace and we found it began to rain upon which we called another general council in which we debated our present circumstances and in particular whether we should go forward or seek for a proper place upon the bank of our golden river which had been so lucky to us to fix our camp for the winter  upon the whole it was resolved to abide where we were and it was not the least part of our happiness that we did so as shall appear in its place  having resolved upon this our first measures were to set our negroes to work to make huts or houses for our habitation and this they did very dexterously only that we changed the ground where we at first intended it thinking as indeed it happened that the river might reach it upon any sudden rain our camp was like a little town in which our huts were in the centre having one large one in the centre of them also into which all our particular lodgings opened so that none of us went into our apartments but through a public tent where we all ate and drank together and kept our councils and society and our carpenters made us tables benches and stools in abundance as many as we could make use of  we had no need of chimneys it was hot enough without fire but yet we found ourselves at last obliged to keep a fire every night upon a particular occasion for though we had in all other respects a very pleasant and agreeable situation yet we were rather worse troubled with the unwelcome visits of wild beasts here than in the wilderness itself for as the deer and other gentle creatures came hither for shelter and food so the lions and tigers and leopards haunted these places continually for prey  when first we discovered this we were so uneasy at it that we thought of removing our situation but after many debates about it we resolved to fortify ourselves in such a manner as not to be in any danger from it and this our carpenters undertook who first palisaded our camp quite round with long stakes for we had wood enough which stakes were not stuck in one by another like pales but in an irregular manner a great multitude of them so placed that they took up near two yards in thickness some higher some lower all sharpened at the top and about a foot asunder so that had any creature jumped at them unless he had gone clean over which it was very hard to do he would be hung upon twenty or thirty spikes  the entrance into this had larger stakes than the rest so placed before one another as to make three or four short turnings which no fourfooted beast bigger than a dog could possibly come in at and that we might not be attacked by any multitude together and consequently be alarmed in our sleep as we had been or be obliged to waste our ammunition which we were very chary of we kept a great fire every night without the entrance of our palisade having a hut for our two sentinels to stand in free from the rain just within the entrance and right against the fire  to maintain this fire we cut a prodigious deal of wood and piled it up in a heap to dry and with the green boughs made a second covering over our huts so high and thick that it might cast the rain from the first and keep us effectually dry  we had scarcely finished all these works but the rain came on so fierce and so continued that we had little time to stir abroad for food except indeed that our negroes who wore no clothes seemed to make nothing of the rain though to us europeans in those hot climates nothing is more dangerous  we continued in this posture for four months that is to say from the middle of june to the middle of october for though the rains went off at least the greatest violence of them about the equinox yet as the sun was then just over our heads we resolved to stay awhile till it passed a little to the southward  during our encampment here we had several adventures with the ravenous creatures of that country and had not our fire been always kept burning i question much whether all our fence though we strengthened it afterwards with twelve or fourteen rows of stakes or more would have kept us secure it was always in the night that we had the disturbance of them and sometimes they came in such multitudes that we thought all the lions and tigers and leopards and wolves of africa were come together to attack us one night being clear moonshine one of our men being upon the watch told us that he verily believed he saw ten thousand wild creatures of one sort or another pass by our little camp and ever as they saw the fire they sheered off but were sure to howl or roar or whatever it was when they were past  the music of their voices was very far from being pleasant to us and sometimes would be so very disturbing that we could not sleep for it and often our sentinels would call us that were awake to come and look at them it was one windy tempestuous night after a rainy day that we were indeed called up for such innumerable numbers of devilish creatures came about us that our watch really thought they would attack us they would not come on the side where the fire was and though we thought ourselves secure everywhere else yet we all got up and took to our arms the moon was near the full but the air full of flying clouds and a strange hurricane of wind to add to the terror of the night when looking on the back part of our camp i thought i saw a creature within our fortification and so indeed he was except his haunches for he had taken a running leap i suppose and with all his might had thrown himself clear over our palisades except one strong pile which stood higher than the rest and which had caught hold of him and by his weight he had hanged himself upon it the spike of the pile running into his hinder haunch or thigh on the inside and by that he hung growling and biting the wood for rage i snatched up a lance from one of the negroes that stood just by me and running to him struck it three or four times into him and despatched him being unwilling to shoot because i had a mind to have a volley fired among the rest whom i could see standing without as thick as a drove of bullocks going to a fair i immediately called our people out and showed them the object of terror which i had seen and without any further consultation fired a full volley among them most of our pieces being loaded with two or three slugs or bullets apiece it made a horrible clutter among them and in general they all took to their heels only that we could observe that some walked off with more gravity and majesty than others being not so much frighted at the noise and fire and we could perceive that some were left upon the ground struggling as for life but we durst not stir out to see what they were  indeed they stood so thick and were so near us that we could not well miss killing or wounding some of them and we believed they had certainly the smell of us and our victuals we had been killing for we had killed a deer and three or four of those creatures like goats the day before and some of the offal had been thrown out behind our camp and this we suppose drew them so much about us but we avoided it for the future  though the creatures fled yet we heard a frightful roaring all night at the place where they stood which we supposed was from some that were wounded and as soon as day came we went out to see what execution we had done and indeed it was a strange sight there were three tigers and two wolves quite killed besides the creature i had killed within our palisade which seemed to be of an illgendered kind between a tiger and a leopard besides this there was a noble old lion alive but with both his forelegs broke so that he could not stir away and he had almost beat himself to death with struggling all night and we found that this was the wounded soldier that had roared so loud and given us so much disturbance our surgeon looking at him smiled now says he if i could be sure this lion would be as grateful to me as one of his majestys ancestors was to androcles the roman slave i would certainly set both his legs again and cure him i had not heard the story of androcles so he told it me at large but as to the surgeon we told him he had no way to know whether the lion would do so or not but to cure him first and trust to his honour but he had no faith so to despatch him and put him out of his torment he shot him in the head and killed him for which we called him the kingkiller ever after  our negroes found no less than five of these ravenous creatures wounded and dropped at a distance from our quarters whereof one was a wolf one a fine spotted young leopard and the other were creatures that we knew not what to call them  we had several more of these gentlefolks about after that but no such general rendezvous of them as that was any more but this ill effect it had to us that it frighted the deer and other creatures from our neighbourhood of whose company we were much more desirous and which were necessary for our subsistence however our negroes went out every day ahunting as they called it with bow and arrow and they scarce ever failed of bringing us home something or other and particularly we found in this part of the country after the rains had fallen some time abundance of wild fowl such as we have in england duck teal widgeon etc some geese and some kinds that we had never seen before and we frequently killed them also we catched a great deal of fresh fish out of the river so that we wanted no provision if we wanted anything it was salt to eat with our fresh meat but we had a little left and we used it sparingly for as to our negroes they could not taste it nor did they care to eat any meat that was seasoned with it  the weather began now to clear up the rains were down and the floods abated and the sun which had passed our zenith was gone to the southward a good way so we prepared to go on our way  it was the 12th of october or thereabouts that we began to set forward and having an easy country to travel in as well as to supply us with provisions though still without inhabitants we made more despatch travelling sometimes as we calculated it twenty or twentyfive miles a day nor did we halt anywhere in eleven days march one day excepted which was to make a raft to carry us over a small river which having swelled with the rains was not yet quite down  when we were past this river which by the way ran to the northward too we found a great row of hills in our way we saw indeed the country open to the right at a great distance but as we kept true to our course due west we were not willing to go a great way out of our way only to shun a few hills so we advanced but we were surprised when being not quite come to the top one of our company who with two negroes was got up before us cried out the sea the sea and fell adancing and jumping as signs of joy  the gunner and i were most surprised at it because we had but that morning been calculating that we must have yet above 1000 miles on the sea side and that we could not expect to reach it till another rainy season would be upon us so that when our man cried out the sea the gunner was angry and said he was mad  but we were both in the greatest surprise imaginable when coming to the top of the hill and though it was very high we saw nothing but water either before us or to the right hand or the left being a vast sea without any bounds but the horizon  we went down the hill full of confusion of thought not being able to conceive whereabouts we were or what it must be seeing by all our charts the sea was yet a vast way off  it was not above three miles from the hills before we came to the shore or wateredge of this sea and there to our further surprise we found the water fresh and pleasant to drink so that in short we knew not what course to take the sea as we thought it to be put a full stop to our journey i mean westward for it lay just in the way our next question was which hand to turn to to the right hand or the left but this was soon resolved for as we knew not the extent of it we considered that our way if it had been the sea really must be on the north and therefore if we went to the south now it must be just so much out of our way at last so having spent a good part of the day in our surprise at the thing and consulting what to do we set forward to the north  we travelled upon the shore of this sea full twentythree days before we could come to any resolution about what it was at the end of which early one morning one of our seamen cried out land and it was no false alarm for we saw plainly the tops of some hills at a very great distance on the further side of the water due west but though this satisfied us that it was not the ocean but an inland sea or lake yet we saw no land to the northward that is to say no end of it but were obliged to travel eight days more and near 100 miles farther before we came to the end of it and then we found this lake or sea ended in a very great river which ran n or n by e as the other river had done which i mentioned before  my friend the gunner upon examining said that he believed that he was mistaken before and that this was the river nile but was still of the mind that we were of before that we should not think of a voyage into egypt that way so we resolved upon crossing this river which however was not so easy as before the river being very rapid and the channel very broad  it cost us therefore a week here to get materials to waft ourselves and cattle over this river for though here were stores of trees yet there was none of any considerable growth sufficient to make a canoe  during our march on the edge of this bank we met with great fatigue and therefore travelled a fewer miles in a day than before there being such a prodigious number of little rivers that came down from the hills on the east side emptying themselves into this gulf all which waters were pretty high the rains having been but newly over  in the last three days of our travel we met with some inhabitants but we found they lived upon the little hills and not by the waterside nor were we a little put to it for food in this march having killed nothing for four or five days but some fish we caught out of the lake and that not in such plenty as we found before  but to make us some amends we had no disturbance upon all the shores of this lake from any wild beasts the only inconveniency of that kind was that we met an ugly venomous deformed kind of a snake or serpent in the wet grounds near the lake that several times pursued us as if it would attack us and if we struck or threw anything at it it would raise itself up and hiss so loud that it might be heard a great way it had a hellish ugly deformed look and voice and our men would not be persuaded but it was the devil only that we did not know what business satan could have there where there were no people  it was very remarkable that we had now travelled 1000 miles without meeting with any people in the heart of the whole continent of africa where to be sure never man set his foot since the sons of noah spread themselves over the face of the whole earth here also our gunner took an observation with his forestaff to determine our latitude and he found now that having marched about thirtythree days northward we were in 6 degrees 22 minutes south latitude  after having with great difficulty got over this river we came into a strange wild country that began a little to affright us for though the country was not a desert of dry scalding sand as that was we had passed before yet it was mountainous barren and infinitely full of most furious wild beasts more than any place we had passed yet there was indeed a kind of coarse herbage on the surface and now and then a few trees or rather shrubs but people we could see none and we began to be in great suspense about victuals for we had not killed a deer a great while but had lived chiefly upon fish and fowl always by the waterside both which seemed to fail us now and we were in the more consternation because we could not lay in a stock here to proceed upon as we did before but were obliged to set out with scarcity and without any certainty of a supply  we had however no remedy but patience and having killed some fowls and dried some fish as much as with short allowance we reckoned would last us five days we resolved to venture and venture we did nor was it without cause that we were apprehensive of the danger for we travelled the five days and met neither with fish nor fowl nor fourfooted beast whose flesh was fit to eat and we were in a most dreadful apprehension of being famished to death on the sixth day we almost fasted or as we may say we ate up all the scraps of what we had left and at night lay down supperless upon our mats with heavy hearts being obliged the eighth day to kill one of our poor faithful servants the buffaloes that carried our baggage the flesh of this creature was very good and so sparingly did we eat of it that it lasted us all three days and a half and was just spent and we were on the point of killing another when we saw before us a country that promised better having high trees and a large river in the middle of it  this encouraged us and we quickened our march for the riverside though with empty stomachs and very faint and weak but before we came to this river we had the good hap to meet with some young deer a thing we had long wished for in a word having shot three of them we came to a full stop to fill our bellies and never gave the flesh time to cool before we ate it nay it was much we could stay to kill it and had not eaten it alive for we were in short almost famished  through all that inhospitable country we saw continually lions tigers leopards civet cats and abundance of kinds of creatures that we did not understand we saw no elephants but every now and then we met with an elephants tooth lying on the ground and some of them lying as it were half buried by the length of time that they had lain there  when we came to the shore of this river we found it ran northerly still as all the rest had done but with this difference that as the course of the other rivers were n by e or nne the course of this lay nwn  on the farther bank of this river we saw some sign of inhabitants but met with none for the first day but the next day we came into an inhabited country the people all negroes and stark naked without shame both men and women  we made signs of friendship to them and found them a very frank civil and friendly sort of people they came to our negroes without any suspicion nor did they give us any reason to suspect them of any villainy as the others had done we made signs to them that we were hungry and immediately some naked women ran and fetched us great quantities of roots and of things like pumpkins which we made no scruple to eat and our artificer showed them some of his trinkets that he had made some of iron some of silver but none of gold they had so much judgment as to choose that of silver before the iron but when we showed them some gold we found they did not value it so much as either of the other  for some of these things they brought us more provisions and three living creatures as big as calves but not of that kind neither did we ever see any of them before their flesh was very good and after that they brought us twelve more and some smaller creatures like hares all which were very welcome to us who were indeed at a very great loss for provisions  we grew very intimate with these people and indeed they were the civillest and most friendly people that we met with at all and mightily pleased with us and which was very particular they were much easier to be made to understand our meaning than any we had met with before  at last we began to inquire our way pointing to the west they made us understand easily that we could not go that way but they pointed to us that we might go northwest so that we presently understood that there was another lake in our way which proved to be true for in two days more we saw it plain and it held us till we passed the equinoctial line lying all the way on our left hand though at a great distance  travelling thus northward our gunner seemed very anxious about our proceedings for he assured us and made me sensible of it by the maps which he had been teaching me out of that when we came into the latitude of six degrees or thereabouts north of the line the land trended away to the west to such a length that we should not come at the sea under a march of above 1500 miles farther westward than the country we desired to go to i asked him if there were no navigable rivers that we might meet with which running into the west ocean might perhaps carry us down their stream and then if it were 1500 miles or twice 1500 miles we might do well enough if we could but get provisions  here he showed me the maps again and that there appeared no river whose stream was of any such a length as to do any kindness till we came perhaps within 200 or 300 miles of the shore except the rio grande as they call it which lay farther northward from us at least 700 miles and that then he knew not what kind of country it might carry us through for he said it was his opinion that the heats on the north of the line even in the same latitude were violent and the country more desolate barren and barbarous than those of the south and that when we came among the negroes in the north part of africa next the sea especially those who had seen and trafficked with the europeans such as dutch english portuguese spaniards etc they had most of them been so illused at some time or other that they would certainly put all the spite they could upon us in mere revenge  upon these considerations he advised us that as soon as we had passed this lake we should proceed wsw that is to say a little inclining to the south and that in time we should meet with the great river congo from whence the coast is called congo being a little north of angola where we intended at first to go  i asked him if ever he had been on the coast of congo he said yes he had but was never on shore there then i asked him how we should get from thence to the coast where the european ships came seeing if the land trended away west for 1500 miles we must have all that shore to traverse before we could double the west point of it  he told me it was ten to one but we should hear of some european ships to take us in for that they often visited the coast of congo and angola in trade with the negroes and that if we could not yet if we could but find provisions we should make our way as well along the seashore as along the river till we came to the gold coast which he said was not above 400 or 500 miles north of congo besides the turning of the coast west about 300 more that shore being in the latitude of six or seven degrees and that there the english or dutch or french had settlements or factories perhaps all of them  i confess i had more mind all the while he argued to have gone northward and shipped ourselves in the rio grande or as the traders call it the river negro or niger for i knew that at last it would bring us down to the cape de verd where we were sure of relief whereas at the coast we were going to now we had a prodigious way still to go either by sea or land and no certainty which way to get provisions but by force but for the present i held my tongue because it was my tutors opinion  but when according to his desire we came to turn southward having passed beyond the second great lake our men began all to be uneasy and said we were now out of our way for certain for that we were going farther from home and that we were indeed far enough off already  but we had not marched above twelve days more eight whereof were taken up in rounding the lake and four more southwest in order to make for the river congo but we were put to another full stop by entering a country so desolate so frightful and so wild that we knew not what to think or do for besides that it appeared as a terrible and boundless desert having neither woods trees rivers or inhabitants so even the place where we were was desolate of inhabitants nor had we any way to gather in a stock of provisions for the passing of this desert as we did before at our entering the first unless we had marched back four days to the place where we turned the head of the lake  well notwithstanding this we ventured for to men that had passed such wild places as we had done nothing could seem too desperate to undertake we ventured i say and the rather because we saw very high mountains in our way at a great distance and we imagined wherever there were mountains there would be springs and rivers where rivers there would be trees and grass where trees and grass there would be cattle and where cattle some kind of inhabitants at last in consequence of this speculative philosophy we entered this waste having a great heap of roots and plants for our bread such as the indians gave us a very little flesh or salt and but a little water  we travelled two days towards those hills and still they seemed as far off as they did at first and it was the fifth day before we got to them indeed we travelled but softly for it was excessively hot and we were much about the very equinoctial line we hardly knew whether to the south or the north of it  as we had concluded that where there were hills there would be springs so it happened but we were not only surprised but really frighted to find the first spring we came to and which looked admirably clear and beautiful to be salt as brine it was a terrible disappointment to us and put us under melancholy apprehensions at first but the gunner who was of a spirit never discouraged told us we should not be disturbed at that but be very thankful for salt was a bait we stood in as much need of as anything and there was no question but we should find fresh water as well as salt and here our surgeon stepped in to encourage us and told us that if we did not know he would show us a way how to make that salt water fresh which indeed made us all more cheerful though we wondered what he meant  meantime our men without bidding had been seeking about for other springs and found several but still they were all salt from whence we concluded that there was a salt rock or mineral stone in those mountains and perhaps they might be all of such a substance but still i wondered by what witchcraft it was that our artist the surgeon would make this salt water turn fresh and i longed to see the experiment which was indeed a very odd one but he went to work with as much assurance as if he had tried it on the very spot before  he took two of our large mats and sewed them together and they made a kind of a bag four feet broad three feet and a half high and about a foot and a half thick when it was full  he caused us to fill this bag with dry sand and tread it down as close as we could not to burst the mats when thus the bag was full within a foot he sought some other earth and filled up the rest with it and still trod all in as hard as he could when he had done he made a hole in the upper earth about as broad as the crown of a large hat or something bigger about but not so deep and bade a negro fill it with water and still as it shrunk away to fill it again and keep it full the bag he had placed at first across two pieces of wood about a foot from the ground and under it he ordered some of our skins to be spread that would hold water in about an hour and not sooner the water began to come dropping through the bottom of the bag and to our great surprise was perfectly fresh and sweet and this continued for several hours but in the end the water began to be a little brackish when we told him that well then said he turn the sand out and fill it again whether he did this by way of experiment from his own fancy or whether he had seen it done before i do not remember  the next day we mounted the tops of the hills where the prospect was indeed astonishing for as far as the eye could look south or west or northwest there was nothing to be seen but a vast howling wilderness with neither tree nor river nor any green thing the surface we found as the part we passed the day before had a kind of thick moss upon it of a blackish dead colour but nothing in it that looked like food either for man or beast  had we been stored with provisions to have entered for ten or twenty days upon this wilderness as we were formerly and with fresh water we had hearts good enough to have ventured though we had been obliged to come back again for if we went north we did not know but we might meet with the same but we neither had provisions neither were we in any place where it was possible to get them we killed some wild ferine creatures at the foot of these hills but except two things like to nothing that we ever saw before we met with nothing that was fit to eat these were creatures that seemed to be between the kind of a buffalo and a deer but indeed resembled neither for they had no horns and had great legs like a cow with a fine head and the neck like a deer we killed also at several times a tiger two young lions and a wolf but god be thanked we were not so reduced as to eat carrion  upon this terrible prospect i renewed my motion of turning northward and making towards the river niger or rio grande then to turn west towards the english settlements on the gold coast to which every one most readily consented only our gunner who was indeed our best guide though he happened to be mistaken at this time he moved that as our coast was now northward so we might slant away northwest that so by crossing the country we might perhaps meet with some other river that run into the rio grande northward or down to the gold coast southward and so both direct our way and shorten the labour as also because if any of the country was inhabited and fruitful we should probably find it upon the shore of the rivers where alone we could be furnished with provisions  this was good advice and too rational not to be taken but our present business was what to do to get out of this dreadful place we were in behind us was a waste which had already cost us five days march and we had not provisions for five days left to go back again the same way before us was nothing but horror as above so we resolved seeing the ridge of the hills we were upon had some appearance of fruitfulness and that they seemed to lead away to the northward a great way to keep under the foot of them on the east side to go on as far as we could and in the meantime to look diligently out for food  accordingly we moved on the next morning for we had no time to lose and to our great comfort we came in our first mornings march to very good springs of fresh water and lest we should have a scarcity again we filled all our bladder bottles and carried it with us i should also have observed that our surgeon who made the salt water fresh took the opportunity of those salt springs and made us the quantity of three or four pecks of very good salt  in our third march we found an unexpected supply of food the hills being full of hares they were of a kind something different from ours in england larger and not as swift of foot but very good meat we shot several of them and the little tame leopard which i told you we took at the negro town that we plundered hunted them like a dog and killed us several every day but she would eat nothing of them unless we gave it her which indeed in our circumstance was very obliging we salted them a little and dried them in the sun whole and carried a strange parcel along with us i think it was almost three hundred for we did not know when we might find any more either of these or any other food we continued our course under these hills very comfortably for eight or nine days when we found to our great satisfaction the country beyond us began to look with something of a better countenance as for the west side of the hills we never examined it till this day when three of our company the rest halting for refreshment mounted the hills again to satisfy their curiosity but found it all the same nor could they see any end of it no not to the north the way we were going so the tenth day finding the hills made a turn and led as it were into the vast desert we left them and continued our course north the country being very tolerably full of woods some waste but not tediously long till we came by our gunners observation into the latitude of eight degrees five minutes which we were nineteen days more in performing  all this way we found no inhabitants but abundance of wild ravenous creatures with which we became so well acquainted now that really we did not much mind them we saw lions and tigers and leopards every night and morning in abundance but as they seldom came near us we let them go about their business if they offered to come near us we made false fire with any gun that was uncharged and they would walk off as soon as they saw the flash  we made pretty good shift for food all this way for sometimes we killed hares sometimes some fowls but for my life i cannot give names to any of them except a kind of partridge and another that was like our turtle now and then we began to meet with elephants again in great numbers those creatures delighted chiefly in the woody part of the country  this longcontinued march fatigued us very much and two of our men fell sick indeed so very sick that we thought they would have died and one of our negroes died suddenly our surgeon said it was an apoplexy but he wondered at it he said for he could never complain of his high feeding another of them was very ill but our surgeon with much ado persuading him indeed it was almost forcing him to be let blood he recovered  we halted here twelve days for the sake of our sick men and our surgeon persuaded me and three or four more of us to be let blood during the time of rest which with other things he gave us contributed very much to our continued health in so tedious a march and in so hot a climate  in this march we pitched our matted tents every night and they were very comfortable to us though we had trees and woods to shelter us in most places we thought it very strange that in all this part of the country we yet met with no inhabitants but the principal reason as we found afterwards was that we having kept a western course first and then a northern course were gotten too much into the middle of the country and among the deserts whereas the inhabitants are principally found among the rivers lakes and lowlands as well to the southwest as to the north  what little rivulets we found here were so empty of water that except some pits and little more than ordinary pools there was scarcely any water to be seen in them and they rather showed that during the rainy months they had a channel than that they had really running water in them at that time by which it was easy for us to judge that we had a great way to go but this was no discouragement so long as we had but provisions and some seasonable shelter from the violent heat which indeed i thought was much greater now than when the sun was just over our heads  our men being recovered we set forward again very well stored with provisions and water sufficient and bending our course a little to the westward of the north travelled in hopes of some favourable stream which might bear a canoe but we found none till after twenty days travel including eight days rest for our men being weak we rested very often especially when we came to places which were proper for our purpose where we found cattle fowl or anything to kill for our food in those twenty days march we advanced four degrees to the northward besides some meridian distance westward and we met with abundance of elephants and with a good number of elephants teeth scattered up and down here and there in the woody grounds especially some of which were very large but they were no booty to us our business was provisions and a good passage out of the country and it had been much more to our purpose to have found a good fat deer and to have killed it for our food than a hundred ton of elephants teeth and yet as you shall presently hear when we came to begin our passage by water we once thought to have built a large canoe on purpose to have loaded it with ivory but this was when we knew nothing of the rivers nor knew anything how dangerous and how difficult a passage it was we were likely to have in them nor had considered the weight of carriage to lug them to the rivers where we might embark  at the end of twenty days travel as above in the latitude of three degrees sixteen minutes we discovered in a valley at some distance from us a pretty tolerable stream which we thought deserved the name of a river and which ran its course nnw which was just what we wanted as we had fixed our thoughts upon our passage by water we took this for the place to make the experiment and bent our march directly to the valley  there was a small thicket of trees just in our way which we went by thinking no harm when on a sudden one of our negroes was dangerously wounded with an arrow shot into his back slanting between his shoulders this put us to a full stop and three of our men with two negroes spreading the wood for it was but a small one found a negro with a bow but no arrow who would have escaped but our men that discovered him shot him in revenge of the mischief he had done so we lost the opportunity of taking him prisoner which if we had done and sent him home with good usage it might have brought others to us in a friendly manner  going a little farther we came to five negro huts or houses built after a different manner from any we had seen yet and at the door of one of them lay seven elephants teeth piled up against the wall or side of the hut as if they had been provided against a market here were no men but seven or eight women and near twenty children we offered them no incivility of any kind but gave them every one a bit of silver beaten out thin as i observed before and cut diamond fashion or in the shape of a bird at which the women were overjoyed and brought out to us several sorts of food which we did not understand being cakes of a meal made of roots which they bake in the sun and which ate very well we went a little way farther and pitched our camp for that night not doubting but our civility to the women would produce some good effect when their husbands might come home  accordingly the next morning the women with eleven men five young boys and two good big girls came to our camp before they came quite to us the women called aloud and made an odd screaming noise to bring us out and accordingly we came out when two of the women showing us what we had given them and pointing to the company behind made such signs as we could easily understand signified friendship when the men advanced having bows and arrows they laid them down on the ground scraped and threw sand over their heads and turned round three times with their hands laid up upon the tops of their heads this it seems was a solemn vow of friendship upon this we beckoned them with our hands to come nearer then they sent the boys and girls to us first which it seems was to bring us more cakes of bread and some green herbs to eat which we received and took the boys up and kissed them and the little girls too then the men came up close to us and sat them down on the ground making signs that we should sit down by them which we did they said much to one another but we could not understand them nor could we find any way to make them understand us much less whither we were going or what we wanted only that we easily made them understand we wanted victuals whereupon one of the men casting his eyes about him towards a rising ground that was about half a mile off started up as if he was frighted flew to the place where they had laid down their bows and arrows snatched up a bow and two arrows and ran like a racehorse to the place when he came there he let fly both his arrows and comes back again to us with the same speed we seeing he came with the bow but without the arrows were the more inquisitive but the fellow saying nothing to us beckons to one of our negroes to come to him and we bid him go so he led him back to the place where lay a kind of deer shot with two arrows but not quite dead and between them they brought it down to us this was for a gift to us and was very welcome i assure you for our stock was low these people were all stark naked  the next day there came about a hundred men to us and women making the same awkward signals of friendship and dancing and showing themselves very well pleased and anything they had they gave us how the man in the wood came to be so butcherly and rude as to shoot at our men without making any breach first we could not imagine for the people were simple plain and inoffensive in all our other conversation with them  from hence we went down the banks of the little river i mentioned and where i found we should see the whole nation of negroes but whether friendly to us or not that we could make no judgment of yet  the river was no use to us as to the design of making canoes a great while and we traversed the country on the edge of it about five days more when our carpenters finding the stream increased proposed to pitch our tents and fall to work to make canoes but after we had begun the work and cut down two or three trees and spent five days in the labour some of our men wandering further down the river brought us word that the stream rather decreased than increased sinking away into the sands or drying up by the heat of the sun so that the river appeared not able to carry the least canoe that could be any way useful to us so we were obliged to give over our enterprise and move on  in our further prospect this way we marched three days full west the country on the north side being extraordinary mountainous and more parched and dry than any we had seen yet whereas in the part which looks due west we found a pleasant valley running a great way between two great ridges of mountains the hills looked frightful being entirely bare of trees or grass and even white with the dryness of the sand but in the valley we had trees grass and some creatures that were fit for food and some inhabitants  we passed by some of their huts or houses and saw people about them but they ran up into the hills as soon as they saw us at the end of this valley we met with a peopled country and at first it put us to some doubt whether we should go among them or keep up towards the hills northerly and as our aim was principally as before to make our way to the river niger we inclined to the latter pursuing our course by the compass to the nw we marched thus without interruption seven days more when we met with a surprising circumstance much more desolate and disconsolate than our own and which in time to come will scarce seem credible  we did not much seek the conversing or acquainting ourselves with the natives of the country except where we found the want of them for our provision or their direction for our way so that whereas we found the country here begin to be very populous especially towards our left hand that is to the south we kept at the more distance northerly still stretching towards the west  in this tract we found something or other to kill and eat which always supplied our necessity though not so well as we were provided in our first setting out being thus as it were pushing to avoid a peopled country we at last came to a very pleasant agreeable stream of water not big enough to be called a river but running to the nnw which was the very course we desired to go  on the farthest bank of this brook we perceived some huts of negroes not many and in a little low spot of ground some maize or indian corn growing which intimated presently to us that there were some inhabitants on that side less barbarous than what we had met with in other places where we had been  as we went forward our whole caravan being in a body our negroes who were in the front cried out that they saw a white man we were not much surprised at first it being as we thought a mistake of the fellows and asked them what they meant when one of them stepped to me and pointing to a hut on the other side of the hill i was astonished to see a white man indeed but stark naked very busy near the door of his hut and stooping down to the ground with something in his hand as if he had been at some work and his back being towards us he did not see us  i gave notice to our negroes to make no noise and waited till some more of our men were come up to show the sight to them that they might be sure i was not mistaken and we were soon satisfied of the truth for the man having heard some noise started up and looked full at us as much surprised to be sure as we were but whether with fear or hope we then knew not  as he discovered us so did the rest of the inhabitants belonging to the huts about him and all crowded together looking at us at a distance a little bottom in which the brook ran lying between us the white man and all the rest as he told us afterwards not knowing well whether they should stay or run away however it presently came into my thoughts that if there were white men among them it would be much easier to make them understand what we meant as to peace or war than we found it with others so tying a piece of white rag to the end of a stick we sent two negroes with it to the bank of the water carrying the pole up as high as they could it was presently understood and two of their men and the white man came to the shore on the other side  however as the white man spoke no portuguese they could understand nothing of one another but by signs but our men made the white man understand that they had white men with them too at which they said the white man laughed however to be short our men came back and told us they were all good friends and in about an hour four of our men two negroes and the black prince went to the riverside where the white man came to them  they had not been half a quarter of an hour but a negro came running to me and told me the white man was inglese as he called him upon which i ran back eagerly enough you may be sure with him and found as he said that he was an englishman upon which he embraced me very passionately the tears running down his face the first surprise of his seeing us was over before we came but any one may conceive it by the brief account he gave us afterwards of his very unhappy circumstances and of so unexpected a deliverance such as perhaps never happened to any man in the world for it was a million to one odds that ever he could have been relieved nothing but an adventure that never was heard or read of before could have suited his case unless heaven by some miracle that never was to be expected had acted for him  he appeared to be a gentleman not an ordinarybred fellow seaman or labouring man this showed itself in his behaviour in the first moment of our conversing with him and in spite of all the disadvantages of his miserable circumstances  he was a middleaged man not above thirtyseven or thirtyeight though his beard was grown exceedingly long and the hair of his head and face strangely covered him to the middle of his back and breast he was white and his skin very fine though discoloured and in some places blistered and covered with a brown blackish substance scurfy scaly and hard which was the effect of the scorching heat of the sun he was stark naked and had been so as he told us upwards of two years  he was so exceedingly transported at our meeting with him that he could scarce enter into any discourse at all with us that day and when he could get away from us for a little we saw him walking alone and showing all the most extravagant tokens of an ungovernable joy and even afterwards he was never without tears in his eyes for several days upon the least word spoken by us of his circumstances or by him of his deliverance  we found his behaviour the most courteous and endearing i ever saw in any man whatever and most evident tokens of a mannerly wellbred person appeared in all things he did or said and our people were exceedingly taken with him he was a scholar and a mathematician he could not speak portuguese indeed but he spoke latin to our surgeon french to another of our men and italian to a third  he had no leisure in his thoughts to ask us whence we came whither we were going or who we were but would have it always as an answer to himself that to be sure wherever we were agoing we came from heaven and were sent on purpose to save him from the most wretched condition that ever man was reduced to  our men pitching their camp on the bank of a little river opposite to him he began to inquire what store of provisions we had and how we proposed to be supplied when he found that our store was but small he said he would talk with the natives and we should have provisions enough for he said they were the most courteous goodnatured part of the inhabitants in all that part of the country as we might suppose by his living so safe among them  the first things this gentleman did for us were indeed of the greatest consequence to us for first he perfectly informed us where we were and which was the properest course for us to steer secondly he put us in the way how to furnish ourselves effectually with provisions and thirdly he was our complete interpreter and peacemaker with all the natives who now began to be very numerous about us and who were a more fierce and politic people than those we had met with before not so easily terrified with our arms as those and not so ignorant as to give their provisions and corn for our little toys such as i said before our artificer made but as they had frequently traded and conversed with the europeans on the coast or with other negro nations that had traded and been concerned with them they were the less ignorant and the less fearful and consequently nothing was to be had from them but by exchange for such things as they liked  this i say of the negro natives which we soon came among but as to these poor people that he lived among they were not much acquainted with things being at the distance of above 300 miles from the coast only that they found elephants teeth upon the hills to the north which they took and carried about sixty or seventy miles south where other trading negroes usually met them and gave them beads glass shells and cowries for them such as the english and dutch and other traders furnish them with from europe  we now began to be more familiar with our new acquaintance and first though we made but a sorry figure as to clothes ourselves having neither shoe or stocking or glove or hat among us and but very few shirts yet as well as we could we clothed him and first our surgeon having scissors and razors shaved him and cut his hair a hat as i say we had not in all our stores but he supplied himself by making himself a cap of a piece of a leopardskin most artificially as for shoes or stockings he had gone so long without them that he cared not even for the buskins and footgloves we wore which i described above  as he had been curious to hear the whole story of our travels and was exceedingly delighted with the relation so we were no less to know and pleased with the account of his circumstances and the history of his coming to that strange place alone and in that condition which we found him in as above this account of his would indeed be in itself the subject of an agreeable history and would be as long and diverting as our own having in it many strange and extraordinary incidents but we cannot have room here to launch out into so long a digression the sum of his history was this  he had been a factor for the english guinea company at sierra leone or some other of their settlements which had been taken by the french where he had been plundered of all his own effects as well as of what was entrusted to him by the company whether it was that the company did not do him justice in restoring his circumstances or in further employing him he quitted their service and was employed by those called separate traders and being afterwards out of employ there also traded on his own account when passing unwarily into one of the companys settlements he was either betrayed into the hands of some of the natives or somehow or other was surprised by them however as they did not kill him he found means to escape from them at that time and fled to another nation of the natives who being enemies to the other entertained him friendly and with them he lived some time but not liking his quarters or his company he fled again and several times changed his landlords sometimes was carried by force sometimes hurried by fear as circumstances altered with him the variety of which deserves a history by itself till at last he had wandered beyond all possibility of return and had taken up his abode where we found him where he was well received by the petty king of the tribe he lived with and he in return instructed them how to value the product of their labour and on what terms to trade with those negroes who came up to them for teeth  as he was naked and had no clothes so he was naked of arms for his defence having neither gun sword staff or any instrument of war about him no not to guard himself against the attacks of a wild beast of which the country was very full we asked him how he came to be so entirely abandoned of all concern for his safety he answered that to him that had so often wished for death life was not worth defending and that as he was entirely at the mercy of the negroes they had much the more confidence in him seeing he had no weapons to hurt them as for wild beasts he was not much concerned about that for he scarce ever went from his hut but if he did the negro king and his men went all with him and they were all armed with bows and arrows and lances with which they would kill any of the ravenous creatures lions as well as others but that they seldom came abroad in the day and if the negroes wander anywhere in the night they always build a hut for themselves and make a fire at the door of it which is guard enough  we inquired of him what we should next do towards getting to the seaside he told us we were about one hundred and twenty english leagues from the coast where almost all the european settlements and factories were and which is called the gold coast but that there were so many different nations of negroes in the way that it was ten to one if we were not either fought with continually or starved for want of provisions but that there were two other ways to go which if he had had any company to go with him he had often contrived to make his escape by the one was to travel full west which though it was farther to go yet was not so full of people and the people we should find would be so much the civiller to us or be so much the easier to fight with or that the other way was if possible to get to the rio grande and go down the stream in canoes we told him that was the way we had resolved on before we met with him but then he told us there was a prodigious desert to go over and as prodigious woods to go through before we came to it and that both together were at least twenty days march for us travel as hard as we could  we asked him if there were no horses in the country or asses or even bullocks or buffaloes to make use of in such a journey and we showed him ours of which we had but three left he said no all the country did not afford anything of that kind  he told us that in this great wood there were immense numbers of elephants and upon the desert great multitudes of lions lynxes tigers leopards c and that it was to that wood and that desert that the negroes went to get elephants teeth where they never failed to find a great number  we inquired still more and particularly the way to the gold coast and if there were no rivers to ease us in our carriage and told him as to the negroes fighting with us we were not much concerned at that nor were we afraid of starving for if they had any victuals among them we would have our share of it and therefore if he would venture to show us the way we would venture to go and as for himself we told him we would live and die togetherthere should not a man of us stir from him  he told us with all his heart if we resolved it and would venture we might be assured he would take his fate with us and he would endeavour to guide us in such a way as we should meet with some friendly savages who would use us well and perhaps stand by us against some others who were less tractable so in a word we all resolved to go full south for the gold coast  the next morning he came to us again and being all met in council as we may call it he began to talk very seriously with us that since we were now come after a long journey to a view of the end of our troubles and had been so obliging to him as to offer to carry him with us he had been all night revolving in his mind what he and we all might do to make ourselves some amends for all our sorrows and first he said he was to let me know that we were just then in one of the richest parts of the world though it was really otherwise but a desolate disconsolate wilderness for says he there is not a river but runs goldnot a desert but without ploughing bears a crop of ivory what mines of gold what immense stores of gold those mountains may contain from whence these rivers come or the shores which these waters run by we know not but may imagine that they must be inconceivably rich seeing so much is washed down the stream by the water washing the sides of the land that the quantity suffices all the traders which the european world send thither we asked him how far they went for it seeing the ships only trade upon the coast he told us that the negroes on the coast search the rivers up for the length of 150 or 200 miles and would be out a month or two or three at a time and always come home sufficiently rewarded but says he they never come thus far and yet hereabouts is as much gold as there upon this he told us that he believed he might have gotten a hundred pounds weight of gold since he came thither if he had employed himself to look and work for it but as he knew not what to do with it and had long since despaired of being ever delivered from the misery he was in he had entirely omitted it for what advantage had it been to me said he or what richer had i been if i had a ton of gold dust and lay and wallowed in it the richness of it said he would not give me one moments felicity nor relieve me in the present exigency nay says he as you all see it would not buy me clothes to cover me or a drop of drink to save me from perishing it is of no value here says he there are several people among these huts that would weigh gold against a few glass beads or a cockleshell and give you a handful of golddust for a handful of cowries nbthese are little shells which our children call blackamoors teeth  when he had said thus he pulled out a piece of an earthen pot baked hard in the sun here says he is some of the dirt of this country and if i would i could have got a great deal more and showing it to us i believe there was in it between two and three pounds weight of golddust of the same kind and colour with that we had gotten already as before after we had looked at it a while he told us smiling we were his deliverers and all he had as well as his life was ours and therefore as this would be of value to us when we came to our own country so he desired we would accept of it among us and that was the only time that he had repented that he had picked up no more of it  i spoke for him as his interpreter to my comrades and in their names thanked him but speaking to them in portuguese i desired them to defer the acceptance of his kindness to the next morning and so i did telling him we would further talk of this part in the morning so we parted for that time  when he was gone i found they were all wonderfully affected with his discourse and with the generosity of his temper as well as the magnificence of his present which in another place had been extraordinary upon the whole not to detain you with circumstances we agreed that seeing he was now one of our number and that as we were a relief to him in carrying him out of the dismal condition he was in so he was equally a relief to us in being our guide through the rest of the country our interpreter with the natives and our director how to manage with the savages and how to enrich ourselves with the wealth of the country that therefore we would put his gold among our common stock and every one should give him as much as would make his up just as much as any single share of our own and for the future we would take our lot together taking his solemn engagement to us as we had before one to another that we would not conceal the least grain of gold we found one from another  in the next conference we acquainted him with the adventures of the golden river and how we had shared what we got there so that every man had a larger stock than he for his share that therefore instead of taking any from him we had resolved every one to add a little to him he appeared very glad that we had met with such good success but would not take a grain from us till at last pressing him very hard he told us that then he would take it thusthat when we came to get any more he would have so much out of the first as should make him even and then we would go on as equal adventurers and thus we agreed  he then told us he thought it would not be an unprofitable adventure if before we set forward and after we had got a stock of provisions we should make a journey north to the edge of the desert he had told us of from whence our negroes might bring every one a large elephants tooth and that he would get some more to assist and that after a certain length of carriage they might be conveyed by canoes to the coast where they would yield a very great profit  i objected against this on account of our other design we had of getting golddust and that our negroes who we knew would be faithful to us would get much more by searching the rivers for gold for us than by lugging a great tooth of a hundred and fifty pounds weight a hundred miles or more which would be an insufferable labour to them after so hard a journey and would certainly kill them  he acquiesced in the justice of this answer but fain would have had us gone to see the woody part of the hill and the edge of the desert that we might see how the elephants teeth lay scattered up and down there but when we told him the story of what we had seen before as is said above he said no more  we stayed here twelve days during which time the natives were very obliging to us and brought us fruits pompions and a root like carrots though of quite another taste but not unpleasant neither and some guineafowls whose names we did not know in short they brought us plenty of what they had and we lived very well and we gave them all such little things as our cutler had made for he had now a whole bag full of them  on the thirteenth day we set forward taking our new gentleman with us at parting the negro king sent two savages with a present to him of some dried flesh but i do not remember what it was and he gave him again three silver birds which our cutler helped him to which i assure you was a present for a king  we travelled now south a little west and here we found the first river for above 2000 miles march whose waters run south all the rest running north or west we followed this river which was no bigger than a good large brook in england till it began to increase its water every now and then we found our englishman went down as it were privately to the water which was to try the land at length after a days march upon this river he came running up to us with his hands full of sand and saying look here upon looking we found that a good deal of gold lay spangled among the sand of the river now says he i think we may begin to work so he divided our negroes into couples and set them to work to search and wash the sand and ooze in the bottom of the water where it was not deep  in the first day and a quarter our men all together had gathered a pound and two ounces of gold or thereabouts and as we found the quantity increased the farther we went we followed it about three days till another small rivulet joined the first and then searching up the stream we found gold there too so we pitched our camp in the angle where the rivers joined and we diverted ourselves as i may call it in washing the gold out of the sand of the river and in getting provisions  here we stayed thirteen days more in which time we had many pleasant adventures with the savages too long to mention here and some of them too homely to tell of for some of our men had made something free with their women which had not our new guide made peace for us with one of their men at the price of seven fine bits of silver which our artificer had cut out into the shapes of lions and fishes and birds and had punched holes to hang them up by an inestimable treasure we must have gone to war with them and all their people  all the while we were busy washing golddust out of the rivers and our negroes the like our ingenious cutler was hammering and cutting and he was grown so dexterous by use that he formed all manner of images he cut out elephants tigers civet cats ostriches eagles cranes fowls fishes and indeed whatever he pleased in thin plates of hammered gold for his silver and iron were almost all gone  at one of the towns of these savage nations we were very friendly received by their king and as he was very much taken with our workmans toys he sold him an elephant cut out of a gold plate as thin as a sixpence at an extravagant rate he was so much taken with it that he would not be quiet till he had given him almost a handful of golddust as they call it i suppose it might weigh threequarters of a pound the piece of gold that the elephant was made of might be about the weight of a pistole rather less than more our artist was so honest though the labour and art were all his own that he brought all the gold and put it into our common stock but we had indeed no manner of reason in the least to be covetous for as our new guide told us we that were strong enough to defend ourselves and had time enough to stay for we were none of us in haste might in time get together what quantity of gold we pleased even to an hundred pounds weight each man if we thought fit and therefore he told us though he had as much reason to be sick of the country as any of us yet if we thought to turn our march a little to the southeast and pitch upon a place proper for our headquarters we might find provisions plenty enough and extend ourselves over the country among the rivers for two or three years to the right and left and we should soon find the advantage of it  the proposal however good as to the profitable part of it suited none of us for we were all more desirous to get home than to be rich being tired of the excessive fatigue of above a years continual wandering among deserts and wild beasts  however the tongue of our new acquaintance had a kind of charm in it and used such arguments and had so much the power of persuasion that there was no resisting him he told us it was preposterous not to take the fruit of all our labours now we were come to the harvest that we might see the hazard the europeans run with ships and men and at great expense to fetch a little gold and that we that were in the centre of it to go away emptyhanded was unaccountable that we were strong enough to fight our way through whole nations and might make our journey afterward to what part of the coast we pleased and we should never forgive ourselves when we came to our own country to see we had 500 pistoles in gold and might as easily have had 5000 or 10000 or what we pleased that he was no more covetous than we but seeing it was in all our powers to retrieve our misfortunes at once and to make ourselves easy for all our lives he could not be faithful to us or grateful for the good we had done him if he did not let us see the advantage we had in our hands and he assured us he would make it clear to our own understanding that we might in two years time by good management and by the help of our negroes gather every man a hundred pounds weight of gold and get together perhaps two hundred ton of teeth whereas if once we pushed on to the coast and separated we should never be able to see that place again with our eyes or do any more than sinners did with heavenwish themselves there but know they can never come at it  our surgeon was the first man that yielded to his reasoning and after him the gunner and they too indeed had a great influence over us but none of the rest had any mind to stay nor i neither i must confess for i had no notion of a great deal of money or what to do with myself or what to do with it if i had it i thought i had enough already and all the thoughts i had about disposing of it if i came to europe was only how to spend it as fast as i could buy me some clothes and go to sea again to be a drudge for more  however he prevailed with us by his good words at last to stay but for six months in the country and then if we did resolve to go he would submit so at length we yielded to that and he carried us about fifty english miles southeast where we found several rivulets of water which seemed to come all from a great ridge of mountains which lay to the northeast and which by our calculation must be the beginning that way of the great waste which we had been forced northward to avoid  here we found the country barren enough but yet we had by his direction plenty of food for the savages round us upon giving them some of our toys as i have so often mentioned brought us in whatever they had and here we found some maize or indian wheat which the negro women planted as we sow seeds in a garden and immediately our new provider ordered some of our negroes to plant it and it grew up presently and by watering it often we had a crop in less than three months growth  as soon as we were settled and our camp fixed we fell to the old trade of fishing for gold in the rivers mentioned above and our english gentleman so well knew how to direct our search that we scarce ever lost our labour  one time having set us to work he asked if we would give him leave with four or five negroes to go out for six or seven days to seek his fortune and see what he could discover in the country assuring us whatever he got should be for the public stock we all gave him our consent and lent him a gun and two of our men desiring to go with him they took then six negroes with them and two of our buffaloes that came with us the whole journey they took about eight days provision of bread with them but no flesh except about as much dried flesh as would serve them two days  they travelled up to the top of the mountains i mentioned just now where they saw as our men afterwards vouched it to be the same desert which we were so justly terrified at when we were on the farther side and which by our calculation could not be less than 300 miles broad and above 600 miles in length without knowing where it ended  the journal of their travels is too long to enter upon here they stayed out twoandfifty days when they brought us seventeen pound and something more for we had no exact weight of golddust some of it in much larger pieces than any we had found before besides about fifteen ton of elephants teeth which he had partly by good usage and partly by bad obliged the savages of the country to fetch and bring down to him from the mountains and which he made others bring with him quite down to our camp indeed we wondered what was coming to us when we saw him attended with above 200 negroes but he soon undeceived us when he made them all throw down their burdens on a heap at the entrance of our camp  besides this they brought two lions skins and five leopards skins very large and very fine he asked our pardon for his long stay and that he had made no greater a booty but told us he had one excursion more to make which he hoped should turn to a better account  so having rested himself and rewarded the savages that brought the teeth for him with some bits of silver and iron cut out diamond fashion and with two shaped like little dogs he sent them away mightily pleased  the second journey he went some more of our men desired to go with him and they made a troop of ten white men and ten savages and the two buffaloes to carry their provisions and ammunition they took the same course only not exactly the same track and they stayed thirtytwo days only in which time they killed no less than fifteen leopards three lions and several other creatures and brought us home fourandtwenty pound some ounces of golddust and only six elephants teeth but they were very great ones  our friend the englishman showed us that now our time was well bestowed for in five months which we had stayed here we had gathered so much golddust that when we came to share it we had five pound and a quarter to a man besides what we had before and besides six or seven pound weight which we had at several times given our artificer to make baubles with and now we talked of going forward to the coast to put an end to our journey but our guide laughed at us then nay you cant go now says he for the rainy season begins next month and there will be no stirring then this we found indeed reasonable so we resolved to furnish ourselves with provisions that we might not be obliged to go abroad too much in the rain and we spread ourselves some one way and some another as far as we cared to venture to get provisions and our negroes killed us some deer which we cured as well as we could in the sun for we had now no salt  by this time the rainy months were set in and we could scarce for above two months look out of our huts but that was not all for the rivers were so swelled with the landfloods that we scarce knew the little brooks and rivulets from the great navigable rivers this had been a very good opportunity to have conveyed by water upon rafts our elephants teeth of which we had a very great pile for as we always gave the savages some reward for their labour the very women would bring us teeth upon every opportunity and sometimes a great tooth carried between two so that our quantity was increased to about twoandtwenty ton of teeth  as soon as the weather proved fair again he told us he would not press us to any further stay since we did not care whether we got any more gold or no that we were indeed the first men he ever met with in his life that said they had gold enough and of whom it might be truly said that when it lay under our feet we would not stoop to take it up but since he had made us a promise he would not break it nor press us to make any further stay only he thought he ought to tell us that now was the time after the landflood when the greatest quantity of gold was found and that if we stayed but one month we should see thousands of savages spread themselves over the whole country to wash the gold out of the sand for the european ships which would come on the coast that they do it then because the rage of the floods always works down a great deal of gold out of the hills and if we took the advantage to be there before them we did not know what extraordinary things we might find  this was so forcible and so well argued that it appeared in all our faces we were prevailed upon so we told him we would all stay for though it was true we were all eager to be gone yet the evident prospect of so much advantage could not well be resisted that he was greatly mistaken when he suggested that we did not desire to increase our store of gold and in that we were resolved to make the utmost use of the advantage that was in our hands and would stay as long as any gold was to be had if it was another year  he could hardly express the joy he was in on this occasion and the fair weather coming on we began just as he directed to search about the rivers for more gold at first we had but little encouragement and began to be doubtful but it was very plain that the reason was the water was not fully fallen or the rivers reduced to their usual channel but in a few days we were fully requited and found much more gold than at first and in bigger lumps and one of our men washed out of the sand a piece of gold as big as a small nut which weighed by our estimationfor we had no small weightsalmost an ounce and a half  this success made us extremely diligent and in little more than a month we had altogether gotten near sixty pound weight of gold but after this as he told us we found abundance of the savages men women and children hunting every river and brook and even the dry land of the hills for gold so that we could do nothing like then compared to what we had done before  but our artificer found a way to make other people find us in gold without our own labour for when these people began to appear he had a considerable quantity of his toys birds beasts c such as before ready for them and the english gentleman being the interpreter he brought the savages to admire them so our cutler had trade enough and to be sure sold his goods at a monstrous rate for he would get an ounce of gold sometimes two for a bit of silver perhaps of the value of a groat nay if it were iron and if it was of gold they would not give the more for it and it was incredible almost to think what a quantity of gold he got that way  in a word to bring this happy journey to a conclusion we increased our stock of gold here in three months stay more to such a degree that bringing it all to a common stock in order to share it we divided almost four pound weight again to every man and then we set forward for the gold coast to see what method we could find out for our passage into europe  there happened several remarkable incidents in this part of our journey as to how we were or were not received friendly by the several nations of savages through which we passed how we delivered one negro king from captivity who had been a benefactor to our new guide and now our guide in gratitude by our assistance restored him to his kingdom which perhaps might contain about 300 subjects how he entertained us and how he made his subjects go with our englishmen and fetch all our elephants teeth which we had been obliged to leave behind us and to carry them for us to the river the name of which i forgot where we made rafts and in eleven days more came down to one of the dutch settlements on the gold coast where we arrived in perfect health and to our great satisfaction as for our cargo of teeth we sold it to the dutch factory and received clothes and other necessaries for ourselves and such of our negroes as we thought fit to keep with us and it is to be observed that we had four pound of gunpowder left when we ended our journey the negro prince we made perfectly free clothed him out of our common stock and gave him a pound and a half of gold for himself which he knew very well how to manage and here we all parted after the most friendly manner possible our englishman remained in the dutch factory some time and as i heard afterwards died there of grief for he having sent a thousand pounds sterling over to england by the way of holland for his refuge at his return to his friends the ship was taken by the french and the effects all lost  the rest of my comrades went away in a small bark to the two portuguese factories near gambia in the latitude of fourteen and i with two negroes which i kept with me went away to cape coast castle where i got passage for england and arrived there in september and thus ended my first harvest of wild oats the rest were not sowed to so much advantage  i had neither friend relation nor acquaintance in england though it was my native country i had consequently no person to trust with what i had or to counsel me to secure or save it but falling into ill company and trusting the keeper of a publichouse in rotherhithe with a great part of my money and hastily squandering away the rest all that great sum which i got with so much pains and hazard was gone in little more than two years time and as i even rage in my own thoughts to reflect upon the manner how it was wasted so i need record no more the rest merits to be concealed with blushes for that it was spent in all kinds of folly and wickedness so this scene of my life may be said to have begun in theft and ended in luxury a sad settingout and a worse coming home  about the year  i began to see the bottom of my stock and that it was time to think of further adventures for my spoilers as i call them began to let me know that as my money declined their respect would ebb with it and that i had nothing to expect of them further than as i might command it by the force of my money which in short would not go an inch the further for all that had been spent in their favour before  this shocked me very much and i conceived a just abhorrence of their ingratitude but it wore off nor had i met with any regret at the wasting so glorious a sum of money as i brought to england with me  i next shipped myself in an evil hour to be sure on a voyage to cadiz in a ship called the  and in the course of our voyage being on the coast of spain was obliged to put into the groyn by a strong southwest wind  here i fell into company with some masters of mischief and among them one forwarder than the rest began an intimate confidence with me so that we called one another brothers and communicated all our circumstances to one another his name was harris this fellow came to me one morning asking me if i would go on shore and i agreed so we got the captains leave for the boat and went together when we were together he asked me if i had a mind for an adventure that might make amends for all past misfortunes i told him yes with all my heart for i did not care where i went having nothing to lose and no one to leave behind me  he then asked me if i would swear to be secret and that if i did not agree to what he proposed i would nevertheless never betray him i readily bound myself to that upon the most solemn imprecations and curses that the devil and both of us could invent  he told me then there was a brave fellow in the other ship pointing to another english ship which rode in the harbour who in concert with some of the men had resolved to mutiny the next morning and run away with the ship and that if we could get strength enough among our ships company we might do the same i liked the proposal very well and he got eight of us to join with him and he told us that as soon as his friend had begun the work and was master of the ship we should be ready to do the like this was his plot and i without the least hesitation either at the villainy of the fact or the difficulty of performing it came immediately into the wicked conspiracy and so it went on among us but we could not bring our part to perfection  accordingly on the day appointed his correspondent in the other ship whose name was wilmot began the work and having seized the captains mate and other officers secured the ship and gave the signal to us we were but eleven in our ship who were in the conspiracy nor could we get any more that we could trust so that leaving the ship we all took the boat and went off to join the other  having thus left the ship i was in we were entertained with a great deal of joy by captain wilmot and his new gang and being well prepared for all manner of roguery bold desperate i mean myself without the least checks of conscience for what i was entered upon or for anything i might do much less with any apprehension of what might be the consequence of it i say having thus embarked with this crew which at last brought me to consort with the most famous pirates of the age some of whom have ended their journals at the gallows i think the giving an account of some of my other adventures may be an agreeable piece of story and this i may venture to say beforehand upon the word of a pirate that i shall not be able to recollect the full no not by far of the great variety which has formed one of the most reprobate schemes that ever man was capable to present to the world  i that was as i have hinted before an original thief and a pirate even by inclination before was now in my element and never undertook anything in my life with more particular satisfaction  captain wilmot for so we are now to call him being thus possessed of a ship and in the manner as you have heard it may be easily concluded he had nothing to do to stay in the port or to wait either the attempts that might be made from the shore or any change that might happen among his men on the contrary we weighed anchor the same tide and stood out to sea steering away for the canaries our ship had twentytwo guns but was able to carry thirty and besides as she was fitted out for a merchantship only she was not furnished either with ammunition or smallarms sufficient for our design or for the occasion we might have in case of a fight so we put into cadiz that is to say we came to an anchor in the bay and the captain and one whom we called young captain kidd who was the gunner landed and some of the men who could best be trusted among whom was my comrade harris who was made second mate and myself who was made a lieutenant some bales of english goods were proposed to be carried on shore with us for sale but my comrade who was a complete fellow at his business proposed a better way for it and having been in the town before told us in short that he would buy what powder and bullet smallarms or anything else we wanted on his own word to be paid for when they came on board in such english goods as we had there this was much the best way and accordingly he and the captain went on shore by themselves and having made such a bargain as they found for their turn came away again in two hours time and bringing only a butt of wine and five casks of brandy with them we all went on board again  the next morning two barcos longos came off to us deeply laden with five spaniards on board them for traffic our captain sold them good pennyworths and they delivered us sixteen barrels of powder twelve small rundlets of fine powder for our smallarms sixty muskets and twelve fusees for the officers seventeen ton of cannonball fifteen barrels of musketbullets with some swords and twenty good pair of pistols besides this they brought thirteen butts of wine for we that were now all become gentlemen scorned to drink the ships beer also sixteen puncheons of brandy with twelve barrels of raisins and twenty chests of lemons all which we paid for in english goods and over and above the captain received six hundred pieces of eight in money they would have come again but we would stay no longer  from hence we sailed to the canaries and from thence onward to the west indies where we committed some depredation upon the spaniards for provisions and took some prizes but none of any great value while i remained with them which was not long at that time for having taken a spanish sloop on the coast of carthagena my friend made a motion to me that we should desire captain wilmot to put us into the sloop with a proportion of arms and ammunition and let us try what we could do she being much fitter for our business than the great ship and a better sailer this he consented to and we appointed our rendezvous at tobago making an agreement that whatever was taken by either of our ships should be shared among the ships company of both all which we very punctually observed and joined our ships again about fifteen months after at the island of tobago as above  we cruised near two years in those seas chiefly upon the spaniards not that we made any difficulty of taking english ships or dutch or french if they came in our way and particularly captain wilmot attacked a new england ship bound from the madeiras to jamaica and another bound from new york to barbados with provisions which last was a very happy supply to us but the reason why we meddled as little with english vessels as we could was first because if they were ships of any force we were sure of more resistance from them and secondly because we found the english ships had less booty when taken for the spaniards generally had money on board and that was what we best knew what to do with captain wilmot was indeed more particularly cruel when he took any english vessel that they might not too soon have advice of him in england and so the menofwar have orders to look out for him but this part i bury in silence for the present  we increased our stock in these two years considerably having taken 60000 pieces of eight in one vessel and 100000 in another and being thus first grown rich we resolved to be strong too for we had taken a brigantine built at virginia an excellent seaboat and a good sailer and able to carry twelve guns and a large spanish frigatebuilt ship that sailed incomparably well also and which afterwards by the help of good carpenters we fitted up to carry twentyeight guns and now we wanted more hands so we put away for the bay of campeachy not doubting we should ship as many men there as we pleased and so we did  here we sold the sloop that i was in and captain wilmot keeping his own ship i took the command of the spanish frigate as captain and my comrade harris as eldest lieutenant and a bold enterprising fellow he was as any the world afforded one culverdine was put into the brigantine so that we were now three stout ships well manned and victualled for twelve months for we had taken two or three sloops from new england and new york laden with flour peas and barrelled beef and pork going for jamaica and barbados and for more beef we went on shore on the island of cuba where we killed as many black cattle as we pleased though we had very little salt to cure them  out of all the prizes we took here we took their powder and bullet their smallarms and cutlasses and as for their men we always took the surgeon and the carpenter as persons who were of particular use to us upon many occasions nor were they always unwilling to go with us though for their own security in case of accidents they might easily pretend they were carried away by force of which i shall give a pleasant account in the course of my other expeditions  we had one very merry fellow here a quaker whose name was william walters whom we took out of a sloop bound from pennsylvania to barbados he was a surgeon and they called him doctor but he was not employed in the sloop as a surgeon but was going to barbados to get a berth as the sailors call it however he had all his surgeons chests on board and we made him go with us and take all his implements with him he was a comic fellow indeed a man of very good solid sense and an excellent surgeon but what was worth all very goodhumoured and pleasant in his conversation and a bold stout brave fellow too as any we had among us  i found william as i thought not very averse to go along with us and yet resolved to do it so that it might be apparent he was taken away by force and to this purpose he comes to me friend says he thou sayest i must go with thee and it is not in my power to resist thee if i would but i desire thou wilt oblige the master of the sloop which i am on board to certify under his hand that i was taken away by force and against my will and this he said with so much satisfaction in his face that i could not but understand him ay ay says i whether it be against your will or no ill make him and all the men give you a certificate of it or ill take them all along with us and keep them till they do so i drew up a certificate myself wherein i wrote that he was taken away by main force as a prisoner by a pirate ship that they carried away his chest and instruments first and then bound his hands behind him and forced him into their boat and this was signed by the master and all his men  accordingly i fell aswearing at him and called to my men to tie his hands behind him and so we put him into our boat and carried him away when i had him on board i called him to me now friend says i i have brought you away by force it is true but i am not of the opinion i have brought you away so much against your will as they imagine come says i you will be a useful man to us and you shall have very good usage among us so i unbound his hands and first ordered all things that belonged to him to be restored to him and our captain gave him a dram  thou hast dealt friendly by me says he and i will be plain with thee whether i came willingly to thee or not i shall make myself as useful to thee as i can but thou knowest it is not my business to meddle when thou art to fight no no says the captain but you may meddle a little when we share the money those things are useful to furnish a surgeons chest says william and smiled but i shall be moderate  in short william was a most agreeable companion but he had the better of us in this part that if we were taken we were sure to be hanged and he was sure to escape and he knew it well enough but in short he was a sprightly fellow and fitter to be captain than any of us i shall have often an occasion to speak of him in the rest of the story  our cruising so long in these seas began now to be so well known that not in england only but in france and spain accounts had been made public of our adventures and many stories told how we murdered the people in cold blood tying them back to back and throwing them into the sea one half of which however was not true though more was done than is fit to speak of here  the consequence of this however was that several english menofwar were sent to the west indies and were particularly instructed to cruise in the bay of mexico and the gulf of florida and among the bahama islands if possible to attack us we were not so ignorant of things as not to expect this after so long a stay in that part of the world but the first certain account we had of them was at honduras when a vessel coming in from jamaica told us that two english menofwar were coming directly from jamaica thither in quest of us we were indeed as it were embayed and could not have made the least shift to have got off if they had come directly to us but as it happened somebody had informed them that we were in the bay of campeachy and they went directly thither by which we were not only free of them but were so much to the windward of them that they could not make any attempt upon us though they had known we were there  we took this advantage and stood away for carthagena and from thence with great difficulty beat it up at a distance from under the shore for st martha till we came to the dutch island of curacoa and from thence to the island of tobago which as before was our rendezvous which being a deserted uninhabited island we at the same time made use of for a retreat here the captain of the brigantine died and captain harris at that time my lieutenant took the command of the brigantine  here we came to a resolution to go away to the coast of brazil and from thence to the cape of good hope and so for the east indies but captain harris as i have said being now captain of the brigantine alleged that his ship was too small for so long a voyage but that if captain wilmot would consent he would take the hazard of another cruise and he would follow us in the first ship he could take so we appointed our rendezvous to be at madagascar which was done by my recommendation of the place and the plenty of provisions to be had there  accordingly he went away from us in an evil hour for instead of taking a ship to follow us he was taken as i heard afterwards by an english manofwar and being laid in irons died of mere grief and anger before he came to england his lieutenant i have heard was afterwards executed in england for a pirate and this was the end of the man who first brought me into this unhappy trade  we parted from tobago three days after bending our course for the coast of brazil but had not been at sea above twentyfour hours when we were separated by a terrible storm which held three days with very little abatement or intermission in this juncture captain wilmot happened unluckily to be on board my ship to his great mortification for we not only lost sight of his ship but never saw her more till we came to madagascar where she was cast away in short after having in this tempest lost our foretopmast we were forced to put back to the isle of tobago for shelter and to repair our damage which brought us all very near our destruction  we were no sooner on shore here and all very busy looking out for a piece of timber for a topmast but we perceived standing in for the shore an english manofwar of thirtysix guns it was a great surprise to us indeed because we were disabled so much but to our great good fortune we lay pretty snug and close among the high rocks and the manofwar did not see us but stood off again upon his cruise so we only observed which way she went and at night leaving our work resolved to stand off to sea steering the contrary way from that which we observed she went and this we found had the desired success for we saw him no more we had gotten an old mizzentopmast on board which made us a jury foretopmast for the present and so we stood away for the isle of trinidad where though there were spaniards on shore yet we landed some men with our boat and cut a very good piece of fir to make us a new topmast which we got fitted up effectually and also we got some cattle here to eke out our provisions and calling a council of war among ourselves we resolved to quit those seas for the present and steer away for the coast of brazil  the first thing we attempted here was only getting fresh water but we learnt that there lay the portuguese fleet at the bay of all saints bound for lisbon ready to sail and only waited for a fair wind this made us lie by wishing to see them put to sea and accordingly as they were with or without convoy to attack or avoid them  it sprung up a fresh gale in the evening at sw by w which being fair for the portugal fleet and the weather pleasant and agreeable we heard the signal given to unmoor and running in under the island of si we hauled our mainsail and foresail up in the brails lowered the topsails upon the cap and clewed them up that we might lie as snug as we could expecting their coming out and the next morning saw the whole fleet come out accordingly but not at all to our satisfaction for they consisted of twentysix sail and most of them ships of force as well as burthen both merchantmen and menofwar so seeing there was no meddling we lay still where we were also till the fleet was out of sight and then stood off and on in hopes of meeting with further purchase  it was not long before we saw a sail and immediately gave her chase but she proved an excellent sailer and standing out to sea we saw plainly she trusted to her heelsthat is to say to her sails however as we were a clean ship we gained upon her though slowly and had we had a day before us we should certainly have come up with her but it grew dark apace and in that case we knew we should lose sight of her  our merry quaker perceiving us to crowd still after her in the dark wherein we could not see which way she went came very dryly to me friend singleton says he dost thee know what we are adoing says i yes why we are chasing yon ship are we not and how dost thou know that says he very gravely still nay thats true says i again we cannot be sure yes friend says he i think we may be sure that we are running away from her not chasing her i am afraid adds he thou art turned quaker and hast resolved not to use the hand of power or art a coward and art flying from thy enemy  what do you mean says i i think i swore at him what do you sneer at now you have always one dry rub or another to give us  nay says he it is plain enough the ship stood off to sea due east on purpose to lose us and thou mayest be sure her business does not lie that way for what should she do at the coast of africa in this latitude which should be as far south as congo or angola but as soon as it is dark that we would lose sight of her she will tack and stand away west again for the brazil coast and for the bay where thou knowest she was going before and are we not then running away from her i am greatly in hopes friend says the dry gibing creature thou wilt turn quaker for i see thou art not for fighting  very well william says i then i shall make an excellent pirate however william was in the right and i apprehended what he meant immediately and captain wilmot who lay very sick in his cabin overhearing us understood him as well as i and called out to me that william was right and it was our best way to change our course and stand away for the bay where it was ten to one but we should snap her in the morning  accordingly we went aboutship got our larboard tacks on board set the topgallant sails and crowded for the bay of all saints where we came to an anchor early in the morning just out of gunshot of the forts we furled our sails with ropeyarns that we might haul home the sheets without going up to loose them and lowering our main and foreyards looked just as if we had lain there a good while  in two hours afterwards we saw our game standing in for the bay with all the sail she could make and she came innocently into our very mouths for we lay still till we saw her almost within gunshot when our foremost gears being stretched fore and aft we first ran up our yards and then hauled home the topsail sheets the ropeyarns that furled them giving way of themselves the sails were set in a few minutes at the same time slipping our cable we came upon her before she could get under way upon the other tack they were so surprised that they made little or no resistance but struck after the first broadside  we were considering what to do with her when william came to me hark thee friend says he thou hast made a fine piece of work of it now hast thou not to borrow thy neighbours ship here just at thy neighbours door and never ask him leave now dost thou not think there are some menofwar in the port thou hast given them the alarm sufficiently thou wilt have them upon thy back before night depend upon it to ask thee wherefore thou didst so  truly william said i for aught i know that may be true what then shall we do next says he thou hast but two things to do either to go in and take all the rest or else get thee gone before they come out and take thee for i see they are hoisting a topmast to yon great ship in order to put to sea immediately and they wont be long before they come to talk with thee and what wilt thou say to them when they ask thee why thou borrowedst their ship without leave  as william said so it was we could see by our glasses they were all in a hurry manning and fitting some sloops they had there and a large manofwar and it was plain they would soon be with us but we were not at a loss what to do we found the ship we had taken was laden with nothing considerable for our purpose except some cocoa some sugar and twenty barrels of flour the rest of her cargo was hides so we took out all we thought fit for our turn and among the rest all her ammunition great shot and smallarms and turned her off we also took a cable and three anchors she had which were for our purpose and some of her sails she had enough left just to carry her into port and that was all  having done this we stood on upon the brazil coast southward till we came to the mouth of the river janeiro but as we had two days the wind blowing hard at se and sse we were obliged to come to an anchor under a little island and wait for a wind in this time the portuguese had it seems given notice over land to the governor there that a pirate was upon the coast so that when we came in view of the port we saw two menofwar riding just without the bar whereof one we found was getting under sail with all possible speed having slipped her cable on purpose to speak with us the other was not so forward but was preparing to follow in less than an hour they stood both fair after us with all the sail they could make  had not the night come on williams words had been made good they would certainly have asked us the question what we did there for we found the foremost ship gained upon us especially upon one tack for we plied away from them to windward but in the dark losing sight of them we resolved to change our course and stand away directly for sea not doubting that we should lose them in the night  whether the portuguese commander guessed we would do so or no i know not but in the morning when the daylight appeared instead of having lost him we found him in chase of us about a league astern only to our great good fortune we could see but one of the two however this one was a great ship carried sixandforty guns and an admirable sailer as appeared by her outsailing us for our ship was an excellent sailer too as i have said before  when i found this i easily saw there was no remedy but we must engage and as we knew we could expect no quarter from those scoundrels the portuguese a nation i had an original aversion to i let captain wilmot know how it was the captain sick as he was jumped up in the cabin and would be led out upon the deck for he was very weak to see how it was well says he well fight them  our men were all in good heart before but to see the captain so brisk who had lain ill of a calenture ten or eleven days gave them double courage and they went all hands to work to make a clear ship and be ready william the quaker comes to me with a kind of a smile friend says he what does yon ship follow us for why says i to fight us you may be sure well says he and will he come up with us dost thou think yes said i you see she will why then friend says the dry wretch why dost thou run from her still when thou seest she will overtake thee will it be better for us to be overtaken farther off than here much as one for that says i why what would you have us do do says he let us not give the poor man more trouble than needs must let us stay for him and hear what he has to say to us he will talk to us in powder and ball said i very well then says he if that be his country language we must talk to him in the same must we not or else how shall he understand us very well william says i we understand you and the captain as ill as he was called to me williams right again says he as good here as a league farther so he gives a word of command haul up the mainsail well shorten sail for him  accordingly we shortened sail and as we expected her upon our leeside we being then upon our starboard tack brought eighteen of our guns to the larboard side resolving to give him a broadside that should warm him it was about halfanhour before he came up with us all which time we luffed up that we might keep the wind of him by which he was obliged to run up under our lee as we designed him when we got him upon our quarter we edged down and received the fire of five or six of his guns by this time you may be sure all our hands were at their quarters so we clapped our helm hard aweather let go the leebraces of the maintop sail and laid it aback and so our ship fell athwart the portuguese ships hawse then we immediately poured in our broadside raking them fore and aft and killed them a great many men  the portuguese we could see were in the utmost confusion and not being aware of our design their ship having fresh way ran their bowsprit into the fore part of our main shrouds as that they could not easily get clear of us and so we lay locked after that manner the enemy could not bring above five or six guns besides their smallarms to bear upon us while we played our whole broadside upon him  in the middle of the heat of this fight as i was very busy upon the quarterdeck the captain calls to me for he never stirred from us what the devil is friend william adoing yonder says the captain has he any business upon deck i stepped forward and there was friend william with two or three stout fellows lashing the ships bowsprit fast to our mainmast for fear they should get away from us and every now and then he pulled a bottle out of his pocket and gave the men a dram to encourage them the shot flew about his ears as thick as may be supposed in such an action where the portuguese to give them their due fought very briskly believing at first they were sure of their game and trusting to their superiority but there was william as composed and in as perfect tranquillity as to danger as if he had been over a bowl of punch only very busy securing the matter that a ship of fortysix guns should not run away from a ship of eightandtwenty  this work was too hot to hold long our men behaved bravely our gunner a gallant man shouted below pouring in his shot at such a rate that the portuguese began to slacken their fire we had dismounted several of their guns by firing in at their forecastle and raking them as i said fore and aft presently comes william up to me friend says he very calmly what dost thou mean why dost thou not visit thy neighbour in the ship the door being open for thee i understood him immediately for our guns had so torn their hull that we had beat two portholes into one and the bulkhead of their steerage was split to pieces so that they could not retire to their close quarters so i gave the word immediately to board them our second lieutenant with about thirty men entered in an instant over the forecastle followed by some more with the boatswain and cutting in pieces about twentyfive men that they found upon the deck and then throwing some grenadoes into the steerage they entered there also upon which the portuguese cried quarter presently and we mastered the ship contrary indeed to our own expectation for we would have compounded with them if they would have sheered off but laying them athwart the hawse at first and following our fire furiously without giving them any time to get clear of us and work their ship by this means though they had sixandforty guns they were not able to fight above five or six as i said above for we beat them immediately from their guns in the forecastle and killed them abundance of men between decks so that when we entered they had hardly found men enough to fight us hand to hand upon their deck  the surprise of joy to hear the portuguese cry quarter and see their ancient struck was so great to our captain who as i have said was reduced very weak with a high fever that it gave him new life nature conquered the distemper and the fever abated that very night so that in two or three days he was sensibly better his strength began to come and he was able to give his orders effectually in everything that was material and in about ten days was entirely well and about the ship  in the meantime i took possession of the portuguese manofwar and captain wilmot made me or rather i made myself captain of her for the present about thirty of their seamen took service with us some of which were french some genoese and we set the rest on shore the next day on a little island on the coast of brazil except some wounded men who were not in a condition to be removed and whom we were bound to keep on board but we had an occasion afterwards to dispose of them at the cape where at their own request we set them on shore  captain wilmot as soon as the ship was taken and the prisoners stowed was for standing in for the river janeiro again not doubting but we should meet with the other manofwar who not having been able to find us and having lost the company of her comrade would certainly be returned and might be surprised by the ship we had taken if we carried portuguese colours and our men were all for it  but our friend william gave us better counsel for he came to me friend says he i understand the captain is for sailing back to the rio janeiro in hopes to meet with the other ship that was in chase of thee yesterday is it true dost thou intend it why yes says i william pray why not nay says he thou mayest do so if thou wilt well i know that too william said i but the captain is a man will be ruled by reason what have you to say to it why says william gravely i only ask what is thy business and the business of all the people thou hast with thee is it not to get money yes william it is so in our honest way and wouldest thou says he rather have money without fighting or fighting without money i mean which wouldest thou have by choice suppose it to be left to thee o william says i the first of the two to be sure why then says he what great gain hast thou made of the prize thou hast taken now though it has cost the lives of thirteen of thy men besides some hurt it is true thou hast got the ship and some prisoners but thou wouldest have had twice the booty in a merchantship with not one quarter of the fighting and how dost thou know either what force or what number of men may be in the other ship and what loss thou mayest suffer and what gain it shall be to thee if thou take her i think indeed thou mayest much better let her alone  why william it is true said i and ill go tell the captain what your opinion is and bring you word what he says accordingly in i went to the captain and told him williams reasons and the captain was of his mind that our business was indeed fighting when we could not help it but that our main affair was money and that with as few blows as we could so that adventure was laid aside and we stood along shore again south for the river de la plata expecting some purchase thereabouts especially we had our eyes upon some of the spanish ships from buenos ayres which are generally very rich in silver and one such prize would have done our business we plied about here in the latitude of  south for near a month and nothing offered and here we began to consult what we should do next for we had come to no resolution yet indeed my design was always for the cape de bona speranza and so to the east indies i had heard some flaming stories of captain avery and the fine things he had done in the indies which were doubled and doubled even ten thousand fold and from taking a great prize in the bay of bengal where he took a lady said to be the great moguls daughter with a great quantity of jewels about her we had a story told us that he took a mogul ship so the foolish sailors called it laden with diamonds  i would fain have had friend williams advice whither we should go but he always put it off with some quaking quibble or other in short he did not care for directing us neither whether he made a piece of conscience of it or whether he did not care to venture having it come against him afterwards or no this i know not but we concluded at last without him  we were however pretty long in resolving and hankered about the rio de la plata a long time at last we spied a sail to windward and it was such a sail as i believe had not been seen in that part of the world a great while it wanted not that we should give it chase for it stood directly towards us as well as they that steered could make it and even that was more accident of weather than anything else for if the wind had chopped about anywhere they must have gone with it i leave any man that is a sailor or understands anything of a ship to judge what a figure this ship made when we first saw her and what we could imagine was the matter with her her maintopmast was come by the board about six foot above the cap and fell forward the head of the topgallantmast hanging in the foreshrouds by the stay at the same time the parrel of the mizzentopsailyard by some accident giving way the mizzentopsailbraces the standing part of which being fast to the maintopsail shrouds brought the mizzentopsail yard and all down with it which spread over part of the quarterdeck like an awning the foretopsail was hoisted up twothirds of the mast but the sheets were flown the foreyard was lowered down upon the forecastle the sail loose and part of it hanging overboard in this manner she came down upon us with the wind quartering in a word the figure the whole ship made was the most confounding to men that understood the sea that ever was seen she had no boat neither had she any colours out  when we came near to her we fired a gun to bring her to she took no notice of it nor of us but came on just as she did before we fired again but it was all one at length we came within pistolshot of one another but nobody answered nor appeared so we began to think that it was a ship gone ashore somewhere in distress and the men having forsaken her the high tide had floated her off to sea coming nearer to her we ran up alongside of her so close that we could hear a noise within her and see the motion of several people through her ports  upon this we manned out two boats full of men and very well armed and ordered them to board her at the same minute as near as they could and to enter one at her forechains on the one side and the other amidships on the other side as soon as they came to the ships side a surprising multitude of black sailors such as they were appeared upon deck and in short terrified our men so much that the boat which was to enter her men in the waist stood off again and durst not board her and the men that entered out of the other boat finding the first boat as they thought beaten off and seeing the ship full of men jumped all back again into their boat and put off not knowing what the matter was upon this we prepared to pour in a broadside upon her but our friend william set us to rights again here for it seems he guessed how it was sooner than we did and coming up to me for it was our ship that came up with her friend says he i am of opinion that thou art wrong in this matter and thy men have been wrong also in their conduct ill tell thee how thou shalt take this ship without making use of those things called guns how can that be william said i why said he thou mayest take her with thy helm thou seest they keep no steerage and thou seest the condition they are in board her with thy ship upon her lee quarter and so enter her from the ship i am persuaded thou wilt take her without fighting for there is some mischief has befallen the ship which we know nothing of  in a word it being a smooth sea and little wind i took his advice and laid her aboard immediately our men entered the ship where we found a large ship with upwards of 600 negroes men and women boys and girls and not one christian or white man on board  i was struck with horror at the sight for immediately i concluded as was partly the case that these black devils had got loose had murdered all the white men and thrown them into the sea and i had no sooner told my mind to the men but the thought so enraged them that i had much ado to keep my men from cutting them all in pieces but william with many persuasions prevailed upon them by telling them that it was nothing but what if they were in the negroes condition they would do if they could and that the negroes had really the highest injustice done them to be sold for slaves without their consent and that the law of nature dictated it to them that they ought not to kill them and that it would be wilful murder to do it  this prevailed with them and cooled their first heat so they only knocked down twenty or thirty of them and the rest ran all down between decks to their first places believing as we fancied that we were their first masters come again  it was a most unaccountable difficulty we had next for we could not make them understand one word we said nor could we understand one word ourselves that they said we endeavoured by signs to ask them whence they came but they could make nothing of it we pointed to the great cabin to the roundhouse to the cookroom then to our faces to ask if they had no white men on board and where they were gone but they could not understand what we meant on the other hand they pointed to our boat and to their ship asking questions as well as they could and said a thousand things and expressed themselves with great earnestness but we could not understand a word of it all or know what they meant by any of their signs  we knew very well they must have been taken on board the ship as slaves and that it must be by some european people too we could easily see that the ship was a dutchbuilt ship but very much altered having been built upon and as we supposed in france for we found two or three french books on board and afterwards we found clothes linen lace some old shoes and several other things we found among the provisions some barrels of irish beef some newfoundland fish and several other evidences that there had been christians on board but saw no remains of them we found not a sword gun pistol or weapon of any kind except some cutlasses and the negroes had hid them below where they lay we asked them what was become of all the smallarms pointing to our own and to the places where those belonging to the ship had hung one of the negroes understood me presently and beckoned to me to come upon the deck where taking my fuzee which i never let go out of my hand for some time after we had mastered the shipi say offering to take hold of it he made the proper motion of throwing it into the sea by which i understood as i did afterwards that they had thrown all the smallarms powder shot swords c into the sea believing as i supposed those things would kill them though the men were gone  after we understood this we made no question but that the ships crew having been surprised by these desperate rogues had gone the same way and had been thrown overboard also we looked all over the ship to see if we could find any blood and we thought we did perceive some in several places but the heat of the sun melting the pitch and tar upon the decks made it impossible for us to discern it exactly except in the roundhouse where we plainly saw that there had been much blood we found the scuttle open by which we supposed that the captain and those that were with him had made their retreat into the great cabin or those in the cabin had made their escape up into the roundhouse  but that which confirmed us most of all in what had happened was that upon further inquiry we found that there were seven or eight of the negroes very much wounded two or three of them with shot whereof one had his leg broken and lay in a miserable condition the flesh being mortified and as our friend william said in two days more he would have died william was a most dexterous surgeon and he showed it in this cure for though all the surgeons we had on board both our ships and we had no less than five that called themselves bred surgeons besides two or three who were pretenders or assistantsthough all these gave their opinions that the negros leg must be cut off and that his life could not be saved without it that the mortification had touched the marrow in the bone that the tendons were mortified and that he could never have the use of his leg if it should be cured william said nothing in general but that his opinion was otherwise and that he desired the wound might be searched and that he would then tell them further accordingly he went to work with the leg and as he desired that he might have some of the surgeons to assist him we appointed him two of the ablest of them to help and all of them to look on if they thought fit  william went to work his own way and some of them pretended to find fault at first however he proceeded and searched every part of the leg where he suspected the mortification had touched it in a word he cut off a great deal of mortified flesh in all which the poor fellow felt no pain william proceeded till he brought the vessels which he had cut to bleed and the man to cry out then he reduced the splinters of the bone and calling for help set it as we call it and bound it up and laid the man to rest who found himself much easier than before  at the first opening the surgeons began to triumph the mortification seemed to spread and a long red streak of blood appeared from the wound upwards to the middle of the mans thigh and the surgeons told me the man would die in a few hours i went to look at it and found william himself under some surprise but when i asked him how long he thought the poor fellow could live he looked gravely at me and said as long as thou canst i am not at all apprehensive of his life said he but i would cure him if i could without making a cripple of him i found he was not just then upon the operation as to his leg but was mixing up something to give the poor creature to repel as i thought the spreading contagion and to abate or prevent any feverish temper that might happen in the blood after which he went to work again and opened the leg in two places above the wound cutting out a great deal of mortified flesh which it seemed was occasioned by the bandage which had pressed the parts too much and withal the blood being at the time in a more than common disposition to mortify might assist to spread it  well our friend william conquered all this cleared the spreading mortification and the red streak went off again the flesh began to heal and matter to run and in a few days the mans spirits began to recover his pulse beat regular he had no fever and gathered strength daily and in a word he was a perfect sound man in about ten weeks and we kept him amongst us and made him an able seaman but to return to the ship we never could come at a certain information about it till some of the negroes which we kept on board and whom we taught to speak english gave the account of it afterwards and this maimed man in particular  we inquired by all the signs and motions we could imagine what was become of the people and yet we could get nothing from them our lieutenant was for torturing some of them to make them confess but william opposed that vehemently and when he heard it was under consideration he came to me friend says he i make a request to thee not to put any of these poor wretches to torment why william said i why not you see they will not give any account of what is become of the white men nay says william do not say so i suppose they have given thee a full account of every particular of it how so says i pray what are we the wiser for all their jabbering nay says william that may be thy fault for aught i know thou wilt not punish the poor men because they cannot speak english and perhaps they never heard a word of english before now i may very well suppose that they have given thee a large account of everything for thou seest with what earnestness and how long some of them have talked to thee and if thou canst not understand their language nor they thine how can they help that at the best thou dost but suppose that they have not told thee the whole truth of the story and on the contrary i suppose they have and how wilt thou decide the question whether thou art right or whether i am right besides what can they say to thee when thou askest them a question upon the torture and at the same time they do not understand the question and thou dost not know whether they say ay or no  it is no compliment to my moderation to say i was convinced by these reasons and yet we had all much ado to keep our second lieutenant from murdering some of them to make them tell what if they had told he did not understand one word of it but he would not be persuaded but that the negroes must needs understand him when he asked them whether the ship had any boat or no like ours and what was become of it  but there was no remedy but to wait till we made these people understand english and to adjourn the story till that time the case was thus where they were taken on board the ship that we could never understand because they never knew the english names which we give to those coasts or what nation they were who belonged to the ship because they knew not one tongue from another but thus far the negro i examined who was the same whose leg william had cured told us that they did not speak the same language as we spoke nor the same our portuguese spoke so that in all probability they must be french or dutch  then he told us that the white men used them barbarously that they beat them unmercifully that one of the negro men had a wife and two negro children one a daughter about sixteen years old that a white man abused the negro mans wife and afterwards his daughter which as he said made all the negro men mad and that the womans husband was in a great rage at which the white man was so provoked that he threatened to kill him but in the night the negro man being loose got a great club by which he made us understand he meant a handspike and that when the same frenchman if it was a frenchman came among them again he began again to abuse the negro mans wife at which the negro taking up the handspike knocked his brains out at one blow and then taking the key from him with which he usually unlocked the handcuffs which the negroes were fettered with he set about a hundred of them at liberty who getting up upon the deck by the same scuttle that the white men came down and taking the mans cutlass who was killed and laying hold of what came next them they fell upon the men that were upon the deck and killed them all and afterwards those they found upon the forecastle that the captain and his other men who were in the cabin and the roundhouse defended themselves with great courage and shot out at the loopholes at them by which he and several other men were wounded and some killed but that they broke into the roundhouse after a long dispute where they killed two of the white men but owned that the two white men killed eleven of their men before they could break in and then the rest having got down the scuttle into the great cabin wounded three more of them  that after this the gunner of the ship having secured himself in the gunroom one of his men hauled up the longboat close under the stern and putting into her all the arms and ammunition they could come at got all into the boat and afterwards took in the captain and those that were with him out of the great cabin when they were all thus embarked they resolved to lay the ship aboard again and try to recover it that they boarded the ship in a desperate manner and killed at first all that stood in their way but the negroes being by this time all loose and having gotten some arms though they understood nothing of powder and bullet or guns yet the men could never master them however they lay under the ships bow and got out all the men they had left in the cookroom who had maintained themselves there notwithstanding all the negroes could do and with their smallarms killed between thirty and forty of the negroes but were at last forced to leave them  they could give me no account whereabouts this was whether near the coast of africa or far off or how long it was before the ship fell into our hands only in general it was a great while ago as they called it and by all we could learn it was within two or three days after they had set sail from the coast they told us that they had killed about thirty of the white men having knocked them on the head with crows and handspikes and such things as they could get and one strong negro killed three of them with an iron crow after he was shot twice through the body and that he was afterwards shot through the head by the captain himself at the door of the roundhouse which he had split open with the crow and this we supposed was the occasion of the great quantity of blood which we saw at the roundhouse door  the same negro told us that they threw all the powder and shot they could find into the sea and they would have thrown the great guns into the sea if they could have lifted them being asked how they came to have their sails in such a condition his answer was they no understand they no know what the sails do that was they did not so much as know that it was the sails that made the ship go or understand what they meant or what to do with them when we asked him whither they were going he said they did not know but believed they should go home to their own country again i asked him in particular what he thought we were when we first came up with them he said they were terribly frighted believing we were the same white men that had gone away in their boats and were come again in a great ship with the two boats with them and expected they would kill them all  this was the account we got out of them after we had taught them to speak english and to understand the names and use of the things belonging to the ship which they had occasion to speak of and we observed that the fellows were too innocent to dissemble in their relation and that they all agreed in the particulars and were always in the same story which confirmed very much the truth of what they said  having taken this ship our next difficulty was what to do with the negroes the portuguese in the brazils would have bought them all of us and been glad of the purchase if we had not showed ourselves enemies there and been known for pirates but as it was we durst not go ashore anywhere thereabouts or treat with any of the planters because we should raise the whole country upon us and if there were any such things as menofwar in any of their ports we should be as sure to be attacked by them and by all the force they had by land or sea  nor could we think of any better success if we went northward to our own plantations one while we determined to carry them all away to buenos ayres and sell them there to the spaniards but they were really too many for them to make use of and to carry them round to the south seas which was the only remedy that was left was so far that we should be no way able to subsist them for so long a voyage  at last our old neverfailing friend william helped us out again as he had often done at a dead lift his proposal was this that he should go as master of the ship and about twenty men such as we could best trust and attempt to trade privately upon the coast of brazil with the planters not at the principal ports because that would not be admitted  we all agreed to this and appointed to go away ourselves towards the rio de la plata where we had thought of going before and to wait for him not there but at port st pedro as the spaniards call it lying at the mouth of the river which they call rio grande and where the spaniards had a small fort and a few people but we believe there was nobody in it  here we took up our station cruising off and on to see if we could meet any ships going to or coming from the buenos ayres or the rio de la plata but we met with nothing worth notice however we employed ourselves in things necessary for our going off to sea for we filled all our watercasks and got some fish for our present use to spare as much as possible our ships stores  william in the meantime went away to the north and made the land about the cape de st thomas and betwixt that and the isles de tuberon he found means to trade with the planters for all his negroes as well the women as the men and at a very good price too for william who spoke portuguese pretty well told them a fair story enough that the ship was in scarcity of provisions that they were driven a great way out of their way and indeed as we say out of their knowledge and that they must go up to the northward as far as jamaica or sell there upon the coast this was a very plausible tale and was easily believed and if you observe the manner of the negroes sailing and what happened in their voyage was every word of it true  by this method and being true to one another william passed for what he wasi mean for a very honest fellow and by the assistance of one planter who sent to some of his neighbour planters and managed the trade among themselves he got a quick market for in less than five weeks william sold all his negroes and at last sold the ship itself and shipped himself and his twenty men with two negro boys whom he had left in a sloop one of those which the planters used to send on board for the negroes with this sloop captain william as we then called him came away and found us at port st pedro in the latitude of 32 degrees 30 minutes south  nothing was more surprising to us than to see a sloop come along the coast carrying portuguese colours and come in directly to us after we were assured he had discovered both our ships we fired a gun upon her nearer approach to bring her to an anchor but immediately she fired five guns by way of salute and spread her english ancient then we began to guess it was friend william but wondered what was the meaning of his being in a sloop whereas we sent him away in a ship of near 300 tons but he soon let us into the whole history of his management with which we had a great deal of reason to be very well satisfied as soon as he had brought the sloop to an anchor he came aboard of my ship and there he gave us an account how he began to trade by the help of a portuguese planter who lived near the seaside how he went on shore and went up to the first house he could see and asked the man of the house to sell him some hogs pretending at first he only stood in upon the coast to take in fresh water and buy some provisions and the man not only sold him seven fat hogs but invited him in and gave him and five men he had with him a very good dinner and he invited the planter on board his ship and in return for his kindness gave him a negro girl for his wife  this so obliged the planter that the next morning he sent him on board in a great luggageboat a cow and two sheep with a chest of sweetmeats and some sugar and a great bag of tobacco and invited captain william on shore again that after this they grew from one kindness to another that they began to talk about trading for some negroes and william pretending it was to do him service consented to sell him thirty negroes for his private use in his plantation for which he gave william ready money in gold at the rate of fiveandthirty moidores per head but the planter was obliged to use great caution in the bringing them on shore for which purpose he made william weigh and stand out to sea and put in again about fifty miles farther north where at a little creek he took the negroes on shore at another plantation being a friends of his whom it seems he could trust  this remove brought william into a further intimacy not only with the first planter but also with his friends who desired to have some of the negroes also so that from one to another they bought so many till one overgrown planter took 100 negroes which was all william had left and sharing them with another planter that other planter chaffered with william for ship and all giving him in exchange a very clean large wellbuilt sloop of near sixty tons very well furnished carrying six guns but we made her afterwards carry twelve guns william had 300 moidores of gold besides the sloop in payment for the ship and with this money he stored the sloop as full as she could hold with provisions especially bread some pork and about sixty hogs alive among the rest william got eighty barrels of good gunpowder which was very much for our purpose and all the provisions which were in the french ship he took out also  this was a very agreeable account to us especially when we saw that william had received in gold coined or by weight and some spanish silver 60000 pieces of eight besides a new sloop and a vast quantity of provisions  we were very glad of the sloop in particular and began to consult what we should do whether we had not best turn off our great portuguese ship and stick to our first ship and the sloop seeing we had scarce men enough for all three and that the biggest ship was thought too big for our business however another dispute which was now decided brought the first to a conclusion the first dispute was whither we should go my comrade as i called him now that is to say he that was my captain before we took this portuguese manofwar was for going to the south seas and coasting up the west side of america where we could not fail of making several good prizes upon the spaniards and that then if occasion required it we might come home by the south seas to the east indies and so go round the globe as others had done before us  but my head lay another way i had been in the east indies and had entertained a notion ever since that if we went thither we could not fail of making good work of it and that we might have a safe retreat and good beef to victual our ship among my old friends the natives of zanzibar on the coast of mozambique or the island of st lawrence i say my thoughts lay this way and i read so many lectures to them all of the advantages they would certainly make of their strength by the prizes they would take in the gulf of mocha or the red sea and on the coast of malabar or the bay of bengal that i amazed them  with these arguments i prevailed on them and we all resolved to steer away se for the cape of good hope and in consequence of this resolution we concluded to keep the sloop and sail with all three not doubting as i assured them but we should find men there to make up the number wanting and if not we might cast any of them off when we pleased  we could do no less than make our friend william captain of the sloop which with such good management he had brought us he told us though with much good manners he would not command her as a frigate but if we would give her to him for his share of the guinea ship which we came very honestly by he would keep us company as a victualler if we commanded him as long as he was under the same force that took him away  we understood him so gave him the sloop but upon condition that he should not go from us and should be entirely under our command however william was not so easy as before and indeed as we afterwards wanted the sloop to cruise for purchase and a right thoroughpaced pirate in her so i was in such pain for william that i could not be without him for he was my privy counsellor and companion upon all occasions so i put a scotsman a bold enterprising gallant fellow into her named gordon and made her carry twelve guns and four petereroes though indeed we wanted men for we were none of us manned in proportion to our force  we sailed away for the cape of good hope the beginning of october 1706 and passed by in sight of the cape the 12th of november following having met with a great deal of bad weather we saw several merchantships in the roads there as well english as dutch whether outward bound or homeward we could not tell be it what it would we did not think fit to come to an anchor not knowing what they might be or what they might attempt against us when they knew what we were however as we wanted fresh water we sent the two boats belonging to the portuguese manofwar with all portuguese seamen or negroes in them to the wateringplace to take in water and in the meantime we hung out a portuguese ancient at sea and lay by all that night they knew not what we were but it seems we passed for anything but really what we was  our boats returning the third time loaden about five oclock next morning we thought ourselves sufficiently watered and stood away to the eastward but before our men returned the last time the wind blowing an easy gale at west we perceived a boat in the grey of the morning under sail crowding to come up with us as if they were afraid we should be gone we soon found it was an english longboat and that it was pretty full of men we could not imagine what the meaning of it should be but as it was but a boat we thought there could be no great harm in it to let them come on board and if it appeared they came only to inquire who we were we would give them a full account of our business by taking them along with us seeing we wanted men as much as anything but they saved us the labour of being in doubt how to dispose of them for it seems our portuguese seamen who went for water had not been so silent at the wateringplaces as we thought they would have been but the case in short was this captain  i forbear his name at present for a particular reason captain of an east india merchantship bound afterwards for china had found some reason to be very severe with his men and had handled some of them very roughly at st helena insomuch that they threatened among themselves to leave the ship the first opportunity and had long wished for that opportunity some of these men it seems had met with our boat at the wateringplace and inquiring of one another who we were and upon what account whether the portuguese seamen by faltering in their account made them suspect that we were out upon the cruise or whether they told it in plain english or no for they all spoke english enough to be understood but so it was that as soon as ever the men carried the news on board that the ships which lay by to the eastward were english and that they were going upon the account which by they way was a sea term for a pirate i say as soon as ever they heard it they went to work and getting all things ready in the night their chests and clothes and whatever else they could they came away before it was day and came up with us about seven oclock  when they came by the ships side which i commanded we hailed them in the usual manner to know what and who they were and what their business they answered they were englishmen and desired to come on board we told them they might lay the ship on board but ordered they should let only one man enter the ship till the captain knew their business and that he should come without any arms they said ay with all their hearts  we presently found their business and that they desired to go with us and as for their arms they desired we would send men on board the boat and that they would deliver them all to us which was done the fellow that came up to me told me how they had been used by their captain how he had starved the men and used them like dogs and that if the rest of the men knew they should be admitted he was satisfied twothirds of them would leave the ship we found the fellows were very hearty in their resolution and jolly brisk sailors they were so i told them i would do nothing without our admiral that was the captain of the other ship so i sent my pinnace on board captain wilmot to desire him to come on board but he was indisposed and being to leeward excused his coming but left it all to me but before my boat was returned captain wilmot called to me by his speakingtrumpet which all the men might hear as well as i thus calling me by my name i hear they are honest fellows pray tell them they are all welcome and make them a bowl of punch  as the men heard it as well as i there was no need to tell them what the captain said and as soon as the trumpet had done they set up a huzza that showed us they were very hearty in their coming to us but we bound them to us by a stronger obligation still after this for when we came to madagascar captain wilmot with consent of all the ships company ordered that these men should have as much money given them out of the stock as was due to them for their pay in the ship they had left and after that we allowed them twenty pieces of eight a man bounty money and thus we entered them upon shares as we were all and brave stout fellows they were being eighteen in number whereof two were midshipmen and one a carpenter  it was the 28th of november when having had some bad weather we came to an anchor in the road off st augustine bay at the southwest end of my old acquaintance the isle of madagascar we lay here awhile and trafficked with the natives for some good beef though the weather was so hot that we could not promise ourselves to salt any of it up to keep but i showed them the way which we practised before to salt it first with saltpetre then cure it by drying it in the sun which made it eat very agreeably though not so wholesome for our men that not agreeing with our way of cooking viz boiling with pudding brewis c and particularly this way would be too salt and the fat of the meat be rusty or dried away so as not to be eaten  this however we could not help and made ourselves amends by feeding heartily on the fresh beef while we were there which was excellent good and fat every way as tender and as well relished as in england and thought to be much better to us who had not tasted any in england for so long a time  having now for some time remained here we began to consider that this was not a place for our business and i that had some views a particular way of my own told them that this was not a station for those who looked for purchase that there were two parts of the island which were particularly proper for our purposes first the bay on the east side of the island and from thence to the island mauritius which was the usual way which ships that came from the malabar coast or the coast of coromandel fort st george c used to take and where if we waited for them we ought to take our station  but on the other hand as we did not resolve to fall upon the european traders who were generally ships of force and well manned and where blows must be looked for so i had another prospect which i promised myself would yield equal profit or perhaps greater without any of the hazard and difficulty of the former and this was the gulf of mocha or the red sea  i told them that the trade here was great the ships rich and the strait of babelmandel narrow so that there was no doubt but we might cruise so as to let nothing slip our hands having the seas open from the red sea along the coast of arabia to the persian gulf and the malabar side of the indies  i told them what i had observed when i sailed round the island in my former progress how that on the northernmost point of the island there were several very good harbours and roads for our ships that the natives were even more civil and tractable if possible than those where we were not having been so often illtreated by european sailors as those had in the south and east sides and that we might always be sure of a retreat if we were driven to put in by any necessity either of enemies or weather  they were easily convinced of the reasonableness of my scheme and captain wilmot whom i now called our admiral though he was at first of the mind to go and lie at the island mauritius and wait for some of the european merchantships from the road of coromandel or the bay of bengal was now of my mind it is true we were strong enough to have attacked an english east india ship of the greatest force though some of them were said to carry fifty guns but i represented to him that we were sure to have blows and blood if we took them and after we had done their loading was not of equal value to us because we had no room to dispose of their merchandise and as our circumstances stood we had rather have taken one outwardbound east india ship with her ready cash on board perhaps to the value of forty or fifty thousand pounds than three homewardbound though their loading would at london be worth three times the money because we knew not whither to go to dispose of the cargo whereas the ships from london had abundance of things we knew how to make use of besides their money such as their stores of provisions and liquors and great quantities of the like sent to the governors and factories at the english settlements for their use so that if we resolved to look for our own country ships it should be those that were outwardbound not the london ships homeward  all these things considered brought the admiral to be of my mind entirely so after taking in water and some fresh provisions where we lay which was near cape st mary on the southwest corner of the island we weighed and stood away south and afterwards sse to round the island and in about six days sail got out of the wake of the island and steered away north till we came off port dauphin and then north by east to the latitude of 13 degrees 40 minutes which was in short just at the farthest part of the island and the admiral keeping ahead made the open sea fair to the west clear of the whole island upon which he brought to and we sent a sloop to stand in round the farthest point north and coast along the shore and see for a harbour to put into which they did and soon brought us an account that there was a deep bay with a very good road and several little islands under which they found good riding in ten to seventeen fathom water and accordingly there we put in  however we afterwards found occasion to remove our station as you shall hear presently we had now nothing to do but go on shore and acquaint ourselves a little with the natives take in fresh water and some fresh provisions and then to sea again we found the people very easy to deal with and some cattle they had but it being at the extremity of the island they had not such quantities of cattle here however for the present we resolved to appoint this for our place of rendezvous and go and look out this was about the latter end of april  accordingly we put to sea and cruised away to the northward for the arabian coast it was a long run but as the winds generally blow trade from the s and sse from may to september we had good weather and in about twenty days we made the island of socotra lying south from the arabian coast and ese from the mouth of the gulf of mocha or the red sea  here we took in water and stood off and on upon the arabian shore we had not cruised here above three days or thereabouts but i spied a sail and gave her chase but when we came up with her never was such a poor prize chased by pirates that looked for booty for we found nothing in her but poor halfnaked turks going a pilgrimage to mecca to the tomb of their prophet mahomet the junk that carried them had no one thing worth taking away but a little rice and some coffee which was all the poor wretches had for their subsistence so we let them go for indeed we knew not what to do with them  the same evening we chased another junk with two masts and in something better plight to look at than the former when we came on board we found them upon the same errand but only that they were people of some better fashion than the other and here we got some plunder some turkish stores a few diamonds in the eardrops of five or six persons some fine persian carpets of which they made their saffras to lie upon and some money so we let them go also  we continued here eleven days longer and saw nothing but now and then a fishingboat but the twelfth day of our cruise we spied a ship indeed i thought at first it had been an english ship but it appeared to be an european freighted for a voyage from goa on the coast of malabar to the red sea and was very rich we chased her and took her without any fight though they had some guns on board too but not many we found her manned with portuguese seamen but under the direction of five merchant turks who had hired her on the coast of malabar of some portugal merchants and had laden her with pepper saltpetre some spices and the rest of the loading was chiefly calicoes and wrought silks some of them very rich  we took her and carried her to socotra but we really knew not what to do with her for the same reasons as before for all their goods were of little or no value to us after some days we found means to let one of the turkish merchants know that if he would ransom the ship we would take a sum of money and let them go he told me that if i would let one of them go on shore for the money they would do it so we adjusted the value of the cargo at 30000 ducats upon this agreement we allowed the sloop to carry him on shore at dofar in arabia where a rich merchant laid down the money for them and came off with our sloop and on payment of the money we very fairly and honestly let them go  some days after this we took an arabian junk going from the gulf of persia to mocha with a good quantity of pearl on board we gutted him of the pearl which it seems was belonging to some merchants at mocha and let him go for there was nothing else worth our taking  we continued cruising up and down here till we began to find our provisions grow low when captain wilmot our admiral told us it was time to think of going back to the rendezvous and the rest of the men said the same being a little weary of beating about for above three months together and meeting with little or nothing compared to our great expectations but i was very loth to part with the red sea at so cheap a rate and pressed them to tarry a little longer which at my instance they did but three days afterwards to our great misfortune understood that by landing the turkish merchants at dofar we had alarmed the coast as far as the gulf of persia so that no vessel would stir that way and consequently nothing was to be expected on that side  i was greatly mortified at this news and could no longer withstand the importunities of the men to return to madagascar however as the wind continued still to blow at sse by s we were obliged to stand away towards the coast of africa and the cape guardafui the winds being more variable under the shore than in the open sea  here we chopped upon a booty which we did not look for and which made amends for all our waiting for the very same hour that we made land we spied a large vessel sailing along the shore to the southward the ship was of bengal belonging to the great moguls country but had on board a dutch pilot whose name if i remember right was vandergest and several european seamen whereof three were english she was in no condition to resist us the rest of her seamen were indians of the moguls subjects some malabars and some others there were five indian merchants on board and some armenians it seems they had been at mocha with spices silks diamonds pearls calico c such goods as the country afforded and had little on board now but money in pieces of eight which by the way was just what we wanted and the three english seamen came along with us and the dutch pilot would have done so too but the two armenian merchants entreated us not to take him for that he being their pilot there was none of the men knew how to guide the ship so at their request we refused him but we made them promise he should not be used ill for being willing to go with us  we got near 200000 pieces of eight in this vessel and if they said true there was a jew of goa who intended to have embarked with them who had 200000 pieces of eight with him all his own but his good fortune springing out of his ill fortune hindered him or he fell sick at mocha and could not be ready to travel which was the saving of his money  there was none with me at the taking this prize but the sloop for captain wilmots ship proving leaky he went away for the rendezvous before us and arrived there the middle of december but not liking the port he left a great cross on shore with directions written on a plate of lead fixed to it for us to come after him to the great bays at mangahelly where he found a very good harbour but we learned a piece of news here that kept us from him a great while which the admiral took offence at but we stopped his mouth with his share of 200000 pieces of eight to him and his ships crew but the story which interrupted our coming to him was this between mangahelly and another point called cape st sebastian there came on shore in the night an european ship and whether by stress of weather or want of a pilot i know not but the ship stranded and could not be got off  we lay in the cove or harbour where as i have said our rendezvous was appointed and had not yet been on shore so we had not seen the directions our admiral had left for us  our friend william of whom i have said nothing a great while had a great mind one day to go on shore and importuned me to let him have a little troop to go with him for safety that they might see the country i was mightily against it for many reasons but particularly i told him he knew the natives were but savages and they were very treacherous and i desired him that he would not go and had he gone on much farther i believe i should have downright refused him and commanded him not to go  but in order to persuade me to let him go he told me he would give me an account of the reason why he was so importunate he told me the last night he had a dream which was so forcible and made such an impression upon his mind that he could not be quiet till he had made the proposal to me to go and if i refused him then he thought his dream was significant and if not then his dream was at an end  his dream was he said that he went on shore with thirty men of which the cockswain he said was one upon the island and that they found a mine of gold and enriched them all but this was not the main thing he said but that the same morning he had dreamed so the cockswain came to him just then and told him that he dreamed he went on shore on the island of madagascar and that some men came to him and told him they would show him where he should get a prize which would make them all rich  these two things put together began to weigh with me a little though i was never inclined to give any heed to dreams but williams importunity turned me effectually for i always put a great deal of stress upon his judgment so that in short i gave them leave to go but i charged them not to go far off from the seacoast that if they were forced down to the seaside upon any occasion we might perhaps see them and fetch them off with our boats  they went away early in the morning oneandthirty men of them in number very well armed and very stout fellows they travelled all the day and at night made us a signal that all was well from the top of a hill which we had agreed on by making a great fire  next day they marched down the hill on the other side inclining towards the seaside as they had promised and saw a very pleasant valley before them with a river in the middle of it which a little farther below them seemed to be big enough to bear small ships they marched apace towards this river and were surprised with the noise of a piece going off which by the sound could not be far off they listened long but could hear no more so they went on to the riverside which was a very fine fresh stream but widened apace and they kept on by the banks of it till almost at once it opened or widened into a good large creek or harbour about five miles from the sea and that which was still more surprising as they marched forward they plainly saw in the mouth of the harbour or creek the wreck of a ship  the tide was up as we call it so that it did net appear very much above the water but as they made downwards they found it grow bigger and bigger and the tide soon after ebbing out they found it lay dry upon the sands and appeared to be the wreck of a considerable vessel larger than could be expected in that country  after some time william taking out his glass to look at it more nearly was surprised with hearing a musketshot whistle by him and immediately after that he heard the gun and saw the smoke from the other side upon which our men immediately fired three muskets to discover if possible what or who they were upon the noise of these guns abundance of men came running down to the shore from among the trees and our men could easily perceive that they were europeans though they knew not of what nation however our men hallooed to them as loud as they could and byandby they got a long pole and set it up and hung a white shirt upon it for a flag of truce they on the other side saw it by the help of their glasses too and quickly after our men see a boat launch off from the shore as they thought but it was from another creek it seems and immediately they came rowing over the creek to our men carrying also a white flag as a token of truce  it is not easy to describe the surprise or joy and satisfaction that appeared on both sides to see not only white men but englishmen in a place so remote but what then must it be when they came to know one another and to find that they were not only countrymen but comrades and that this was the very ship that captain wilmot our admiral commanded and whose company we had lost in the storm at tobago after making an agreement to rendezvous at madagascar  they had it seems got intelligence of us when they came to the south part of the island and had been aroving as far as the gulf of bengal when they met captain avery with whom they joined took several rich prizes and amongst the rest one ship with the great moguls daughter and an immense treasure in money and jewels and from thence they came about the coast of coromandel and afterwards that of malabar into the gulf of persia where they also took some prize and then designed for the south part of madagascar but the winds blowing hard at se and se by e they came to the northward of the isle and being after that separated by a furious tempest from the nw they were forced into the mouth of that creek where they lost their ship and they told us also that they heard that captain avery himself had lost his ship also not far off  when they had thus acquainted one another with their fortunes the poor overjoyed men were in haste to go back to communicate their joy to their comrades and leaving some of their men with ours the rest went back and william was so earnest to see them that he and two more went back with them and there he came to their little camp where they lived there were about a hundred and sixty men of them in all they had got their guns on shore and some ammunition but a good deal of their powder was spoiled however they had raised a fair platform and mounted twelve pieces of cannon upon it which was a sufficient defence to them on that side of the sea and just at the end of the platform they had made a launch and a little yard and were all hard at work building another little ship as i may call it to go to sea in but they put a stop to this work upon the news they had of our being come in  when our men went into their huts it was surprising indeed to see the vast stock of wealth they had got in gold and silver and jewels which however they told us was a trifle to what captain avery had wherever he was gone  it was five days we had waited for our men and no news of them and indeed i gave them over for lost but was surprised after five days waiting to see a ships boat come rowing towards us along shore what to make of it i could not tell but was at least better satisfied when our men told me they heard them halloo and saw them wave their caps to us  in a little time they came quite up to us and i saw friend william stand up in the boat and make signs to us so they came on board but when i saw there were but fifteen of our oneandthirty men i asked him what had become of their fellows oh says william they are all very well and my dream is fully made good and the cockswains too  this made me very impatient to know how the case stood so he told us the whole story which indeed surprised us all the next day we weighed and stood away southerly to join captain wilmot and ship at mangahelly where we found him as i said a little chagrined at our stay but we pacified him afterwards with telling him the history of williams dream and the consequence of it  in the meantime the camp of our comrades was so near mangahelly that our admiral and i friend william and some of the men resolved to take the sloop and go and see them and fetch them all and their goods bag and baggage on board our ship which accordingly we did and found their camp their fortifications the battery of guns they had erected their treasure and all the men just as william had related it so after some stay we took all the men into the sloop and brought them away with us  it was some time before we knew what was become of captain avery but after about a month by the direction of the men who had lost their ship we sent the sloop to cruise along the shore to find out if possible where they were and in about a weeks cruise our men found them and particularly that they had lost their ship as well as our men had lost theirs and that they were every way in as bad a condition as ours  it was about ten days before the sloop returned and captain avery with them and this was the whole force that as i remember captain avery ever had with him for now we joined all our companies together and it stood thuswe had two ships and a sloop in which we had 320 men but much too few to man them as they ought to be the great portuguese ship requiring of herself near 400 men to man her completely as for our lost but now found comrade her complement of men was 180 or thereabouts and captain avery had about 300 men with him whereof he had ten carpenters with him most of which were taken aboard the prize they had taken so that in a word all the force avery had at madagascar in the year 1699 or thereabouts amounted to our three ships for his own was lost as you have heard and never had any more than about 1200 men in all  it was about a month after this that all our crews got together and as avery was unshipped we all agreed to bring our own company into the portuguese manofwar and the sloop and give captain avery the spanish frigate with all the tackles and furniture guns and ammunition for his crew by themselves for which they being full of wealth agreed to give us 40000 pieces of eight  it was next considered what course we should take captain avery to give him his due proposed our building a little city here establishing ourselves on shore with a good fortification and works proper to defend ourselves and that as we had wealth enough and could increase it to what degree we pleased we should content ourselves to retire here and bid defiance to the world but i soon convinced him that this place would be no security to us if we pretended to carry on our cruising trade for that then all the nations of europe and indeed of that part of the world would be engaged to root us out but if we resolved to live there as in retirement and plant in the country as private men and give over our trade of pirating then indeed we might plant and settle ourselves where we pleased but then i told him the best way would be to treat with the natives and buy a tract of land of them farther up the country seated upon some navigable river where boats might go up and down for pleasure but not ships to endanger us that thus planting the high ground with cattle such as cows and goats of which the country also was full to be sure we might live here as well as any men in the world and i owned to him i thought it was a good retreat for those that were willing to leave off and lay down and yet did not care to venture home and be hanged that is to say to run the risk of it  captain avery however he made no positive discovery of his intentions seemed to me to decline my notion of going up into the country to plant on the contrary it was apparent he was of captain wilmots opinion that they might maintain themselves on shore and yet carry on their cruising trade too and upon this they resolved but as i afterwards understood about fifty of their men went up the country and settled themselves in an inland place as a colony whether they are there still or not i cannot tell or how many of them are left alive but it is my opinion they are there still and that they are considerably increased for as i hear they have got some women among them though not many for it seems five dutch women and three or four little girls were taken by them in a dutch ship which they afterwards took going to mocha and three of those women marrying some of these men went with them to live in their new plantation but of this i speak only by hearsay  as we lay here some time i found our people mightily divided in their notions some were for going this way and some that till at last i began to foresee they would part company and perhaps we should not have men enough to keep together to man the great ship so i took captain wilmot aside and began to talk to him about it but soon perceived that he inclined himself to stay at madagascar and having got a vast wealth for his own share had secret designs of getting home some way or other  i argued the impossibility of it and the hazard he would run either of falling into the hands of thieves and murderers in the red sea who would never let such a treasure as his pass their hands or of his falling into the hands of the english dutch or french who would certainly hang him for a pirate i gave him an account of the voyage i had made from this very place to the continent of africa and what a journey it was to travel on foot  in short nothing could persuade him but he would go into the red sea with the sloop and where the children of israel passed through the sea dryshod and landing there would travel to grand cairo by land which is not above eighty miles and from thence he said he could ship himself by the way of alexandria to any part of the world  i represented the hazard and indeed the impossibility of his passing by mocha and jiddah without being attacked if he offered it by force or plundered if he went to get leave and explained the reasons of it so much and so effectually that though at last he would not hearken to it himself none of his men would go with him they told him they would go anywhere with him to serve him but that this was running himself and them into certain destruction without any possibility of avoiding it or probability of answering his end the captain took what i said to him quite wrong and pretended to resent it and gave me some buccaneer words upon it but i gave him no return to it but this that i advised him for his advantage that if he did not understand it so it was his fault not mine that i did not forbid him to go nor had i offered to persuade any of the men not to go with him though it was to their apparent destruction  however warm heads are not easily cooled the captain was so eager that he quitted our company and with most part of his crew went over to captain avery and sorted with his people taking all the treasure with him which by the way was not very fair in him we having agreed to share all our gains whether more or less whether absent or present  our men muttered a little at it but i pacified them as well as i could and told them it was easy for us to get as much if we minded our hits and captain wilmot had set us a very good example for by the same rule the agreement of any further sharing of profits with them was at an end i took this occasion to put into their heads some part of my further designs which were to range over the eastern sea and see if we could not make ourselves as rich as mr avery who it was true had gotten a prodigious deal of money though not onehalf of what was said of it in europe  our men were so pleased with my forward enterprising temper that they assured me that they would go with me one and all over the whole globe wherever i would carry them and as for captain wilmot they would have nothing more to do with him this came to his ears and put him into a great rage so that he threatened if i came on shore he would cut my throat  i had information of it privately but took no notice of it at all only i took care not to go unprovided for him and seldom walked about but in very good company however at last captain wilmot and i met and talked over the matter very seriously and i offered him the sloop to go where he pleased or if he was not satisfied with that i offered to take the sloop and leave him the great ship but he declined both and only desired that i would leave him six carpenters which i had in our ship more than i had need of to help his men to finish the sloop that was begun before we came thither by the men that lost their ship this i consented readily to and lent him several other hands that were useful to them and in a little time they built a stout brigantine able to carry fourteen guns and 200 men  what measures they took and how captain avery managed afterwards is too long a story to meddle with here nor is it any of my business having my own story still upon my hands  we lay here about these several simple disputes almost five months when about the latter end of march i set sail with the great ship having in her fortyfour guns and 400 men and the sloop carrying eighty men we did not steer to the malabar coast and so to the gulf of persia as was first intended the east monsoons blowing yet too strong but we kept more under the african coast where we had the wind variable till we passed the line and made the cape bassa in the latitude of four degrees ten minutes from thence the monsoons beginning to change to the ne and nne we led it away with the wind large to the maldives a famous ledge of islands well known by all the sailors who have gone into those parts of the world and leaving these islands a little to the south we made cape comorin the southernmost land of the coast of malabar and went round the isle of ceylon here we lay by a while to wait for purchase and here we saw three large english east india ships going from bengal or from fort st george homeward for england or rather for bombay and surat till the trade set in  we brought to and hoisting an english ancient and pendant lay by for them as if we intended to attack them they could not tell what to make of us a good while though they saw our colours and i believe at first they thought us to be french but as they came nearer to us we let them soon see what we were for we hoisted a black flag with two cross daggers in it on our maintopmast head which let them see what they were to expect  we soon found the effects of this for at first they spread their ancients and made up to us in a line as if they would fight us having the wind off shore fair enough to have brought them on board us but when they saw what force we were of and found we were cruisers of another kind they stood away from us again with all the sail they could make if they had come up we should have given them an unexpected welcome but as it was we had no mind to follow them so we let them go for the same reasons which i mentioned before  but though we let them pass we did not design to let others go at so easy a price it was but the next morning that we saw a sail standing round cape comorin and steering as we thought the same course with us we knew not at first what to do with her because she had the shore on her larboard quarter and if we offered to chase her she might put into any port or creek and escape us but to prevent this we sent the sloop to get in between her and the land as soon as she saw that she hauled in to keep the land aboard and when the sloop stood towards her she made right ashore with all the canvas she could spread  the sloop however came up with her and engaged her and found she was a vessel of ten guns portuguese built but in the dutch traders hands and manned by dutchmen who were bound from the gulf of persia to batavia to fetch spices and other goods from thence the sloops men took her and had the rummaging of her before we came up she had in her some european goods and a good round sum of money and some pearl so that though we did not go to the gulf for the pearl the pearl came to us out of the gulf and we had our share of it this was a rich ship and the goods were of very considerable value besides the money and the pearl  we had a long consultation here what we should do with the men for to give them the ship and let them pursue their voyage to java would be to alarm the dutch factory there who are by far the strongest in the indies and to make our passage that way impracticable whereas we resolved to visit that part of the world in our way but were not willing to pass the great bay of bengal where we hoped for a great deal of purchase and therefore it behoved us not to be waylaid before we came there because they knew we must pass by the straits of malacca or those of sunda and either way it was very easy to prevent us  while we were consulting this in the great cabin the men had had the same debate before the mast and it seems the majority there were for pickling up the poor dutchmen among the herrings in a word they were for throwing them all into the sea poor william the quaker was in great concern about this and comes directly to me to talk about it hark thee says william what wilt thou do with these dutchmen that thou hast on board thou wilt not let them go i suppose says he why says i william would you advise me to let them go no says william i cannot say it is fit for thee to let them go that is to say to go on with their voyage to batavia because it is not for thy turn that the dutch at batavia should have any knowledge of thy being in these seas well then says i to him i know no remedy but to throw them overboard you know william says i a dutchman swims like a fish and all our people here are of the same opinion as well as i at the same time i resolved it should not be done but wanted to hear what william would say he gravely replied if all the men in the ship were of that mind i will never believe that thou wilt be of that mind thyself for i have heard thee protest against cruelty in all other cases well william says i that is true but what then shall we do with them why says william is there no way but to murder them i am persuaded thou canst not be in earnest no indeed william says i i am not in earnest but they shall not go to java no nor to ceylon that is certain but says william the men have done thee no injury at all thou hast taken a great treasure from them what canst thou pretend to hurt them for nay william says i do not talk of that i have pretence enough if that be all my pretence is to prevent doing me hurt and that is as necessary a piece of the law of selfpreservation as any you can name but the main thing is i know not what to do with them to prevent their prating  while william and i were talking the poor dutchmen were openly condemned to die as it may be called by the whole ships company and so warm were the men upon it that they grew very clamorous and when they heard that william was against it some of them swore they should die and if william opposed it he should drown along with them  but as i was resolved to put an end to their cruel project so i found it was time to take upon me a little or the bloody humour might grow too strong so i called the dutchmen up and talked a little with them first i asked them if they were willing to go with us two of them offered it presently but the rest which were fourteen declined it well then said i where would you go they desired they should go to ceylon no i told them i could not allow them to go to any dutch factory and told them very plainly the reasons of it which they could not deny to be just i let them know also the cruel bloody measures of our men but that i had resolved to save them if possible and therefore i told them i would set them on shore at some english factory in the bay of bengal or put them on board any english ship i met after i was past the straits of sunda or of malacca but not before for as to my coming back again i told them i would run the venture of their dutch power from batavia but i would not have the news come there before me because it would make all their merchantships lay up and keep out of our way  it came next into our consideration what we should do with their ship but this was not long resolving for there were but two ways either to set her on fire or to run her on shore and we chose the last so we set her foresail with the tack at the cathead and lashed her helm a little to starboard to answer her headsail and so set her agoing with neither cat or dog in her and it was not above two hours before we saw her run right ashore upon the coast a little beyond the cape comorin and away we went round about ceylon for the coast of coromandel  we sailed along there not in sight of the shore only but so near as to see the ships in the road at fort st david fort st george and at the other factories along that shore as well as along the coast of golconda carrying our english ancient when we came near the dutch factories and dutch colours when we passed by the english factories we met with little purchase upon this coast except two small vessels of golconda bound across the bay with bales of calicoes and muslins and wrought silks and fifteen bales of romals from the bottom of the bay which were going on whose account we knew not to acheen and to other ports on the coast of malacca we did not inquire to what place in particular but we let the vessels go having none but indians on board  in the bottom of the bay we met with a great junk belonging to the moguls court with a great many people passengers as we supposed them to be it seems they were bound for the river hooghly or ganges and came from sumatra this was a prize worth taking indeed and we got so much gold in her besides other goods which we did not meddle withpepper in particularthat it had like to have put an end to our cruise for almost all my men said we were rich enough and desired to go back again to madagascar but i had other things in my head still and when i came to talk with them and set friend william to talk with them we put such further golden hopes into their heads that we soon prevailed with them to let us go on  my next design was to leave all the dangerous straits of malacca singapore and sunda where we could expect no great booty but what we might light on in european ships which we must fight for and though we were able to fight and wanted no courage even to desperation yet we were rich too and resolved to be richer and took this for our maxim that while we were sure the wealth we sought was to be had without fighting we had no occasion to put ourselves to the necessity of fighting for that which would come upon easy terms  we left therefore the bay of bengal and coming to the coast of sumatra we put in at a small port where there was a town inhabited only by malays and here we took in fresh water and a large quantity of good pork pickled up and well salted notwithstanding the heat of the climate being in the very middle of the torrid zone viz in three degrees fifteen minutes north latitude we also took on board both our vessels forty hogs alive which served us for fresh provisions having abundance of food for them such as the country produced such as guams potatoes and a sort of coarse rice good for nothing else but to feed the swine we killed one of these hogs every day and found them to be excellent meat we took in also a monstrous quantity of ducks and cocks and hens the same kind as we have in england which we kept for change of provisions and if i remember right we had no less than two thousand of them so that at first we were pestered with them very much but we soon lessened them by boiling roasting stewing c for we never wanted while we had them  my longprojected design now lay open to me which was to fall in amongst the dutch spice islands and see what mischief i could do there accordingly we put out to sea the 12th of august and passing the line on the 17th we stood away due south leaving the straits of sunda and the isle of java on the east till we came to the latitude of eleven degrees twenty minutes when we steered east and ene having easy gales from the wsw till we came among the moluccas or spice islands  we passed those seas with less difficulty than in other places the winds to the south of java being more variable and the weather good though sometimes we met with squally weather and short storms but when we came in among the spice islands themselves we had a share of the monsoons or tradewinds and made use of them accordingly  the infinite number of islands which lie in these seas embarrassed us strangely and it was with great difficulty that we worked our way through them then we steered for the north side of the philippines when we had a double chance for purchase viz either to meet with the spanish ships from acapulco on the coast of new spain or we were certain not to fail of finding some ships or junks of china who if they came from china would have a great quantity of goods of value on board as well as money or if we took them going back we should find them laden with nutmegs and cloves from banda and ternate or from some of the other islands  we were right in our guesses here to a tittle and we steered directly through a large outlet which they call a strait though it be fifteen miles broad and to an island they call dammer and from thence nne to banda between these islands we met with a dutch junk or vessel going to amboyna we took her without much trouble and i had much ado to prevent our men murdering all the men as soon as they heard them say they belonged to amboyna the reasons i suppose any one will guess  we took out of her about sixteen ton of nutmegs some provisions and their smallarms for they had no great guns and let the ship go from thence we sailed directly to the banda island or islands where we were sure to get more nutmegs if we thought fit for my part i would willingly have got more nutmegs though i had paid for them but our people abhorred paying for anything so we got about twelve ton more at several times most of them from shore and only a few in a small boat of the natives which was going to gilolo we would have traded openly but the dutch who have made themselves masters of all those islands forbade the people dealing with us or any strangers whatever and kept them so in awe that they durst not do it so we could indeed have made nothing of it if we had stayed longer and therefore resolved to be gone for ternate and see if we could make up our loading with cloves  accordingly we stood away north but found ourselves so entangled among innumerable islands and without any pilot that understood the channel and races between them that we were obliged to give it over and resolved to go back again to banda and see what we could get among the other islands thereabouts  the first adventure we made here had like to have been fatal to us all for the sloop being ahead made the signal to us for seeing a sail and afterwards another and a third by which we understood she saw three sail whereupon we made more sail to come up with her but on a sudden were gotten among some rocks falling foul upon them in such a manner as frighted us all very heartily for having it seems but just water enough as it were to an inch our rudder struck upon the top of a rock which gave us a terrible shock and split a great piece off the rudder and indeed disabled it so that our ship would not steer at all at least not so as to be depended upon and we were glad to hand all our sails except our foresail and maintopsail and with them we stood away to the east to see if we could find any creek or harbour where we might lay the ship on shore and repair our rudder besides we found the ship herself had received some damage for she had some little leak near her sternpost but a great way under water  by this mischance we lost the advantages whatever they were of the three sail of ships which we afterwards came to hear were small dutch ships from batavia going to banda and amboyna to load spice and no doubt had a good quantity of money on board  upon the disaster i have been speaking of you may very well suppose that we came to an anchor as soon as we could which was upon a small island not far from banda where though the dutch keep no factory yet they come at the season to buy nutmegs and mace we stayed there thirteen days but there being no place where we could lay the ship on shore we sent the sloop to cruise among the islands to look out for a place fit for us in the meantime we got very good water here some provisions roots and fruits and a good quantity of nutmegs and mace which we found ways to trade with the natives for without the knowledge of their masters the dutch  at length our sloop returned having found another island where there was a very good harbour we ran in and came to an anchor we immediately unbent all our sails sent them ashore upon the island and set up seven or eight tents with them then we unrigged our topmasts and cut them down hoisted all our guns out our provisions and loading and put them ashore in the tents with the guns we made two small batteries for fear of a surprise and kept a lookout upon the hill when we were all ready we laid the ship aground upon a hard sand the upper end of the harbour and shored her up on each side at low water she lay almost dry so we mended her bottom and stopped the leak which was occasioned by straining some of the rudder irons with the shock which the ship had against the rock  having done this we also took occasion to clean her bottom which having been at sea so long was very foul the sloop washed and tallowed also but was ready before us and cruised eight or ten days among the islands but met with no purchase so that we began to be tired of the place having little to divert us but the most furious claps of thunder that ever were heard or read of in the world  we were in hopes to have met with some purchase here among the chinese who we had been told came to ternate to trade for cloves and to the banda isles for nutmegs and we would have been very glad to have loaded our galleon or great ship with these two sorts of spice and have thought it a glorious voyage but we found nothing stirring more than what i have said except dutchmen who by what means we could not imagine had either a jealousy of us or intelligence of us and kept themselves close in their ports  i was once resolved to have made a descent at the island of dumas the place most famous for the best nutmegs but friend william who was always for doing our business without fighting dissuaded me from it and gave such reasons for it that we could not resist particularly the great heats of the season and of the place for we were now in the latitude of just half a degree south but while we were disputing this point we were soon determined by the following accidentwe had a strong gale of wind at sw by w and the ship had fresh way but a great sea rolling in upon us from the ne which we afterwards found was the pouring in of the great ocean east of new guinea however as i said we stood away large and made fresh way when on the sudden from a dark cloud which hovered over our heads came a flash or rather blast of lightning which was so terrible and quivered so long among us that not i only but all our men thought the ship was on fire the heat of the flash or fire was so sensibly felt in our faces that some of our men had blisters raised by it on their skins not immediately perhaps by the heat but by the poisonous or noxious particles which mixed themselves with the matter inflamed but this was not all the shock of the air which the fracture in the clouds made was such that our ship shook as when a broadside is fired and her motion being checked as it were at once by a repulse superior to the force that gave her way before the sails all flew back in a moment and the ship lay as we might truly say thunderstruck as the blast from the cloud was so very near us it was but a few moments after the flash that the terriblest clap of thunder followed that was ever heard by mortals i firmly believe a blast of a hundred thousand barrels of gunpowder could not have been greater to our hearing nay indeed to some of our men it took away their hearing  it is not possible for me to describe or any one to conceive the terror of that minute our men were in such a consternation that not a man on board the ship had presence of mind to apply to the proper duty of a sailor except friend william and had he not run very nimbly and with a composure that i am sure i was not master of to let go the foresheet set in the weatherbrace of the foreyard and haul down the topsails we had certainly brought all our masts by the board and perhaps have been overwhelmed in the sea  as for myself i must confess my eyes were open to my danger though not the least to anything of application for remedy i was all amazement and confusion and this was the first time that i can say i began to feel the effects of that horror which i know since much more of upon the just reflection on my former life i thought myself doomed by heaven to sink that moment into eternal destruction and with this peculiar mark of terror viz that the vengeance was not executed in the ordinary way of human justice but that god had taken me into his immediate disposing and had resolved to be the executer of his own vengeance  let them alone describe the confusion i was in who know what was the case of john child of shadwell or francis spira it is impossible to describe it my soul was all amazement and surprise i thought myself just sinking into eternity owning the divine justice of my punishment but not at all feeling any of the moving softening tokens of a sincere penitent afflicted at the punishment but not at the crime alarmed at the vengeance but not terrified at the guilt having the same gust to the crime though terrified to the last degree at the thought of the punishment which i concluded i was just now going to receive  but perhaps many that read this will be sensible of the thunder and lightning that may think nothing of the rest or rather may make a jest of it all so i say no more of it at this time but proceed to the story of the voyage when the amazement was over and the men began to come to themselves they fell acalling for one another every one for his friend or for those he had most respect for and it was a singular satisfaction to find that nobody was hurt the next thing was to inquire if the ship had received no damage when the boatswain stepping forward found that part of the head was gone but not so as to endanger the bowsprit so we hoisted our topsails again hauled aft the foresheet braced the yards and went our course as before nor can i deny but that we were all somewhat like the ship our first astonishment being a little over and that we found the ship swim again we were soon the same irreligious hardened crew that we were before and i among the rest  as we now steered our course lay nne and we passed thus with a fair wind through the strait or channel between the island of gilolo and the land of nova guinea when we were soon in the open sea or ocean on the southeast of the philippines being the great pacific or south sea where it may be said to join itself with the vast indian ocean  as we passed into these seas steering due north so we soon crossed the line to the north side and so sailed on towards mindanao and manilla the chief of the philippine islands without meeting with any purchase till we came to the northward of manilla and then our trade began for here we took three japanese vessels though at some distance from manilla two of them had made their market and were going home with nutmegs cinnamon cloves c besides all sorts of european goods brought with the spanish ships from acapulco they had together eightandthirty ton of cloves and five or six ton of nutmegs and as much cinnamon we took the spice but meddled with very little of the european goods they being as we thought not worth our while but we were very sorry for it soon after and therefore grew wiser upon the next occasion  the third japanese was the best prize to us for he came with money and a great deal of gold uncoined to buy such goods as we mentioned above we eased him of his gold and did him no other harm and having no intention to stay long here we stood away for china  we were at sea above two months upon this voyage beating it up against the wind which blew steadily from the ne and within a point or two one way or other and this indeed was the reason why we met with the more prizes in our voyage  we were just gotten clear of the philippines and we purposed to go to the isle of formosa but the wind blew so fresh at nne that there was no making anything of it and we were forced to put back to laconia the most northerly of those islands we rode here very secure and shifted our situation not in view of any danger for there was none but for a better supply of provisions which we found the people very willing to supply us with  there lay while we remained here three very great galleons or spanish ships from the south seas whether newly come in or ready to sail we could not understand at first but as we found the china traders began to load and set forward to the north we concluded the spanish ships had newly unloaded their cargo and these had been buying so we doubted not but we should meet with purchase in the rest of the voyage neither indeed could we well miss of it  we stayed here till the beginning of may when we were told the chinese traders would set forward for the northern monsoons end about the latter end of march or beginning of april so that they are sure of fair winds home accordingly we hired some of the country boats which are very swift sailers to go and bring us word how affairs stood at manilla and when the china junks would sail and by this intelligence we ordered our matters so well that three days after we set sail we fell in with no less than eleven of them out of which however having by misfortune of discovering ourselves taken but three we contented ourselves and pursued our voyage to formosa in these three vessels we took in short such a quantity of cloves nutmegs cinnamon and mace besides silver that our men began to be of my opinionthat we were rich enough and in short we had nothing to do now but to consider by what methods to secure the immense treasure we had got  i was secretly glad to hear that they were of this opinion for i had long before resolved if it were possible to persuade them to think of returning having fully perfected my first projected design of rummaging among the spice islands and all those prizes which were exceeding rich at manilla was quite beyond my design  but now i had heard what the men said and how they thought we were very well i let them know by friend william that i intended only to sail to the island of formosa where i should find opportunity to turn our spices and europe goods into ready money and that then i would tack about for the south the northern monsoons being perhaps by that time also ready to set in they all approved of my design and willingly went forward because besides the winds which would not permit until october to go to the south i say besides this we were now a very deep ship having near two hundred ton of goods on board and particularly some very valuable the sloop also had a proportion  with this resolution we went on cheerfully when within about twelve days sail more we made the island formosa at a great distance but were ourselves shot beyond the southernmost part of the island being to leeward and almost upon the coast of china here we were a little at a loss for the english factories were not far off and we might be obliged to fight some of their ships if we met with them which though we were able enough to do yet we did not desire it on many accounts and particularly because we did not think it was our business to have it known who we were or that such a kind of people as we had been seen on the coast however we were obliged to keep to the northward keeping as good an offing as we could with respect to the coast of china  we had not sailed long but we chased a small chinese junk and having taken her we found she was bound to the island of formosa having no goods on board but some rice and a small quantity of tea but she had three chinese merchants in her and they told us that they were going to meet a large vessel of their country which came from tonquin and lay in a river in formosa whose name i forgot and they were going to the philippine islands with silks muslins calicoes and such goods as are the product of china and some gold that their business was to sell their cargo and buy spices and european goods  this suited very well with our purpose so i resolved now that we would leave off being pirates and turn merchants so we told them what goods we had on board and that if they would bring their supercargoes or merchants on board we would trade with them they were very willing to trade with us but terribly afraid to trust us nor was it an unjust fear for we had plundered them already of what they had on the other hand we were as diffident as they and very uncertain what to do but william the quaker put this matter into a way of barter he came to me and told me he really thought the merchants looked like fair men that meant honestly and besides says william it is their interest to be honest now for as they know upon what terms we got the goods we are to truck with them so they know we can afford good pennyworths and in the next place it saves them going the whole voyage so that the southerly monsoons yet holding if they traded with us they could immediately return with their cargo to china though by the way we afterwards found they intended for japan but that was all one for by this means they saved at least eight months voyage upon these foundations william said he was satisfied we might trust them for says william i would as soon trust a man whose interest binds him to be just to me as a man whose principle binds himself upon the whole william proposed that two of the merchants should be left on board our ship as hostages and that part of our goods should be loaded in their vessel and let the third go with it into the port where their ship lay and when he had delivered the spices he should bring back such things as it was agreed should be exchanged this was concluded on and william the quaker ventured to go along with them which upon my word i should not have cared to have done nor was i willing that he should but he went still upon the notion that it was their interest to treat him friendly  in the meantime we came to an anchor under a little island in the latitude of 23 degrees 28 minutes being just under the northern tropic and about twenty leagues from the island here we lay thirteen days and began to be very uneasy for my friend william for they had promised to be back again in four days which they might very easily have done however at the end of thirteen days we saw three sail coming directly to us which a little surprised us all at first not knowing what might be the case and we began to put ourselves in a posture of defence but as they came nearer us we were soon satisfied for the first vessel was that which william went in who carried a flag of truce and in a few hours they all came to an anchor and william came on board us with a little boat with the chinese merchant in his company and two other merchants who seemed to be a kind of brokers for the rest  here he gave us an account how civilly he had been used how they had treated him with all imaginable frankness and openness that they had not only given him the full value of his spices and other goods which he carried in gold by good weight but had loaded the vessel again with such goods as he knew we were willing to trade for and that afterwards they had resolved to bring the great ship out of the harbour to lie where we were that so we might make what bargain we thought fit only william said he had promised in our name that we should use no violence with them nor detain any of the vessels after we had done trading with them i told him we would strive to outdo them in civility and that we would make good every part of his agreement in token whereof i caused a white flag likewise to be spread at the poop of our great ship which was the signal agreed on  as to the third vessel which came with them it was a kind of bark of the country who having intelligence of our design to traffic came off to deal with us bringing a great deal of gold and some provisions which at that time we were very glad of  in short we traded upon the high seas with these men and indeed we made a very good market and yet sold thieves pennyworths too we sold here about sixty ton of spice chiefly cloves and nutmegs and above two hundred bales of european goods such as linen and woollen manufactures we considered we should have occasion for some such things ourselves and so we kept a good quantity of english stuffs cloth baize c for ourselves i shall not take up any of the little room i have left here with the further particulars of our trade it is enough to mention that except a parcel of tea and twelve bales of fine china wrought silks we took nothing in exchange for our goods but gold so that the sum we took here in that glittering commodity amounted to above fifty thousand ounces good weight  when we had finished our barter we restored the hostages and gave the three merchants about the quantity of twelve hundredweight of nutmegs and as many of cloves with a handsome present of european linen and stuff for themselves as a recompense for what we had taken from them so we sent them away exceedingly well satisfied  here it was that william gave me an account that while he was on board the japanese vessel he met with a kind of religious or japan priest who spoke some words of english to him and being very inquisitive to know how he came to learn any of those words he told him that there was in his country thirteen englishmen he called them englishmen very articulately and distinctly for he had conversed with them very frequently and freely he said that they were all that were left of twoandthirty men who came on shore on the north side of japan being driven upon a great rock in a stormy night where they lost their ship and the rest of their men were drowned that he had persuaded the king of his country to send boats off to the rock or island where the ship was lost to save the rest of the men and to bring them on shore which was done and they were used very kindly and had houses built for them and land given them to plant for provision and that they lived by themselves  he said he went frequently among them to persuade them to worship their god an idol i suppose of their own making which he said they ungratefully refused and that therefore the king had once or twice ordered them all to be put to death but that as he said he had prevailed upon the king to spare them and let them live their own way as long as they were quiet and peaceable and did not go about to withdraw others from the worship of the country  i asked william why he did not inquire from whence they came i did said william for how could i but think it strange said he to hear him talk of englishmen on the north side of japan well said i what account did he give of it an account said william that will surprise thee and all the world after thee that shall hear of it and which makes me wish thou wouldst go up to japan and find them out what do you mean said i whence could they come why says william he pulled out a little book and in it a piece of paper where it was written in an englishmans hand and in plain english words thus and says william i read it myselfwe came from greenland and from the north pole this indeed was amazing to us all and more so to those seamen among us who knew anything of the infinite attempts which had been made from europe as well by the english as the dutch to discover a passage that way into those parts of the world and as william pressed as earnestly to go on to the north to rescue those poor men so the ships company began to incline to it and in a word we all came to this that we would stand in to the shore of formosa to find this priest again and have a further account of it all from him accordingly the sloop went over but when they came there the vessels were very unhappily sailed and this put an end to our inquiry after them and perhaps may have disappointed mankind of one of the most noble discoveries that ever was made or will again be made in the world for the good of mankind in general but so much for that  william was so uneasy at losing this opportunity that he pressed us earnestly to go up to japan to find out these men he told us that if it was nothing but to recover thirteen honest poor men from a kind of captivity which they would otherwise never be redeemed from and where perhaps they might some time or other be murdered by the barbarous people in defence of their idolatry it were very well worth our while and it would be in some measure making amends for the mischiefs we had done in the world but we that had no concern upon us for the mischiefs we had done had much less about any satisfactions to be made for it so he found that kind of discourse would weigh very little with us then he pressed us very earnestly to let him have the sloop to go by himself and i told him i would not oppose it but when he came to the sloop none of the men would go with him for the case was plain they had all a share in the cargo of the great ship as well as in thae of the sloop and the richness of the cargo was such that they would not leave it by any means so poor william much to his mortification was obliged to give it over what became of those thirteen men or whether they are not there still i can give no account of  we are now at the end of our cruise what we had taken was indeed so considerable that it was not only enough to satisfy the most covetous and the most ambitious minds in the world but it did indeed satisfy us and our men declared they did not desire any more the next motion therefore was about going back and the way by which we should perform the voyage so as not to be attacked by the dutch in the straits of sunda  we had pretty well stored ourselves here with provisions and it being now near the return of the monsoons we resolved to stand away to the southward and not only to keep without the philippine islands that is to say to the eastward of them but to keep on to the southward and see if we could not leave not only the moluccas or spice islands behind us but even nova guinea and nova hollandia also and so getting into the variable winds to the south of the tropic of capricorn steer away to the west over the great indian ocean  this was indeed at first a monstrous voyage in its appearance and the want of provisions threatened us william told us in so many words that it was impossible we could carry provisions enough to subsist us for such a voyage and especially fresh water and that as there would be no land for us to touch at where we could get any supply it was a madness to undertake it  but i undertook to remedy this evil and therefore desired them not to be uneasy at that for i knew that we might supply ourselves at mindanao the most southerly island of the philippines  accordingly we set sail having taken all the provisions here that we could get the 28th of september the wind veering a little at first from the nnw to the ne by e but afterwards settled about the ne and the ene we were nine weeks in this voyage having met with several interruptions by the weather and put in under the lee of a small island in the latitude of 16 degrees 12 minutes of which we never knew the name none of our charts having given any account of it i say we put in here by reason of a strange tornado or hurricane which brought us into a great deal of danger here we rode about sixteen days the winds being very tempestuous and the weather uncertain however we got some provisions on shore such as plants and roots and a few hogs we believed there were inhabitants on the island but we saw none of them  from hence the weather settling again we went on and came to the southernmost part of mindanao where we took in fresh water and some cows but the climate was so hot that we did not attempt to salt up any more than so as to keep a fortnight or three weeks and away we stood southward crossing the line and leaving gillolo on the starboard side we coasted the country they call new guinea where in the latitude of eight degrees south we put in again for provisions and water and where we found inhabitants but they fled from us and were altogether inconversable from thence sailing still southward we left all behind us that any of our charts and maps took any notice of and went on till we came to the latitude of seventeen degrees the wind continuing still northeast  here we made land to the westward which when we had kept in sight for three days coasting along the shore for the distance of about four leagues we began to fear we should find no outlet west and so should be obliged to go back again and put in among the moluccas at last but at length we found the land break off and go trending away to the west sea seeming to be all open to the south and southwest and a great sea came rolling out of the south which gave us to understand that there was no land for a great way  in a word we kept on our course to the south a little westerly till we passed the south tropic where we found the winds variable and now we stood away fair west and held it out for about twenty days when we discovered land right ahead and on our larboard bow we made directly to the shore being willing to take all advantages now for supplying ourselves with fresh provisions and water knowing we were now entering on that vast unknown indian ocean perhaps the greatest sea on the globe having with very little interruption of islands a continued sea quite round the globe  we found a good road here and some people on shore but when we landed they fled up the country nor would they hold any correspondence with us nor come near us but shot at us several times with arrows as long as lances we set up white flags for a truce but they either did not or would not understand it on the contrary they shot our flag of truce through several times with their arrows so that in a word we never came near any of them  we found good water here though it was something difficult to get at it but for living creatures we could see none for the people if they had any cattle drove them all away and showed us nothing but themselves and that sometimes in a threatening posture and in number so great that made us suppose the island to be greater than we first imagined it is true they would not come near enough for us to engage with them at least not openly but they came near enough for us to see them and by the help of our glasses to see that they were clothed and armed but their clothes were only about their lower and middle parts that they had long lances half pikes in their hands besides bows and arrows that they had great high things on their heads made as we believed of feathers and which looked something like our grenadiers caps in england  when we saw them so shy that they would not come near us our men began to range over the island if it was such for we never surrounded it to search for cattle and for any of the indian plantations for fruits or plants but they soon found to their cost that they were to use more caution than that came to and that they were to discover perfectly every bush and every tree before they ventured abroad in the country for about fourteen of our men going farther than the rest into a part of the country which seemed to be planted as they thought for it did but seem so only i think it was overgrown with canes such as we make our cane chairs withi say venturing too far they were suddenly attacked with a shower of arrows from almost every side of them as they thought out of the tops of the trees  they had nothing to do but to fly for it which however they could not resolve on till five of them were wounded nor had they escaped so if one of them had not been so much wiser or thoughtfuller than the rest as to consider that though they could not see the enemy so as to shoot at them yet perhaps the noise of their shot might terrify them and that they should rather fire at a venture accordingly ten of them faced about and fired at random anywhere among the canes  the noise and the fire not only terrified the enemy but as they believed their shot had luckily hit some of them for they found not only that the arrows which came thick among them before ceased but they heard the indians halloo after their way to one another and make a strange noise more uncouth and inimitably strange than any they had ever heard more like the howling and barking of wild creatures in the woods than like the voice of men only that sometimes they seemed to speak words  they observed also that this noise of the indians went farther and farther off so that they were satisfied the indians fled away except on one side where they heard a doleful groaning and howling and where it continued a good while which they supposed was from some or other of them being wounded and howling by reason of their wounds or killed and others howling over them but our men had enough of making discoveries so they did not trouble themselves to look farther but resolved to take this opportunity to retreat but the worst of their adventure was to come for as they came back they passed by a prodigious great trunk of an old tree what tree it was they said they did not know but it stood like an old decayed oak in a park where the keepers in england take a stand as they call it to shoot a deer and it stood just under the steep side of a great rock or hill that our people could not see what was beyond it  as they came by this tree they were of a sudden shot at from the top of the tree with seven arrows and three lances which to our great grief killed two of our men and wounded three more this was the more surprising because being without any defence and so near the trees they expected more lances and arrows every moment nor would flying do them any service the indians being as appeared very good marksmen in this extremity they had happily this presence of mind viz to run close to the tree and stand as it were under it so that those above could not come at or see them to throw their lances at them this succeeded and gave them time to consider what to do they knew their enemies and murderers were above they heard them talk and those above knew those were below but they below were obliged to keep close for fear of their lances from above at length one of our men looking a little more strictly than the rest thought he saw the head of one of the indians just over a dead limb of the tree which it seems the creature sat upon one man immediately fired and levelled his piece so true that the shot went through the fellows head and down he fell out of the tree immediately and came upon the ground with such force with the height of his fall that if he had not been killed with the shot he would certainly have been killed with dashing his body against the ground  this so frightened them that besides the howling noise they made in the tree our men heard a strange clutter of them in the body of the tree from whence they concluded they had made the tree hollow and were got to hide themselves there now had this been the case they were secure enough from our men for it was impossible any of our men could get up the tree on the outside there being no branches to climb by and to shoot at the tree that they tried several times to no purpose for the tree was so thick that no shot would enter it they made no doubt however but that they had their enemies in a trap and that a small siege would either bring them down tree and all or starve them out so they resolved to keep their post and send to us for help accordingly two of them came away to us for more hands and particularly desired that some of our carpenters might come with tools to help to cut down the tree or at least to cut down other wood and set fire to it and that they concluded would not fail to bring them out  accordingly our men went like a little army and with mighty preparations for an enterprise the like of which has scarce been ever heard to form the siege of a great tree however when they came there they found the task difficult enough for the old trunk was indeed a very great one and very tall being at least twoandtwenty feet high with seven old limbs standing out every way from the top but decayed and very few leaves if any left on it  william the quaker whose curiosity led him to go among the rest proposed that they should make a ladder and get upon the top and then throw wildfire into the tree and smoke them out others proposed going back and getting a great gun out of the ship which would split the tree in pieces with the iron bullets others that they should cut down a great deal of wood and pile it up round the tree and set it on fire and burn the tree and the indians in it  these consultations took up our people no less than two or three days in all which time they heard nothing of the supposed garrison within this wooden castle nor any noise within williams project was first gone about and a large strong ladder was made to scale this wooden tower and in two or three hours time it would have been ready to mount when on a sudden they heard the noise of the indians in the body of the tree again and a little after several of them appeared at the top of the tree and threw some lances down at our men one of which struck one of our seamen atop of the shoulder and gave him such a desperate wound that the surgeons not only had a great deal of difficulty to cure him but the poor man endured such horrible torture that we all said they had better have killed him outright however he was cured at last though he never recovered the perfect use of his arm the lance having cut some of the tendons on the top of the arm near the shoulder which as i supposed performed the office of motion to the limb before so that the poor man was a cripple all the days of his life but to return to the desperate rogues in the tree our men shot at them but did not find they had hit them or any of them but as soon as ever they shot at them they could hear them huddle down into the trunk of the tree again and there to be sure they were safe  well however it was this which put by the project of williams ladder for when it was done who would venture up among such a troop of bold creatures as were there and who they supposed were desperate by their circumstances and as but one man at a time could go up they began to think it would not do and indeed i was of the opinion for about this time i was come to their assistance that going up the ladder would not do unless it was thus that a man should as it were run just up to the top and throw some fireworks into the tree and come down again and this we did two or three times but found no effect of it at last one of our gunners made a stinkpot as we called it being a composition which only smokes but does not flame or burn but withal the smoke of it is so thick and the smell of it so intolerably nauseous that it is not to be suffered this he threw into the tree himself and we waited for the effect of it but heard or saw nothing all that night or the next day so we concluded the men within were all smothered when on a sudden the next night we heard them upon the top of the tree again shouting and hallooing like madmen  we concluded as anybody would that this was to call for help and we resolved to continue our siege for we were all enraged to see ourselves so baulked by a few wild people whom we thought we had safe in our clutches and indeed never were there so many concurring circumstances to delude men in any case we had met with we resolved however to try another stinkpot the next night and our engineer and gunner had got it ready when hearing a noise of the enemy on the top of the tree and in the body of the tree i was not willing to let the gunner go up the ladder which i said would be but to be certain of being murdered however he found a medium for it and that was to go up a few steps and with a long pole in his hand to throw it in upon the top of the tree the ladder being standing all this while against the top of the tree but when the gunner with his machine at the top of his pole came to the tree with three other men to help him behold the ladder was gone  this perfectly confounded us and we now concluded the indians in the tree had by this piece of negligence taken the opportunity and come all down the ladder made their escape and had carried away the ladder with them i laughed most heartily at my friend william who as i said had the direction of the siege and had set up a ladder for the garrison as we called them to get down upon and run away but when daylight came we were all set to rights again for there stood our ladder hauled up on the top of the tree with about half of it in the hollow of the tree and the other half upright in the air then we began to laugh at the indians for fools that they could not as well have found their way down by the ladder and have made their escape as to have pulled it up by main strength into the tree  we then resolved upon fire and so to put an end to the work at once and burn the tree and its inhabitants together and accordingly we went to work to cut wood and in a few hours time we got enough as we thought together and piling it up round the bottom of the tree we set it on fire waiting at a distance to see when the gentlemens quarters being too hot for them they would come flying out at the top but we were quite confounded when on a sudden we found the fire all put out by a great quantity of water thrown upon it we then thought the devil must be in them to be sure says william this is certainly the cunningest piece of indian engineering that ever was heard of and there can be but one thing more to guess at besides witchcraft and dealing with the devil which i believe not one word of says he and that must be that this is an artificial tree or a natural tree artificially made hollow down into the earth through root and all and that these creatures have an artificial cavity underneath it quite into the hill or a way to go through and under the hill to some other place and where that other place is we know not but if it be not our own fault ill find the place and follow them into it before i am two days older he then called the carpenters to know of them if they had any large saws that would cut through the body and they told him they had no saws that were long enough nor could men work into such a monstrous old stump in a great while but that they would go to work with it with their axes and undertake to cut it down in two days and stock up the root of it in two more but william was for another way which proved much better than all this for he was for silent work that if possible he might catch some of the fellows in it so he sets twelve men to it with large augers to bore great holes into the side of the tree to go almost through but not quite through which holes were bored without noise and when they were done he filled them all with gunpowder stopping strong plugs bolted crossways into the holes and then boring a slanting hole of a less size down into the greater hole all of which were filled with powder and at once blown up when they took fire they made such a noise and tore and split up the tree in so many places and in such a manner that we could see plainly such another blast would demolish it and so it did thus at the second time we could at two or three places put our hands in them and discovered a cheat namely that there was a cave or hole dug into the earth from or through the bottom of the hollow and that it had communication with another cave farther in where we heard the voices of several of the wild folks calling and talking to one another  when we came thus far we had a great mind to get at them and william desired that three men might be given him with handgrenadoes and he promised to go down first and boldly he did so for william to give him his due had the heart of a lion  they had pistols in their hands and swords by their sides but as they had taught the indians before by their stinkpots the indians returned them in their own kind for they made such a smoke come up out of the entrance into the cave or hollow that william and his three men were glad to come running out of the cave and out of the tree too for mere want of breath and indeed they were almost stifled  never was a fortification so well defended or assailants so many ways defeated we were now for giving it over and particularly i called william and told him i could not but laugh to see us spinning out our time here for nothing that i could not imagine what we were doing that it was certain that the rogues that were in it were cunning to the last degree and it would vex anybody to be so baulked by a few naked ignorant fellows but still it was not worth our while to push it any further nor was there anything that i knew of to be got by the conquest when it was made so that i thought it high time to give it over  william acknowledged what i said was just and that there was nothing but our curiosity to be gratified in this attempt and though as he said he was very desirous to have searched into the thing yet he would not insist upon it so we resolved to quit it and come away which we did however william said before we went he would have this satisfaction of them viz to burn down the tree and stop up the entrance into the cave and while doing this the gunner told him he would have one satisfaction of the rogues and this was that he would make a mine of it and see which way it had vent upon this he fetched two barrels of powder out of the ships and placed them in the inside of the hollow of the cave as far in as he durst go to carry them and then filling up the mouth of the cave where the tree stood and ramming it sufficiently hard leaving only a pipe or touchhole he gave fire to it and stood at a distance to see which way it would operate when on a sudden he found the force of the powder burst its way out among some bushes on the other side the little hill i mentioned and that it came roaring out there as out of the mouth of a cannon immediately running thither we saw the effects of the powder  first we saw that there was the other mouth of the cave which the powder had so torn and opened that the loose earth was so fallen in again that nothing of shape could be discerned but there we saw what was become of the garrison of the indians too who had given us all this trouble for some of them had no arms some no legs some no head some lay half buried in the rubbish of the minethat is to say in the loose earth that fell in and in short there was a miserable havoc made in them all for we had good reason to believe not one of them that were in the inside could escape but rather were shot out of the mouth of the cave like a bullet out of a gun  we had now our full satisfaction of the indians but in short this was a losing voyage for we had two men killed one quite crippled and five more wounded we spent two barrels of powder and eleven days time and all to get the understanding how to make an indian mine or how to keep garrison in a hollow tree and with this wit bought at this dear price we came away having taken in some fresh water but got no fresh provisions  we then considered what we should do to get back again to madagascar we were much about the latitude of the cape of good hope but had such a very long run and were neither sure of meeting with fair winds nor with any land in the way that we knew not what to think of it william was our last resort in this case again and he was very plain with us friend says he to captain wilmot what occasion hast thou to run the venture of starving merely for the pleasure of saying thou hast been where nobody has been before there are a great many places nearer home of which thou mayest say the same thing at less expense i see no occasion thou hast of keeping thus far south any longer than till you are sure you are to the west end of java and sumatra and then thou mayest stand away north towards ceylon and the coast of coromandel and madras where thou mayest get both fresh water and fresh provisions and to that part it is likely we may hold out well enough with the stores we have already  this was wholesome advice and such as was not to be slighted so we stood away to the west keeping between the latitude of 31 and 35 and had very good weather and fair winds for about ten days sail by which time by our reckoning we were clear of the isles and might run away to the north and if we did not fall in with ceylon we should at least go into the great deep bay of bengal  but we were out in our reckoning a great deal for when we had stood due north for about fifteen or sixteen degrees we met with land again on our starboard bow about three leagues distance so we came to an anchor about half a league from it and manned out our boats to see what sort of a country it was we found it a very good one fresh water easy to come at but no cattle that we could see or inhabitants and we were very shy of searching too far after them lest we should make such another journey as we did last so that we let rambling alone and chose rather to take what we could find which was only a few wild mangoes and some plants of several kinds which we knew not the names of  we made no stay here but put to sea again nw by n but had little wind for a fortnight more when we made land again and standing in with the shore we were surprised to find ourselves on the south shore of java and just as we were coming to an anchor we saw a boat carrying dutch colours sailing alongshore we were not solicitous to speak with them or any other of their nation but left it indifferent to our people when they went on shore to see the dutchmen or not to see them our business was to get provisions which indeed by this time were very short with us  we resolved to go on shore with our boats in the most convenient place we could find and to look out a proper harbour to bring the ship into leaving it to our fate whether we should meet with friends or enemies resolving however not to stay any considerable time at least not long enough to have expresses sent across the island to batavia and for ships to come round from thence to attack us  we found according to our desire a very good harbour where we rode in seven fathom water well defended from the weather whatever might happen and here we got fresh provisions such as good hogs and some cows and that we might lay in a little store we killed sixteen cows and pickled and barrelled up the flesh as well as we could be supposed to do in the latitude of eight degrees from the line  we did all this in about five days and filled our casks with water and the last boat was coming off with herbs and roots we being unmoored and our foretopsail loose for sailing when we spied a large ship to the northward bearing down directly upon us we knew not what she might be but concluded the worst and made all possible haste to get our anchor up and get under sail that we might be in a readiness to see what she had to say to us for we were under no great concern for one ship but our notion was that we should be attacked by three or four together  by the time we had got up our anchor and the boat was stowed the ship was within a league of us and as we thought bore down to engage us so we spread our black flag or ancient on the poop and the bloody flag at the topmasthead and having made a clear ship we stretched away to the westward to get the wind of him  they had it seems quite mistaken us before expecting nothing of an enemy or a pirate in those seas and not doubting but we had been one of their own ships they seemed to be in some confusion when they found their mistake so they immediately hauled upon a wind on the other tack and stood edging in for the shore towards the easternmost part of the island upon this we tacked and stood after him with all the sail we could and in two hours came almost within gunshot though they crowded all the sail they could lay on there was no remedy but to engage us and they soon saw their inequality of force we fired a gun for them to bring to so they manned out their boat and sent to us with a flag of truce we sent back the boat but with this answer to the captain that he had nothing to do but to strike and bring his ship to an anchor under our stern and come on board us himself when he should know our demands but that however since he had not yet put us to the trouble of forcing him which we saw we were able to do we assured them that the captain should return again in safety and all his men and that supplying us with such things as we should demand his ship should not be plundered they went back with this message and it was some time after they were on board before they struck which made us begin to think they refused it so we fired a shot and in a few minutes more we perceived their boat put off and as soon as the boat put off the ship struck and came to an anchor as was directed  when the captain came on board we demanded an account of their cargo which was chiefly bales of goods from bengal for bantam we told them our present want was provisions which they had no need of being just at the end of their voyage and that if they would send their boat on shore with ours and procure us sixandtwenty head of black cattle threescore hogs a quantity of brandy and arrack and three hundred bushels of rice we would let them go free  as to the rice they gave us six hundred bushels which they had actually on board together with a parcel shipped upon freight also they gave us thirty middling casks of very good arrack but beef and pork they had none however they went on shore with our men and bought eleven bullocks and fifty hogs which were pickled up for our occasion and upon the supplies of provision from shore we dismissed them and their ship  we lay here several days before we could furnish ourselves with the provisions agreed for and some of the men fancied the dutchmen were contriving our destruction but they were very honest and did what they could to furnish the black cattle but found it impossible to supply so many so they came and told us ingenuously that unless we could stay a while longer they could get no more oxen or cows than those eleven with which we were obliged to be satisfied taking the value of them in other things rather than stay longer there on our side we were punctual with them in observing the conditions we had agreed on nor would we let any of our men so much as go on board them or suffer any of their men to come on board us for had any of our men gone on board nobody could have answered for their behaviour any more than if they had been on shore in an enemys country  we were now victualled for our voyage and as we mattered not purchase we went merrily on for the coast of ceylon where we intended to touch to get fresh water again and more provisions and we had nothing material offered in this part of the voyage only that we met with contrary winds and were above a month in the passage  we put in upon the south coast of the island desiring to have as little to do with the dutch as we could and as the dutch were lords of the country as to commerce so they are more so of the seacoast where they have several forts and in particular have all the cinnamon which is the trade of that island  we took in fresh water here and some provisions but did not much trouble ourselves about laying in any stores our beef and hogs which we got at java being not yet all gone by a good deal we had a little skirmish on shore here with some of the people of the island some of our men having been a little too familiar with the homely ladies of the country for homely indeed they were to such a degree that if our men had not had good stomachs that way they would scarce have touched any of them  i could never fully get it out of our men what they did they were so true to one another in their wickedness but i understood in the main that it was some barbarous thing they had done and that they had like to have paid dear for it for the men resented it to the last degree and gathered in such numbers about them that had not sixteen more of our men in another boat come all in the nick of time just to rescue our first men who were but eleven and so fetch them off by main force they had been all cut off the inhabitants being no less than two or three hundred armed with darts and lances the usual weapons of the country and which they are very dexterous at the throwing even so dexterous that it was scarce credible and had our men stood to fight them as some of them were bold enough to talk of they had been all overwhelmed and killed as it was seventeen of our men were wounded and some of them very dangerously but they were more frighted than hurt too for every one of them gave themselves over for dead men believing the lances were poisoned but william was our comfort here too for when two of our surgeons were of the same opinion and told the men foolishly enough that they would die william cheerfully went to work with them and cured them all but one who rather died by drinking some arrack punch than of his wound the excess of drinking throwing him into a fever  we had enough of ceylon though some of our people were for going ashore again sixty or seventy men together to be revenged but william persuaded them against it and his reputation was so great among the men as well as with us that were commanders that he could influence them more than any of us  they were mighty warm upon their revenge and they would go on shore and destroy five hundred of them well says william and suppose you do what are you the better why then says one of them speaking for the rest we shall have our satisfaction well and what will you be the better for that says william they could then say nothing to that then says william if i mistake not your business is money now i desire to know if you conquer and kill two or three thousand of these poor creatures they have no money pray what will you get they are poor naked wretches what shall you gain by them but then says william perhaps in doing this you may chance to lose halfascore of your own company as it is very probable you may pray what gain is in it and what account can you give the captain for his lost men in short william argued so effectually that he convinced them that it was mere murder to do so and that the men had a right to their own and that they had no right to take them away that it was destroying innocent men who had acted no otherwise than as the laws of nature dictated and that it would be as much murder to do so as to meet a man on the highway and kill him for the mere sake of it in cold blood not regarding whether he had done any wrong to us or no  these reasons prevailed with them at last and they were content to go away and leave them as they found them in the first skirmish they killed between sixty and seventy men and wounded a great many more but they had nothing and our people got nothing by it but the loss of one mans life and the wounding sixteen more as above  but another accident brought us to a necessity of further business with these people and indeed we had like to have put an end to our lives and adventures all at once among them for about three days after our putting out to sea from the place where we had that skirmish we were attacked by a violent storm of wind from the south or rather a hurricane of wind from all the points southward for it blew in a most desperate and furious manner from the se to the sw one minute at one point and then instantly turning about again to another point but with the same violence nor were we able to work the ship in that condition so that the ship i was in split three topsails and at last brought the maintopmast by the board and in a word we were once or twice driven right ashore and one time had not the wind shifted the very moment it did we had been dashed in a thousand pieces upon a great ledge of rocks which lay off about halfaleague from the shore but as i have said the wind shifting very often and at that time coming to the ese we stretched off and got above a league more searoom in halfanhour after that it blew with some fury sw by s then sw by w and put us back again a great way to the eastward of the ledge of rocks where we found a great opening between the rocks and the land and endeavoured to come to an anchor there but we found there was no ground fit to anchor in and that we should lose our anchors there being nothing but rocks we stood through the opening which held about four leagues the storm continued and now we found a dreadful foul shore and knew not what course to take we looked out very narrowly for some river or creek or bay where we might run in and come to an anchor but found none a great while at length we saw a great headland lie out far south into the sea and that to such a length that in short we saw plainly that if the wind held where it was we could not weather it so we ran in as much under the lee of the point as we could and came to an anchor in about twelve fathom water  but the wind veering again in the night and blowing exceedingly hard our anchors came home and the ship drove till the rudder struck against the ground and had the ship gone half her length farther she had been lost and every one of us with her but our sheetanchor held its own and we heaved in some of the cable to get clear of the ground we had struck upon it was by this only cable that we rode it out all night and towards morning we thought the wind abated a little and it was well for us that it was so for in spite of what our sheetanchor did for us we found the ship fast aground in the morning to our very great surprise and amazement  when the tide was out though the water here ebbed away the ship lay almost dry upon a bank of hard sand which never i suppose had any ship upon it before the people of the country came down in great numbers to look at us and gaze not knowing what we were but gaping at us as at a great sight or wonder at which they were surprised and knew not what to do  i have reason to believe that upon the sight they immediately sent an account of a ship being there and of the condition we were in for the next day there appeared a great man whether it was their king or no i know not but he had abundance of men with him and some with long javelins in their hands as long as halfpikes and these came all down to the waters edge and drew up in a very good order just in our view they stood near an hour without making any motion and then there came near twenty of them with a man before them carrying a white flag they came forward into the water as high as their waists the sea not going so high as before for the wind was abated and blew off the shore  the man made a long oration to us as we could see by his gestures and we sometimes heard his voice but knew not one word he said william who was always useful to us i believe was here again the saving of all our lives the case was this the fellow or what i might call him when his speech was done gave three great screams for i know not what else to say they were then lowered his white flag three times and then made three motions to us with his arm to come to him  i acknowledge that i was for manning out the boat and going to them but william would by no means allow me he told me we ought to trust nobody that if they were barbarians and under their own government we might be sure to be all murdered and if they were christians we should not fare much better if they knew who we were that it was the custom of the malabars to betray all people that they could get into their hands and that these were some of the same people and that if we had any regard to our own safety we should not go to them by any means i opposed him a great while and told him i thought he used to be always right but that now i thought he was not that i was no more for running needless risks than he or any one else but i thought all nations in the world even the most savage people when they held out a flag of peace kept the offer of peace made by that signal very sacredly and i gave him several examples of it in the history of my african travels which i have here gone through in the beginning of this work and that i could not think these people worse than some of them and besides i told him our case seemed to be such that we must fall into somebodys hands or other and that we had better fall into their hands by a friendly treaty than by a forced submission nay though they had indeed a treacherous design and therefore i was for a parley with them  well friend says william very gravely if thou wilt go i cannot help it i shall only desire to take my last leave of thee at parting for depend upon it thou wilt never see us again whether we in the ship may come off any better at last i cannot resolve thee but this i will answer for that we will not give up our lives idly and in cool blood as thou art going to do we will at least preserve ourselves as long as we can and die at last like men not like fools trepanned by the wiles of a few barbarians  william spoke this with so much warmth and yet with so much assurance of our fate that i began to think a little of the risk i was going to run i had no more mind to be murdered than he and yet i could not for my life be so fainthearted in the thing as he upon which i asked him if he had any knowledge of the place or had ever been there he said no then i asked him if he had heard or read anything about the people of this island and of their way of treating any christians that had fallen into their hands and he told me he had heard of one and he would tell me the story afterward his name he said was knox commander of an east india ship who was driven on shore just as we were upon this island of ceylon though he could not say it was at the same place or whereabouts that he was beguiled by the barbarians and enticed to come on shore just as we were invited to do at that time and that when they had him they surrounded him and eighteen or twenty of his men and never suffered them to return but kept them prisoners or murdered them he could not tell which but they were carried away up into the country separated from one another and never heard of afterwards except the captains son who miraculously made his escape after twenty years slavery  i had no time then to ask him to give the full story of this knox much less to hear him tell it me but as it is usual in such cases when one begins to be a little touched i turned short with him why then friend william said i what would you have us do you see what condition we are in and what is before us something must be done and that immediately why says william ill tell thee what thou shalt do first cause a white flag to be hanged out as they do to us and man out the longboat and pinnace with as many men as they can well stow to handle their arms and let me go with them and thou shalt see what we will do if i miscarry thou mayest be safe and i will also tell thee that if i do miscarry it shall be my own fault and thou shalt learn wit by my folly  i knew not what to reply to him at first but after some pause i said william william i am as both you should be lost as you are that i should and if there be any danger i desire you may no more fall into it than i therefore if you will let us all keep in the ship fare alike and take our fate together  no no says william theres no danger in the method i propose thou shalt go with me if thou thinkest fit if thou pleasest but to follow the measures that i shall resolve on depend upon it though we will go off from the ships we will not a man of us go any nearer them than within call to talk with them thou seest they have no boats to come off to us but says he i rather desire thou wouldst take my advice and manage the ships as i shall give the signal from the boat and let us concert that matter together before we go off  well i found william had his measures in his head all laid beforehand and was not at a loss what to do at all so i told him he should be captain for this voyage and we would be all of us under his orders which i would see observed to a tittle  upon this conclusion of our debates he ordered fourandtwenty men into the longboat and twelve men into the pinnace and the sea being now pretty smooth they went off being all very well armed also he ordered that all the guns of the great ship on the side which lay next the shore should be loaded with musketballs old nails stubs and suchlike pieces of old iron lead and anything that came to hand and that we should prepare to fire as soon as ever we saw them lower the white flag and hoist up a red one in the pinnace  with these measures fixed between us they went off towards the shore william in the pinnace with twelve men and the longboat coming after him with fourandtwenty more all stout resolute fellows and very well armed they rowed so near the shore as that they might speak to one another carrying a white flag as the other did and offering a parley the brutes for such they were showed themselves very courteous but finding we could not understand them they fetched an old dutchman who had been their prisoner many years and set him to speak to us the sum and substance of his speech was that the king of the country had sent his general down to know who we were and what our business was william stood up in the stern of the pinnace and told him that as to that he that was an european by his language and voice might easily know what we were and our condition the ship being aground upon the sand would also tell him that our business there was that of a ship in distress so william desired to know what they came down for with such a multitude and with arms and weapons as if they came to war with us  he answered they might have good reason to come down to the shore the country being alarmed with the appearance of ships of strangers upon the coast and as our vessels were full of men and as we had guns and weapons the king had sent part of his military men that in case of any invasion upon the country they might be ready to defend themselves whatsoever might be the occasion  but says he as you are men in distress the king has ordered his general who is here also to give you all the assistance he can and to invite you on shore and receive you with all possible courtesy says william very quick upon him before i give thee an answer to that i desire thee to tell me what thou art for by thy speech thou art an european he answered presently he was a dutchman that i know well says william by thy speech but art thou a native dutchman of holland or a native of this country that has learned dutch by conversing among the hollanders who we know are settled upon this island  no says the old man i am a native of delft in the province of holland in europe  well says william immediately but art thou a christian or a heathen or what we call a renegado  i am says he a christian and so they went on in a short dialogue as follows  william thou art a dutchman and a christian thou sayest pray art thou a freeman or a servant  dutchman i am a servant to the king here and in his army  w but art thou a volunteer or a prisoner  d indeed i was a prisoner at first but am at liberty now and so am a volunteer  w that is to say being first a prisoner thou hast liberty to serve them but art thou so at liberty that thou mayest go away if thou pleasest to thine own countrymen  d no i do not say so my countrymen live a great way off on the north and east parts of the island and there is no going to them without the kings express license  w well and why dost thou not get a license to go away  d i have never asked for it  w and i suppose if thou didst thou knowest thou couldst not obtain it  d i cannot say much as to that but why do you ask me all these questions  w why my reason is good if thou art a christian and a prisoner how canst thou consent to be made an instrument to these barbarians to betray us into their hands who are thy countrymen and fellowchristians is it not a barbarous thing in thee to do so  d how do i go about to betray you do i not give you an account how the king invites you to come on shore and has ordered you to be treated courteously and assisted  w as thou art a christian though i doubt it much dost thou believe the king or the general as thou callest it means one word of what he says  d he promises you by the mouth of his great general  w i dont ask thee what he promises or by whom but i ask thee this canst thou say that thou believest he intends to perform it  d how can i answer that how can i tell what he intends  w thou canst tell what thou believest  d i cannot say but he will perform it i believe he may  w thou art but a doubletongued christian i doubt come ill ask thee another question wilt thou say that thou believest it and that thou wouldst advise me to believe it and put our lives into their hands upon these promises  d i am not to be your adviser  w thou art perhaps afraid to speak thy mind because thou art in their power pray do any of them understand what thou and i say can they speak dutch  d no not one of them i have no apprehensions upon that account at all  w why then answer me plainly if thou art a christian is it safe for us to venture upon their words to put ourselves into their hands and come on shore  d you put it very home to me pray let me ask you another question are you in any likelihood of getting your ship off if you refuse it  w yes yes we shall get off the ship now the storm is over we dont fear it  d then i cannot say it is best for you to trust them  w well it is honestly said  d but what shall i say to them  w give them good words as they give us  d what good words  w why let them tell the king that we are strangers who were driven on his coast by a great storm that we thank him very kindly for his offer of civility to us which if we are further distressed we will accept thankfully but that at present we have no occasion to come on shore and besides that we cannot safely leave the ship in the present condition she is in but that we are obliged to take care of her in order to get her off and expect in a tide or two more to get her quite clear and at an anchor  d but he will expect you to come on shore then to visit him and make him some present for his civility  w when we have got our ship clear and stopped the leaks we will pay our respects to him  d nay you may as well come to him now as then  w nay hold friend i did not say we would come to him then you talked of making him a present that is to pay our respects to him is it not  d well but i will tell him that you will come on shore to him when your ship is got off  w i have nothing to say to that you may tell him what you think fit  d but he will be in a great rage if i do not  w who will he be in a great rage at  d at you  w what occasion have we to value that  d why he will send all his army down against you  w and what if they were all here just now what dost thou suppose they could do to us  d he would expect they should burn your ships and bring you all to him  w tell him if he should try he may catch a tartar  d he has a world of men  w has he any ships  d no he has no ships  w nor boats  d no nor boats  w why what then do you think we care for his men what canst thou do now to us if thou hadst a hundred thousand with thee  d oh they might set you on fire  w set us afiring thou meanest that they might indeed but set us on fire they shall not they may try at their peril and we shall make mad work with your hundred thousand men if they come within reach of our guns i assure thee  d but what if the king gives you hostages for your safety  w whom can he give but mere slaves and servants like thyself whose lives he no more values than we an english hound  d whom do you demand for hostages  w himself and your worship  d what would you do with him  w do with him as he would do with uscut his head off  d and what would you do with me  w do with thee we would carry thee home into thine own country and though thou deservest the gallows we would make a man and a christian of thee again and not do by thee as thou wouldst have done by usbetray thee to a parcel of merciless savage pagans that know no god nor how to show mercy to man  d you put a thought in my head that i will speak to you about tomorrow  thus they went away and william came on board and gave us a full account of his parley with the old dutchman which was very diverting and to me instructing for i had abundance of reason to acknowledge william had made a better judgment of things than i  it was our good fortune to get our ship off that very night and to bring her to an anchor at about a mile and a half farther out and in deep water to our great satisfaction so that we had no need to fear the dutchmans king with his hundred thousand men and indeed we had some sport with them the next day when they came down a vast prodigious multitude of them very few less in number in our imagination than a hundred thousand with some elephants though if it had been an army of elephants they could have done us no harm for we were fairly at our anchor now and out of their reach and indeed we thought ourselves more out of their reach than we really were and it was ten thousand to one that we had not been fast aground again for the wind blowing off shore though it made the water smooth where we lay yet it blew the ebb farther out than usual and we could easily perceive the sand which we touched upon before lay in the shape of a halfmoon and surrounded us with two horns of it so that we lay in the middle or centre of it as in a round bay safe just as we were and in deep water but present death as it were on the right hand and on the left for the two horns or points of the sand reached out beyond where our ship lay near two miles  on that part of the sand which lay on our east side this misguided multitude extended themselves and being most of them not above their knees or most of them not above ankledeep in the water they as it were surrounded us on that side and on the side of the mainland and a little way on the other side of the sand standing in a halfcircle or rather threefifths of a circle for about six miles in length the other horn or point of the sand which lay on our west side being not quite so shallow they could not extend themselves upon it so far  they little thought what service they had done us and how unwittingly and by the greatest ignorance they had made themselves pilots to us while we having not sounded the place might have been lost before we were aware it is true we might have sounded our new harbour before we had ventured out but i cannot say for certain whether we should or not for i for my part had not the least suspicion of what our real case was however i say perhaps before we had weighed we should have looked about us a little i am sure we ought to have done it for besides these armies of human furies we had a very leaky ship and all our pumps could hardly keep the water from growing upon us and our carpenters were overboard working to find out and stop the wounds we had received heeling her first on the one side and then on the other and it was very diverting to see how when our men heeled the ship over to the side next the wild army that stood on the east horn of the sand they were so amazed between fright and joy that it put them into a kind of confusion calling to one another hallooing and skreeking in a manner that it is impossible to describe  while we were doing this for we were in a great hurry you may be sure and all hands at work as well at the stopping our leaks as repairing our rigging and sails which had received a great deal of damage and also in rigging a new maintopmast and the likei say while we were doing all this we perceived a body of men of near a thousand move from that part of the army of the barbarians that lay at the bottom of the sandy bay and came all along the waters edge round the sand till they stood just on our broadside east and were within about halfamile of us then we saw the dutchman come forward nearer to us and all alone with his white flag and all his motions just as before and there he stood  our men had but just brought the ship to rights again as they came up to our broadside and we had very happily found out and stopped the worst and most dangerous leak that we had to our very great satisfaction so i ordered the boats to be hauled up and manned as they were the day before and william to go as plenipotentiary i would have gone myself if i had understood dutch but as i did not it was to no purpose for i should be able to know nothing of what was said but from him at secondhand which might be done as well afterwards all the instructions i pretended to give william was if possible to get the old dutchman away and if he could to make him come on board  well william went just as before and when he came within about sixty or seventy yards of the shore he held up his white flag as the dutchman did and turning the boats broadside to the shore and his men lying upon their oars the parley or dialogue began again thus  william well friend what dost thou say to us now  dutchman i come of the same mild errand as i did yesterday  w what dost thou pretend to come of a mild errand with all these people at thy back and all the foolish weapons of war they bring with them prithee what dost thou mean  d the king hastens us to invite the captain and all his men to come on shore and has ordered all his men to show them all the civility they can  w well and are all those men come to invite us ashore  d they will do you no hurt if you will come on shore peaceably  w well and what dost thou think they can do to us if we will not  d i would not have them do you any hurt then neither  w but prithee friend do not make thyself fool and knave too dost not thou know that we are out of fear of all thy army and out of danger of all that they can do what makes thee act so simply as well as so knavishly  d why you may think yourselves safer than you are you do not know what they may do to you i can assure you they are able to do you a great deal of harm and perhaps burn your ship  w suppose that were true as i am sure it is false you see we have more ships to carry us off pointing to the sloop  nbjust at this time we discovered the sloop standing towards us from the east along the shore at about the distance of two leagues which was to our particular satisfaction she having been missing thirteen days  d we do not value that if you had ten ships you dare not come on shore with all the men you have in a hostile way we are too many for you  w thou dost not even in that speak as thou meanest and we may give thee a trial of our hands when our friends come up to us for thou hearest they have discovered us  just then the sloop fired five guns which was to get news of us for they did not see us  d yes i hear they fire but i hope your ship will not fire again for if they do our general will take it for breaking the truce and will make the army let fly a shower of arrows at you in the boat  w thou mayest be sure the ship will fire that the other ship may hear them but not with ball if thy general knows no better he may begin when he will but thou mayest be sure we will return it to his cost  d what must i do then  w do why go to him and tell him of it beforehand then and let him know that the ship firing is not at him nor his men and then come again and tell us what he says  d no i will send to him which will do as well  w do as thou wilt but i believe thou hadst better go thyself for if our men fire first i suppose he will be in a great wrath and it may be at thee for as to his wrath at us we tell thee beforehand we value it not  d you slight them too much you know not what they may do  w thou makest as if these poor savage wretches could do mighty things prithee let us see what you can all do we value it not thou mayest set down thy flag of truce when thou pleasest and begin  d i had rather make a truce and have you all part friends  w thou art a deceitful rogue thyself for it is plain thou knowest these people would only persuade us on shore to entrap and surprise us and yet thou that art a christian as thou callest thyself would have us come on shore and put our lives into their hands who know nothing that belongs to compassion good usage or good manners how canst thou be such a villain  d how can you call me so what have i done to you and what would you have me do  w not act like a traitor but like one that was once a christian and would have been so still if you had not been a dutchman  d i know not what to do not i i wish i were from them they are a bloody people  w prithee make no difficulty of what thou shouldst do canst thou swim  d yes i can swim but if i should attempt to swim off to you i should have a thousand arrows and javelins sticking in me before i should get to your boat  w ill bring the boat close to thee and take thee on board in spite of them all we will give them but one volley and ill engage they will all run away from thee  d you are mistaken in them i assure you they would immediately come all running down to the shore and shoot firearrows at you and set your boat and ship and all on fire about your ears  w we will venture that if thou wilt come off  d will you use me honourably when i am among you  w ill give thee my word for it if thou provest honest  d will you not make me a prisoner  w i will be thy surety body for body that thou shalt be a free man and go whither thou wilt though i own to thee thou dost not deserve it  just at this time our ship fired three guns to answer the sloop and let her know we saw her who immediately we perceived understood it and stood directly for the place but it is impossible to express the confusion and filthy vile noise the hurry and universal disorder that was among that vast multitude of people upon our firing off three guns they immediately all repaired to their arms as i may call it for to say they put themselves into order would be saying nothing  upon the word of command then they advanced all in a body to the seaside and resolving to give us one volley of their firearms for such they were immediately they saluted us with a hundred thousand of their firearrows every one carrying a little bag of cloth dipped in brimstone or some such thing which flying through the air had nothing to hinder it taking fire as it flew and it generally did so  i cannot say but this method of attacking us by a way we had no notion of might give us at first some little surprise for the number was so great at first that we were not altogether without apprehensions that they might unluckily set our ship on fire so that william resolved immediately to row on board and persuade us all to weigh and stand out to sea but there was no time for it for they immediately let fly a volley at the boat and at the ship from all parts of the vast crowd of people which stood near the shore nor did they fire as i may call it all at once and so leave off but their arrows being soon notched upon their bows they kept continually shooting so that the air was full of flame  i could not say whether they set their cotton rag on fire before they shot the arrow for i did not perceive they had fire with them which however it seems they had the arrow besides the fire it carried with it had a head or a peg as we call it of bone and some of sharp flint stone and some few of a metal too soft in itself for metal but hard enough to cause it to enter if it were a plank so as to stick where it fell  william and his men had notice sufficient to lie close behind their wasteboards which for this very purpose they had made so high that they could easily sink themselves behind them so as to defend themselves from anything that came pointblank as we call it or upon a line but for what might fall perpendicularly out of the air they had no guard but took the hazard of that at first they made as if they would row away but before they went they gave a volley of their firearms firing at those which stood with the dutchman but william ordered them to be sure to take their aim at others so as to miss him and they did so  there was no calling to them now for the noise was so great among them that they could hear nobody but our men boldly rowed in nearer to them for they were at first driven a little off and when they came nearer they fired a second volley which put the fellows into great confusion and we could see from the ship that several of them were killed or wounded  we thought this was a very unequal fight and therefore we made a signal to our men to row away that we might have a little of the sport as well as they but the arrows flew so thick upon them being so near the shore that they could not sit to their oars so they spread a little of their sail thinking they might sail along the shore and lie behind their wasteboard but the sail had not been spread six minutes till it had five hundred firearrows shot into it and through it and at length set it fairly on fire nor were our men quite out of the danger of its setting the boat on fire and this made them paddle and shove the boat away as well as they could as they lay to get farther off  by this time they had left us a fair mark at the whole savage army and as we had sheered the ship as near to them as we could we fired among the thickest of them six or seven times five guns at a time with shot old iron musketbullets c  we could easily see that we made havoc among them and killed and wounded abundance of them and that they were in a great surprise at it but yet they never offered to stir and all this while their firearrows flew as thick as before  at last on a sudden their arrows stopped and the old dutchman came running down to the waterside all alone with his white flag as before waving it as high as he could and making signals to our boat to come to him again  william did not care at first to go near him but the man continuing to make signals to him to come at last william went and the dutchman told him that he had been with the general who was much mollified by the slaughter of his men and that now he could have anything of him  anything says william what have we to do with him let him go about his business and carry his men out of gunshot cant he  why says the dutchman but he dares not stir nor see the kings face unless some of your men come on shore he will certainly put him to death  why then says william he is a dead man for if it were to save his life and the lives of all the crowd that is with him he shall never have one of us in his power but ill tell thee said william how thou shalt cheat him and gain thy own liberty too if thou hast any mind to see thy own country again and art not turned savage and grown fond of living all thy days among heathens and savages  i would be glad to do it with all my heart says he but if i should offer to swim off to you now though they are so far from me they shoot so true that they would kill me before i got halfway  but says william ill tell thee how thou shalt come with his consent go to him and tell him i have offered to carry you on board to try if you could persuade the captain to come on shore and that i would not hinder him if he was willing to venture  the dutchman seemed in a rapture at the very first word ill do it says he i am persuaded he will give me leave to come  away he runs as if he had a glad message to carry and tells the general that william had promised if he would go on board the ship with him he would persuade the captain to return with him the general was fool enough to give him orders to go and charged him not to come back without the captain which he readily promised and very honestly might  so they took him in and brought him on board and he was as good as his word to them for he never went back to them any more and the sloop being come to the mouth of the inlet where we lay we weighed and set sail but as we went out being pretty near the shore we fired three guns as it were among them but without any shot for it was of no use to us to hurt any more of them after we had fired we gave them a cheer as the seamen call it that is to say we hallooed at them by way of triumph and so carried off their ambassador how it fared with their general we know nothing of that  this passage when i related it to a friend of mine after my return from those rambles agreed so well with his relation of what happened to one mr knox an english captain who some time ago was decoyed on shore by these people that it could not but be very much to my satisfaction to think what mischief we had all escaped and i think it cannot but be very profitable to record the other story which is but short with my own to show whoever reads this what it was i avoided and prevent their falling into the like if they have to do with the perfidious people of ceylon the relation is as follows  the island of ceylon being inhabited for the greatest part by barbarians which will not allow any trade or commerce with any european nation and inaccessible by any travellers it will be convenient to relate the occasion how the author of this story happened to go into this island and what opportunities he had of being fully acquainted with the people their laws and customs that so we may the better depend upon the account and value it as it deserves for the rarity as well as the truth of it and both these the author gives us a brief relation of in this manner his words are as follows  in the year 1657 the anne frigate of london captain robert knox commander on the 21st day of january set sail out of the downs in the service of the honourable east india company of england bound for fort st george upon the coast of coromandel to trade for one year from port to port in india which having performed as he was lading his goods to return for england being in the road of masulipatam on the 19th of november 1659 there happened such a mighty storm that in it several ships were cast away and he was forced to cut his mainmast by the board which so disabled the ship that he could not proceed in his voyage whereupon cottiar in the island of ceylon being a very commodious bay fit for her present distress thomas chambers esq since sir thomas chambers the agent at fort st george ordered that the ship should take in some cloth and india merchants belonging to porto novo who might trade there while she lay to set her mast and repair the other damages sustained by the storm at her first coming thither after the indian merchants were set ashore the captain and his men were very jealous of the people of that place by reason the english never had any commerce or dealing with them but after they had been there twenty days going ashore and returning again at pleasure without any molestation they began to lay aside all suspicious thoughts of the people that dwelt thereabouts who had kindly entertained them for their money  by this time the king of the country had notice of their arrival and not being acquainted with their intents he sent down a dissauva or general with an army to them who immediately sent a messenger to the captain on board to desire him to come ashore to him pretending a letter from the king the captain saluted the message with firing of guns and ordered his son robert knox and mr john loveland merchant of the ship to go ashore and wait on him when they were come before him he demanded who they were and how long they should stay they told him they were englishmen and not to stay above twenty or thirty days and desired permission to trade in his majestys port his answer was that the king was glad to hear the english were come into his country and had commanded him to assist them as they should desire and had sent a letter to be delivered to none but the captain himself they were then twelve miles from the seaside and therefore replied that the captain could not leave his ship to come so far but if he pleased to go down to the seaside the captain would wait on him to receive the letter whereupon the dissauva desired them to stay that day and on the morrow he would go with them which rather than displease him in so small a matter they consented to in the evening the dissauva sent a present to the captain of cattle and fruits c which being carried all night by the messengers was delivered to him in the morning who told him withal that his men were coming down with the dissauva and desired his company on shore against his coming having a letter from the king to deliver into his own hand the captain mistrusting nothing came on shore with his boat and sitting under a tamarind tree waited for the dissauva in the meantime the native soldiers privately surrounded him and the seven men he had with him and seizing them carried them to meet the dissauva bearing the captain on a hammock on their shoulders  the next day the longboats crew not knowing what had happened came on shore to cut down a tree to make cheeks for the mainmast and were made prisoners after the same manner though with more violence because they were more rough with them and made resistance yet they were not brought to the captain and his company but quartered in another house in the same town  the dissauva having thus gotten two boats and eighteen men his next care was to gain the ship and to that end telling the captain that he and his men were only detained because the king intended to send letters and a present to the english nation by him desired he would send some men on board his ship to order her to stay and because the ship was in danger of being fired by the dutch if she stayed long in the bay to bring her up the river the captain did not approve of the advice but did not dare to own his dislike so he sent his son with the order but with a solemn conjuration to return again which he accordingly did bringing a letter from the company in the ship that they would not obey the captain nor any other in this matter but were resolved to stand on their own defence this letter satisfied the dissauva who thereupon gave the captain leave to write for what he would have brought from the ship pretending that he had not the kings order to release them though it would suddenly come  the captain seeing he was held in suspense and the season of the year spending for the ship to proceed on her voyage to some place sent order to mr john burford the chief mate to take charge of the ship and set sail to porto novo from whence they came and there to follow the agents order  and now began that long and sad captivity they all along feared the ship being gone the dissauva was called up to the king and they were kept under guards a while till a special order came from the king to part them and put one in a town for the conveniency of their maintenance which the king ordered to be at the charge of the country on september 16 1660 the captain and his son were placed in a town called bonder coswat in the country of hotcurly  hewarrisse korle distant from the city of kandy northward thirty miles and from the rest of the english a full days journey here they had their provisions brought them twice a day without money as much as they could eat and as good as the country yielded the situation of the place was very pleasant and commodious but that year that part of the land was very sickly by agues and fevers of which many died the captain and his son after some time were visited with the common distemper and the captain being also loaded with grief for his deplorable condition languished more than three months and then died february 9 1661  robert knox his son was now left desolate sick and in captivity having none to comfort him but god who is the father of the fatherless and hears the groans of such as are in captivity being alone to enter upon a long scene of misery and calamity oppressed with weakness of body and grief of soul for the loss of his father and the remediless trouble that he was like to endure and the first instance of it was in the burial of his father for he sent his black boy to the people of the town to desire their assistance because they understood not their language but they sent him only a rope to drag him by the neck into the woods and told him that they would offer him no other help unless he would pay for it this barbarous answer increased his trouble for his fathers death that now he was like to lie unburied and be made a prey to the wild beasts in the woods for the ground was very hard and they had not tools to dig with and so it was impossible for them to bury him and having a small matter of money left him viz a pagoda and a gold ring he hired a man and so buried him in as decent a manner as their condition would permit  his dead father being thus removed out of his sight but his ague continuing he was reduced very low partly by sorrow and partly by his disease all the comfort he had was to go into the wood and fields with a book either the practice of piety or mr rogerss seven treatises which were the only two books he had and meditate and read and sometimes pray in which his anguish made him often invert elijahs petitionthat he might die because his life was a burden to him god though he was pleased to prolong his life yet he found a way to lighten his grief by removing his ague and granting him a desire which above all things was acceptable to him he had read his two books over so often that he had both almost by heart and though they were both pious and good writings yet he longed for the truth from the original fountain and thought it his greatest unhappiness that he had not a bible and did believe that he should never see one again but contrary to his expectation god brought him one after this manner as he was fishing one day with his black boy to catch some fish to relieve his hunger an old man passed by them and asked his boy whether his master could read and when the boy had answered yes he told him that he had gotten a book from the portuguese when they left colombo and if his master pleased he would sell it him the boy told his master who bade him go and see what book it was the boy having served the english some time knew the book and as soon as he got it into his hand came running to him calling out before he came to him it is the bible the words startled him and he flung down his angle to meet him and finding it was true was mightily rejoiced to see it but he was afraid he should not have enough to purchase it though he was resolved to part with all the money he had which was but one pagoda to buy it but his black boy persuading him to slight it and leave it to him to buy it he at length obtained it for a knit cap  this accident he could not but look upon as a great miracle that god should bestow upon him such an extraordinary blessing and bring him a bible in his own native language in such a remote part of the world where his name was not known and where it was never heard of that an englishman had ever been before the enjoyment of this mercy was a great comfort to him in captivity and though he wanted no bodily convenience that the country did afford for the king immediately after his fathers death had sent an express order to the people of the towns that they should be kind to him and give him good victuals and after he had been some time in the country and understood the language he got him good conveniences as a house and gardens and falling to husbandry god so prospered him that he had plenty not only for himself but to lend others which being according to the custom of the country at 50 per cent a year much enriched him he had also goats which served him for mutton and hogs and hens notwithstanding this i say for he lived as fine as any of their noblemen he could not so far forget his native country as to be contented to dwell in a strange land where there was to him a famine of gods word and sacraments the want of which made all other things to be of little value to him therefore as he made it his daily and fervent prayer to god in his good time to restore him to both so at length he with one stephen rutland who had lived with him two years before resolved to make their escape and about the year 1673 meditated all secret ways to compass it they had before taken up a way of peddling about the country and buying tobacco pepper garlic combs and all sorts of iron ware and carried them into those parts of the country where they wanted them and now to promote their design as they went with their commodities from place to place they discoursed with the country people for they could now speak their language well concerning the ways and inhabitants where the isle was thinnest and fullest inhabited where and how the watches lay from one country to another and what commodities were proper for them to carry into all parts pretending that they would furnish themselves with such wares as the respective places wanted none doubted but what they did was upon the account of trade because mr knox was so well seated and could not be supposed to leave such an estate by travelling northward because that part of the land was least inhabited and so furnishing themselves with such wares as were vendible in those parts they set forth and steered their course towards the north part of the islands knowing very little of the ways which were generally intricate and perplexed because they have no public roads but a multitude of little paths from one town to another and those often changing and for white men to inquire about the ways was very dangerous because the people would presently suspect their design  at this time they travelled from conde uda as far as the country of nuwarakalawiya which is the furthermost part of the kings dominions and about three days journey from their dwelling they were very thankful to providence that they had passed all difficulties so far but yet they durst not go any farther because they had no wares left to traffic with and it being the first time they had been absent so long from home they feared the townsmen would come after them to seek for them and so they returned home and went eight or ten times into those parts with their wares till they became well acquainted both with the people and the paths  in these parts mr knox met his black boy whom he had turned away divers years before he had now got a wife and children and was very poor but being acquainted with these quarters he not only took directions of him but agreed with him for a good reward to conduct him and his companions to the dutch he gladly undertook it and a time was appointed between them but mr knox being disabled by a grievous pain which seized him on his right side and held him five days that he could not travel this appointment proved in vain for though he went as soon as he was well his guide was gone into another country about his business and they durst not at that time venture to run away without him  these attempts took up eight or nine years various accidents hindering their designs but most commonly the dry weather because they feared in the woods they should be starved with thirst all the country being in such a condition almost four or five years together for lack of rain  on september 22 1679 they set forth again furnished with knives and small axes for their defence because they could carry them privately and send all sorts of wares to sell as formerly and all necessary provisions the moon being twentyseven days old that they might have light to run away by to try what success god almighty would now give them in seeking their liberty their first stage was to anuradhapoora in the way to which lay a wilderness called parraoth mocolane full of wild elephants tigers and bears and because it is the utmost confines of the kings dominions there is always a watch kept  in the middle of the way they heard that the governors officers of these parts were out to gather up the kings revenues and duties to send them up to the city which put them into no small fear lest finding them they should send them back again whereupon they withdrew to the western parts of ecpoulpot and sat down to knitting till they heard the officers were gone as soon as they were departed they went onwards of their journey having got a good parcel of cottonyarn to knit caps with and having kept their wares as they pretended to exchange for dried flesh which was sold only in those lower parts their way lay necessarily through the governors yard at kalluvilla who dwells there on purpose to examine all that go and come this greatly distressed them because he would easily suspect they were out of their bounds being captives however they went resolutely to his house and meeting him presented him with a small parcel of tobacco and betel and showing him their wares told him they came to get dried flesh to carry back with them the governor did not suspect them but told them he was sorry they came in so dry a time when no deer were to be catched but if some rain fell he would soon supply them this answer pleased them and they seemed contented to stay and accordingly abiding with him two or three days and no rain falling they presented the governor with five or six charges of gunpowder which is a rarity among them and leaving a bundle at his house they desired him to shoot them some deer while they made a step to anuradhapoora here also they were put in a great fright by the coming of certain soldiers from the king to the governor to give him orders to set a secure guard at the watches that no suspicious persons might pass which though it was only intended to prevent the flight of the relations of certain nobles whom the king had clapped up yet they feared they might wonder to see white men here and so send them back again but god so ordered it that they were very kind to them and left them to their business and so they got safe to anuradhapoora their pretence was dried flesh though they knew there was none to be had but their real business was to search the way down to the dutch which they stayed three days to do but finding that in the way to jaffnapatam which is one of the dutch ports there was a watch which could hardly be passed and other inconveniences not surmountable they resolved to go back and take the river malwatta oya which they had before judged would be a probable guide to lead them to the sea and that they might not be pursued left anuradhapoora just at night when the people never travel for fear of wild beasts on sunday october 12 being stored with all things needful for their journey viz ten days provision a basin to boil their provision in two calabashes to fetch water in and two great tallipat leaves for tents with jaggery sweetmeats tobacco betel tinderboxes and a deerskin for shoes to keep their feet from thorns because to them they chiefly trusted being come to the river they struck into the woods and kept by the side of it yet not going on the sand lest their footsteps should be discerned unless forced and then going backwards  being gotten a good way into the wood it began to rain wherefore they erected their tents made a fire and refreshed themselves against the rising of the moon which was then eighteen days old and having tied deerskins about their feet and eased themselves of their wares they proceeded on their journey when they had travelled three or four hours with difficulty because the moon gave but little light among the thick trees they found an elephant in their way before them and because they could not scare him away they were forced to stay till morning and so they kindled a fire and took a pipe of tobacco by the light they could not discern that ever anybody had been there nothing being to be seen but woods and so they were in great hopes that they were past all danger being beyond all inhabitants but they were mistaken for the river winding northward brought them into the midst of a parcel of towns called tissea wava where being in danger of being seen they were under a mighty terror for had the people found them they would have beat them and sent them up to the king and to avoid it they crept into a hollow tree and sat there in mud and wet till it began to grow dark and then betaking themselves to their legs travelled till the darkness of night stopped them they heard voices behind them and feared it was somebody in pursuit of them but at length discerning it was only an hallooing to keep the wild beasts out of the corn they pitched their tents by the river and having boiled rice and roasted meat for their suppers and satisfied their hunger they committed themselves to gods keeping and laid them down to sleep  the next morning to prevent the worst they got up early and hastened on their journey and though they were now got out of all danger of the tame chiangulays they were in great danger of the wild ones of whom those woods were full and though they saw their tents yet they were all gone since the rains had fallen from the river into the woods and so god kept them from that danger for had they met the wild men they had been shot  thus they travelled from morning till night several days through bushes and thorns which made their arms and shoulders which were naked all of a gore blood they often met with bears hogs deer and wild buffaloes but they all ran away as soon as they saw them the river was exceedingly full of alligators in the evening they used to pitch their tents and make great fires both before and behind them to affright the wild beasts and though they heard the voices of all sorts they saw none  on thursday at noon they crossed the river coronda  kannadera oya which parts the country of the malabars from the kings and on friday about nine or ten in the morning came among the inhabitants of whom they were as much afraid as of the chiangulays before for though the wanniounay or prince of this people payeth tribute to the dutch out of fear yet he is better affected to the king of kandy and if he had took them would have sent them up to their old master but not knowing any way to escape they kept on their journey by the riverside by day because the woods were not to be travelled by night for thorns and wild beasts who came down then to the river to drink in all the malabar country they met with only two brahmins who treated them very civilly and for their money one of them conducted them till they came into the territories of the dutch and out of all danger of the king of kandy which did not a little rejoice them but yet they were in no small trouble how to find the way out of the woods till a malabar for the lucre of a knife conducted them to a dutch town where they found guides to conduct them from town to town till they came to the fort called aripo where they arrived saturday october 18 1679 and there thankfully adored gods wonderful providence in thus completing their deliverance from a long captivity of nineteen years and six months  i come now back to my own history which grows near a conclusion as to the travels i took in this part of the world we were now at sea and we stood away to the north for a while to try if we could get a market for our spice for we were very rich in nutmegs but we ill knew what to do with them we durst not go upon the english coast or to speak more properly among the english factories to trade not that we were afraid to fight any two ships they had and besides that we knew that as they had no letters of marque or of reprisals from the government so it was none of their business to act offensively no not though we were pirates indeed if we had made any attempt upon them they might have justified themselves in joining together to resist and assisting one another to defend themselves but to go out of their business to attack a pirate ship of almost fifty guns as we were it was plain that it was none of their business and consequently it was none of our concern so we did not trouble ourselves about it but on the other hand it was none of our business to be seen among them and to have the news of us carried from one factory to another so that whatever design we might be upon at another time we should be sure to be prevented and discovered much less had we any occasion to be seen among any of the dutch factories upon the coast of malabar for being fully laden with the spices which we had in the sense of their trade plundered them of it would have told them what we were and all that we had been doing and they would no doubt have concerned themselves all manner of ways to have fallen upon us  the only way we had for it was to stand away for goa and trade if we could for our spices with the portuguese factory there accordingly we sailed almost thither for we had made land two days before and being in the latitude of goa were standing in fair for margaon on the head of salsat at the going up to goa when i called to the men at the helm to bring the ship to and bid the pilot go away nnw till we came out of sight of the shore when william and i called a council as we used to do upon emergencies what course we should take to trade there and not be discovered and we concluded at length that we would not go thither at all but that william with such trusty fellows only as could be depended upon should go in the sloop to surat which was still farther northward and trade there as merchants with such of the english factory as they could find to be for their turn  to carry this with the more caution and so as not to be suspected we agreed to take out all her guns and put such men into her and no other as would promise us not to desire or offer to go on shore or to enter into any talk or conversation with any that might come on board and to finish the disguise to our mind william documented two of our men one a surgeon as he himself was and the other a readywitted fellow an old sailor that had been a pilot upon the coast of new england and was an excellent mimic these two william dressed up like two quakers and made them talk like such the old pilot he made go captain of the sloop and the surgeon for doctor as he was and himself supercargo in this figure and the sloop all plain no curled work upon her indeed she had not much before and no guns to be seen away he went for surat  i should indeed have observed that we went some days before we parted to a small sandy island close under the shore where there was a good cove of deep water like a road and out of sight of any of the factories which are here very thick upon the coast here we shifted the loading of the sloop and put into her such things only as we had a mind to dispose of there which was indeed little but nutmegs and cloves but chiefly the former and from thence william and his two quakers with about eighteen men in the sloop went away to surat and came to an anchor at a distance from the factory  william used such caution that he found means to go on shore himself and the doctor as he called him in a boat which came on board them to sell fish rowed with only indians of the country which boat he afterwards hired to carry him on board again it was not long that they were on shore but that they found means to get acquaintance with some englishmen who though they lived there and perhaps were the companys servants at first yet appeared then to be traders for themselves in whatever coast business especially came in their way and the doctor was made the first to pick acquaintance so he recommended his friend the supercargo till by degrees the merchants were as fond of the bargain as our men were of the merchants only that the cargo was a little too much for them  however this did not prove a difficulty long with them for the next day they brought two more merchants english also into their bargain and as william could perceive by their discourse they resolved if they bought them to carry them to the gulf of persia upon their own accounts william took the hint and as he told me afterwards concluded we might carry them there as well as they but this was not williams present business he had here no less than threeandthirty ton of nuts and eighteen ton of cloves there was a good quantity of mace among the nutmegs but we did not stand to make much allowance in short they bargained and the merchants who would gladly have bought sloop and all gave william directions and two men for pilots to go to a creek about six leagues from the factory where they brought boats and unloaded the whole cargo and paid william very honestly for it the whole parcel amounting in money to about thirtyfive thousand pieces of eight besides some goods of value which william was content to take and two large diamonds worth about three hundred pounds sterling  when they paid the money william invited them on board the sloop where they came and the merry old quaker diverted them exceedingly with his talk and theed them and thoud them till he made them so drunk that they could not go on shore for that night  they would fain have known who our people were and whence they came but not a man in the sloop would answer them to any question they asked but in such a manner as let them think themselves bantered and jested with however in discourse william said they were able men for any cargo we could have brought them and that they would have bought twice as much spice if we had had it he ordered the merry captain to tell them that they had another sloop that lay at margaon and that had a great quantity of spice on board also and that if it was not sold when he went back for that thither he was bound he would bring her up  their new chaps were so eager that they would have bargained with the old captain beforehand nay friend said he i will not trade with thee unsight and unseen neither do i know whether the master of the sloop may not have sold his loading already to some merchants of salsat but if he has not when i come to him i think to bring him up to thee  the doctor had his employment all this while as well as william and the old captain for he went on shore several times a day in the indian boat and brought fresh provisions for the sloop which the men had need enough of he brought in particular seventeen large casks of arrack as big as butts besides smaller quantities a quantity of rice and abundance of fruits mangoes pompions and such things with fowls and fish he never came on board but he was deep laden for in short he bought for the ship as well as for themselves and particularly they halfloaded the ship with rice and arrack with some hogs and six or seven cows alive and thus being well victualled and having directions for coming again they returned to us  william was always the lucky welcome messenger to us but never more welcome to us than now for where we had thrust in the ship we could get nothing except a few mangoes and roots being not willing to make any steps into the country or make ourselves known till we had news of our sloop and indeed our mens patience was almost tired for it was seventeen days that william spent upon this enterprise and well bestowed too  when he came back we had another conference upon the subject of trade namely whether we should send the best of our spices and other goods we had in the ship to surat or whether we should go up to the gulf of persia ourselves where it was probable we might sell them as well as the english merchants of surat william was for going ourselves which by the way was from the good frugal merchantlike temper of the man who was for the best of everything but here i overruled william which i very seldom took upon me to do but i told him that considering our circumstances it was much better for us to sell all our cargoes here though we made but halfprice of them than to go with them to the gulf of persia where we should run a greater risk and where people would be much more curious and inquisitive into things than they were here and where it would not be so easy to manage them seeing they traded freely and openly there not by stealth as those men seemed to do and besides if they suspected anything it would be much more difficult for us to retreat except by mere force than here where we were upon the high sea as it were and could be gone whenever we pleased without any disguise or indeed without the least appearance of being pursued none knowing where to look for us  my apprehensions prevailed with william whether my reasons did or no and he submitted and we resolved to try another ships loading to the same merchants the main business was to consider how to get off that circumstance that had exposed them to the english merchants namely that it was our other sloop but this the old quaker pilot undertook for being as i said an excellent mimic himself it was the easier for him to dress up the sloop in new clothes and first he put on all the carved work he had taken off before her stern which was painted of a dumb white or dun colour before all flat was now all lacquered and blue and i know not how many gay figures in it as to her quarter the carpenters made her a neat little gallery on either side she had twelve guns put into her and some petereroes upon her gunnel none of which were there before and to finish her new habit or appearance and make her change complete he ordered her sails to be altered and as she sailed before with a halfsprit like a yacht she sailed now with squaresail and mizzenmast like a ketch so that in a word she was a perfect cheat disguised in everything that a stranger could be supposed to take any notice of that had never had but one view for they had been but once on board  in this mean figure the sloop returned she had a new man put into her for captain one we knew how to trust and the old pilot appearing only as a passenger the doctor and william acting as the supercargoes by a formal procuration from one captain singleton and all things ordered in form  we had a complete loading for the sloop for besides a very great quantity of nutmegs and cloves mace and some cinnamon she had on board some goods which we took in as we lay about the philippine islands while we waited as looking for purchase  william made no difficulty of selling this cargo also and in about twenty days returned again freighted with all necessary provisions for our voyage and for a long time and as i say we had a great deal of other goods he brought us back about threeandthirty thousand pieces of eight and some diamonds which though william did not pretend to much skill in yet he made shift to act so as not to be imposed upon the merchants he had to deal with too being very fair men  they had no difficulty at all with these merchants for the prospect they had of gain made them not at all inquisitive nor did they make the least discovery of the sloop and as to the selling them spices which were fetched so far from thence it seems it was not so much a novelty there as we believed for the portuguese had frequently vessels which came from macao in china who brought spices which they bought of the chinese traders who again frequently dealt among the dutch spice islands and received spices in exchange for such goods as they carried from china  this might be called indeed the only trading voyage we had made and now we were really very rich and it came now naturally before us to consider whither we should go next our proper delivery port as we ought to have called it was at madagascar in the bay of mangahelly but william took me by myself into the cabin of the sloop one day and told me he wanted to talk seriously with me a little so we shut ourselves in and william began with me  wilt thou give me leave says william to talk plainly with thee upon thy present circumstances and thy future prospect of living and wilt thou promise on thy word to take nothing ill of me  with all my heart said i william i have always found your advice good and your designs have not only been well laid but your counsel has been very lucky to us and therefore say what you will i promise you i will not take it ill  but that is not all my demand says william if thou dost not like what i am going to propose to thee thou shalt promise me not to make it public among the men  i will not william says i upon my word and swore to him too very heartily  why then says william i have but one thing more to article with thee about and that is that thou wilt consent that if thou dost not approve of it for thyself thou wilt yet consent that i shall put so much of it in practice as relates to myself and my new comrade doctor so that it be nothing to thy detriment and loss  in anything says i william but leaving me i will but i cannot part with you upon any terms whatever  well says william i am not designing to part from thee unless it is thy own doing but assure me in all these points and i will tell my mind freely  so i promised him everything he desired of me in the solemnest manner possible and so seriously and frankly withal that william made no scruple to open his mind to me  why then in the first place says william shall i ask thee if thou dost not think thou and all thy men are rich enough and have really gotten as much wealth together by whatsoever way it has been gotten that is not the question as we all know what to do with  why truly william said i thou art pretty right i think we have had pretty good luck  well then says william i would ask whether if thou hast gotten enough thou hast any thought of leaving off this trade for most people leave off trading when they are satisfied of getting and are rich enough for nobody trades for the sake of trading much less do men rob for the sake of thieving  well william says i now i perceive what it is thou art driving at i warrant you says i you begin to hanker after home  why truly says william thou hast said it and so i hope thou dost too it is natural for most men that are abroad to desire to come home again at last especially when they are grown rich and when they are as thou ownest thyself to be rich enough and so rich as they know not what to do with more if they had it  well william said i but now you think you have laid your preliminary at first so home that i should have nothing to say that is that when i had got money enough it would be natural to think of going home but you have not explained what you mean by home and there you and i shall differ why man i am at home here is my habitation i never had any other in my lifetime i was a kind of charity school boy so that i can have no desire of going anywhere for being rich or poor for i have nowhere to go  why says william looking a little confused art not thou an englishman  yes says i i think so you see i speak english but i came out of england a child and never was in it but once since i was a man and then i was cheated and imposed upon and used so ill that i care not if i never see it more  why hast thou no relations or friends there says he no acquaintance none that thou hast any kindness or any remains of respect for  not i william said i no more than i have in the court of the geat mogul  nor any kindness for the country where thou wast born says william  not i any more than for the island of madagascar nor so much neither for that has been a fortunate island to me more than once as thou knowest william said i  william was quite stunned at my discourse and held his peace and i said to him go on william what hast thou to say farther for i hear you have some project in your head says i come lets have it out  nay says william thou hast put me to silence and all i had to say is overthrown all my projects are come to nothing and gone  well but william said i let me hear what they were for though it is so that what i have to aim at does not look your way and though i have no relation no friend no acquaintance in england yet i do not say i like this roving cruising life so well as never to give it over let me hear if thou canst propose to me anything beyond it  certainly friend says william very gravely there is something beyond it and lifting up his hands he seemed very much affected and i thought i saw tears stand in his eyes but i that was too hardened a wretch to be moved with these things laughed at him what says i you mean death i warrant you dont you that is beyond this trade why when it comes it comes then we are all provided for  ay says william that is true but it would be better that some things were thought on before that came  thought on says i what signifies thinking of it to think of death is to die and to be always thinking of it is to be all ones life long adying it is time enough to think of it when it comes  you will easily believe i was well qualified for a pirate that could talk thus but let me leave it upon record for the remark of other hardened rogues like myselfmy conscience gave me a pang that i never felt before when i said what signifies thinking of it and told me i should one day think of these words with a sad heart but the time of my reflection was not yet come so i went on  says william very seriously i must tell thee friend i am sorry to hear thee talk so they that never think of dying often die without thinking of it  i carried on the jesting way a while farther and said prithee do not talk of dying how do we know we shall ever die and began to laugh  i need not answer thee to that says william it is not my place to reprove thee who art commander over me here but i would rather thou wouldst talk otherwise of death it is a coarse thing  say anything to me william said i i will take it kindly i began now to be very much moved at his discourse  says william tears running down his face it is because men live as if they were never to die that so many die before they know how to live but it was not death that i meant when i said that there was something to be thought of beyond this way of living  why william said i what was that  it was repentance says he  why says i did you ever know a pirate repent  at this he startled a little and returned at the gallows i have known one before and i hope thou wilt be the second  he spoke this very affectionately with an appearance of concern for me  well william says i i thank you and i am not so senseless of these things perhaps as i make myself seem to be but come let me hear your proposal  my proposal says william is for thy good as well as my own we may put an end to this kind of life and repent and i think the fairest occasion offers for both at this very time that ever did or ever will or indeed can happen again  look you william says i let me have your proposal for putting an end to our present way of living first for that is the case before us and you and i will talk of the other afterwards i am not so insensible said i as you may think me to be but let us get out of this hellish condition we are in first  nay says william thou art in the right there we must never talk of repenting while we continue pirates  well says i william thats what i meant for if we must not reform as well as be sorry for what is done i have no notion what repentance means indeed at best i know little of the matter but the nature of the thing seems to tell me that the first step we have to take is to break off this wretched course and ill begin there with you with all my heart  i could see by his countenance that william was thoroughly pleased with the offer and if he had tears inhis eyes before he had more now but it was from quite a different passion for he was so swallowed up with joy he could not speak  come william says i thou showest me plain enough thou hast an honest meaning dost thou think it practicable for us to put an end to our unhappy way of living here and get off  yes says he i think it very practicable for me whether it is for thee or no that will depend upon thyself  well says i i give you my word that as i have commanded you all along from the time i first took you on board so you shall command me from this hour and everything you direct me ill do  wilt thou leave it all to me dost thou say this freely  yes william said i freely and ill perform it faithfully  why then says william my scheme is this we are now at the mouth of the gulf of persia we have sold so much of our cargo here at surat that we have money enough send me away for bassorah with the sloop laden with the china goods we have on board which will make another good cargo and ill warrant thee ill find means among the english and dutch merchants there to lodge a quantity of goods and money also as a merchant so as we will be able to have recourse to it again upon any occasion and when i come home we will contrive the rest and in the meantime do you bring the ships crew to take a resolution to go to madagascar as soon as i return  i told him i thought he need not go so far as bassorah but might run into gombroon or to ormuz and pretend the same business  no says he i cannot act with the same freedom there because the companys factories are there and i may be laid hold of there on pretence of interloping  well but said i you may go to ormuz then for i am loth to part with you so long as to go to the bottom of the persian gulf he returned that i should leave it to him to do as he should see cause  we had taken a large sum of money at surat so that we had near a hundred thousand pounds in money at our command but on board the great ship we had still a great deal more  i ordered him publicly to keep the money on board which he had and to buy up with it a quantity of ammunition if he could get it and so to furnish us for new exploits and in the meantime i resolved to get a quantity of gold and some jewels which i had on board the great ship and place them so that i might carry them off without notice as soon as he came back and so according to williams directions i left him to go the voyage and i went on board the great ship in which we had indeed an immense treasure  we waited no less than two months for williams return and indeed i began to be very uneasy about william sometimes thinking he had abandoned me and that he might have used the same artifice to have engaged the other men to comply with him and so they were gone away together and it was but three days before his return that i was just upon the point of resolving to go away to madagascar and give him over but the old surgeon who mimicked the quaker and passed for the master of the sloop at surat persuaded me against that for which good advice and apparent faithfulness in what he had been trusted with i made him a party to my design and he proved very honest  at length william came back to our inexpressible joy and brought a great many necessary things with him as particularly he brought sixty barrels of powder some iron shot and about thirty ton of lead also he brought a great deal of provisions and in a word william gave me a public account of his voyage in the hearing of whoever happened to be upon the quarterdeck that no suspicions might be found about us  after all was done william moved that he might go up again and that i would go with him named several things which we had on board that he could not sell there and particularly told us he had been obliged to leave several things there the caravans being not come in and that he had engaged to come back again with goods  this was what i wanted the men were eager for his going and particularly because he told them they might load the sloop back with rice and provisions but i seemed backward to going when the old surgeon stood up and persuaded me to go and with many arguments pressed me to it as particularly if i did not go there would be no order and several of the men might drop away and perhaps betray all the rest and that they should not think it safe for the sloop to go again if i did not go and to urge me to it he offered himself to go with me  upon these considerations i seemed to be overpersuaded to go and all the company seemed to be better satisfied when i had consented and accordingly we took all the powder lead and iron out of the sloop into the great ship and all the other things that were for the ships use and put in some bales of spices and casks or frails of cloves in all about seven ton and some other goods among the bales of which i had conveyed all my private treasure which i assure you was of no small value and away i went  at going off i called a council of all the officers in the ship to consider in what place they should wait for me and how long and we appointed the ship to stay eightandtwenty days at a little island on the arabian side of the gulf and that if the sloop did not come in that time they should sail to another island to the west of that place and wait there fifteen days more and that then if the sloop did not come they should conclude some accident must have happened and the rendezvous should be at madagascar  being thus resolved we left the ship which both william and i and the surgeon never intended to see any more we steered directly for the gulf and through to bassorah or balsara this city of balsara lies at some distance from the place where our sloop lay and the river not being very safe and we but ill acquainted with it having but an ordinary pilot we went on shore at a village where some merchants live and which is very populous for the sake of small vessels riding there  here we stayed and traded three or four days landing all our bales and spices and indeed the whole cargo that was of any considerable value which we chose to do rather than go up immediately to balsara till the project we had laid was put in execution  after we had bought several goods and were preparing to buy several others the boat being on shore with twelve men myself william the surgeon and one fourth man whom we had singled out we contrived to send a turk just at the dusk of the evening with a letter to the boatswain and giving the fellow a charge to run with all possible speed we stood at a small distance to observe the event the contents of the letter were thus written by the old doctor  boatswain thomaswe are all betrayed for gods sake make off with the boat and get on board or you are all lost the captain william the quaker and george the reformade are seized and carried away i am escaped and hid but cannot stir out if i do i am a dead man as soon as you are on board cut or slip and make sail for your lives adieurs  we stood undiscovered as above it being the dusk of the evening and saw the turk deliver the letter and in three minutes we saw all the men hurry into the boat and put off and no sooner were they on board than they took the hint as we supposed for the next morning they were out of sight and we never heard tale or tidings of them since  we were now in a good place and in very good circumstances for we passed for merchants of persia  it is not material to record here what a mass of illgotten wealth we had got together it will be more to the purpose to tell you that i began to be sensible of the crime of getting of it in such a manner as i had done that i had very little satisfaction in the possession of it and as i told william i had no expectation of keeping it nor much desire but as i said to him one day walking out into the fields near the town of bassorah so i depended upon it that it would be the case which you will hear presently  we were perfectly secured at bassorah by having frighted away the rogues our comrades and we had nothing to do but to consider how to convert our treasure into things proper to make us look like merchants as we were now to be and not like freebooters as we really had been  we happened very opportunely here upon a dutchman who had travelled from bengal to agra the capital city of the great mogul and from thence was come to the coast of malabar by land and got shipping somehow or other up the gulf and we found his design was to go up the great river to bagdad or babylon and so by the caravan to aleppo and scanderoon as william spoke dutch and was of an agreeable insinuating behaviour he soon got acquainted with this dutchman and discovering our circumstances to one another we found he had considerable effects with him and that he had traded long in that country and was making homeward to his own country and that he had servants with him one an armenian whom he had taught to speak dutch and who had something of his own but had a mind to travel into europe and the other a dutch sailor whom he had picked up by his fancy and reposed a great trust in him and a very honest fellow he was  this dutchman was very glad of an acquaintance because he soon found that we directed our thoughts to europe also and as he found we were encumbered with goods only for we let him know nothing of our money he readily offered us his assistance to dispose of as many of them as the place we were in would put off and his advice what to do with the rest  while this was doing william and i consulted what to do with ourselves and what we had and first we resolved we would never talk seriously of our measures but in the open fields where we were sure nobody could hear so every evening when the sun began to decline and the air to be moderate we walked out sometimes this way sometimes that to consult of our affairs  i should have observed that we had new clothed ourselves here after the persian manner with long vests of silk a gown or robe of english crimson cloth very fine and handsome and had let our beards grow so after the persian manner that we passed for persian merchants in view only though by the way we could not understand or speak one word of the language of persia or indeed of any other but english and dutch and of the latter i understood very little  however the dutchman supplied all this for us and as we had resolved to keep ourselves as retired as we could though there were several english merchants upon the place yet we never acquainted ourselves with one of them or exchanged a word with them by which means we prevented their inquiry of us now or their giving any intelligence of us if any news of our landing here should happen to come which it was easy for us to know was possible enough if any of our comrades fell into bad hands or by many accidents which we could not foresee  it was during my being here for here we stayed near two months that i grew very thoughtful about my circumstances not as to the danger neither indeed were we in any but were entirely concealed and unsuspected but i really began to have other thoughts of myself and of the world than ever i had before  william had struck so deep into my unthinking temper with hinting to me that there was something beyond all this that the present time was the time of enjoyment but that the time of account approached that the work that remained was gentler than the labour past viz repentance and that it was high time to think of iti say these and such thoughts as these engrossed my hours and in a word i grew very sad  as to the wealth i had which was immensely great it was all like dirt under my feet i had no value for it no peace in the possession of it no great concern about me for the leaving of it  william had perceived my thoughts to be troubled and my mind heavy and oppressed for some time and one evening in one of our cool walks i began with him about the leaving our effects william was a wise and wary man and indeed all the prudentials of my conduct had for a long time been owing to his advice and so now all the methods for preserving our effects and even ourselves lay upon him and he had been telling me of some of the measures he had been taking for our making homeward and for the security of our wealth when i took him very short why william says i dost thou think we shall ever be able to reach europe with all this cargo that we have about us  ay says william without doubt as well as other merchants with theirs as long as it is not publicly known what quantity or of what value our cargo consists  why william says i smiling do you think that if there is a god above as you have so long been telling me there is and that we must give an account to himi say do you think if he be a righteous judge he will let us escape thus with the plunder as we may call it of so many innocent people nay i might say nations and not call us to an account for it before we can get to europe where we pretend to enjoy it  william appeared struck and surprised at the question and made no answer for a great while and i repeated the question adding that it was not to be expected  after a little pause says william thou hast started a very weighty question and i can make no positive answer to it but i will state it thus first it is true that if we consider the justice of god we have no reason to expect any protection but as the ordinary ways of providence are out of the common road of human affairs so we may hope for mercy still upon our repentance and we know not how good he may be to us so we are to act as if we rather depended upon the last i mean the merciful part than claimed the first which must produce nothing but judgment and vengeance  but hark ye william says i the nature of repentance as you have hinted once to me included reformation and we can never reform how then can we repent  why can we never reform says william  because said i we cannot restore what we have taken away by rapine and spoil  it is true says william we never can do that for we can never come to the knowledge of the owners  but what then must be done with our wealth said i the effects of plunder and rapine if we keep it we continue to be robbers and thieves and if we quit it we cannot do justice with it for we cannot restore it to the right owners  nay says william the answer to it is short to quit what we have and do it here is to throw it away to those who have no claim to it and to divest ourselves of it but to do no right with it whereas we ought to keep it carefully together with a resolution to do what right with it we are able and who knows what opportunity providence may put into our hands to do justice at least to some of those we have injured so we ought at least to leave it to him and go on as it is without doubt our present business is to go to some place of safety where we may wait his will  this resolution of william was very satisfying to me indeed as the truth is all he said and at all times was solid and good and had not william thus as it were quieted my mind i think verily i was so alarmed at the just reason i had to expect vengeance from heaven upon me for my illgotten wealth that i should have run away from it as the devils goods that i had nothing to do with that did not belong to me and that i had no right to keep and was in certain danger of being destroyed for  however william settled my mind to more prudent steps than these and i concluded that i ought however to proceed to a place of safety and leave the event to god almightys mercy but this i must leave upon record that i had from this time no joy of the wealth i had got i looked upon it all as stolen and so indeed the greatest part of it was i looked upon it as a hoard of other mens goods which i had robbed the innocent owners of and which i ought in a word to be hanged for here and damned for hereafter and now indeed i began sincerely to hate myself for a dog a wretch that had been a thief and a murderer a wretch that was in a condition which nobody was ever in for i had robbed and though i had the wealth by me yet it was impossible i should ever make any restitution and upon this account it ran in my head that i could never repent for that repentance could not be sincere without restitution and therefore must of necessity be damned there was no room for me to escape i went about with my heart full of these thoughts little better than a distracted fellow in short running headlong into the dreadfullest despair and premeditating nothing but how to rid myself out of the world and indeed the devil if such things are of the devils immediate doing followed his work very close with me and nothing lay upon my mind for several days but to shoot myself into the head with my pistol  i was all this while in a vagrant life among infidels turks pagans and such sort of people i had no minister no christian to converse with but poor william he was my ghostly father or confessor and he was all the comfort i had as for my knowledge of religion you have heard my history you may suppose i had not much and as for the word of god i do not remember that i ever read a chapter in the bible in my lifetime i was little bob at bussleton and went to school to learn my testament  however it pleased god to make william the quaker everything to me upon this occasion i took him out one evening as usual and hurried him away into the fields with me in more haste than ordinary and there in short i told him the perplexity of my mind and under what terrible temptations of the devil i had been that i must shoot myself for i could not support the weight and terror that was upon me  shoot yourself says william why what will that do for you  why says i it will put an end to a miserable life  well says william are you satisfied the next will be better  no no says i much worse to be sure  why then says he shooting yourself is the devils motion no doubt for it is the devil of a reason that because thou art in an ill case therefore thou must put thyself into a worse  this shocked my reason indeed well but says i there is no bearing the miserable condition i am in  very well says william but it seems there is some bearing a worse condition and so you will shoot yourself that you may be past remedy  i am past remedy already says i  how do you know that says he  i am satisfied of it said i  well says he but you are not sure so you will shoot yourself to make it certain for though on this side death you cannot be sure you will be damned at all yet the moment you step on the other side of time you are sure of it for when it is done it is not to be said then that you will be but that you are damned  well but says william as if he had been between jest and earnest pray what didst thou dream of last night  why said i i had frightful dreams all night and particularly i dreamed that the devil came for me and asked me what my name was and i told him then he asked me what trade i was trade says i i am a thief a rogue by my calling i am a pirate and a murderer and ought to be hanged ay ay says the devil so you do and you are the man i looked for and therefore come along with me at which i was most horribly frighted and cried out so that it waked me and i have been in horrible agony ever since  very well says william come give me the pistol thou talkedst of just now  why says i what will you do with it  do with it says william why thou needest not shoot thyself i shall be obliged to do it for thee why thou wilt destroy us all  what do you mean william said i  mean said he nay what didst thou mean to cry out aloud in thy sleep i am a thief a pirate a murderer and ought to be hanged why thou wilt ruin us all twas well the dutchman did not understand english in short i must shoot thee to save my own life come come says he give me thy pistol  i confess this terrified me again another way and i began to be sensible that if anybody had been near me to understand english i had been undone the thought of shooting myself forsook me from that time and i turned to william you disorder me extremely william said i why i am never safe nor is it safe to keep me company what shall i do i shall betray you all  come come friend bob says he ill put an end to it all if you will take my advice  hows that said i  why only says he that the next time thou talkest with the devil thou wilt talk a little softlier or we shall be all undone and you too  this frighted me i must confess and allayed a great deal of the trouble of mind i was in but william after he had done jesting with me entered upon a very long and serious discourse with me about the nature of my circumstances and about repentance that it ought to be attended indeed with a deep abhorrence of the crime that i had to charge myself with but that to despair of gods mercy was no part of repentance but putting myself into the condition of the devil indeed that i must apply myself with a sincere humble confession of my crime to ask pardon of god whom i had offended and cast myself upon his mercy resolving to be willing to make restitution if ever it should please god to put it in my power even to the utmost of what i had in the world and this he told me was the method which he had resolved upon himself and in this he told me he had found comfort  i had a great deal of satisfaction in williams discourse and it quieted me very much but william was very anxious ever after about my talking in my sleep and took care to lie with me always himself and to keep me from lodging in any house where so much as a word of english was understood  however there was not the like occasion afterward for i was much more composed in my mind and resolved for the future to live a quite different life from what i had done as to the wealth i had i looked upon it as nothing i resolved to set it apart to any such opportunity of doing justice as god should put into my hand and the miraculous opportunity i had afterwards of applying some parts of it to preserve a ruined family whom i had plundered may be worth reading if i have room for it in this account  with these resolutions i began to be restored to some degree of quiet in my mind and having after almost three months stay at bassorah disposed of some goods but having a great quantity left we hired boats according to the dutchmans direction and went up to bagdad or babylon on the river tigris or rather euphrates we had a very considerable cargo of goods with us and therefore made a great figure there and were received with respect we had in particular twoandforty bales of indian stuffs of sundry sorts silks muslins and fine chintz we had fifteen bales of very fine china silks and seventy packs or bales of spices particularly cloves and nutmegs with other goods we were bid money here for our cloves but the dutchman advised us not to part with them and told us we should get a better price at aleppo or in the levant so we prepared for the caravan  we concealed our having any gold or pearls as much as we could and therefore sold three or four bales of china silks and indian calicoes to raise money to buy camels and to pay the customs which are taken at several places and for our provisions over the deserts  i travelled this journey careless to the last degree of my goods or wealth believing that as i came by it all by rapine and violence god would direct that it should be taken from me again in the same manner and indeed i think i might say i was very willing it should be so but as i had a merciful protector above me so i had a most faithful steward counsellor partner or whatever i might call him who was my guide my pilot my governor my everything and took care both of me and of all we had and though he had never been in any of these parts of the world yet he took the care of all upon him and in about nineandfifty days we arrived from bassorah at the mouth of the river tigris or euphrates through the desert and through aleppo to alexandria or as we call it scanderoon in the levant  here william and i and the other two our faithful comrades debated what we should do and here william and i resolved to separate from the other two they resolving to go with the dutchman into holland by the means of some dutch ship which lay then in the road william and i told them we resolved to go and settle in the morea which then belonged to the venetians  it is true we acted wisely in it not to let them know whither we went seeing we had resolved to separate but we took our old doctors directions how to write to him in holland and in england that we might have intelligence from him on occasion and promised to give him an account how to write to us which we afterwards did as may in time be made out  we stayed here some time after they were gone till at length not being thoroughly resolved whither to go till then a venetian ship touched at cyprus and put in at scanderoon to look for freight home we took the hint and bargaining for our passage and the freight of our goods we embarked for venice where in twoandtwenty days we arrived safe with all our treasure and with such a cargo take our goods and our money and our jewels together as i believed was never brought into the city by two single men since the state of venice had a being  we kept ourselves here incognito for a great while passing for two armenian merchants still as we had done before and by this time we had gotten so much of the persian and armenian jargon which they talked at bassorah and bagdad and everywhere that we came in the country as was sufficient to make us able to talk to one another so as not to be understood by anybody though sometimes hardly by ourselves  here we converted all our effects into money settled our abode as for a considerable time and william and i maintaining an inviolable friendship and fidelity to one another lived like two brothers we neither had or sought any separate interest we conversed seriously and gravely and upon the subject of our repentance continually we never changed that is to say so as to leave off our armenian garbs and we were called at venice the two grecians  i had been two or three times going to give a detail of our wealth but it will appear incredible and we had the greatest difficulty in the world how to conceal it being justly apprehensive lest we might be assassinated in that country for our treasure at length william told me he began to think now that he must never see england any more and that indeed he did not much concern himself about it but seeing we had gained so great wealth and he had some poor relations in england if i was willing he would write to know if they were living and to know what condition they were in and if he found such of them were alive as he had some thoughts about he would with my consent send them something to better their condition  i consented most willingly and accordingly william wrote to a sister and an uncle and in about five weeks time received an answer from them both directed to himself under cover of a hard armenian name that he had given himself viz signore constantine alexion of ispahan at venice  it was a very moving letter he received from his sister who after the most passionate expressions of joy to hear he was alive seeing she had long ago had an account that he was murdered by the pirates in the west indies entreats him to let her know what circumstances he was in tells him she was not in any capacity to do anything considerable for him but that he should be welcome to her with all her heart that she was left a widow with four children but kept a little shop in the minories by which she made shift to maintain her family and that she had sent him five pounds lest he should want money in a strange country to bring him home  i could see the letter brought tears out of his eyes as he read it and indeed when he showed it to me and the little bill for five pounds upon an english merchant in venice it brought tears out of my eyes too  after we had been both affected sufficiently with the tenderness and kindness of this letter he turns to me says he what shall i do for this poor woman i mused a while at last says i i will tell you what you shall do for her she has sent you five pounds and she has four children and herself that is five such a sum from a poor woman in her circumstances is as much as five thousand pounds is to us you shall send her a bill of exchange for five thousand pounds english money and bid her conceal her surprise at it till she hears from you again but bid her leave off her shop and go and take a house somewhere in the country not far off from london and stay there in a moderate figure till she hears from you again  now says william i perceive by it that you have some thoughts of venturing into england  indeed william said i you mistake me but it presently occurred to me that you should venture for what have you done that you may not be seen there why should i desire to keep you from your relations purely to keep me company  william looked very affectionately upon me nay says he we have embarked together so long and come together so far i am resolved i will never part with thee as long as i live go where thou wilt or stay where thou wilt and as for my sister said william i cannot send her such a sum of money for whose is all this money we have it is most of it thine  no william said i there is not a penny of it mine but what is yours too and i wont have anything but an equal share with you and therefore you shall send it to her if not i will send it  why says william it will make the poor woman distracted she will be so surprised she will go out of her wits  well said i william you may do it prudently send her a bill backed of a hundred pounds and bid her expect more in a post or two and that you will send her enough to live on without keeping shop and then send her more  accordingly william sent her a very kind letter with a bill upon a merchant in london for a hundred and sixty pounds and bid her comfort herself with the hope that he should be able in a little time to send her more about ten days after he sent her another bill of five hundred and forty pounds and a post or two after another for three hundred pounds making in all a thousand pounds and told her he would send her sufficient to leave off her shop and directed her to take a house as above  he waited then till he received an answer to all the three letters with an account that she had received the money and which i did not expect that she had not let any other acquaintance know that she had received a shilling from anybody or so much as that he was alive and would not till she had heard again  when he showed me this letter well william said i this woman is fit to be trusted with life or anything send her the rest of the five thousand pounds and ill venture to england with you to this womans house whenever you will  in a word we sent her five thousand pounds in good bills and she received them very punctually and in a little time sent her brother word that she had pretended to her uncle that she was sickly and could not carry on the trade any longer and that she had taken a large house about four miles from london under pretence of letting lodgings for her livelihood and in short intimated as if she understood that he intended to come over to be incognito assuring him he should be as retired as he pleased  this was opening the very door for us that we thought had been effectually shut for this life and in a word we resolved to venture but to keep ourselves entirely concealed both as to name and every other circumstance and accordingly william sent his sister word how kindly he took her prudent steps and that she had guessed right that he desired to be retired and that he obliged her not to increase her figure but live private till she might perhaps see him  he was going to send the letter away come william said i you shant send her an empty letter tell her you have a friend coming with you that must be as retired as yourself and ill send her five thousand pounds more  so in short we made this poor womans family rich and yet when it came to the point my heart failed me and i durst not venture and for william he would not stir without me and so we stayed about two years after this considering what we should do  you may think perhaps that i was very prodigal of my illgotten goods thus to load a stranger with my bounty and give a gift like a prince to one that had been able to merit nothing of me or indeed know me but my condition ought to be considered in this case though i had money to profusion yet i was perfectly destitute of a friend in the world to have the least obligation or assistance from or knew not either where to dispose or trust anything i had while i lived or whom to give it to if i died  when i had reflected upon the manner of my getting of it i was sometimes for giving it all to charitable uses as a debt due to mankind though i was no roman catholic and not at all of the opinion that it would purchase me any repose to my soul but i thought as it was got by a general plunder and which i could make no satisfaction for it was due to the community and i ought to distribute it for the general good but still i was at a loss how and where and by whom to settle this charity not daring to go home to my own country lest some of my comrades strolled home should see and detect me and for the very spoil of my money or the purchase of his own pardon betray and expose me to an untimely end  being thus destitute i say of a friend i pitched thus upon williams sister the kind step of hers to her brother whom she thought to be in distress signifying a generous mind and a charitable disposition and having resolved to make her the object of my first bounty i did not doubt but i should purchase something of a refuge for myself and a kind of a centre to which i should tend in my future actions for really a man that has a subsistence and no residence no place that has a magnetic influence upon his affections is in one of the most odd uneasy conditions in the world nor is it in the power of all his money to make it up to him  it was as i told you two years and upwards that we remained at venice and thereabout in the greatest hesitation imaginable irresolute and unfixed to the last degree williams sister importuned us daily to come to england and wondered we should not dare to trust her whom we had to such a degree obliged to be faithful and in a manner lamented her being suspected by us  at last i began to incline and i said to william come brother william said i for ever since our discourse at bassorah i called him brother if you will agree to two or three things with me ill go home to england with all my heart  says william let me know what they are  why first says i you shall not disclose yourself to any of your relations in england but your sisterno not one secondly we will not shave off our mustachios or beards for we had all along worn our beards after the grecian manner nor leave off our long vests that we may pass for grecians and foreigners thirdly that we shall never speak english in public before anybody your sister excepted fourthly that we will always live together and pass for brothers  william said he would agree to them all with all his heart but that the not speaking english would be the hardest but he would do his best for that too so in a word we agreed to go from venice to naples where we converted a large sum of money into bales of silk left a large sum in a merchants hands at venice and another considerable sum at naples and took bills of exchange for a great deal too and yet we came with such a cargo to london as few american merchants had done for some years for we loaded in two ships seventythree bales of thrown silk besides thirteen bales of wrought silks from the duchy of milan shipped at genoa with all which i arrived safely and some time after i married my faithful protectress williams sister with whom i am much more happy than i deserve  and now having so plainly told you that i am come to england after i have so boldly owned what life i have led abroad it is time to leave off and say no more for the present lest some should be willing to inquire too nicely after your old friend captain bob
