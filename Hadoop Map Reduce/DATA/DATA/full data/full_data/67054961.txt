67054961	italian hours  by  henry james   published november 1909      preface  the chapters of which this volume is composed have with few exceptions already been collected and were then associated with others commemorative of other impressions of no very extensive excursions and wanderings the notes on various visits to italy are here for the first time exclusively placed together and as they largely refer to quite other days than thesethe date affixed to each paper sufficiently indicating thisi have introduced a few passages that speak for a later and in some cases a frequently repeated vision of the places and scenes in question i have not hesitated to amend my text expressively wherever it seemed urgently to ask for this though i have not pretended to add the element of information or the weight of curious and critical insistence to a brief record of light inquiries and conclusions the fond appeal of the observer concerned is all to aspects and appearancesabove all to the interesting face of things as it mainly used to be  h j      contents  venice the grand canal venice an early impression two old houses and three young women casa al visi from chambÉry to milan the

ravenna pineta terracina      venice   it is a great pleasure to write the word but i am not sure there is not a certain impudence in pretending to add anything to it venice has been painted and described many thousands of times and of all the cities of the world is the easiest to visit without going there open the first book and you will find a rhapsody about it step into the first picturedealers and you will find three or four highcoloured views of it there is notoriously nothing more to be said on the subject every one has been there and every one has brought back a collection of photographs there is as little mystery about the grand canal as about our local thoroughfare and the name of st mark is as familiar as the postmans ring it is not forbidden however to speak of familiar things and i hold that for the true venice lover venice is always in order there is nothing new to be said about her certainly but the old is better than any novelty it would be a sad day indeed when there should be something new to say i write these lines with the full consciousness of having no information whatever to offer i do not pretend to enlighten the reader i pretend only to give a fillip to his memory and i hold any writer sufficiently justified who is himself in love with his theme   i  mr ruskin has given it up that is very true but only after extracting half a lifetime of pleasure and an immeasurable quantity of fame from it we all may do the same after it has served our turn which it probably will not cease to do for many a year to come meantime it is mr ruskin who beyond anyone helps us to enjoy he has indeed lately produced several aids to depression in the shape of certain little humorousillhumorous pamphlets the series of st marks rest which embody his latest reflections on the subject of our city and describe the latest atrocities perpetrated there these latter are numerous and deeply to be deplored but to admit that they have spoiled venice would be to admit that venice may be spoiledan admission pregnant as it seems to us with disloyalty fortunately one reacts against the ruskinian contagion and one hour of the lagoon is worth a hundred pages of demoralised prose this queer latecoming prose of mr ruskin including the revised and condensed issue of the stones of venice only one little volume of which has been published or perhaps ever will be is all to be read though much of it appears addressed to children of tender age it is pitched in the nurserykey and might be supposed to emanate from an angry governess it is however all suggestive and much of it is delightfully just there is an inconceivable want of form in it though the author has spent his life in laying down the principles of form and scolding people for departing from them but it throbs and flashes with the love of his subjecta love disconcerted and abjured but which has still much of the force of inspiration among the many strange things that have befallen venice she has had the good fortune to become the object of a passion to a man of splendid genius who has made her his own and in doing so has made her the worlds there is no better reading at venice therefore as i say than ruskin for every true venicelover can separate the wheat from the chaff the narrow theological spirit the moralism à tout propos the queer provincialities and pruderies are mere wild weeds in a mountain of flowers one may doubtless be very happy in venice without reading at allwithout criticising or analysing or thinking a strenuous thought it is a city in which i suspect there is very little strenuous thinking and yet it is a city in which there must be almost as much happiness as misery the misery of venice stands there for all the world to see it is part of the spectaclea thoroughgoing devotee of local colour might consistently say it is part of the pleasure the venetian people have little to call their ownlittle more than the bare privilege of leading their lives in the most beautiful of towns their habitations are decayed their taxes heavy their pockets light their opportunities few one receives an impression however that life presents itself to them with attractions not accounted for in this meagre train of advantages and that they are on better terms with it than many people who have made a better bargain they lie in the sunshine they dabble in the sea they wear bright rags they fall into attitudes and harmonies they assist at an eternal conversazione it is not easy to say that one would have them other than they are and it certainly would make an immense difference should they be better fed the number of persons in venice who evidently never have enough to eat is painfully large but it would be more painful if we did not equally perceive that the rich venetian temperament may bloom upon a dogs allowance nature has been kind to it and sunshine and leisure and conversation and beautiful views form the greater part of its sustenance it takes a great deal to make a successful american but to make a happy venetian takes only a handful of quick sensibility the italian people have at once the good and the evil fortune to be conscious of few wants so that if the civilisation of a society is measured by the number of its needs as seems to be the common opinion today it is to be feared that the children of the lagoon would make but a poor figure in a set of comparative tables not their misery doubtless but the way they elude their misery is what pleases the sentimental tourist who is gratified by the sight of a beautiful race that lives by the aid of its imagination the way to enjoy venice is to follow the example of these people and make the most of simple pleasures almost all the pleasures of the place are simple this may be maintained even under the imputation of ingenious paradox there is no simpler pleasure than looking at a fine titian unless it be looking at a fine tintoret or strolling into st marksabominable the way one falls into the habitand resting ones lightwearied eyes upon the windowless gloom or than floating in a gondola or than hanging over a balcony or than taking ones coffee at florians it is of such superficial pastimes that a venetian day is composed and the pleasure of the matter is in the emotions to which they minister these are fortunately of the finest otherwise venice would be insufferably dull reading ruskin is good reading the old records is perhaps better but the best thing of all is simply staying on the only way to care for venice as she deserves it is to give her a chance to touch you oftento linger and remain and return   ii  the danger is that you will not linger enougha danger of which the author of these lines had known something it is possible to dislike venice and to entertain the sentiment in a responsible and intelligent manner there are travellers who think the place odious and those who are not of this opinion often find themselves wishing that the others were only more numerous the sentimental tourists sole quarrel with his venice is that he has too many competitors there he likes to be alone to be original to have to himself at least the air of making discoveries the venice of today is a vast museum where the little wicket that admits you is perpetually turning and creaking and you march through the institution with a herd of fellowgazers there is nothing left to discover or describe and originality of attitude is completely impossible this is often very annoying you can only turn your back on your impertinent playfellow and curse his want of delicacy but this is not the fault of venice it is the fault of the rest of the world the fault of venice is that though she is easy to admire she is not so easy to live with as you count living in other places after you have stayed a week and the bloom of novelty has rubbed off you wonder if you can accommodate yourself to the peculiar conditions your old habits become impracticable and you find yourself obliged to form new ones of an undesirable and unprofitable character you are tired of your gondola or you think you are and you have seen all the principal pictures and heard the names of the palaces announced a dozen times by your gondolier who brings them out almost as impressively as if he were an english butler bawling titles into a drawingroom you have walked several hundred times round the piazza and bought several bushels of photographs you have visited the antiquity mongers whose horrible signboards dishonour some of the grandest vistas in the grand canal you have tried the opera and found it very bad you have bathed at the lido and found the water flat you have begun to have a shipboardfeelingto regard the piazza as an enormous saloon and the riva degli schiavoni as a promenadedeck you are obstructed and encaged your desire for space is unsatisfied you miss your usual exercise you try to take a walk and you fail and meantime as i say you have come to regard your gondola as a sort of magnified babys cradle you have no desire to be rocked to sleep though you are sufficiently kept awake by the irritation produced as you gaze across the shallow lagoon by the attitude of the perpetual gondolier with his turnedout toes his protruded chin his absurdly unscientific stroke the canals have a horrible smell and the everlasting piazza where you have looked repeatedly at every article in every shopwindow and found them all rubbish where the young venetians who sell bead bracelets and panoramas are perpetually thrusting their wares at you where the same tightlybuttoned officers are for ever sucking the same black weeds at the same empty tables in front of the same cafésthe piazza as i say has resolved itself into a magnificent treadmill this is the state of mind of those shallow inquirers who find venice all very well for a week and if in such a state of mind you take your departure you act with fatal rashness the loss is your own moreover it is notwith all deference to your personal attractionsthat of your companions who remain behind for though there are some disagreeable things in venice there is nothing so disagreeable as the visitors the conditions are peculiar but your intolerance of them evaporates before it has had time to become a prejudice when you have called for the bill to go pay it and remain and you will find on the morrow that you are deeply attached to venice it is by living there from day to day that you feel the fulness of her charm that you invite her exquisite influence to sink into your spirit the creature varies like a nervous woman whom you know only when you know all the aspects of her beauty she has high spirits or low she is pale or red grey or pink cold or warm fresh or wan according to the weather or the hour she is always interesting and almost always sad but she has a thousand occasional graces and is always liable to happy accidents you become extraordinarily fond of these things you count upon them they make part of your life tenderly fond you become there is something indefinable in those depths of personal acquaintance that gradually establish themselves the place seems to personify itself to become human and sentient and conscious of your affection you desire to embrace it to caress it to possess it and finally a soft sense of possession grows up and your visit becomes a perpetual loveaffair it is very true that if you go as the author of these lines on a certain occasion went about the middle of march a certain amount of disappointment is possible he had paid no visit for several years and in the interval the beautiful and helpless city had suffered an increase of injury the barbarians are in full possession and you tremble for what they may do you are reminded from the moment of your arrival that venice scarcely exists any more as a city at all that she exists only as a battered peep show and bazaar there was a horde of savage germans encamped in the piazza and they filled the ducal palace and the academy with their uproar the english and americans came a little later they came in good time with a great many french who were discreet enough to make very long repasts at the caffè quadri during which they were out of the way the months of april and may of the year 1881 were not as a general thing a favourable season for visiting the ducal palace and the academy the valetde place had marked them for his own and held triumphant possession of them he celebrates his triumphs in a terrible brassy voice which resounds all over the place and has whatever language he be speaking the accent of some other idiom during all the spring months in venice these gentry abound in the great resorts and they lead their helpless captives through churches and galleries in dense irresponsible groups they infest the piazza they pursue you along the riva they hang about the bridges and the doors of the cafés in saying just now that i was disappointed at first i had chiefly in mind the impression that assails me today in the whole precinct of st marks the condition of this ancient sanctuary is surely a great scandal the pedlars and commissioners ply their tradeoften a very unclean oneat the very door of the temple they follow you across the threshold into the sacred dusk and pull your sleeve and hiss into your ear scuffling with each other for customers there is a great deal of dishonour about st marks altogether and if venice as i say has become a great bazaar this exquisite edifice is now the biggest booth   iii  it is treated as a booth in all ways and if it had not somehow a great spirit of solemnity within it the traveller would soon have little warrant for regarding it as a religious affair the restoration of the outer walls which has lately been so much attacked and defended is certainly a great shock of the necessity of the work only an expert is i suppose in a position to judge but there is no doubt that if a necessity it be it is one that is deeply to be regretted to no more distressing necessity have people of taste lately had to resign themselves wherever the hand of the restorer has been laid all semblance of beauty has vanished which is a sad fact considering that the external loveliness of st marks has been for ages less impressive only than that of the still comparatively uninjured interior i know not what is the measure of necessity in such a case and it appears indeed to be a very delicate question to day at any rate that admirable harmony of faded mosaic and marble which to the eye of the traveller emerging from the narrow streets that lead to the piazza filled all the further end of it with a sort of dazzling silver presencetoday this lovely vision is in a way to be completely reformed and indeed wellnigh abolished the old softness and mellowness of colour the work of the quiet centuries and of the breath of the salt seais giving way to large crude patches of new material which have the effect of a monstrous malady rather than of a restoration to health they look like blotches of red and white paint and dishonourable smears of chalk on the cheeks of a noble matron the face toward the piazzetta is in especial the newest looking thing conceivableas new as a new pair of boots or as the mornings paper we do not profess however to undertake a scientific quarrel with these changes we admit that our complaint is a purely sentimental one the march of industry in united italy must doubtless be looked at as a whole and one must endeavour to believe that it is through innumerable lapses of taste that this deeply interesting country is groping her way to her place among the nations for the present it is not to be denied certain odd phases of the process are more visible than the result to arrive at which it seems necessary that as she was of old a passionate votary of the beautiful she should to day burn everything that she has adored it is doubtless too soon to judge her and there are moments when one is willing to forgive her even the restoration of st marks inside as well there has been a considerable attempt to make the place more tidy but the general effect as yet has not seriously suffered what i chiefly remember is the straightening out of that dark and rugged old pavementthose deep undulations of primitive mosaic in which the fond spectator was thought to perceive an intended resemblance to the waves of the ocean whether intended or not the analogy was an image the more in a treasurehouse of images but from a considerable portion of the church it has now disappeared throughout the greater part indeed the pavement remains as recent generations have known itdark rich cracked uneven spotted with porphyry and timeblackened malachite polished by the knees of innumerable worshippers but in other large stretches the idea imitated by the restorers is that of the ocean in a dead calm and the model they have taken the floor of a london clubhouse or of a new york hotel i think no venetian and scarcely any italian cares much for such differences and when a year ago people in england were writing to the times about the whole business and holding meetings to protest against it the dear children of the lagoonso far as they heard or heeded the rumourthought them partly busybodies and partly asses busybodies they doubtless were but they took a good deal of disinterested trouble it never occurs to the venetian mind of today that such trouble may be worth taking the venetian mind vainly endeavours to conceive a state of existence in which personal questions are so insipid that people have to look for grievances in the wrongs of brick and marble i must not however speak of st marks as if i had the pretension of giving a description of it or as if the reader desired one the reader has been too well served already it is surely the bestdescribed building in the world open the stones of venice open théophile gautiers ltalia and you will see these writers take it very seriously and it is only because there is another way of taking it that i venture to speak of it the way that offers itself after you have been in venice a couple of months and the light is hot in the great square and you pass in under the pictured porticoes with a feeling of habit and friendliness and a desire for something cool and dark there are moments after all when the church is comparatively quiet and empty and when you may sit there with an easy consciousness of its beauty from the moment of course that you go into any italian church for any purpose but to say your prayers or look at the ladies you rank yourself among the trooping barbarians i just spoke of you treat the place as an orifice in the peep show still it is almost a spiritual functionor at the worst an amorous oneto feed ones eyes on the molten colour that drops from the hollow vaults and thickens the air with its richness it is all so quiet and sad and faded and yet all so brilliant and living the strange figures in the mosaic pictures bending with the curve of niche and vault stare down through the glowing dimness the burnished gold that stands behind them catches the light on its little uneven cubes st marks owes nothing of its character to the beauty of proportion or perspective there is nothing grandly balanced or fararching there are no long lines nor triumphs of the perpendicular the church arches indeed but arches like a dusky cavern beauty of surface of tone of detail of things near enough to touch and kneel upon and lean againstit is from this the effect proceeds in this sort of beauty the place is incredibly rich and you may go there every day and find afresh some lurking pictorial nook it is a treasury of bits as the painters say and there are usually three or four of the fraternity with their easels set up in uncertain equilibrium on the undulating floor it is not easy to catch the real complexion of st marks and these laudable attempts at portraiture are apt to look either lurid or livid but if you cannot paint the old looselooking marble slabs the great panels of basalt and jasper the crucifixes of which the lonely anguish looks deeper in the vertical light the tabernacles whose open doors disclose a dark byzantine image spotted with dull crooked gemsif you cannot paint these things you can at least grow fond of them you grow fond even of the old benches of red marble partly worn away by the breeches of many generations and attached to the base of those wide pilasters of which the precious plating delightful in its faded brownness with a faint grey bloom upon it bulges and yawns a little with honourable age  illustration flags at st marks venice   iv  even at first when the vexatious sense of the city of the doges reduced to earning its living as a curiosityshop was in its keenness there was a great deal of entertainment to be got from lodging on riva schiavoni and looking out at the farshimmering lagoon there was entertainment indeed in simply getting into the place and observing the queer incidents of a venetian installation a great many persons contribute indirectly to this undertaking and it is surprising how they spring out at you during your novitiate to remind you that they are bound up in some mysterious manner with the constitution of your little establishment it was an interesting problem for instance to trace the subtle connection existing between the niece of the landlady and the occupancy of the fourth floor superficially it was none too visible as the young lady in question was a dancer at the fenice theatreor when that was closed at the rossini and might have been supposed absorbed by her professional duties it proved necessary however that she should hover about the premises in a velvet jacket and a pair of black kid gloves with one little white button as also that she should apply a thick coating of powder to her face which had a charming oval and a sweet weak expression like that of most of the venetian maidens who as a general thingit was not a peculiarity of the land ladys nieceare fond of besmearing themselves with flour you soon recognise that it is not only the manytwinkling lagoon you behold from a habitation on the riva you see a little of everything venetian straight across before my windows rose the great pink mass of san giorgio maggiore which has for an ugly palladian church a success beyond all reason it is a success of position of colour of the immense detached campanile tipped with a tall gold angel i know not whether it is because san giorgio is so grandly conspicuous with a great deal of worn fadedlooking brickwork but for many persons the whole place has a kind of suffusion of rosiness asked what may be the leading colour in the venetian concert we should inveterately say pink and yet without remembering after all that this elegant hue occurs very often it is a faint shimmering airy watery pink the bright sealight seems to flush with it and the pale whiteishgreen of lagoon and canal to drink it in there is indeed a great deal of very evident brickwork which is never fresh or loud in colour but always burnt out as it were always exquisitely mild  certain little mental pictures rise before the collector of memories at the simple mention written or spoken of the places he has loved when i hear when i see the magical name i have written above these pages it is not of the great square that i think with its strange basilica and its high arcades nor of the wide mouth of the grand canal with the stately steps and the well poised dome of the salute it is not of the low lagoon nor the sweet piazzetta nor the dark chambers of st marks i simply see a narrow canal in the heart of the citya patch of green water and a surface of pink wall the gondola moves slowly it gives a great smooth swerve passes under a bridge and the gondoliers cry carried over the quiet water makes a kind of splash in the stillness a girl crosses the little bridge which has an arch like a camels back with an old shawl on her head which makes her characteristic and charming you see her against the sky as you float beneath the pink of the old wall seems to fill the whole place it sinks even into the opaque water behind the wall is a garden out of which the long arm of a white june rosethe roses of venice are splendidhas flung itself by way of spontaneous ornament on the other side of this small water way is a great shabby facade of gothic windows and balconies balconies on which dirty clothes are hung and under which a cavernouslooking doorway opens from a low flight of slimy water steps it is very hot and still the canal has a queer smell and the whole place is enchanting  illustration a narrow canal venice  it is poor work however talking about the colour of things in venice the fond spectator is perpetually looking at it from his window when he is not floating about with that delightful sense of being for the moment a part of it which any gentleman in a gondola is free to entertain venetian windows and balconies are a dreadful lure and while you rest your elbows on these cushioned ledges the precious hours fly away but in truth venice isnt in fair weather a place for concentration of mind the effort required for sitting down to a writingtable is heroic and the brightest page of ms looks dull beside the brilliancy of your milieu all nature beckons you forth and murmurs to you sophistically that such hours should be devoted to collecting impressions afterwards in ugly places at unprivileged times you can convert your impressions into prose fortunately for the present proser the weather wasnt always fine the first month was wet and windy and it was better to judge of the matter from an open casement than to respond to the advances of persuasive gondoliers even then however there was a constant entertainment in the view it was all cold colour and the steelgrey floor of the lagoon was stroked the wrong way by the wind then there were charming cool intervals when the churches the houses the anchored fishingboats the whole gentlycurving line of the riva seemed to be washed with a pearly white later it all turned warmwarm to the eye as well as to other senses after the middle of may the whole place was in a glow the sea took on a thousand shades but they were only infinite variations of blue and those rosy walls i just spoke of began to flush in the thick sunshine every patch of colour every yard of weather stained stucco every glimpse of nestling garden or daub of sky above a calle began to shine and sparklebegan as the painters say to compose the lagoon was streaked with odd currents which played across it like huge smooth fingermarks the gondolas multiplied and spotted it allover every gondola and gondolier looking at a distance precisely like every other  there is something strange and fascinating in this mysterious impersonality of the gondola it has an identity when you are in it but thanks to their all being of the same size shape and colour and of the same deportment and gait it has none or as little as possible as you see it pass before you from my windows on the riva there was always the same silhouettethe long black slender skiff lifting its head and throwing it back a little moving yet seeming not to move with the grotesquely graceful figure on the poop this figure inclines as may be more to the graceful or to the grotesquestanding in the second position of the dancingmaster but indulging from the waist upward in a freedom of movement which that functionary would deprecate one may say as a general thing that there is something rather awkward in the movement even of the most graceful gondolier and something graceful in the movement of the most awkward in the graceful men of course the grace predominates and nothing can be finer than the large firm way in which from their point of vantage they throw themselves over their tremendous oar it has the boldness of a plunging bird and the regularity of a pendulum sometimes as you see this movement in profile in a gondola that passes yousee as you recline on your own low cushions the arching body of the gondolier lifted up against the skyit has a kind of nobleness which suggests an image on a greek frieze the gondolier at venice is your very good friendif you choose him happilyand on the quality of the personage depends a good deal that of your impressions he is a part of your daily life your double your shadow your complement most people i think either like their gondolier or hate him and if they like him like him very much in this case they take an interest in him after his departure wish him to be sure of employment speak of him as the gem of gondoliers and tell their friends to be certain to secure him there is usually no difficulty in securing him there is nothing elusive or reluctant about a gondolier nothing would induce me not to believe them for the most part excellent fellows and the sentimental tourist must always have a kindness for them more than the rest of the population of course they are the children of venice they are associated with its idiosyncrasy with its essence with its silence with its melancholy  when i say they are associated with its silence i should immediately add that they are associated also with its sound among themselves they are an extraordinarily talkative company they chatter at the traghetti where they always have some sharp point under discussion they bawl across the canals they bespeak your commands as you approach they defy each other from afar if you happen to have a traghetto under your window you are well aware that they are a vocal race i should go even further than i went just now and say that the voice of the gondolier is in fact for audibility the dominant or rather the only note of venice there is scarcely another heard sound and that indeed is part of the interest of the place there is no noise there save distinctly human noise no rumbling no vague uproar nor rattle of wheels and hoofs it is all articulate and vocal and personal one may say indeed that venice is emphatically the city of conversation people talk all over the place because there is nothing to interfere with its being caught by the ear among the populace it is a general family party the still water carries the voice and good venetians exchange confidences at a distance of half a mile it saves a world of trouble and they dont like trouble their delightful garrulous language helps them to make venetian life a long conversazione this language with its soft elisions its odd transpositions its kindly contempt for consonants and other disagreeables has in it something peculiarly human and accommodating if your gondolier had no other merit he would have the merit that he speaks venetian this may rank as a merit even some people perhaps would say especiallywhen you dont understand what he says but he adds to it other graces which make him an agreeable feature in your life the price he sets on his services is touchingly small and he has a happy art of being obsequious without being or at least without seeming abject for occasional liberalities he evinces an almost lyrical gratitude in short he has delightfully good manners a merit which he shares for the most part with the venetians at large one grows very fond of these people and the reason of ones fondness is the frankness and sweetness of their address that of the italian family at large has much to recommend it but in the venetian manner there is something peculiarly ingratiating one feels that the race is old that it has a long and rich civilisation in its blood and that if it hasnt been blessed by fortune it has at least been polished by time it hasnt a genius for stiff morality and indeed makes few pretensions in that direction it scruples but scantly to represent the false as the true and has been accused of cultivating the occasion to grasp and to overreach and of steering a crooked coursenot to your and my advantageamid the sanctities of property it has been accused further of loving if not too well at least too often of being in fine as little austere as possible i am not sure it is very brave nor struck with its being very industrious but it has an unfailing sense of the amenities of life the poorest venetian is a natural man of the world he is better company than persons of his class are apt to be among the nations of industry and virtuewhere people are also sometimes perceived to lie and steal and otherwise misconduct themselves he has a great desire to please and to be pleased   v  in that matter at least the coldblooded stranger begins at last to imitate him begins to lead a life that shall be before all things easy unless indeed he allow himself like mr ruskin to be put out of humour by titian and tiepolo the hours he spends among the pictures are his best hours in venice and i am ashamed to have written so much of common things when i might have been making festoons of the names of the masters only when we have covered our page with such festoons what more is left to say when one has said carpaccio and bellini the tintoret and the veronese one has struck a note that must be left to resound at will everything has been said about the mighty painters and it is of little importance that a pilgrim the more has found them to his taste went this morning to the academy was very much pleased with titians assumption that honest phrase has doubtless been written in many a travellers diary and was not indiscreet on the part of its author but it appeals little to the general reader and we must moreover notoriously not expose our deepest feelings since i have mentioned titians assumption i must say that there are some people who have been less pleased with it than the observer we have just imagined it is one of the possible disappointments of venice and you may if you like take advantage of your privilege of not caring for it it imparts a look of great richness to the side of the beautiful room of the academy on which it hangs but the same room contains two or three works less known to fame which are equally capable of inspiring a passion the annunciation struck me as coarse and superficial that note was once made in a simpleminded tourists book at venice strange to say titian is altogether a disappointment the city of his adoption is far from containing the best of him madrid paris london florence dresden munich these are the homes of his greatness  there are other painters who have but a single home and the greatest of these is the tintoret close beside him sit carpaccio and bellini who make with him the dazzling venetian trio the veronese may be seen and measured in other places he is most splendid in venice but he shines in paris and in dresden you may walk out of the noonday dusk of trafalgar square in november and in one of the chambers of the national gallery see the family of darius rustling and pleading and weeping at the feet of alexander alexander is a beautiful young venetian in crimson pantaloons and the picture sends a glow into the cold london twilight you may sit before it for an hour and dream you are floating to the watergate of the ducal palace where a certain old beggar who has one of the handsomest heads in the worldhe has sat to a hundred painters for doges and for personages more sacredhas a prescriptive right to pretend to pull your gondola to the steps and to hold out a greasy immemorial cap but you must go to venice in very fact to see the other masters who form part of your life while you are there who illuminate your view of the universe it is difficult to express ones relation to them the whole venetian artworld is so near so familiar so much an extension and adjunct of the spreading actual that it seems almost invidious to say one owes more to one of them than to the other nowhere not even in holland where the correspondence between the real aspects and the little polished canvases is so constant and so exquisite do art and life seem so interfused and as it were so consanguineous all the splendour of light and colour all the venetian air and the venetian history are on the walls and ceilings of the palaces and all the genius of the masters all the images and visions they have left upon canvas seem to tremble in the sunbeams and dance upon the waves that is the perpetual interest of the placethat you live in a certain sort of knowledge as in a rosy cloud you dont go into the churches and galleries by way of a change from the streets you go into them because they offer you an exquisite reproduction of the things that surround you all venice was both model and painter and life was so pictorial that art couldnt help becoming so with all diminutions life is pictorial still and this fact gives an extraordinary freshness to ones perception of the great venetian works you judge of them not as a connoisseur but as a man of the world and you enjoy them because they are so social and so true perhaps of all works of art that are equally great they demand least reflection on the part of the spectatorthey make least of a mystery of being enjoyed reflection only confirms your admiration yet is almost ashamed to show its head these things speak so frankly and benignantly to the sense that even when they arrive at the highest styleas in the tintorets presentation of the little virgin at the templethey are still more familiar  but it is hard as i say to express all this and it is painful as well to attempt itpainful because in the memory of vanished hours so filled with beauty the consciousness of present loss oppresses exquisite hours enveloped in light and silence to have known them once is to have always a terrible standard of enjoyment certain lovely mornings of may and june come back with an ineffaceable fairness venice isnt smothered in flowers at this season in the manner of florence and rome but the sea and sky themselves seem to blossom and rustle the gondola waits at the wavewashed steps and if you are wise you will take your place beside a discriminating companion such a companion in venice should of course be of the sex that discriminates most finely an intelligent woman who knows her venice seems doubly intelligent and it makes no womans perceptions less keen to be aware that she cant help looking graceful as she is borne over the waves the handsome pasquale with uplifted oar awaits your command knowing in a general way from observation of your habits that your intention is to go to see a picture or two it perhaps doesnt immensely matter what picture you choose the whole affair is so charming it is charming to wander through the light and shade of intricate canals with perpetual architecture above you and perpetual fluidity beneath it is charming to disembark at the polished steps of a little empty campoa sunny shabby square with an old well in the middle an old church on one side and tall venetian windows looking down sometimes the windows are tenantless sometimes a lady in a faded dressinggown leans vaguely on the sill there is always an old man holding out his hat for coppers there are always three or four small boys dodging possible umbrellapokes while they precede you in the manner of custodians to the door of the church   vi  the churches of venice are rich in pictures and many a masterpiece lurks in the unaccommodating gloom of sidechapels and sacristies many a noble work is perched behind the dusty candles and muslin roses of a scantilyvisited altar some of them indeed hidden behind the altar suffer in a darkness that can never be explored the facilities offered you for approaching the picture in such cases are a mockery of your irritated wish you stand at tiptoe on a threelegged stool you climb a rickety ladder you almost mount upon the shoulders of the custode you do everything but see the picture you see just enough to be sure its beautiful you catch a glimpse of a divine head of a fig tree against a mellow sky but the rest is impenetrable mystery you renounce all hope for instance of approaching the magnificent cima da conegliano in san giovanni in bragora and bethinking yourself of the immaculate purity that shines in the spirit of this master you renounce it with chagrin and pain behind the high altar in that church hangs a baptism of christ by cima which i believe has been more or less repainted you make the thing out in spots you see it has a fullness of perfection but you turn away from it with a stiff neck and promise yourself consolation in the academy and at the madonna dell orto where two noble works by the same handpictures as clear as a summer twilightpresent themselves in better circumstances it may be said as a general thing that you never see the tintoret you admire him you adore him you think him the greatest of painters but in the great majority of cases your eyes fail to deal with him this is partly his own fault so many of his works have turned to blackness and are positively rotting in their frames at the scuola di san rocco where there are acres of him there is scarcely anything at all adequately visible save the immense crucifixion in the upper story it is true that in looking at this huge composition you look at many pictures it has not only a multitude of figures but a wealth of episodes and you pass from one of these to the other as if you were doing a gallery surely no single picture in the world contains more of human life there is everything in it including the most exquisite beauty it is one of the greatest things of art it is always interesting there are works of the artist which contain touches more exquisite revelations of beauty more radiant but there is no other vision of so intense a reality an execution so splendid the interest the impressiveness of that whole corner of venice however melancholy the effect of its gorgeous and illlighted chambers gives a strange importance to a visit to the scuola nothing that all travellers go to see appears to suffer less from the incursions of travellers it is one of the loneliest booths of the bazaar and the author of these lines has always had the good fortune which he wishes to every other traveller of having it to himself i think most visitors find the place rather alarming and wickedlooking they walk about a while among the fitful figures that gleam here and there out of the great tapestry as it were with which the painter has hung all the walls and then depressed and bewildered by the portentous solemnity of these objects by strange glimpses of unnatural scenes by the echo of their lonely footsteps on the vast stone floors they take a hasty departure finding themselves again with a sense of release from danger a sense that the genius loci was a sort of mad whitewasher who worked with a bad mixture in the bright light of the campo among the beggars the orangevendors and the passing gondolas solemn indeed is the place solemn and strangely suggestive for the simple reason that we shall scarcely find four walls elsewhere that inclose within a like area an equal quantity of genius the air is thick with it and dense and difficult to breathe for it was genius that was not happy inasmuch as it lacked the art to fix itself for ever it is not immortality that we breathe at the scuola di san rocco but conscious reluctant mortality  fortunately however we can turn to the ducal palace where everything is so brilliant and splendid that the poor dusky tintoret is lifted in spite of himself into the concert this deeply original building is of course the loveliest thing in venice and a mornings stroll there is a wonderful illumination cunningly select your hourhalf the enjoyment of venice is a question of dodgingand enter at about one oclock when the tourists have flocked off to lunch and the echoes of the charming chambers have gone to sleep among the sunbeams there is no brighter place in veniceby which i mean that on the whole there is none half so bright the reflected sunshine plays up through the great windows from the glittering lagoon and shimmers and twinkles over gilded walls and ceilings all the history of venice all its splendid stately past glows around you in a strong sealight everyone here is magnificent but the great veronese is the most magnificent of all he swims before you in a silver cloud he thrones in an eternal morning the deep blue sky burns behind him streaked across with milky bars the white colonnades sustain the richest canopies under which the first gentlemen and ladies in the world both render homage and receive it their glorious garments rustle in the air of the sea and their sunlighted faces are the very complexion of venice the mixture of pride and piety of politics and religion of art and patriotism gives a splendid dignity to every scene never was a painter more nobly joyous never did an artist take a greater delight in life seeing it all as a kind of breezy festival and feeling it through the medium of perpetual success he revels in the goldframed ovals of the ceilings multiplies himself there with the fluttering movement of an embroidered banner that tosses itself into the blue he was the happiest of painters and produced the happiest picture in the world the rape of europa surely deserves this title it is impossible to look at it without aching with envy nowhere else in art is such a temperament revealed never did inclination and opportunity combine to express such enjoyment the mixture of flowers and gems and brocade of blooming flesh and shining sea and waving groves of youth health movement desireall this is the brightest vision that ever descended upon the soul of a painter happy the artist who could entertain such a vision happy the artist who could paint it as the masterpiece i here recall is painted  the tintorets visions were not so bright as that but he had several that were radiant enough in the room that contains the work just cited are several smaller canvases by the greatly more complex genius of the scuola di san rocco which are almost simple in their loveliness almost happy in their simplicity they have kept their brightness through the centuries and they shine with their neighbours in those golden rooms there is a piece of painting in one of them which is one of the sweetest things in venice and which reminds one afresh of those wild flowers of execution that bloom so profusely and so unheeded in the dark corners of all of the tintorets work pallas chasing away mars is i believe the name that is given to the picture and it represents in fact a young woman of noble appearance administering a gentle push to a fine young man in armour as if to tell him to keep his distance it is of the gentleness of this push that i speak the charming way in which she puts out her arm with a single bracelet on it and rests her young hand its rosy fingers parted on his dark breastplate she bends her enchanting head with the efforta head which has all the strange fairness that the tintoret always sees in womenand the soft living fleshlike glow of all these members over which the brush has scarcely paused in its course is as pretty an example of genius as all venice can show but why speak of the tintoret when i can say nothing of the great paradise which unfolds its somewhat smoky splendour and the wonder of its multitudinous circles in one of the other chambers if it were not one of the first pictures in the world it would be about the biggest and we must confess that the spectator gets from it at first chiefly an impression of quantity then he sees that this quantity is really wealth that the dim confusion of faces is a magnificent composition and that some of the details of this composition are extremely beautiful it is impossible however in a retrospect of venice to specify ones happiest hours though as one looks backward certain ineffaceable moments start here and there into vividness how is it possible to forget ones visits to the sacristy of the frari however frequent they may have been and the great work of john bellini which forms the treasure of that apartment   vii  nothing in venice is more perfect than this and we know of no work of art more complete the picture is in three compartments the virgin sits in the central division with her child two venerable saints standing close together occupy each of the others it is impossible to imagine anything more finished or more ripe it is one of those things that sum up the genius of a painter the experience of a life the teaching of a school it seems painted with molten gems which have only been clarified by time and is as solemn as it is gorgeous and as simple as it is deep giovanni bellini is more or less everywhere in venice and wherever he is almost certain to be firstfirst i mean in his own line paints little else than the madonna and the saints he has not carpaccios care for human life at large nor the tintorets nor the of the veronese some of his greater pictures however where several figures are clustered together have a richness of sanctity that is almost profane there is one of them on the dark side of the room at the academy that contains titians assumption which if we could only see itits position is an inconceivable scandalwould evidently be one of the mightiest of socalled sacred pictures so too is the madonna of san zaccaria hung in a cold dim dreary place ever so much too high but so mild and serene and so grandly disposed and accompanied that the proper attitude for even the most critical amateur as he looks at it strikes one as the bended knee there is another noble john bellini one of the very few in which there is no virgin at san giovanni crisostomoa st jerome in a red dress sitting aloft upon the rocks and with a landscape of extraordinary purity behind him the absence of the peculiarly erect madonna makes it an interesting surprise among the works of the painter and gives it a somewhat less strenuous air but it has brilliant beauty and the st jerome is a delightful old personage  the same church contains another great picture for which the haunter of these places must find a shrine apart in his memory one of the most interesting things he will have seen if not the most brilliant nothing appeals more to him than three figures of venetian ladies which occupy the foreground of a smallish canvas of sebastian del piombo placed above the high altar of san giovanni crisostomo sebastian was a venetian by birth but few of his productions are to be seen in his native place few indeed are to be seen anywhere the picture represents the patronsaint of the church accompanied by other saints and by the worldly votaries i have mentioned these ladies stand together on the left holding in their hands little white caskets two of them are in profile but the foremost turns her face to the spectator this face and figure are almost unique among the beautiful things of venice and they leave the susceptible observer with the impression of having made or rather having missed a strange a dangerous but a most valuable acquaintance the lady who is superbly handsome is the typical venetian of the sixteenth century and she remains for the mind the perfect flower of that society never was there a greater air of breeding a deeper expression of tranquil superiority she walks a goddessas if she trod without sinking the waves of the adriatic it is impossible to conceive a more perfect expression of the aristocratic spirit either in its pride or in its benignity this magnificent creature is so strong and secure that she is gentle and so quiet that in comparison all minor assumptions of calmness suggest only a vulgar alarm but for all this there are depths of possible disorder in her lightcoloured eye  i had meant however to say nothing about her for its not right to speak of sebastian when one hasnt found room for carpaccio these visions come to one and one can neither hold them nor brush them aside memories of carpaccio the magnificent the delightfulits not for want of such visitations but only for want of space that i havent said of him what i would there is little enough need of it for carpaccios sake his fame being brighter todaythanks to the generous lamp mr ruskin has held up to itthan it has ever been yet there is something ridiculous in talking of venice without making him almost the refrain he and the tintoret are the two great realists and it is hard to say which is the more human the more various the tintoret had the mightier temperament but carpaccio who had the advantage of more newness and more responsibility sailed nearer to perfection here and there he quite touches it as in the enchanting picture at the academy of st ursula asleep in her little white bed in her high clean room where the angel visits her at dawn or in the noble st jerome in his study at s giorgio schiavoni this latter work is a pearl of sentiment and i may add without being fantastic a ruby of colour it unites the most masterly finish with a kind of universal largeness of feeling and he who has it well in his memory will never hear the name of carpaccio without a throb of almost personal affection such indeed is the feeling that descends upon you in that wonderful little chapel of st george of the slaves where this most personal and sociable of artists has expressed all the sweetness of his imagination the place is small and incommodious the pictures are out of sight and illlighted the custodian is rapacious the visitors are mutually intolerable but the shabby little chapel is a palace of art mr ruskin has written a pamphlet about it which is a real aid to enjoyment though i cant but think the generous artist with his keen senses and his just feeling would have suffered to hear his eulogist declare that one of his other productionsin the museo civico of palazzo correr a delightful portrait of two venetian ladies with pet animalsis the finest picture in the world it has no need of that to be thought admirable and what more can a painter desire   viii  may in venice is better than april but june is best of all then the days are hot but not too hot and the nights are more beautiful than the days then venice is rosier than ever in the morning and more golden than ever as the day descends she seems to expand and evaporate to multiply all her reflections and iridescences then the life of her people and the strangeness of her constitution become a perpetual comedy or at least a perpetual drama then the gondola is your sole habitation and you spend days between sea and sky you go to the lido though the lido has been spoiled when i first saw it in 1869 it was a very natural place and there was but a rough lane across the little island from the landingplace to the beach there was a bathingplace in those days and a restaurant which was very bad but where in the warm evenings your dinner didnt much matter as you sat letting it cool on the wooden terrace that stretched out into the sea today the lido is a part of united italy and has been made the victim of villainous improvements a little cockney village has sprung up on its rural bosom and a thirdrate boulevard leads from santa elisabetta to the adriatic there are bitumen walks and gaslamps lodginghouses shops and a teatro diurno the bathingestablishment is bigger than before and the restaurant as well but it is a compensation perhaps that the cuisine is no better such as it is however you wont scorn occasionally to partake of it on the breezy platform under which bathers dart and splash and which looks out to where the fishingboats with sails of orange and crimson wander along the darkening horizon the beach at the lido is still lonely and beautiful and you can easily walk away from the cockney village the return to venice in the sunset is classical and indispensable and those who at that glowing hour have floated toward the towers that rise out of the lagoon will not easily part with the impression but you indulge in larger excursionsyou go to burano and torcello to malamocco and chioggia torcello like the lido has been improved the deeply interesting little cathedral of the eighth century which stood there on the edge of the sea as touching in its ruin with its grassy threshold and its primitive mosaics as the bleached bones of a human skeleton washed ashore by the tide has now been restored and made cheerful and the charm of the place its strange and suggestive desolation has wellnigh departed  it will still serve you as a pretext however for a day on the lagoon especially as you will disembark at burano and admire the wonderful fisherfolk whose good looksand bad manners i am sorry to saycan scarcely be exaggerated burano is celebrated for the beauty of its women and the rapacity of its children and it is a fact that though some of the ladies are rather bold about it every one of them shows you a handsome face the children assail you for coppers and in their desire to be satisfied pursue your gondola into the sea chioggia is a larger burano and you carry away from either place a halfsad halfcynical but altogether pictorial impression the impression of bright coloured hovels of bathing in stagnant canals of young girls with faces of a delicate shape and a susceptible expression with splendid heads of hair and complexions smeared with powder faded yellow shawls that hang like old greek draperies and little wooden shoes that click as they go up and down the steps of the convex bridges of browncheeked matrons with lustrous tresses and high tempers massive throats encased with gold beads and eyes that meet your own with a certain traditional defiance the men throughout the islands of venice are almost as handsome as the women i have never seen so many goodlooking rascals at burano and chioggia they sit mending their nets or lounge at the street corners where conversation is always high pitched or clamour to you to take a boat and everywhere they decorate the scene with their splendid colourcheeks and throats as richly brown as the sails of their fishingsmacks their seafaded tatters which are always a costume their soft venetian jargon and the gallantry with which they wear their hats an article that nowhere sits so well as on a mass of dense venetian curls if you are happy you will find yourself after a june day in venice about ten oclock on a balcony that overhangs the grand canal with your elbows on the broad ledge a cigarette in your teeth and a little good company beside you the gondolas pass beneath the watery surface gleams here and there from their lamps some of which are coloured lanterns that move mysteriously in the darkness there are some evenings in june when there are too many gondolas too many lanterns too many serenades in front of the hotels the serenading in particular is overdone but on such a balcony as i speak of you neednt suffer from it for in the apartment behind youan accessible refuge there is more good company there are more cigarettes if you are wise you will step back there presently  1882      the grand canal   the honour of representing the plan and the place at their best might perhaps appear in the city of st mark properly to belong to the splendid square which bears the patrons name and which is the centre of venetian life so far this is pretty well all the way indeed as venetian life is a matter of strolling and chaffering of gossiping and gaping of circulating without a purpose and of staringtoo often with a foolish onethrough the shopwindows of dealers whose hospitality makes their doorsteps dramatic at the very vulgarest rubbish in all the modern market if the grand canal however is not quite technically a street the perverted piazza is perhaps even less normal and i hasten to add that i am glad not to find myself studying my subject under the international arcades or yet i will go the length of saying in the solemn presence of the church for indeed in that case i foresee i should become still more confoundingly conscious of the stumblingblock that inevitably even with his first few words crops up in the path of the lover of venice who rashly addresses himself to expression venetian life is a mere literary convention though it be an indispensable figure the words have played an effective part in the literature of sensibility they constituted thirty years ago the title of mr howellss delightful volume of impressions but in using them today one owes some frank amends to ones own lucidity let me carefully premise therefore that so often as they shall again drop from my pen so often shall i beg to be regarded as systematically superficial  venetian life in the large old sense has long since come to an end and the essential present character of the most melancholy of cities resides simply in its being the most beautiful of tombs nowhere else has the past been laid to rest with such tenderness such a sadness of resignation and remembrance nowhere else is the present so alien so discontinuous so like a crowd in a cemetery without garlands for the graves it has no flowers in its hands but as a compensation perhapsand the thing is doubtless more to the pointit has money and little red books the everlasting shuffle of these irresponsible visitors in the piazza is contemporary venetian life everything else is only a reverberation of that the vast mausoleum has a turnstile at the door and a functionary in a shabby uniform lets you in as per tariff to see how dead it is from this constatation this cold curiosity proceed all the industry the prosperity the vitality of the place the shopkeepers and gondoliers the beggars and the models depend upon it for a living they are the custodians and the ushers of the great museumthey are even themselves to a certain extent the objects of exhibition it is in the wide vestibule of the square that the polygot pilgrims gather most densely piazza san marco is the lobby of the opera in the intervals of the performance the present fortune of venice the lamentable difference is most easily measured there and that is why in the effort to resist our pessimism we must turn away both from the purchasers and from the vendors of ricordi the ricordi that we prefer are gathered best where the gondola glidesbest of all on the noble waterway that begins in its glory at the salute and ends in its abasement at the railway station it is however the cockneyfied piazzetta forgive me shade of st theodorehas not a brand new café begun to glare there electrically this very year that introduces us most directly to the great picture by which the grand canal works its first spell and to which a thousand artists not always with a talent apiece have paid their tribute we pass into the piazzetta to look down the great throat as it were of venice and the vision must console us for turning our back on st marks  we have been treated to it again and again of course even if we have never stirred from home but that is only a reason the more for catching at any freshness that may be left in the world of photography it is in venice above all that we hear the small buzz of this vulgarising voice of the familiar yet perhaps it is in venice too that the picturesque fact has best mastered the pious secret of how to wait for us even the classic salute waits like some great lady on the threshold of her saloon she is more ample and serene more seated at her door than all the copyists have told us with her domes and scrolls her scolloped buttresses and statues forming a pompous crown and her wide steps disposed on the ground like the train of a robe this fine air of the woman of the world is carried out by the wellbred assurance with which she looks in the direction of her old fashioned byzantine neighbour and the juxtaposition of two churches so distinguished and so different each splendid in its sort is a sufficient mark of the scale and range of venice however we ourselves are looking away from st markswe must blind our eyes to that dazzle without it indeed there are brightnesses and fascinations enough we see them in abundance even while we look away from the shady steps of the salute these steps are cool in the morning yet i dont know that i can justify my excessive fondness for them any better than i can explain a hundred of the other vague infatuations with which venice sophisticates the spirit under such an influence fortunately one need nt explainit keeps account of nothing but perceptions and affections it is from the salute steps perhaps of a summer morning that this view of the open mouth of the city is most brilliantly amusing the whole thing composes as if composition were the chief end of human institutions the charming architectural promontory of the dogana stretches out the most graceful of arms balancing in its hand the gilded globe on which revolves the delightful satirical figure of a little weathercock of a woman this fortune this navigation or whatever she is calledshe surely needs no namecatches the wind in the bit of drapery of which she has divested her rotary bronze loveliness on the other side of the canal twinkles and glitters the long row of the happy palaces which are mainly expensive hotels there is a little of everything everywhere in the bright venetian air but to these houses belongs especially the appearance of sitting across the water at the receipt of custom of watching in their hypocritical loveliness for the stranger and the victim i call them happy because even their sordid uses and their vulgar signs melt somehow with their vague seastained pinks and drabs into that strange gaiety of light and colour which is made up of the reflection of superannuated things the atmosphere plays over them like a laugh they are of the essence of the sad old joke they are almost as charming from other places as they are from their own balconies and share fully in that universal privilege of venetian objects which consists of being both the picture and the point of view  this double character which is particularly strong in the grand canal adds a difficulty to any control of ones notes the grand canal may be practically as in impression the cushioned balcony of a high and wellloved palacethe memory of irresistible evenings of the sociable elbow of endless lingering and looking or it may evoke the restlessness of a fresh curiosity of methodical inquiry in a gondola piled with references there are no references i ought to mention in the present remarks which sacrifice to accident not to completeness a rhapsody of venice is always in order but i think the catalogues are finished i should not attempt to write here the names of all the palaces even if the number of those i find myself able to remember in the immense array were less insignificant there are many i delight in that i dont know or at least dont keep apart then there are the bad reasons for preference that are better than the good and all the sweet bribery of association and recollection these things as one stands on the salute steps are so many delicate fingers to pick straight out of the row a dear little featureless house which with its pale green shutters looks straight across at the great door and through the very keyhole as it were of the church and which i neednt call by a namea pleasant american namethat every one in venice these many years has had on grateful lips it is the very friendliest house in all the wide world and it has as it deserves to have the most beautiful position it is a real porto di mare as the gondoliers saya port within a port it sees everything that comes and goes and takes it all in with practised eyes not a tint or a hint of the immense iridescence is lost upon it and there are days of exquisite colour on which it may fancy itself the heart of the wonderful prism we wave to it from the salute steps which we must decidedly leave if we wish to get on a grateful hand across the water and turn into the big white church of longhenaan empty shaft beneath a perfunctory domewhere an american family and a german party huddled in a corner upon a pair of benches are gazing with a conscientiousness worthy of a better cause at nothing in particular  for there is nothing particular in this cold and conventional temple to gaze at save the great tintoretto of the sacristy to which we quickly pay our respects and which we are glad to have for ten minutes to ourselves the picture though full of beauty is not the finest of the masters but it serves again as  well as another to transportthere is no other wordthose of his lovers for whom in faraway days when venice was an early rapture this strange and mystifying painter was almost the supreme revelation the plastic arts may have less to say to us than in the hungry years of youth and the celebrated picture in general be more of a blank but more than the others any fine tintoret still carries us back calling up not only the rich particular vision but the freshness of the old wonder many things come and go but this great artist remains for us in venice a part of the company of the mind the others are there in their obvious glory but he is the only one for whom the imagination in our expressive modern phrase sits up the marriage in cana at the salute has all his characteristic and fascinating unexpectednessthe sacrifice of the figure of our lord who is reduced to the mere final point of a clever perspective and the free joyous presentation of all the other elements of the feast why in spite of this queer onesidedness does the picture give us no impression of a lack of what the critics call reverence for no other reason that i can think of than because it happens to be the work of its author in whose very mistakes there is a singular wisdom mr ruskin has spoken with sufficient eloquence of the serious loveliness of the row of heads of the women on the right who talk to each other as they sit at the foreshortened banquet there could be no better example of the roving independence of the painters vision a real spirit of adventure for which his subject was always a cluster of accidents not an obvious order but a sort of peopled and agitated chapter of life in which the figures are submissive pictorial notes these notes are all there in their beauty and heterogeneity and if the abundance is of a kind to make the principle of selection seem in comparison timid yet the sense of composition in the spectatorif it happen to existreaches out to the painter in peculiar sympathy dull must be the spirit of the worker tormented in any field of art with that particular question who is not moved to recognise in the eternal problem the high fellowship of tintoretto  if the long reach from this point to the deplorable iron bridge which discharges the pedestrian at the academyor more comprehensively to the painted and gilded gothic of the noble palazzo foscariis too much of a curve to be seen at any one point as a whole it represents the better the arched neck as it were of the undulating serpent of which the canalazzo has the likeness we pass a dozen historic houses we note in our passage a hundred component bits with the baffled sketchers sense and with what would doubtless be save for our intensely venetian fatalism the baffled sketchers temper it is the early palaces of course and also to be fair some of the late if we could take them one by one that give the canal the best of its grand air the fairest are often cheekbyjowl with the foulest and there are few alas so fair as to have been completely protected by their beauty the ages and the generations have worked their will on them and the wind and the weather have had much to say but disfigured and dishonoured as they are with the bruises of their marbles and the patience of their ruin there is nothing like them in the world and the long succession of their faded conscious faces makes of the quiet waterway they overhang a promenade historique of which the lesson however often we read it gives in the depth of its interest an incomparable dignity to venice we read it in the romanesque arches crooked today in their very curves of the early middleage in the exquisite individual gothic of the splendid time and in the cornices and columns of a decadence almost as proud these things at present are almost equally touching in their good faith they have each in their degree so effectually parted with their pride they have lived on as they could and lasted as they might and we hold them to no account of their infirmities for even those of them whose blank eyes today meet criticism with most submission are far less vulgar than the uses we have mainly managed to put them to we have botched them and patched them and covered them with sordid signs we have restored and improved them with a merciless taste and the best of them we have made over to the pedlars some of the most striking objects in the finest vistas at present are the huge advertisements of the curiosityshops  the antiquitymongers in venice have all the courage of their opinion and it is easy to see how well they know they can confound you with an unanswerable question what is the whole place but a curiosityshop and what are you here for yourself but to pick up odds and ends we pick them up for you say these honest jews whose prices are marked in dollars and who shall blame us if the flowers being pretty well plucked we add an artificial rose or two to the composition of the bouquet they take care in a word that there be plenty of relics and their establishments are huge and active they administer the antidote to pedantry and you can complain of them only if you never cross their thresholds if you take this step you are lost for you have parted with the correctness of your attitude venice becomes frankly from such a moment the big depressing dazzling joke in which after all our sense of her contradictions sinks to restthe grimace of an overstrained philosophy its rather a comfort for the curiosityshops are amusing you have bad moments indeed as you stand in their halls of humbug and in the intervals of haggling hear through the high windows the soft splash of the sea on the old watersteps for you think with anger of the noble homes that are laid waste in such scenes of the delicate lives that must have been that might still be led there you reconstruct the admirable house according to your own needs leaning on a back balcony you drop your eyes into one of the little green gardens with which for the most part such establishments are exasperatingly blessed and end by feeling it a shame that you yourself are not in possession i take for granted of course that as you go and come you are in imagination perpetually lodging yourself and setting up your gods for if this innocent pastime this borrowing of the mind be not your favourite sport there is a flaw in the appeal that venice makes to you there may be happy cases in which your envy is tempered or perhaps i should rather say intensified by real participation if you have had the good fortune to enjoy the hospitality of an old venetian home and to lead your life a little in the painted chambers that still echo with one of the historic names you have entered by the shortest step into the inner spirit of the place if it did nt savour of treachery to private kindness i should like to speak frankly of one of these delightful even though alienated structures to refer to it as a splendid example of the old palatial type but i can only do so in passing with a hundred precautions and lifting the curtain at the edge drop a commemorative word on the success with which in this particularly happy instance the cosmopolite habit the modern sympathy the intelligent flexible attitude the latest fruit of time adjust themselves to the great gilded relinquished shell and try to fill it out a venetian palace that has not too grossly suffered and that is not overwhelming by its mass makes almost any life graceful that may be led in it with cultivated and generous contemporary ways it reveals a pre established harmony as you live in it day after day its beauty and its interest sink more deeply into your spirit it has its moods and its hours and its mystic voices and its shifting expressions if in the absence of its masters you have happened to have it to yourself for twentyfour hours you will never forget the charm of its haunted stillness late on the summer afternoon for instance when the call of playing children comes in behind from the campo nor the way the old ghosts seemed to pass on tiptoe on the marble floors it gives you practically the essence of the matter that we are considering for beneath the high balconies venice comes and goes and the particular stretch you command contains all the characteristics everything has its turn from the heavy barges of merchandise pushed by long poles and the patient shoulder to the floating pavilions of the great serenades and you may study at your leisure the admirable venetian arts of managing a boat and organising a spectacle of the beautiful free stroke with which the gondola especially when there are two oars is impelled you never in the venetian scene grow weary it is always in the picture and the large profiled action that lets the standing rowers throw themselves forward to a constant recovery has the double value of being at the fagend of greatness the only energetic note the people from the hotels are always afloat and at the hotel pace the solitary gondolier like the solitary horseman of the old fashioned novel is i confess a somewhat melancholy figure perched on his poop without a mate he reenacts perpetually in high relief with his toes turned out the comedy of his odd and charming movement he always has a little the look of an absent minded nurserymaid pushing her small charges in a perambulator  but why should i risk too free a comparison where this picturesque and amiable class are concerned i delight in their sunburnt complexions and their childish dialect i know them only by their merits and i am grossly prejudiced in their favour they are interesting and touching and alike in their virtues and their defects human nature is simplified as with a big effective brush affecting above all is their dependence on the stranger the whimsical stranger who swims out of their ken yet whom providence sometimes restores the best of them at any rate are in their line great artists on the swarming feast days on the strange feastnight of the redentore their steering is a miracle of ease the masterhands the celebrities and winners of prizesyou may see them on the private gondolas in spotless white with brilliant sashes and ribbons and often with very handsome personstake the right of way with a pardonable insolence they penetrate the crush of boats with an authority of their own the crush of boats the universal sociable bumping and squeezing is great when on the summer nights the ladies shriek with alarm the city pays the fiddlers and the illuminated barges scattering music and song lead a long train down the canal the barges used to be rowed in rhythmic strokes but now they are towed by the steamer the coloured lamps the vocalists before the hotels are not to my sense the greatest seduction of venice but it would be an uncandid sketch of the canalazzo that shouldnt touch them with indulgence taking one nuisance with another they are probably the prettiest in the world and if they have in general more magic for the new arrival than for the old venicelover they in any case at their best keep up the immemorial tradition the venetians have had from the beginning of time the pride of their processions and spectacles and its a wonder how with empty pockets they still make a clever show the carnival is dead but these are the scraps of its inheritance vauxhall on the water is of course more vauxhall than ever with the good fortune of homemade music and of a mirror that reduplicates and multiplies the feast of the redeemerthe great popular feast of the yearis a wonderful venetian vauxhall all venice on this occasion takes to the boats for the night and loads them with lamps and provisions wedged together in a mass it sups and sings every boat is a floating arbour a private caféconcert of all christian commemorations it is the most ingenuously and harmlessly pagan toward morning the passengers repair to the lido where as the sun rises they plunge still sociably into the sea the night of the redentore has been described but it would be interesting to have an account from the domestic point of view of its usual morrow it is mainly an affair of the giudecca however which is bridged over from the zattere to the great church the pontoons are laid together during the dayit is all done with extraordinary celerity and artand the bridge is prolonged across the canalazzo to santa maria zobenigo which is my only warrant for glancing at the occasion we glance at it from our palace windows lengthening our necks a little as we look up toward the salute we see all venice on the july afternoon so serried as to move slowly pour across the temporary footway it is a flock of very good children and the bridged canal is their toy all venice on such occasions is gentle and friendly not even all venice pushes anyone into the water  but from the same high windows we catch without any stretching of the neck a still more indispensable note in the picture a famous pretender eating the bread of bitterness this repast is served in the open air on a neat little terrace by attendants in livery and there is no indiscretion in our seeing that the pretender dines ever since the table dhôte in candide venice has been the refuge of monarchs in want of thronesshe would nt know herself without her rois en exil the exile is agreeable and soothing the gondola lets them down gently its movement is an anodyne its silence a philtre and little by little it rocks all ambitions to sleep the proscript has plenty of leisure to write his proclamations and even his memoirs and i believe he has organs in which they are published but the only noise he makes in the world is the harmless splash of his oars he comes and goes along the canalazzo and he might be much worse employed he is but one of the interesting objects it presents however and i am by no means sure that he is the most striking he has a rival if not in the iron bridge which alas is within our range at leastto take an immediate examplein the montecuculi palace fardescended and weary but beautiful in its crooked old age with its lovely proportions its delicate round arches its carvings and its disks of marble is the haunted montecuculi those who have a kindness for venetian gossip like to remember that it was once for a few months the property of robert browning who however never lived in it and who died in the splendid rezzonico the residence of his son and a wonderful cosmopolite document which as it presents itself in an admirable position but a short way farther down the canal we can almost see in spite of the curve from the window at which we stand this great seventeenth century pile throwing itself upon the water with a peculiar florid assurance a certain upward toss of its cornice which gives it the air of a rearing sea horse decorates immenselyand within as well as withoutthe wide angle that it commands  there is a more formal greatness in the high square gothic foscari just below it one of the noblest creations of the fifteenth century a masterpiece of symmetry and majesty dedicated today to official usesit is the property of the stateit looks conscious of the consideration it enjoys and is one of the few great houses within our range whose old age strikes us as robust and painless it is visibly kept up perhaps it is kept up too much perhaps i am wrong in thinking so well of it these doubts and fears course rapidly through my mindi am easily their victim when it is a question of architectureas they are apt to do today in italy almost anywhere in the presence of the beautiful of the desecrated or the neglected we feel at such moments as if the eye of mr ruskin were upon us we grow nervous and lose our confidence this makes me inevitably in talking of venice seek a pusillanimous safety in the trivial and the obvious i am on firm ground in rejoicing in the little garden directly opposite our windowsit is another proof that they really show us everything and in feeling that the gardens of venice would deserve a page to themselves they are infinitely more numerous than the arriving stranger can suppose they nestle with a charm all their own in the complications of most backviews some of them are exquisite many are large and even the scrappiest have an artful understanding in the interest of colour with the waterways that edge their foundations on the small canals in the hunt for amusement they are the prettiest surprises of all the tangle of plants and flowers crowds over the battered walls the greenness makes an arrangement with the rosy sordid brick of all the reflected and liquefied things in venice and the number of these is countless i think the lapping water loves them most they are numerous on the canalazzo but wherever they occur they give a brush to the picture and in particular it is easy to guess give a sweetness to the house then the elements are completethe trio of air and water and of things that grow venice without them would be too much a matter of the tides and the stones even the little trellises of the traghetti count charmingly as reminders amid so much artifice of the woodland nature of man the vineleaves trained on horizontal poles make a roof of chequered shade for the gondoliers and ferrymen who doze there according to opportunity or chatter or hail the approaching fare there is no hum in venice so that their voices travel far they enter your windows and mingle even with your dreams i beg the reader to believe that if i had time to go into everything i would go into the traghetti which have their manners and their morals and which used to have their piety this piety was always a madonnina the protectress of the passagea quaint figure of the virgin with the red spark of a lamp at her feet the lamps appear for the most part to have gone out and the images doubtless have been sold for brica brac the ferrymen for aught i know are converted to nihilisma faith consistent happily with a good stroke of business one of the figures has been left howeverthe madonnetta which gives its name to a traghetto near the rialto but this sweet survivor is a carven stone inserted ages ago in the corner of an old palace and doubtless difficult of removal pazienza the day will come when so marketable a relic will also be extracted from its socket and purchased by the devouring american i leave that expression on second thought standing but i repent of it when i remember that it is a devouring americana lady long resident in venice and whose kindnesses all venetians as well as her countrypeople know who has rekindled some of the extinguished tapers setting up especially the big brave gothic shrine of painted and gilded wood which on the top of its stout palo sheds its influence on the place of passage opposite the salute  if i may not go into those of the palaces this devious discourse has left behind much less may i enter the great galleries of the academy which rears its blank wall surmounted by the lion of st mark well within sight of the windows at which we are still lingering this wondrous temple of venetian artfor all it promises little from withoutoverhangs in a manner the grand canal but if we were so much as to cross its threshold we should wander beyond recall it contains in some of the most magnificent hallswhere the ceilings have all the glory with which the imagination of venice alone could overarch a room some of the noblest pictures in the world and whether or not we go back to them on any particular occasion for another look it is always a comfort to know that they are there as the sense of them on the spot is a part of the furniture of the mindthe sense of them close at hand behind every wall and under every cover like the inevitable reverse of a medal of the side exposed to the air that reflects intensifies completes the scene in other words as it was the inevitable destiny of venice to be painted and painted with passion so the wide world of picture becomes as we live there and however much we go about our affairs the constant habitation of our thoughts the truth is we are in it so uninterruptedly at home and abroad that there is scarcely a pressure upon us to seek it in one place more than in another choose your standpoint at random and trust the picture to come to you this is manifestly why i have not i find myself conscious said more about the features of the canalazzo which occupy the reach between the salute and the position we have so obstinately taken up it is still there before us however and the delightful little palazzo dario intimately familiar to english and american travellers picks itself out in the foreshortened brightness the dario is covered with the loveliest little marble plates and sculptured circles it is made up of exquisite pieces as if there had been only enough to make it smallso that it looks in its extreme antiquity a good deal like a house of cards that hold together by a tenure it would be fatal to touch an old venetian house dies hard indeed and i should add that this delicate thing with submission in every feature continues to resist the contact of generations of lodgers it is let out in floors it used to be let as a whole and in how many eager handsfor it is in great requisitionunder how many fleeting dispensations have we not known and loved it people are always writing in advance to secure it as they are to secure the jenkinss gondolier and as the gondola passes we see strange faces at the windowsthough its ten to one we recognise them and the millionth artist coming forth with his traps at the watergate the poor little patient dario is one of the most flourishing booths at the fair  the faces in the window look out at the great sansovinothe splendid pile that is now occupied by the prefect i feel decidedly that i dont object as i ought to the palaces of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries their pretensions impose upon me and the imagination peoples them more freely than it can people the interiors of the prime was not moreover this masterpiece of sansovino once occupied by the venetian post office and thereby intimately connected with an ineffaceable first impression of the author of these remarks he had arrived wondering palpitating twentythree years ago after nightfall and the first thing on the morrow had repaired to the post office for his letters they had been waiting a long time and were full of delayed interest and he returned with them to the gondola and floated slowly down the canal the mixture the rapture the wonderful temple of the poste restante the beautiful strangeness all humanised by good newsthe memory of this abides with him still so that there always proceeds from the splendid waterfront i speak of a certain secret appeal something that seems to have been uttered first in the sonorous chambers of youth of course this association falls to the groundor rather splashes into the waterif i am the victim of a confusion was the edifice in question twentythree years ago the postoffice which has occupied since for many a day very much humbler quarters i am afraid to take the proper steps for finding out lest i should learn that during these years i have misdirected my emotion a better reason for the sentiment at any rate is that such a great house has surely in the high beauty of its tiers a refinement of its own they make one think of colosseums and aqueducts and bridges and they constitute doubtless in venice the most pardonable specimen of the imitative i have even a timid kindness for the huge pesaro far down the canal whose main reproach more even than the coarseness of its forms is its swaggering size its want of consideration for the general picture which the early examples so reverently respect the pesaro is as far out of the frame as a modern hotel and the cornaro close to it oversteps almost equally the modesty of art one more thing they and their kindred do i must add for which unfortunately we can patronise them less they make even the most elaborate material civilisation of the present day seem woefully shrunken and bourgeois for they simplyi allude to the biggest palacescant be lived in as they were intended to be the modern tenant may take in all the magazines but he bends not the bow of achilles he occupies the place but he doesnt fill it and he has guests from the neighbouring inns with ulsters and baedekers we are far at the pesaro by the way from our attaching window and we take advantage of it to go in rather a melancholy mood to the end the long straight vista from the foscari to the rialto the great middle stretch of the canal contains as the phrase is a hundred objects of interest but it contains most the bright oddity of its general deluge air in all these centuries it has never got over its resemblance to a flooded city for some reason or other it is the only part of venice in which the houses look as if the waters had overtaken them everywhere else they reckon with themhave chosen them here alone the lapping seaway seems to confess itself an accident  illustration palazzo moncenigo venice  there are persons who hold this long gay shabby spotty perspective in which with its immense field of confused reflection the houses have infinite variety the dullest expanse in venice it was not dull we imagine for lord byron who lived in the midmost of the three mocenigo palaces where the writingtable is still shown at which he gave the rein to his passions for other observers it is sufficiently enlivened by so delightful a creation as the palazzo loredan once a masterpiece and at present the municipio not to speak of a variety of other immemorial bits whose beauty still has a degree of freshness some of the most touching relics of early venice are herefor it was here she precariously clusteredpeeping out of a submersion more pitiless than the sea as we approach the rialto indeed the picture falls off and a comparative commonness suffuses it there is a wide paved walk on either side of the canal on which the watermanand who in venice is not a watermanis prone to seek repose i speak of the summer daysit is the summer venice that is the visible venice the big tarry barges are drawn up at the fondamenta and the barelegged boatmen in faded blue cotton lie asleep on the hot stones if there were no colour anywhere else there would be enough in their tanned personalities half the low doorways open into the warm interior of waterside drinkingshops and here and there on the quay beneath the bush that overhangs the door there are rickety tables and chairs where in venice is there not the amusement of character and of detail the tone in this part is very vivid and is largely that of the brown plebeian faces looking out of the patchy miscellaneous housesthe faces of fat undressed women and of other simple folk who are not aware that they enjoy from balconies once doubtless patrician a view the knowing ones of the earth come thousands of miles to envy them the effect is enhanced by the tattered clothes hung to dry in the windows by the sunfaded rags that flutter from the polished balustrades these are ivorysmooth with time and the whole scene profits by the general law that renders decadence and ruin in venice more brilliant than any prosperity decay is in this extraordinary place golden in tint and misery couleur de rose the gondolas of the correct people are unmitigated sable but the poor marketboats from the islands are kaleidoscopic  the bridge of the rialto is a name to conjure with but honestly speaking it is scarcely the gem of the composition there are of course two ways of taking itfrom the water or from the upper passage where its small shops and booths abound in venetian character but it mainly counts as a feature of the canal when seen from the gondola or even from the awful vaporetto the great curve of its single arch is much to be commended especially when coming from the direction of the railway station you see it frame with its sharp compassline the perfect picture the reach of the canal on the other side but the backs of the little shops make from the water a graceless collective hump and the inside view is the diverting one the big arch of the bridgelike the arches of all the bridgesis the watermans friend in wet weather the gondolas when it rains huddle beside the peopled barges and the young ladies from the hotels vaguely fidgeting complain of the communication of insect life here indeed is a little of everything and the jewellers of this celebrated precinctthey have their immemorial rowmake almost as fine a show as the fruiterers it is a universal market and a fine place to study venetian types the produce of the islands is discharged there and the fishmongers announce their presence all ones senses indeed are vigorously attacked the whole place is violently hot and bright all odorous and noisy the churning of the screw of the vaporetto mingles with the other soundsnot indeed that this offensive note is confined to one part of the canal but just here the little piers of the resented steamer are particularly near together and it seems somehow to be always kicking up the water as we go further down we see it stopping exactly beneath the glorious windows of the cadoro it has chosen its position well and who shall gainsay it for having put itself under the protection of the most romantic facade in europe the companionship of these objects is a symbol it expresses supremely the present and the future of venice perfect in its prime was the marble cadoro with the noble recesses of its loggie but even then it probably never met a want like the successful vaporetto if however we are not to go into the museo civicothe old museo correr which rears a staring renovated front far down on the left near the station so also we must keep out of the great vexed question of steam on the canalazzo just as a while since we prudently kept out of the accademia these are expensive and complicated excursions it is obvious that if the vaporetti have contributed to the ruin of the gondoliers already hard pressed by fate and to that of the palaces whose foundations their waves undermine and that if they have robbed the grand canal of the supreme distinction of its tranquillity so on the other hand they have placed rapid transit in the new york phrase in everybodys reach and enabled everybodysave indeed those who wouldnt for the worldto rush about venice as furiously as people rush about new york the suitability of this consummation neednt be pointed out  even we ourselves in the irresistible contagion are going so fast now that we have only time to note in how clever and costly a fashion the museo civico the old fondaco dei turchi has been reconstructed and restored it is a glare of white marble without and a series of showy majestic halls within where a thousand curious mementos and relics of old venice are gathered and classified of its miscellaneous treasures i fear i may perhaps frivolously prefer the series of its remarkable living longhis an illustration of manners more copious than the celebrated carpaccio the two ladies with their little animals and their long sticks wonderful indeed today are the museums of italy where the renovations and the belle ordonnance speak of funds apparently unlimited in spite of the fact that the numerous custodians frankly look starved what is the pecuniary source of all this civic magnificenceit is shown in a hundred other waysand how do the italian cities manage to acquit themselves of expenses that would be formidable to communities richer and doubtless less aesthetic who pays the bills for the expressive statues alone the general exuberance of sculpture with which every piazzetta of almost every village is patriotically decorated let us not seek an answer to the puzzling question but observe instead that we are passing the mouth of the populous canareggio next widest of the waterways where the race of shylock abides and at the corner of which the big colourless church of san geremia stands gracefully enough on guard the canareggio with its wide lateral footways and humpbacked bridges makes on the feast of st john an admirable noisy tawdry theatre for one of the prettiest and the most infantile of the venetian processions  the rest of the course is a reduced magnificence in spite of interesting bits of the battered pomp of the pesaro and the cornaro of the recurrent memories of royalty in exile which cluster about the palazzo vendramin calergi once the residence of the comte de chambord and still that of his halfbrother in spite too of the big papadopoli gardens opposite the station the largest private grounds in venice but of which venice in general mainly gets the benefit in the usual form of irrepressible greenery climbing over walls and nodding at water the rococo church of the scalzi is here all marble and malachite all a cold hard glitter and a costly curly ugliness and here too opposite on the top of its high steps is san simeone profeta i wont say immortalised but unblushingly misrepresented by the perfidious canaletto i shall not stay to unravel the mystery of this prosaic painters malpractices he falsified without fancy and as he apparently transposed at will the objects he reproduced one is never sure of the particular view that may have constituted his subject it would look exactly like such and such a place if almost everything were not different san simeone profeta appears to hang there upon the wall but it is on the wrong side of the canal and the other elements quite fail to correspond ones confusion is the greater because one doesnt know that everything may not really have changed even beyond all probabilitythough its only in america that churches cross the street or the riverand the mixture of the recognisable and the different makes the ambiguity maddening all the more that the painter is almost as attaching as he is bad thanks at any rate to the white church domed and porticoed on the top of its steps the traveller emerging for the first time upon the terrace of the railwaystation seems to have a canaletto before him he speedily discovers indeed even in the presence of this scene of the final accents of the canalazzo there is a charm in the old pink warehouses on the hot fondamentathat he has something much better he looks up and down at the gathered gondolas he has his surprise after all his little first venetian thrill and as the terrace of the station ushers in these things we shall say no harm of it though it is not lovely it is the beginning of his experience but it is the end of the grand canal  1892      venice an early impression   there would be much to say about that golden chain of historic cities which stretches from milan to venice in which the very namesbrescia verona mantua paduaare an ornament to ones phrase but i should have to draw upon recollections now three years old and to make my short story a long one of verona and venice only have i recent impressions and even to these must i do hasty justice i came into venice just as i had done before toward the end of a summers day when the shadows begin to lengthen and the light to glow and found that the attendant sensations bore repetition remarkably well there was the same last intolerable delay at mestre just before your first glimpse of the lagoon confirms the already distinct seasmell which has added speed to the precursive flight of your imagination then the liquid level edged afar off by its band of undiscriminated domes and spires soon distinguished and proclaimed however as excited and contentious heads multiply at the windows of the train then your long rumble on the immense white railwaybridge which in spite of the invidious contrast drawn and very properly by mr ruskin between the old and the new approach does truly in a manner shine across the green lap of the lagoon like a mighty causeway of marble then the plunge into the station which would be exactly similar to every other plunge save for one little factthat the keynote of the great medley of voices borne back from the exit is not cab sir but barca signore  i do not mean however to follow the traveller through every phase of his initiation at the risk of stamping poor venice beyond repair as the supreme bugbear of literature though for my own part i hold that to a fine healthy romantic appetite the subject cant be too diffusely treated meeting in the piazza on the evening of my arrival a young american painter who told me that he had been spending the summer just where i found him i could have assaulted him for very envy he was painting forsooth the interior of st marks to be a young american painter unperplexed by the mocking elusive soul of things and satisfied with their wholesome lightbathed surface and shape keen of eye fond of colour of sea and sky and anything that may chance between them of old lace and old brocade and old furniture even when made to order of timemellowed harmonies on nameless canvases and happy contours in cheap old engravings to spend ones mornings in still productive analysis of the clustered shadows of the basilica ones afternoons anywhere in church or campo on canal or lagoon and ones evenings in starlight gossip at florians feeling the seabreeze throb languidly between the two great pillars of the piazzetta and over the low black domes of the churchthis i consider is to be as happy as is consistent with the preservation of reason  the mere use of ones eyes in venice is happiness enough and generous observers find it hard to keep an account of their profits in this line everything the attention touches holds it keeps playing with itthanks to some inscrutable flattery of the atmosphere your brownskinned whiteshirted gondolier twisting himself in the light seems to you as you lie at contemplation beneath your awning a perpetual symbol of venetian effect the light here is in fact a mighty magician and with all respect to titian veronese and tintoret the greatest artist of them all you should see in places the material with which it dealsslimy brick marble battered and befouled rags dirt decay sea and sky seem to meet halfway to blend their tones into a soft iridescence a lustrous compound of wave and cloud and a hundred nameless local reflections and then to fling the clear tissue against every object of vision you may see these elements at work everywhere but to see them in their intensity you should choose the finest day in the month and have yourself rowed far away across the lagoon to torcello without making this excursion you can hardly pretend to know venice or to sympathise with that longing for pure radiance which animated her great colourists it is a perfect bath of light and i couldnt get rid of a fancy that we were cleaving the upper atmosphere on some hurrying cloudskiff at torcello there is nothing but the light to see nothing at least but a sort of blooming sandbar intersected by a single narrow creek which does duty as a canal and occupied by a meagre cluster of huts the dwellings apparently of market gardeners and fishermen and by a ruinous church of the eleventh century it is impossible to imagine a more penetrating case of unheeded collapse torcello was the mothercity of venice and she lies there now a mere mouldering vestige like a group of weatherbleached parental bones left impiously unburied i stopped my gondola at the mouth of the shallow inlet and walked along the grass beside a hedge to the lowbrowed crumbling cathedral the charm of certain vacant grassy spaces in italy overfrowned by masses of brickwork that are honeycombed by the suns of centuries is something that i hereby renounce once for all the attempt to express but you may be sure that whenever i mention such a spot enchantment lurks in it  a delicious stillness covered the little campo at torcello i remember none so subtly audible save that of the roman campagna there was no life but the visible tremor of the brilliant air and the cries of halfadozen young children who dogged our steps and clamoured for coppers these children by the way were the handsomest little brats in the world and each was furnished with a pair of eyes that could only have signified the protest of nature against the meanness of fortune they were very nearly as naked as savages and their little bellies protruded like those of infant cannibals in the illustrations of books of travel but as they scampered and sprawled in the soft thick grass grinning like suddenlytranslated cherubs and showing their hungry little teeth they suggested forcibly that the best assurance of happiness in this world is to be found in the maximum of innocence and the minimum of wealth one small urchinframed if ever a child was to be the joy of an aristocratic mammawas the most expressively beautiful creature i had ever looked upon he had a smile to make correggio sigh in his grave and yet here he was running wild among the seastunted bushes on the lonely margin of a decaying world in prelude to how blank or to how dark a destiny verily nature is still at odds with propriety though indeed if they ever really pull together i fear nature will quite lose her distinction an infant citizen of our own republic straighthaired paleeyed and freckled duly darned and catechised marching into a new england schoolhouse is an object often seen and soon forgotten but i think i shall always remember with infinite tender conjecture as the years roll by this little unlettered eros of the adriatic strand yet all youthful things at torcello were not cheerful for the poor lad who brought us the key of the cathedral was shaking with an ague and his melancholy presence seemed to point the moral of forsaken nave and choir the church admirably primitive and curious reminded me of the two or three oldest churches of romest clement and st agnes the interior is rich in grimly mystical mosaics of the twelfth century and the patchwork of precious fragments in the pavement not inferior to that of st marks but the terribly distinct apostles are ranged against their dead gold backgrounds as stiffly as grenadiers presenting armsintensely personal sentinels of a personal deity their stony stare seems to wait for ever vainly for some visible revival of primitive orthodoxy and one may well wonder whether it finds much beguilement in idlygazing troops of western heretics passionless even in their heresy  i had been curious to see whether in the galleries and temples of venice i should be disposed to transpose my old estimatesto burn what i had adored and adore what i had burned it is a sad truth that one can stand in the ducal palace for the first time but once with the deliciously ponderous sense of that particular halfhours being an era in ones mental history but i had the satisfaction of finding at leasta great comfort in a short staythat none of my early memories were likely to change places and that i could take up my admirations where i had left them i still found carpaccio delightful veronese magnificent titian supremely beautiful and tintoret scarce to be appraised i repaired immediately to the little church of san cassano which contains the smaller of tintorets two great crucifixions and when i had looked at it a while i drew a long breath and felt i could now face any other picture in venice with proper self possession it seemed to me i had advanced to the uttermost limit of painting that beyond this another artinspired poetry begins and that bellini veronese giorgione and titian all joining hands and straining every muscle of their genius reach forward not so far but that they leave a visible space in which tintoret alone is master i well remember the exaltations to which he lifted me when first i learned to know him but the glow of that comparatively youthful amazement is dead and with it i fear that confident vivacity of phrase of which in trying to utter my impressions i felt less the magniloquence than the impotence in his power there are many weak spots mysterious lapses and fitful intermissions but when the list of his faults is complete he still remains to me the most interesting of painters his reputation rests chiefly on a more superficial sort of merithis energy his unsurpassed productivity his being as théophile gautier says le roi des fougueux these qualities are immense but the great source of his impressiveness is that his indefatigable hand never drew a line that was not as one may say a moral line no painter ever had such breadth and such depth and even titian beside him scarce figures as more than a great decorative artist mr ruskin whose eloquence in dealing with the great venetians sometimes outruns his discretion is fond of speaking even of veronese as a painter of deep spiritual intentions this it seems to me is pushing matters too far and the author of the rape of europa is pictorially speaking no greater casuist than any other genius of supreme good taste titian was assuredly a mighty poet but tintoretwell tintoret was almost a prophet before his greatest works you are conscious of a sudden evaporation of old doubts and dilemmas and the eternal problem of the conflict between idealism and realism dies the most natural of deaths in his genius the problem is practically solved the alternatives are so harmoniously interfused that i defy the keenest critic to say where one begins and the other ends the homeliest prose melts into the most ethereal poetrythe literal and the imaginative fairly confound their identity  this however is vague praise tintorets great merit to my mind was his unequalled distinctness of vision when once he had conceived the germ of a scene it defined itself to his imagination with an intensity an amplitude an individuality of expression which makes ones observation of his pictures seem less an operation of the mind than a kind of supplementary experience of life veronese and titian are content with a much looser specification as their treatment of any subject that the author of the crucifixion at san cassano has also treated abundantly proves there are few more suggestive contrasts than that between the absence of a total character at all commensurate with its scattered variety and brilliancy in veroneses marriage of cana at the louvre and the poignant almost startling completeness of tintorets illustration of the theme at the salute church to compare his presentation of the virgin at the madonna dell orto with titians at the academy or his annunciation with titians close at hand is to measure the essential difference between observation and imagination one has certainly not said all that there is to say for titian when one has called him an observer il y mettait du sien and i use the term to designate roughly the artist whose apprehension infinitely deep and strong when applied to the single figure or to easily balanced groups spends itself vainly on great dramatic combinationsor rather leaves them ungauged it was the whole scene that tintoret seemed to have beheld in a flash of inspiration intense enough to stamp it ineffaceably on his perception and it was the whole scene complete peculiar individual unprecedented that he committed to canvas with all the vehemence of his talent compare his last supper at san giorgioits long diagonally placed table its dusky spaciousness its scattered lamplight and halolight its startled gesticulating figures its richly realistic foreground with the customary formal almost mathematical rendering of the subject in which impressiveness seems to have been sought in elimination rather than comprehension you get from tintorets work the impression that he felt pictorially the great beautiful terrible spectacle of human life very much as shakespeare felt it poeticallywith a heart that never ceased to beat a passionate accompaniment to every stroke of his brush thanks to this fact his works are signally grave and their almost universal and rapidly increasing decay doesnt relieve their gloom nothing indeed can well be sadder than the great collection of tintorets at san rocco incurable blackness is settling fast upon all of them and they frown at you across the sombre splendour of their great chambers like gaunt twilight phantoms of pictures to our childrens children tintoret as things are going can be hardly more than a name and such of them as shall miss the tragic beauty already so dimmed and stained of the great bearing of the cross in that temple of his spirit will live and die without knowing the largest eloquence of art if you wish to add the last touch of solemnity to the place recall as vividly as possible while you linger at san rocco the painters singularly interesting portrait of himself at the louvre the old man looks out of the canvas from beneath a brow as sad as a sunless twilight with just such a stoical hopelessness as you might fancy him to wear if he stood at your side gazing at his rotting canvases it isnt whimsical to read it as the face of a man who felt that he had given the world more than the world was likely to repay indeed before every picture of tintoret you may remember this tremendous portrait with profit on one side the power the passion the illusion of his art on the other the mortal fatigue of his spirit the worlds knowledge of him is so small that the portrait throws a doubly precious light on his personality and when we wonder vainly what manner of man he was and what were his purpose his faith and his method we may find forcible assurance there that they were at any rate his lifeone of the most intellectually passionate ever led  verona which was my last italian stoppingplace is in any conditions a delightfully interesting city but the kindness of my own memory of it is deepened by a subsequent ten days experience of germany i rose one morning at verona and went to bed at night at botzen the statement needs no comment and the two places though but fifty miles apart are as painfully dissimilar as their names i had prepared myself for your delectation with a copious tirade on german manners german scenery german art and the german stageon the lights and shadows of innsbrück munich nüremberg and heidelberg but just as i was about to put pen to paper i glanced into a little volume on these very topics lately published by that famous novelist and moralist m ernest feydeau the fruit of a summers observation at homburg this work produced a reaction and if i chose to follow m feydeaus own example when he wishes to qualify his approbation i might call his treatise by any vile name known to the speech of man but i content myself with pronouncing it superficial i then reflect that my own opportunities for seeing and judging were extremely limited and i suppress my tirade lest some more enlightened critic should come and hang me with the same rope its sum and substance was to have been that superficiallygermany is ugly that munich is a nightmare heidelberg a disappointment in spite of its charming castle and even nüremberg not a joy for ever but comparisons are odious and if munich is ugly verona is beautiful enough you may laugh at my logic but will probably assent to my meaning i carried away from verona a precious mental picture upon which i cast an introspective glance whenever between botzen and strassburg the oppression of external circumstance became painful it was a lovely august afternoon in the roman arenaa ruin in which repair and restoration have been so watchfully and plausibly practised that it seems all of one harmonious antiquity the vast stony oval rose high against the sky in a single clear continuous line broken here and there only by strolling and reclining loungers the massive tiers inclined in solid monotony to the central circle in which a small openair theatre was in active operation a small quarter of the great slope of masonry facing the stage was roped off into an auditorium in which the narrow level space between the footlights and the lowest step figured as the pit footlights are a figure of speech for the performance was going on in the broad glow of the afternoon with a delightful and apparently by no means misplaced confidence in the goodwill of the spectators what the piece was that was deemed so superbly able to shift for itself i know notvery possibly the same drama that i remember seeing advertised during my former visit to verona nothing less than la tremenda giustizia di dio if titles are worth anything this product of the melodramatists art might surely stand upon its own legs along the tiers above the little group of regular spectators was gathered a freelist of unauthorised observers who although beyond earshot must have been enabled by the generous breadth of italian gesture to follow the tangled thread of the piece it was all deliciously italianthe mixture of old life and new the mountebanks booth it was hardly more grafted on the antique circus the dominant presence of a mighty architecture the loungers and idlers beneath the kindly sky and upon the sun warmed stones i never felt more keenly the difference between the background to life in very old and very new civilisations there are other things in verona to make it a liberal education to be born there though that it is one for the contemporary veronese i dont pretend to say the tombs of the scaligers with their soaring pinnacles their highpoised canopies their exquisite refinement and concentration of the gothic idea i cant profess even after much worshipful gazing to have fully comprehended and enjoyed they seemed to me full of deep architectural meanings such as must drop gently into the mind one by one after infinite tranquil contemplation but even to the hurried and preoccupied traveller the solemn little chapel yard in the citys heart in which they stand girdled by their great swaying curtain of linked and twisted iron is one of the most impressive spots in italy nowhere else is such a wealth of artistic achievement crowded into so narrow a space nowhere else are the daily comings and goings of men blessed by the presence of manlier art verona is rich furthermore in beautiful churchesseveral with beautiful names san fermo santa anastasia san zenone this last is a structure of high antiquity and of the most impressive loveliness the nave terminates in a double choir that is a subchoir or crypt into which you descend and where you wander among primitive columns whose variously grotesque capitals rise hardly higher than your head and an upper choral plane reached by broad stairways of the bravest effect i shall never forget the impression of majestic chastity that i received from the great nave of the building on my former visit i then decided to my satisfaction that every church is from the devotional point of view a solecism that has not something of a similar absolute felicity of proportion for strictly formal beauty seems best to express our conception of spiritual beauty the nobly serious character of san zenone is deepened by its single picturea masterpiece of the most serious of painters the severe and exquisite mantegna  illustration the amphitheatre verona  1872      two old houses and three young women   there are times and places that come back yet again but that when the brooding tourist puts out his hand to them meet it a little slowly or even seem to recede a step as if in slight fear of some liberty he may take surely they should know by this time that he is capable of taking none he has his own wayhe makes it all right it now becomes just a part of the charming solicitation that it presents precisely a problemthat of giving the particular thing as much as possible without at the same time giving it as we say away there are considerations proprieties a necessary indirectnesshe must use in short a little art no necessity however more than this makes him warm to his work and thus it is that after all he hangs his three pictures   i  the evening that was to give me the first of them was by no means the first occasion of my asking myself if that inveterate style of which we talk so much be absolutely conditionedin dear old venice and elsewhereon decrepitude is it the style that has brought about the decrepitude or the decrepitude that has as it were intensified and consecrated the style there is an ambiguity about it all that constantly haunts and beguiles dear old venice has lost her complexion her figure her reputation her selfrespect and yet with it all has so puzzlingly not lost a shred of her distinction perhaps indeed the case is simpler than it seems for the poetry of misfortune is familiar to us all whereas in spite of a stroke here and there of some happy justice that charms we scarce find ourselves anywhere arrested by the poetry of a run of luck the misfortune of venice being accordingly at every point what we most touch feel and see we end by assuming it to be of the essence of her dignity a consequence we become aware by the way sufficiently discouraging to the general application or pretension of style and all the more that to make the final felicity deep the original greatness must have been something tremendous if it be the ruins that are noble we have known plenty that were not and moreover there are degrees and varieties certain monuments solid survivals hold up their heads and decline to ask for a grain of your pity well one knows of course when to keep ones pity to oneself yet one clings even in the face of the colder stare to ones prized venetian privilege of making the sense of doom and decay a part of every impression cheerful work it may be said of course and it is doubtless only in venice that you gain more by such a trick than you lose what was most beautiful is gone what was next most beautiful is thank goodness going that i think is the monstrous description of the better part of your thought is it really your fault if the place makes you want so desperately to read history into everything  you do that wherever you turn and wherever you look and you do it i should say most of all at night it comes to you there with longer knowledge and with all deference to what flushes and shimmers that the night is the real time it perhaps even wouldnt take much to make you award the palm to the nights of winter this is certainly true for the form of progression that is most characteristic for every question of departure and arrival by gondola the little closed cabin of this perfect vehicle the movement the darkness and the plash the indistinguishable swerves and twists all the things you dont see and all the things you do feeleach dim recognition and obscure arrest is a possible throb of your sense of being floated to your doom even when the truth is simply and sociably that you are going out to tea nowhere else is anything as innocent so mysterious nor anything as mysterious so pleasantly deterrent to protest these are the moments when you are most daringly venetian most content to leave cheap trippers and other aliens the high light of the midlagoon and the pursuit of pink and gold the splendid day is good enough for them what is best for you is to stop at last as you are now stopping among clustered pali and softlyshifting poops and prows at a great flight of watersteps that play their admirable part in the general effect of a great entrance the high doors stand open from them to the paved chamber of a basement tremendously tall and not vulgarly lighted from which in turn mounts the slow stone staircase that draws you further on the great point is that if you are worthy of this impression at all there isnt a single item of it of which the association isnt noble hold to it fast that there is no other such dignity of arrival as arrival by water hold to it that to float and slacken and gently bump to creep out of the low dark felze and make the few guided movements and find the strong crooked and offered arm and then beneath lighted palacewindows pass up the few damp steps on the precautionary carpethold to it that these things constitute a preparation of which the only defect is that it may sometimes perhaps really prepare too much its so stately that what can come afterits so good in itself that what upstairs as we comparative vulgarians say can be better hold to it at any rate that if a lady in especial scrambles out of a carriage tumbles out of a cab flops out of a tramcar and hurtles projectilelike out of a lightningelevator she alights from the venetian conveyance as cleopatra may have stepped from her barge upstairswhatever may be yet in store for herher entrance shall still advantageously enjoy the support most opposed to the momentum acquired the beauty of the matter has been in the absence of all momentumelsewhere so scientifically applied to us from behind by the terrible life of our dayand in the fact that as the elements of slowness the felicities of deliberation doubtless thus all hang together the last of calculable dangers is to enter a great venetian room with a rush  not the least happy note therefore of the picture i am trying to frame is that there was absolutely no rushing not only in the sense of a scramble over marble floors but by reason of something dissuasive and distributive in the very air of the place a suggestion under the fine old ceilings and among types of face and figure abounding in the unexpected that here were many things to consider perhaps the simplest rendering of a scene into the depths of which there are good grounds of discretion for not sinking would be just this emphasis on the value of the unexpected for such occasionswith due qualification naturally of its degree unexpectedness pure and simple it is needless to say may easily endanger any social gathering and i hasten to add moreover that the figures and faces i speak of were probably not in the least unexpected to each other the stage they occupied was a stage of variety venice has ever been a garden of strange social flowers it is only as reflected in the consciousness of the visitor from afar brooding tourist even call him or sharpeyed bird on the branch that i attempt to give you the little drama beginning with the felicity that most appealed to him the visible unmistakable fact that he was the only representative of his class the whole of the rest of the business was but what he saw and felt and fanciedwhat he was to remember and what he was to forget through it all i may say distinctly he clung to his great venetian cluethe explanation of everything by the historic idea it was a high historic house with such a quantity of recorded past twinkling in the multitudinous candles that one grasped at the idea of something waning and displaced and might even fondly and secretly nurse the conceit that what one was having was just the very last wasnt it certainly for instance no mere illusion that there is no appreciable future left for such mannersan urbanity so comprehensive a form so transmitted as those of such a hostess and such a host the future is for a different conception of the graceful altogether so far as its for a conception of the graceful at all into that computation i shall not attempt to enter but these representative products of an antique culture at least and one of which the secret seems more likely than not to be lost were not common nor indeed was any one elsein the circle to which the picture most insisted on restricting itself  neither on the other hand was anyone either very beautiful or very fresh which was again exactly a precious value on an occasion that was to shine most to the imagination by the complexity of its references such old old women with such old old jewels such ugly ugly ones with such handsome becoming names such battered fatigued gentlemen with such inscrutable decorations such an absence of youth for the most part in either sexof the pink and white the bud of new worlds such a general personal air in fine of being the worse for a good deal of wear in various old ones it was not a societythat was clearin which little girls and boys set the tune and there was that about it all that might well have cast a shadow on the path of even the most successful little girl yet alsolet me not be rudely inexactit was in honour of youth and freshness that we had all been convened the fiançailles of the lastunless it were the last but oneunmarried daughter of the house had just been brought to a proper climax the contract had been signed the betrothal rounded offim not sure that the civil marriage hadnt that day taken place the occasion then had in fact the most charming of heroines and the most ingenuous of heroes a young man the latter all happily suffused with a fair austrian blush the young lady had had besides other more or less shining recent ancestors a very famous paternal grandmother who had played a great part in the political history of her time and whose portrait in the taste and dress of 1830 was conspicuous in one of the rooms the granddaughter of this celebrity of royal race was strikingly like her and by a fortunate stroke had been habited combed curled in a manner exactly to reproduce the portrait these things were charming and amusing as indeed were several other things besides the great venetian beauty of our period was there and nature had equipped the great venetian beauty for her part with the properest sense of the suitable or in any case with a splendid generosity since on the ideally suitable character of so brave a human symbol who shall have the last word this responsible agent was at all events the beauty in the world about whom probably most the absence of question an absence never wholly propitious would a little smugly and monotonously flourish the one thing wanting to the interest she inspired was thus the possibility of ever discussing it there were plenty of suggestive subjects round about on the other hand as to which the exchange of ideas would by no means necessarily have dropped you profit to the full at such times by all the old voices echoes imagesby that element of the history of venice which represents all europe as having at one time and another revelled or rested asked for pleasure or for patience there which gives you the place supremely as the refuge of endless strange secrets broken fortunes and wounded hearts   ii  there had been on lines of further or different speculation a young englishman to luncheon and the young englishman had proved sympathetic so that when it was a question afterwards of some of the more hidden treasures the browner depths of the old churches the case became one for mutual guidance and gratitude for a small afternoon tour and the wait of a pair of friends in the warm little campi at locked doors for which the nearest urchin had scurried off to fetch the keeper of the key there are few brown depths today into which the light of the hotels doesnt shine and few hidden treasures about which pages enough doubtless havent already been printed my business accordingly let me hasten to say is not now with the fond renewal of any discoveryat least in the order of impressions most usual your discovery may be for that matter renewed every week the only essential is the good luckwhich a fair amount of practice has taught you to count uponof not finding for the particular occasion other discoverers in the field then in the quiet corner with the closed doorthen in the presence of the picture and of your companions sensible emotionnot only the original happy moment but everything else is renewed yet once again it can all come back the old custode shuffling about in the dimness jerks away to make sure of his tip the old curtain that isnt much more modern than the wonderful work itself he does his best to create light where light can never be but you have your practised groping gaze and in guiding the young eyes of your less confident associate moreover you feel you possess the treasure these are the refined pleasures that venice has still to give these odd happy passages of communication and response   but the point of my reminiscence is that there were other communications that day as there were certainly other responses i have forgotten exactly what it was we were looking forwithout much successwhen we met the three sisters nothing requires more care as a long knowledge of venice works in than not to lose the useful faculty of getting lost i had so successfully done my best to preserve it that i could at that moment conscientiously profess an absence of any suspicion of where we might be it proved enough that wherever we were we were where the three sisters found us this was on a little bridge near a big campo and a part of the charm of the matter was the theory that it was very much out of the way they took us promptly in handthey were only walking over to san marco to match some coloured wool for the manufacture of such belated cushions as still bloom with purple and green in the long leisures of old palaces and that mild errand could easily open a parenthesis the obscure church we had feebly imagined we were looking for proved if i am not mistaken that of the sisters parish as to which i have but a confused recollection of a large grey void and of admiring for the first time a fine work of art of which i have now quite lost the identity this was the effect of the charming beneficence of the three sisters who presently were to give our adventure a turn in the emotion of which everything that had preceded seemed as nothing it actually strikes me even as a little dim to have been told by them as we all fared together that a certain low wide house in a small square as to which i found myself without particular association had been in the far off time the residence of george sand and yet this was a fact that though i could then only feel it must be for another day would in a different connection have set me richly reconstructing  madame sands famous venetian year has been of late immensely in the aira tub of soiled linen which the muse of history rolling her sleeves well up has not even yet quite ceased energetically and publicly to wash the house in question must have been the house to which the wonderful lady betook herself when in 1834 after the dramatic exit of alfred de musset she enjoyed that remarkable period of rest and refreshment with the so long silent the but recently rediscovered reported extinguished doctor pagello as an old sandistnot exactly indeed of the première heure but of the fine high noon and golden afternoon of the great careeri had been though i confess too inactively curious as to a few points in the topography of the eminent adventure to which i here allude but had never got beyond the little public fact in itself always a bit of a thrill to the sandist that the present hotel danieli had been the scene of its first remarkable stages i am not sure indeed that the curiosity i speak of has not at last in my breast yielded to another form of wondermenttruly to the rather rueful question of why we have so continued to concern ourselves and why the fond observer of the footprints of genius is likely so to continue with a body of discussion neither in itself and in its day nor in its preserved and attested records at all positively edifying the answer to such an inquiry would doubtless reward patience but i fear we can now glance at its possibilities only long enough to say that interesting personsso they be of a sufficiently approved and established interestrender in some degree interesting whatever happens to them and give it an importance even when very little else as in the case i refer to may have operated to give it a dignity which is where i leave the issue of further identifications  for the three sisters in the kindest way in the world had asked us if we already knew their sequestered home and whether in case we didnt we should be at all amused to see it my own acquaintance with them though not of recent origin had hitherto lacked this enhancement at which we both now grasped with the full instinct indescribable enough of what it was likely to give but how for that matter either can i find the right expression of what was to remain with us of this episode it is the fault of the sadeyed old witch of venice that she so easily puts more into things that can pass under the common names that do for them elsewhere too much for a rough sketch was to be seen and felt in the home of the three sisters and in the delightful and slightly pathetic deviation of their doing us so simply and freely the honours of it what was most immediately marked was their resigned cosmopolite state the effacement of old conventional lines by foreign contact and example by the action too of causes full of a special interest but not to be emphasised perhapsgranted indeed they be named at allwithout a certain sadness of sympathy if style in venice sits among ruins let us always lighten our tread when we pay her a visit  our steps were in fact i am happy to think almost soft enough for a deathchamber as we stood in the big vague sala of the three sisters spectators of their simplified state and their beautiful blighted rooms the memories the portraits the shrunken relics of nine doges if i wanted a first chapter it was here made to my hand the painter of life and manners as he glanced about could only sighas he so frequently has toover the vision of so much more truth than he can use what on earth is the need to invent in the midst of tragedy and comedy that never cease why with the subject itself all round so inimitable condemn the picture to the silliness of trying not to be aware of it the charming lonely girls carrying so simply their great name and fallen fortunes the despoiled decaduta house the unfailing italian grace the space so out of scale with actual needs the absence of books the presence of ennui the sense of the length of the hours and the shortness of everything elseall this was a matter not only for a second chapter and a third but for a whole volume a dénoûment and a sequel  this time unmistakably it was the lastwordsworths stately shade of that which once was great and it was almost as if our distinguished young friends had consented to pass away slowly in order to treat us to the vision ends are only ends in truth for the painter of pictures when they are more or less conscious and prolonged one of the sisters had been to london whence she had brought back the impression of having seen at the british museum a room exclusively filled with books and documents devoted to the commemoration of her family she must also then have encountered at the national gallery the exquisite specimen of an early venetian master in which one of her ancestors then head of the state kneels with so sweet a dignity before the virgin and child she was perhaps old enough none the less to have seen this precious work taken down from the wall of the room in which we sat andon terms so far too easycarried away for ever and not too young at all events to have been present now and then when her candid elders enlightened too late as to what their sacrifice might really have done for them looked at each other with the pale hush of the irreparable we let ourselves note that these were matters to put a great deal of old old history into sweet young venetian faces   iii  in italy if we come to that this particular appearance is far from being only in the streets where we are apt most to observe itin countenances caught as we pass and in the objects marked by the guidebooks with their respective stellar allowances it is behind the walls of the houses that old old history is thick and that the multiplied stars of baedeker might often best find their application the feast of st john the baptist is the feast of the year in florence and it seemed to me on that night that i could have scattered about me a handful of these signs i had the pleasure of spending a couple of hours on a signal high terrace that overlooks the arno as well as in the galleries that open out to it where i met more than ever the pleasant curious question of the disparity between the old conditions and the new manners make our manners we moderns as good as we can there is still no getting over it that they are not good enough for many of the great places this was one of those scenes and its greatness came out to the full into the hot florentine evening in which the pink and golden fires of the pyrotechnics arranged on ponte carrajathe occasion of our assemblylighted up the large issue the good people beneath were a huge hot gentle happy family the fireworks on the bridge kindling river as well as sky were delicate and charming the terrace connected the two wings that give bravery to the front of the palace and the closehung pictures in the rooms open in a long series offered to a lover of quiet perambulation an alternative hard to resist  wherever he stoodon the broad loggia in the cluster of company among bland ejaculations and liquefied ices or in the presence of the mixed masters that led him from wall to wall such a seeker for the spirit of each occasion could only turn it over that in the first place this was an intenser finer little florence than ever and that in the second the testimony was again wonderful to former fashions and ideas what did they do in the other time the time of so much smaller a society smaller and fewer fortunes more taste perhaps as to some particulars but fewer tastes at any rate and fewer habits and wantswhat did they do with chambers so multitudinous and so vast put their state at its highestand we know of many ways in which it must have broken downhow did they live in them without the aid of variety how did they in minor communities in which every one knew every one and every ones impression and effect had been long as we say discounted find representation and emulation sufficiently amusing much of the charm of thinking of it however is doubtless that we are not able to say this leaves us with the conviction that does them most honour the old generations built and arranged greatly for the simple reason that they liked it and they could bore themselvesto say nothing of each other when it came to thatbetter in noble conditions than in mean ones  it was not i must add of the faraway florentine age that i most thought but of periods more recent and of which the sound and beautiful house more directly spoke if one had always been homesick for the arnoside of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries here was a chance and a better one than ever to taste again of the cup many of the picturesthere was a charming quarter of an hour when i had them to myselfwere bad enough to have passed for good in those delightful years shades of granddukes encompassed medukes of the pleasant later sort who werent really grand there was still the sense of having come too lateyet not too late after all for this glimpse and this dream my business was to people the placeits own business had never been to save us the trouble of understanding it and then the deepest spell of all was perhaps that just here i was supremely out of the way of the so terribly actual florentine question this as all the world knows is a battleground to day in many journals with all italy practically pulling on one side and all england america and germany pulling on the other i speak of course of the more or less articulate opinion the improvement the rectification of florence is in the air and the problem of the particular ways in which given such desperately delicate cases these matters should be understood the little treasurecity is if there ever was one a delicate case more delicate perhaps than any other in the world save that of our taking on ourselves to persuade the italians that they maynt do as they like with their own they so absolutely may that i profess i see no happy issue from the fight it will take more tact than our combined tactful genius may at all probably muster to convince them that their own is by an ingenious logic much rather ours it will take more subtlety still to muster for them that dazzling show of examples from which they may learn that what in general is ours shall appear to them as a rule a sacrifice to beauty and a triumph of taste the situation to the truly analytic mind offers in short to perfection all the elements of despair and i am afraid that if i hung back at the corsini palace to woo illusions and invoke the irrelevant it was because i could think in the conditions of no better way to meet the acute responsibility of the critic than just to shirk it  1899      casa alvisi   invited to introduce certain pages of cordial and faithful reminiscence from another hand 1  1 browning in venice being recollections of the late katharine de kay bronson with a prefatory note by h j cornhill magazine february 1902  in which a frankly predominant presence seems to live again i undertook that office with an interest inevitably somewhat sad so passed and gone today is so much of the life suggested those who fortunately knew mrs bronson will read into her notes still more of itmore of her subject more of herself too and of many thingsthan she gives and some may well even feel tempted to do for her what she has done here for her distinguished friend in venice during a long period for many pilgrims mrs arthur bronson originally of new york was so far as society hospitality a charming personal welcome were concerned almost in sole possession she had become there with time quite the prime representative of those private amenities which the anglosaxon abroad is apt to miss just in proportion as the place visited is publicly wonderful and in which he therefore finds a value twice as great as at home mrs bronson really earned in this way the gratitude of mingled generations and races she sat for twenty years at the wide mouth as it were of the grand canal holding out her hand with endless goodnature patience charity to all decently accredited petitioners the incessant troop of those either bewilderedly making or fondly renewing acquaintance with the dazzling city  illustration casa alvisi venice  casa alvisi is directly opposite the high broadbased florid church of s maria della saluteso directly that from the balcony over the waterentrance your eye crossing the canal seems to find the keyhole of the great door right in a line with it and there was something in this position that for the time made all venicelovers think of the genial padrona as thus levying in the most convenient way the toll of curiosity and sympathy every one passed every one was seen to pass and few were those not seen to stop and to return the most generous of hostesses died a year ago at florence her house knows her no moreit had ceased to do so for some time before her death and the long pleased processionthe charmed arrivals the happy sojourns at anchor the reluctant departures that made ca alvisi as was currently said a social porto di mareis for remembrance and regret already a possession of ghosts so that on the spot at present the attention ruefully averts itself from the dear little old faded but once familiarly bright façade overtaken at last by the comparatively vulgar uses that are doing their best to paint out in venice right and left by staring signs and other vulgarities the immemorial note of distinction the house in a city of palaces was small but the tenant clung to her perfect her inclusive positionthe one right place that gave her a better command as it were than a better house obtained by a harder compromise not being fond moreover of spacious halls and massive treasures but of compact and familiar rooms in which her remarkable accumulation of minute and delicate venetian objects could show she adoredin the way of the venetian to which all her taste addressed itself the small the domestic and the exquisite so that she would have given a tintoretto or two i think without difficulty for a cabinet of tiny gilded glasses or a dinnerservice of the right old silver  the general receptacle of these multiplied treasures played at any rate through the years the part of a friendly privatebox at the constant operatic show a box at the best point of the best tier with the cushioned ledge of its front raking the whole scene and with its withdrawing rooms behind for more detached conversation for easywhen not indeed slightly difficult polyglot talk artful bibite artful cigarettes too straight from the hand of the hostess who could do all that belonged to a hostess place people in relation and keep them so take up and put down the topic cause delicate tobacco and little gilded glasses to circulate without ever leaving her sofa cushions or intermitting her goodnature she exercised in these conditions with never a block as we say in london in the traffic with never an admission an acceptance of the least social complication her positive genius for easy interest easy sympathy easy friendship it was as if at last she had taken the human race at large quite irrespective of geography for her neighbours with neighbourly relations as a matter of course these things on her part had at all events the greater appearance of ease from their having found to their purposeand as if the very air of venice produced thema cluster of forms so light and immediate so preestablished by picturesque custom the old bright tradition the wonderful venetian legend had appealed to her from the first closing round her house and her wellplashed watersteps where the waiting gondolas were thick quite as if actually the ghost of the defunct carnivalsince i have spoken of ghostsstill played some haunting part  let me add at the same time that mrs bronsons social facility which was really her great refuge from importunity a defence with serious thought and serious feeling quietly cherished behind it had its discriminations as well as its inveteracies and that the most marked of all these perhaps was her attachment to robert browning nothing in all her beneficent life had probably made her happier than to have found herself able to minister each year with the returning autumn to his pleasure and comfort attached to ca alvisi on the land side is a somewhat melancholy old section of a giustiniani palace which she had annexed to her own premises mainly for the purpose of placing it in comfortable guise at the service of her friends she liked as she professed when they were the real thing to have them under her hand and here succeeded each other through the years the company of the privileged and the more closely domesticated who liked harmlessly to distinguish between themselves and outsiders among visitors partaking of this pleasant provision mr browning was of course easily first but i must leave her own pen to show him as her best years knew him the point was meanwhile that if her charity was great even for the outsider this was by reason of the inner essence of it her perfect tenderness for venice which she always recognised as a link that was the true principle of fusion the key to communication she communicated in proportionlittle or much measuring it as she felt people more responsive or less so and she expressed herself or in other words her full affection for the place only to those who had most of the same sentiment the rich and interesting form in which she found it in browning may well be imaginedtogether with the quite independent quantity of the genial at large that she also found but i am not sure that his favour was not primarily based on his paid tribute of such things as two in a gondola and a toccata of galuppi he had more ineffaceably than anyone recorded his initiation from of old  she was thus all round supremely faithful yet it was perhaps after all with the very small folk those to the manner born that she made the easiest terms she loved she had from the first enthusiastically adopted the engaging venetian people whose virtues she found touching and their infirmities but such as appeal mainly to the sense of humour and the love of anecdote and she befriended and admired she studied and spoiled them there must have been a multitude of whom it would scarce be too much to say that her long residence among them was their settled golden age when i consider that they have lost her now i fairly wonder to what shifts they have been put and how long they may not have to wait for such another messenger of providence she cultivated their dialect she renewed their boats she piously relightedat the top of the tidewashed pali of traghetto or lagoonthe neglected lamp of the tutelary madonnetta she took cognisance of the wives the children the accidents the troubles as to which she became perceptibly the most prompt the established remedy on lines where the amusement was happily less onesided she put together in dialect many short comedies dramatic proverbs which with one of her drawingrooms permanently arranged as a charming diminutive theatre she caused to be performed by the young persons of her circleoften when the case lent itself by the wonderful small offspring of humbler friends children of the venetian lower class whose aptitude teachability drollery were her constant delight it was certainly true that an impression of venice as humanly sweet might easily found itself on the frankness and quickness and amiability of these little people they were at least so much to the good for the philosophy of their patroness was as venetian as everything else helping her to accept experience without bitterness and to remain fresh even in the fatigue which finally overtook her for pleasant surprises and proved sincerities she was herself sincere to the last for the place of her predilection inasmuch as though she had arranged herself in the later timeand largely for the love of pippa passesan alternative refuge at asolo she absented herself from venice with continuity only under coercion of illness  at asolo periodically the link with browning was more confirmed than weakened and there in old venetian territory and with the invasion of visitors comparatively checked her preferentially small house became again a setting for the pleasure of talk and the sense of italy it contained again its own small treasures all in the pleasant key of the homelier venetian spirit the plain beneath it stretched away like a purple sea from the lower cliffs of the hills and the white campanili of the villages as one was perpetually saying showed on the expanse like scattered sails of ships the rumbling carriage the old time rattling redvelveted carriage of provincial rural italy delightful and quaint did the office of the gondola to bassano to treviso to highwalled castelfranco all pink and gold the home of the great giorgione here also memories cluster but it is in venice again that her vanished presence is most felt for there in the real or certainly the finer the more sifted cosmopolis it falls into its place among the others evoked those of the past seekers of poetry and dispensers of romance it is a fact that almost every one interesting appealing melancholy memorable odd seems at one time or another after many days and much life to have gravitated to venice by a happy instinct settling in it and treating it cherishing it as a sort of repository of consolations all of which today for the conscious mind is mixed with its air and constitutes its unwritten history the deposed the defeated the disenchanted the wounded or even only the bored have seemed to find there something that no other place could give but such people came for themselves as we seem to see themonly with the egotism of their grievances and the vanity of their hopes mrs bronsons case was beautifully differentshe had come altogether for others      from chambÉry to milan   your truly sentimental tourist will never take it from any occasion that there is absolutely nothing for him and it was at chambérybut four hours from genevathat i accepted the situation and decided there might be mysterious delights in entering italy by a whizz through an eightmile tunnel even as a bullet through the bore of a gun i found my reward in the savoyard landscape which greets you betimes with the smile of anticipation if it is not so italian as italy it is at least more italian than anything but italymore italian too i should think than can seem natural and proper to the swarming redlegged soldiery who so publicly proclaim it of the empire of m thiers the light and the complexion of things had to my eyes not a little of that mollified depth last loved by them rather further on it was simply perhaps that the weather was hot and the mountains drowsing in that iridescent haze that i have seen nearer home than at chambéry but the vegetation assuredly had an all but transalpine twist and curl and the classic wayside tangle of corn and vines left nothing to be desired in the line of careless grace chambéry as a town however constitutes no foretaste of the monumental cities there is shabbiness and shabbiness the fond critic of such things will tell you and that of the ancient capital of savoy lacks style i found a better pastime however than strolling through the dark dull streets in quest of effects that were not forthcoming the first urchin you meet will show you the way to les charmettes and the maison jeanjacques a very pleasant way it becomes as soon as it leaves the towna winding climbing byroad bordered with such a tall and sturdy hedge as to give it the air of an english laneif you can fancy an english lane introducing you to the haunts of a madame de warens  the house that formerly sheltered this ladys singular ménage stands on a hillside above the road which a rapid path connects with the little grassgrown terrace before it it is a small shabby homely dwelling with a certain reputable solidity however and more of internal spaciousness than of outside promise the place is shown by an elderly competent dame who points out the very few surviving objects which you may touch with the reflectioncomplacent in whatsoever degree suits you that they have known the familiarity of rousseaus hand it was presumably a meagrelyappointed house and i wondered that on such scanty features so much expression should linger but the structure has an ancient ponderosity and the dust of the eighteenth century seems to lie on its wormeaten floors to cling to the faded old papiers à ramages on the walls and to lodge in the crevices of the brown wooden ceilings madame de warenss bed remains with the narrow couch of jeanjacques as well his little warped and cracked yellow spinet and a battered turnipshaped silver timepiece engraved with its masters nameits primitive tick as extinct as his passionate heartbeats it cost me i confess a somewhat pitying acceleration of my own to see this intimately personal relic of the genius locifor it had dwelt in his waistcoat pocket than which there is hardly a material point in space nearer to a mans consciousnesstossed so the dogseared visitors record or livre de cuisine recently denounced by madame george sand in fact the place generally in so far as some faint ghostly presence of its famous inmates seems to linger there is by no means exhilarating coppet and ferney tell if not of pure happiness at least of prosperity and honour wealth and success but les charmettes is haunted by ghosts unclean and forlorn the place tells of poverty perversity distress a good deal of clever modern talent in france has been employed in touching up the episode of which it was the scene and tricking it out in idyllic loveknots but as i stood on the charming terrace i have mentioneda little jewel of a terrace with grassy flags and a mossy parapet and an admirable view of great swelling violet hillsstood there reminded how much sweeter nature is than man the story looked rather wan and unlovely beneath these literary decorations and i could pay it no livelier homage than is implied in perfect pity hero and heroine have become too much creatures of history to take up attitudes as part of any poetry but not to moralise too sternly for a tourist between trains i should add that as an illustration to be inserted mentally in the text of the confessions a glimpse of les charmettes is pleasant enough it completes the rare charm of good autobiography to behold with ones eyes the faded and battered background of the story and rousseaus narrative is so incomparably vivid and forcible that the sordid little house at chambéry seems of a hardly deeper shade of reality than so many other passages of his projected truth  if i spent an hour at les charmettes fumbling thus helplessly with the past i recognised on the morrow how strongly the mont cenis tunnel smells of the time to come as i passed along the saintgothard highway a couple of months since i perceived half up the swiss ascent a group of navvies at work in a gorge beneath the road they had laid bare a broad surface of granite and had punched in the centre of it a round black cavity of about the dimensions as it seemed to me of a soupplate this was to attain its perfect development some eight years hence the mont cenis may therefore be held to have set a fashion which will be followed till the highest himalaya is but the ornamental apex or snowcapped gabletip of some resounding fuliginous corridor the tunnel differs but in length from other tunnels you spend half an hour in it but you whirl out into the blest peninsula and as you look back seem to see the mighty mass shrug its shoulders over the line the mere turn of a dreaming giant in his sleep the tunnel is certainly not a poetic object out there is no perfection without its beauty and as you measure the long rugged outline of the pyramid of which it forms the base you accept it as the perfection of a short cut twentyfour hours from paris to turin is speed for the timesspeed which may content us at any rate until expansive berlin has succeeded in placing itself at thirtysix from milan  to enter turin then of a lovely august afternoon was to find a city of arcades of pink and yellow stucco of innumerable cafes of bluelegged officers of ladies draped in the northitalian mantilla an old friend of italy coming back to her finds an easy waking for dormant memories every object is a reminder and every reminder a thrill half an hour after my arrival as i stood at my window which overhung the great square i found the scene within and without a rough epitome of every pleasure and every impression i had formerly gathered from italy the balcony and the venetianblind the cool floor of speckled concrete the lavish delusions of frescoed wall and ceiling the broad divan framed for the noonday siesta the massive medieval castello in midpiazza with its shabby rear and its pompous palladian front the brick campaniles beyond the milder yellower light the range of colour the suggestion of sound later beneath the arcades i found many an old acquaintance beautiful officers resplendent slowstrolling contemplative of female beauty civil and peaceful dandies hardly less gorgeous with that religious faith in moustache and shirtfront which distinguishes the belle jeunesse of italy ladies with heads artfully shawled in spanishlooking lace but with too little artor too much nature at leastin the region of the bodice well conditioned young abbati with neatly drawn stockings these indeed are not objects of firstrate interest and with such turin is rather meagrely furnished it has no architecture no churches no monuments no romantic streetscenery it has the great votive temple of the superga which stands on a high hilltop above the city gazing across at monte rosa and lifting its own fine dome against the sky with no contemptible art but when you have seen the superga from the quay beside the po a skein of a few yellow threads in august despite its frequent habit of rising high and running wild and said to yourself that in architecture position is half the battle you have nothing left to visit but the museum of pictures the turin gallery which is large and well arranged is the fortunate owner of three or four masterpieces a couple of magnificent vandycks and a couple of paul veroneses the latter a queen of sheba and a feast of the house of levithe usual splendid combination of brocades grandees and marble colonnades dividing those skies de turquoise malade to which théophile gautier is fond of alluding the veroneses are fine but with venice in prospect the traveller feels at liberty to keep his best attention in reserve if however he has the proper relish for vandyck let him linger long and fondly here for that admiration will never be more potently stirred than by the adorable group of the three little royal highnesses sons and the daughter of charles i all the purity of childhood is here and all its soft solidity of structure rounded tenderly beneath the spangled satin and contrasted charmingly with the pompous rigidity clad respectively in crimson white and blue these small scions stand up in their ruffs and fardingales in dimpled serenity squaring their infantine stomachers at the spectator with an innocence a dignity a delightful grotesqueness which make the picture a thing of close truth as well as of fine decorum you might kiss their hands but you certainly would think twice before pinching their cheeksprovocative as they are of this tribute of admirationand would altogether lack presumption to lift them off the ground or the higher level or dais on which they stand so sturdily planted by right of birth there is something inimitable in the paternal gallantry with which the painter has touched off the young lady she was a princess yet she was a baby and he has contrived we let ourselves fancy to interweave an intimation that she was a creature whom in her teens the lucklessly smitteneven as he was prematurelymust vainly sigh for though the work is a masterpiece of execution its merits under this head may be emulated at a distance the lovely modulations of colour in the three contrasted and harmonised little satin petticoats the solidity of the little heads in spite of all their prettiness the happy unexaggerated squareness and maturity of pose are severally points to study to imitate and to reproduce with profit but the taste of such a consummate thing is its great secret as well as its great merita taste which seems one of the lost instincts of mankind go and enjoy this supreme expression of vandycks fine sense and admit that never was a politer production  milan speaks to us of a burden of felt life of which turin is innocent but in its general aspect still lingers a northern reserve which makes the place rather perhaps the last of the prose capitals than the first of the poetic the long austrian occupation perhaps did something to germanise its physiognomy though indeed this is an indifferent explanation when one remembers how well temperamentally speaking italy held her own in venetia milan at any rate if not bristling with the æsthetic impulse opens to us frankly enough the thick volume of her past of that volume the cathedral is the fairest and fullest pagea structure not supremely interesting not logical not even to some minds commandingly beautiful but grandly curious and superbly rich i hope for my own part never to grow too particular to admire it if it had no other distinction it would still have that of impressive immeasurable achievement as i strolled beside its vast indented base one evening and felt it above me rear its grey mysteries into the starlight while the restless human tide on which i floated rose no higher than the first few layers of streetsoiled marble i was tempted to believe that beauty in great architecture is almost a secondary merit and that the main point is masssuch mass as may make it a supreme embodiment of vigorous effort viewed in this way a great building is the greatest conceivable work of art more than any other it represents difficulties mastered resources combined labour courage and patience and there are people who tell us that art has nothing to do with morality little enough doubtless when it is concerned even ever so little in painting the roof of milan cathedral within to represent carved stone work of this famous roof every one has heardhow good it is how bad how perfect a delusion how transparent an artifice it is the first thing your cicerone shows you on entering the church the occasionally accommodating artlover may accept it philosophically i think for the interior though admirably effective as a whole has no great sublimity nor even purity of pitch it is splendidly vast and dim the altarlamps twinkle afar through the incensethickened air like foglights at sea and the great columns rise straight to the roof which hardly curves to meet them with the girth and altitude of oaks of a thousand years but there is little refinement of designfew of those felicities of proportion which the eye caresses when it finds them very much as the memory retains and repeats some happy lines of poetry or some haunting musical phrase consistently brave none the less is the result produced and nothing braver than a certain exhibition that i privately enjoyed of the relics of st charles borromeus this holy man lies at his eternal rest in a small but gorgeous sepulchral chapel beneath the boundless pavement and before the high altar and for the modest sum of five francs you may have his shrivelled mortality unveiled and gaze at it with whatever reserves occur to you the catholic church never renounces a chance of the sublime for fear of a chance of the ridiculousespecially when the chance of the sublime may be the very excellent chance of five francs the performance in question of which the good san carlo paid in the first instance the cost was impressive certainly but as a monstrous matter or a grim comedy may still be the little sacristan having secured his audience whipped on a white tunic over his frock lighted a couple of extra candles and proceeded to remove from above the altar by means of a crank a sort of sliding shutter just as you may see a shopboy do of a morning at his masters window in this case too a large sheet of plate glass was uncovered and to form an idea of the étalage you must imagine that a jeweller for reasons of his own has struck an unnatural partnership with an undertaker the black mummified corpse of the saint is stretched out in a glass coffin clad in his mouldering canonicals mitred crosiered and gloved glittering with votive jewels it is an extraordinary mixture of death and life the desiccated clay the ashen rags the hideous little black mask and skull and the living glowing twinkling splendour of diamonds emeralds and sapphires the collection is really fine and many great historic names are attached to the different offerings whatever may be the better opinion as to the future of the church i cant help thinking she will make a figure in the world so long as she retains this great fund of precious properties this prodigious capital decoratively invested and scintillating throughout christendom at effectively scattered points you see i am forced to agree after all in spite of the sliding shutter and the profane swagger of the sacristan that a certain pastoral majesty saved the situation or at least made irony gape yet it was from a natural desire to breathe a sweeter air that i immediately afterwards undertook the interminable climb to the roof of the cathedral this is another world of wonders and one which enjoys due renown every square inch of wall on the winding stairways being bescribbled with a travellers name there is a great glare from the farstretching slopes of marble a confusion like the masts of a navy or the spears of an army of imagecapped pinnacles biting the impalpable blue and better than either the goodliest view of level lombardy sleeping in its rich transalpine light and resembling with its whitewalled dwellings and the spires on its horizon a vast green sea spotted with ships after two months of switzerland the lombard plain is a rich rest to the eye and the yellow liquid freeflowing lightas if on favoured italy the vessels of heaven were more widely openedhad for mine a charm which made me think of a great opaque mountain as a blasphemous invasion of the atmospheric spaces  illustration the simplon gate milan  i have mentioned the cathedral first but the prime treasure of milan at the present hour is the beautiful tragical leonardo the cathedral is good for another thousand years but we ask whether our children will find in the most majestic and most luckless of frescoes much more than the shadow of a shadow its fame has been for a century or two that as one may say of an illustrious invalid whom people visit to see how he lasts with leavetaking sighs and almost deathbed or tiptoe precautions the picture needs not another scar or stain now to be the saddest work of art in the world and battered defaced ruined as it is it remains one of the greatest we may really compare its anguish of decay to the slow conscious ebb of life in a human organism the production of the prodigy was a breath from the infinite and the painters conception not immeasurably less complex than the scheme say of his own mortal constitution there has been much talk lately of the irony of fate but i suspect fate was never more ironical than when she led the most scientific the most calculating of all painters to spend fifteen long years in building his goodly house upon the sand and yet after all may not the playing of that trick represent but a deeper wisdom since if the thing enjoyed the immortal health and bloom of a firstrate titian we should have lost one of the most pertinent lessons in the history of art we know it as hearsay but here is the plain proof that there is no limit to the amount of stuff an artist may put into his work every painter ought once in his life to stand before the cenacolo and decipher its moral mix with your colours and mess on your palette every particle of the very substance of your soul and this lest perchance your prepared surface shall play you a trick then and then only it will fight to the lastit will resist even in death raphael was a happier genius you look at his lovely marriage of the virgin at the brera beautiful as some first deep smile of conscious inspiration but to feel that he foresaw no complaint against fate and that he knew the world he wanted to know and charmed it into never giving him away but i have left no space to speak of the brera nor of that paradise of bookworms with an eye for their backgroundif such creatures existthe ambrosian library nor of that mighty basilica of st ambrose with its spacious atrium and its crudely solemn mosaics in which it is surely your own fault if you dont forget dr strauss and m renan and worship as grimly as a christian of the ninth century  it is part of the sordid prose of the mont cenis road that unlike those fine old unimproved passes the simplon the splügen andyet awhile longerthe saintgothard it denies you a glimpse of that paradise adorned by the four lakes even as that of uncommented scripture by the rivers of eden i made however an excursion to the lake of como which though brief lasted long enough to suggest to me that i too was a hero of romance with leisure for a loveaffair and not a hurrying tourist with a bradshaw in his pocket the lake of como has figured largely in novels of immoral tendencybeing commonly the spot to which inflamed young gentlemen invite the wives of other gentlemen to fly with them and ignore the restrictions of public opinion but even the lake of como has been revised and improved the fondest prejudices yield to time it gives one somehow a sense of an aspiringly high tone i should pay a poor compliment at least to the swarming inmates of the hotels which now alternate attractively by the waterside with villas old and new were i to read the appearances more cynically but if it is lost to florid fiction it still presents its blue bosom to most other refined uses and the unsophisticated tourist the american at least may do any amount of private romancing there the pretty hotel at cadenabbia offers him for instance in the most elegant and assured form the so often precarious adventure of what he calls at home summer board it is all so unreal so fictitious so elegant and idle so framed to undermine a rigid sense of the chief end of man not being to float for ever in an ornamental boat beneath an awning tasselled like a circushorse impelled by an affable giovanni or antonio from one stately stretch of lakelaved villa steps to another that departure seems as harsh and unnatural as the dreamdispelling note of some punctual voice at your bedside on a dusky winter morning yet i wondered for my own part where i had seen it all beforethe pinkwalled villas gleaming through their shrubberies of orange and oleander the mountains shimmering in the hazy light like so many breasts of doves the constant presence of the melodious italian voice where indeed but at the opera when the manager has been more than usually regardless of expense here in the foreground was the palace of the nefarious barytone with its banquetinghall opening as freely on the stage as a railway buffet on the platform beyond the delightful back scene with its operatic gamut of colouring in the middle the scarletsashed barcaiuoli grouped like a chorus hat in hand awaiting the conductors signal it was better even than being in a novel this being this fairly wallowing in a libretto      the old saintgothard leaves from a notebook   berne september 1873in berne again some eleven weeks after having left it in july i have never been in switzerland so late and i came hither innocently supposing the last cooks tourist to have paid out his last coupon and departed but i was lucky it seems to discover an empty cot in an attic and a very tight place at a table dhôte people are all flocking out of switzerland as in july they were flocking in and the main channels of egress are terribly choked i have been here several days watching them come and go it is like the marchpast of an army it gives one for an occasional change from darker thoughts a lively impression of the numbers of people now living and above all now moving at extreme ease in the world here is little switzerland disgorging its tens of thousands of honest folk chiefly english and rarely to judge by their faces and talk children of light in any eminent degree for whom snowpeaks and glaciers and passes and lakes and chalets and sunsets and a café complet including honey as the coupon says have become prime necessities for six weeks every year its not so long ago that lords and nabobs monopolised these pleasures but nowadays i a months tour in switzerland is no more a jeu de prince than a sunday excursion to watch this huge anglosaxon wave ebbing through berne suggests no doubt most fallaciously that the common lot of mankind isnt after all so very hard and that the masses have reached a high standard of comfort the view of the oberland chain as you see it from the garden of the hotel really butters ones bread most handsomely and here are i dont know how many hundred cooks tourists a day looking at it through the smoke of their pipes is it really the masses however that i see every day at the table dhôte they have rather too few hs to the dozen but their goodnature is great some people complain that they vulgarise switzerland but as far as i am concerned i freely give it up to them and offer them a personal welcome and take a peculiar satisfaction in seeing them here switzerland is a show countryi am more and more struck with the bearings of that truth and its use in the world is to reassure persons of a benevolent imagination when they begin to wish for the drudging millions a greater supply of elevating amusement here is amusement for a thousand years and as elevating certainly as mountains three miles high can make it i expect to live to see the summit of monte rosa heated by steamtubes and adorned with a hotel setting three tables dhôte a day  illustration the clock tower berne  i have been walking about the arcades which used to bestow a grateful shade in july but which seem rather dusky and chilly in these shortening autumn days i am struck with the way the english always speak of themwith a shudder as gloomy as dirty as evilsmelling as suffocating as freezing as anything and everything but admirably picturesque i take us americans for the only people who in travelling judge things on the first impulsewhen we do judge them at allnot from the standpoint of simple comfort most of us strolling forth into these bustling basements are i imagine too much amused too much diverted from the sense of an alienable right to public ease to be conscious of heat or cold of thick air or even of the universal smell of strong charcuterie if the visible romantic were banished from the face of the earth i am sure the idea of it would still survive in some typical american heart  lucerne september berne i find has been filling with tourists at the expense of lucerne which i have been having almost to myself there are six people at the table dhôte the excellent dinner denotes on the part of the chef the easy leisure in which true artists love to work the waiters have nothing to do but lounge about the hall and chink in their pockets the fees of the past season the day has been lovely in itself and pervaded to my sense by the gentle glow of a natural satisfaction at my finding myself again on the threshold of italy i am lodged en prince in a room with a balcony hanging over the lakea balcony on which i spent a long time this morning at dawn thanking the mountaintops from the depths of a landscapelovers heart for their promise of superbly fair weather there were a great many mountaintops to thank for the crags and peaks and pinnacles tumbled away through the morning mist in an endless confusion of grandeur i have been all day in better humour with lucerne than ever beforea forecast reflection of italian moods if switzerland as i wrote the other day is so furiously a showplace lucerne is certainly one of the biggest booths at the fair the little quay under the trees squeezed in between the decks of the steamboats and the doors of the hotels is a terrible medley of saxon dialectsa jumble of pilgrims in all the phases of devotion equipped with book and staff alpenstock and baedeker there are so many hotels and trinketshops so many omnibuses and steamers so many saint gothard vetturini so many ragged urchins poking photographs minerals and lucernese english at you that you feel as if lake and mountains themselves in all their loveliness were but a part of the enterprise of landlords and pedlars and half expect to see the righi and pilatus and the fine weather figure as items on your hotelbill between the bougie and the siphon nature herself assists you to this conceit there is something so operatic and suggestive of footlights and sceneshifters in the view on which lucerne looks out you are one of five thousandfifty thousandaccommodated spectators you have taken your seasonticket and there is a responsible impresario somewhere behind the scenes there is such a luxury of beauty in the prospectsuch a redundancy of composition and effectso many more peaks and pinnacles than are needed to make one heart happy or regale the vision of one quiet observer that you finally accept the little babel on the quay and the looming masses in the clouds as equal parts of a perfect system and feel as if the mountains had been waiting so many ages for the hotels to come and balance the colossal group that they show a right after all to have them big and numerous the sceneshifters have been at work all day long composing and discomposing the beautiful background of the prospectmassing the clouds and scattering the light effacing and reviving making play with their wonderful machinery of mist and haze the mountains rise one behind the other in an enchanting gradation of distances and of melting blues and greys you think each successive tone the loveliest and haziest possible till you see another loom dimly behind it i couldnt enjoy even the swiss times over my breakfast till i had marched forth to the office of the saint gothard service of coaches and demanded the banquette for to morrow the one place at the disposal of the office was taken but i might possibly mentendre with the conductor for his own seatthe conductor being generally visible in the intervals of business at the postoffice to the postoffice after breakfast i repaired over the fine new bridge which now spans the green reuss and gives such a woeful air of countrycousinship to the crooked old wooden structure which did sole service when i was here four years ago the old bridge is covered with a running hood of shingles and adorned with a series of very quaint and vivid little paintings of the dance of death quite in the holbein manner the new sends up a painful glare from its white limestone and is ornamented with candelabra in a meretricious imitation of platinum as an almost professional cherisher of the quaint i ought to have chosen to return at least by the dark and narrow way but mark how luxury unmans us i was already demoralised i crossed the threshold of the timbered portal took a few steps and retreated it smelt badly so i marched back counting the lamps in their fine falsity but the other the crooked and covered way smelt very badly indeed and no good american is without a fund of accumulated sensibility to the odour of stale timber  meanwhile i had spent an hour in the great yard of the postoffice waiting for my conductor to turn up and seeing the yellow mallespostes pushed to and fro at last being told my man was at my service i was brought to speech of a huge jovial bearded delightful italian clad in the blue coat and waistcoat with close round silver buttons which are a heritage of the old postilions no it was not he it was a friend of his and finally the friend was produced en costume de ville but equally jovialand italian enougha brave lucernese who had spent half of his life between bellinzona and camerlata for ten francs this worthy mans perch behind the luggage was made mine as far as bellinzona and we separated with reciprocal wishes for good weather on the morrow tomorrow is so manifestly determined to be as fine as any other 30th of september since the weather became on this planet a topic of conversation that i have had nothing to do but stroll about lucerne staring loafing and vaguely intent on regarding the fact that whatever happens my place is paid to milan i loafed into the immense new hotel national and read the new york tribune on a blue satin divan after which i was rather surprised on coming out to find myself staring at a green swiss lake and not at the broadway omnibuses the hotel national is adorned with a perfectly appointed broadway barone of the prohibited ones seeking hospitality in foreign lands after the manner of an oldfashioned french or italian refugee  milan octobermy journey hither was such a pleasant piece of travellers luck that i feel a delicacy for taking it to pieces to see what it was made of do what we will however there remains in all deeply agreeable impressions a charming something we cant analyse i found it agreeable even given the rest of my case to turn out of bed at lucerne by four oclock into the chilly autumn darkness the thickstarred sky was cloudless and there was as yet no flush of dawn but the lake was wrapped in a ghostly white mist which crept halfway up the mountains and made them look as if they too had been lying down for the night and were casting away the vaporous tissues of their bedclothes into this fantastic fog the little steamer went creaking away and i hung about the deck with the two or three travellers who had known better than to believe it would save them francs or midnight sighsover those debts you pay with your personto go and wait for the diligence at the poste at fliielen or yet at the guillaume tell the dawn came sailing up over the mountaintops flushed but unperturbed and blew out the little stars and then the big ones as a thrifty matron after a party blows out her candles and lamps the mist went melting and wandering away into the duskier hollows and recesses of the mountains and the summits defined their profiles against the cool soft light  at flüelen before the landing the big yellow coaches were actively making themselves bigger and piling up boxes and bags on their roofs in a way to turn nervous peoples thoughts to the sharp corners of the downward twists of the great road i climbed into my own banquette and stood eating peacheshalfadozen women were hawking them about under the horses legswith an air of security that might have been offensive to the people scrambling and protesting below between coupé and intérieur they were all english and all had false alarms about the claim of somebody else to their place the place for which they produced their ticket with a declaration in three or four different tongues of the inalienable right to it given them by the expenditure of british gold they were all serenely confuted by the stout purplefaced manybuttoned conductors patted on the backs assured that their bathtubs had every advantage of position on the top and stowed away according to their dues when once one has fairly started on a journey and has but to go and go by the impetus received it is surprising what entertainment one finds in very small things we surrender to the gaping travellers mood which surely isnt the unwisest the heart knows i dont envy people at any rate who have outlived or outworn the simple sweetness of feeling settled to go somewhere with bag and umbrella if we are settled on the top of a coach and the somewhere contains an element of the new and strange the case is at its best in this matter wise people are content to become children again we dont turn about on our knees to look out of the omnibuswindow but we indulge in very much the same roundeyed contemplation of accessible objects responsibility is left at home or at the worst packed away in the valise relegated to quite another part of the diligence with the clean shirts and the writingcase i sucked in the gladness of gaping for this occasion with the somewhat acrid juice of my indifferent peaches it made me think them very good this was the first of a series of kindly services it rendered me it made me agree next as we started that the gentleman at the booking office at lucerne had but played a harmless joke when he told me the regular seat in the banquette was taken no one appeared to claim it so the conductor and i reversed positions and i found him quite as conversible as the usual anglosaxon  he was trolling snatches of melody and showing his great yellow teeth in a jovial grin all the way to bellinzonaand this in face of the sombre fact that the saintgothard tunnel is scraping away into the mountain all the while under his nose and numbering the days of the manybuttoned brotherhood but he hopes for long services sake to be taken into the employ of the railway he at least is no cherisher of quaintness and has no romantic perversity i found the railway coming on however in a manner very shocking to mine about an hour short of andermatt they have pierced a huge black cavity in the mountain around which has grown up a swarming digging hammering smokecompelling colony there are great barracks with tall chimneys down in the gorge that bristled the other day but with natural graces and a wonderful increase of wineshops in the little village of göschenen above along the breast of the mountain beside the road come wandering several miles of very handsome iron pipes of a stupendous girtha conduit for the waterpower with which some of the machinery is worked it lies at its mighty length among the rocks like an immense black serpent and serves as a mere detail to give one the measure of the central enterprise when at the end of our long days journey well down in warm italy we came upon the other aperture of the tunnel i could but uncap with a grim reverence truly nature is great but she seems to me to stand in very much the shoes of my poor friend the conductor she is being superseded at her strongest points successively and nothing remains but for her to take humble service with her master if she can hear herself think amid that din of blasting and hammering she must be reckoning up the years to elapse before the cleverest of ober ingénieurs decides that mountains are mere obstructive matter and has the jungfrau melted down and the residuum carried away in balloons and dumped upon another planet  the devils bridge with the same failing apparently as the good homer was decidedly nodding the volume of water in the torrent was shrunken and i missed the thunderous uproar and farleaping spray that have kept up a miniature tempest in the neighbourhood on my other passages it suddenly occurs to me that the fault is not in the good homers inspiration but simply in the big black pipes abovementioned they dip into the rushing stream higher up presumably and pervert its fine frenzy to their prosaic uses there could hardly be a more vivid reminder of the standing quarrel between use and beauty and of the hard time poor beauty is having i looked wistfully as we rattled into dreary andermatt at the great white zigzags of the oberalp road which climbed away to the left even on ones way to italy one may spare a throb of desire for the beautiful vision of the castled grisons dear to me the memory of my days drive last summer through that long blue avenue of mountains to queer little mouldering ilanz visited before supper in the ghostly dusk at andermatt a sign over a little black doorway flanked by two dung hills seemed to me tolerably comical mineraux quadrupedes oiseaux oeufs tableaux antiques we bundled in to dinner and the american gentleman in the banquette made the acquaintance of the irish lady in the coupé who talked of the weather as foine and wore a persian scarf twisted about her head at the other end of the table sat an englishman out of the intérieur who bore an extraordinary resemblance to the portraits of edward vis and marys reigns he walking a convincing holbein the impression was of value to a cherisher of quaintness and he must have wonderednot knowing me for such a characterwhy i stared at him it wasnt him i was staring at but some handsome seymour or dudley or digby with a ruff and a round cap and plume  from andermatt through its high cold sunny valley we passed into rugged little hospenthal and then up the last stages of the ascent from here the road was all new to me among the summits of the various alpine passes there is little to choose you wind and double slowly into keener cold and deeper stillness you put on your overcoat and turn up the collar you count the nestling snowpatches and then you cease to count them you pause as you trudge before the lumbering coach and listen to the lastheard cowbell tinkling away below you in kindlier herbage the sky was tremendously blue and the little stunted bushes on the snow streaked slopes were all dyed with autumnal purples and crimsons it was a great display of colour purple and crimson too though not so fine were the faces thrust out at us from the greasy little double casements of a barrack beside the road where the horses paused before the last pull there was one little girl in particular beginning to lisser her hair as civilisation approached in a manner not to be described with her poor little blueblack hands at the summit are the two usual grim little stone taverns the steelblue tarn the snowwhite peaks the pause in the cold sunshine then we begin to rattle down with two horses in five minutes we are swinging along the famous zigzags engineer driver horsesits very handsomely done by all of them the road curves and curls and twists and plunges like the tail of a kite sitting perched in the banquette you see it making below you and in midair certain bold gyrations which bring you as near as possible short of the actual experience to the philosophy of that immortal irishman who wished that his fall from the housetop would only last but the zigzags last no more than paddys fall and in due time we were all coming to our senses over cafe au lait in the little inn at faido after faido the valley plunging deeper began to take thick afternoon shadows from the hills and at airolo we were fairly in the twilight but the pink and yellow houses shimmered through the gentle gloom and italy began in broken syllables to whisper that she was at hand for the rest of the way to bellinzona her voice was muffled in the grey of evening and i was half vexed to lose the charming sight of the changing vegetation but only half vexed for the moon was climbing all the while nearer the edge of the crags that overshadowed us and a thin magical light came trickling down into the winding murmuring gorges it was a most enchanting business the chestnuttrees loomed up with double their daylight stature the vines began to swing their low festoons like nets to trip up the fairies at last the ruined towers of bellinzona stood gleaming in the moonshine and we rattled into the great postyard it was eleven oclock and i had risen at four moonshine apart i wasnt sorry  all that was very well but the drive next day from bellinzona to como is to my mind what gives its supreme beauty to this great pass one cant describe the beauty of the italian lakes nor would one try if one could the floweriest rhetoric can recall it only as a picture on a fireboard recalls a claude but it lay spread before me for a whole perfect day in the long gleam of the major from whose head the diligence swerves away and begins to climb the bosky hills that divide it from lugano in the shimmering melting azure of the southern slopes and masses in the luxurious tangle of nature and the familiar amenity of man in the lawnlike inclinations where the great grouped chestnuts make so cool a shadow in so warm a light in the rusty vineyards the littered cornfields and the tawdry wayside shrines but most of all its the deep yellow light that enchants you and tells you where you are see it come filtering down through a vinecovered trellis on the red handkerchief with which a ragged contadina has bound her hair and all the magic of italy to the eye makes an aureole about the poor girls head look at a brownbreasted reaper eating his chunk of black bread under a spreading chestnut nowhere is shadow so charming nowhere is colour so charged nowhere has accident such grace the whole drive to lugano was one long loveliness and the town itself is admirably italian there was a great unlading of the coach during which i wandered under certain brown old arcades and bought for six sous from a young woman in a gold necklace a hatful of peaches and figs when i came back i found the young man holding open the door of the second diligence which had lately come up and beckoning to me with a despairing smile the young man i must note was the most amiable of ticinese though he wore no buttons he was attached to the diligence in some amateurish capacity and had an eye to the mailbags and other valuables in the boot i grumbled at berne over the want of soft curves in the swiss temperament but the children of the tangled tessin are cast in the italian mould my friend had as many quips and cranks as a neapolitan we walked together for an hour under the chestnuts while the coach was plodding up from bellinzona and he never stopped singing till we reached a little winehouse where he got his mouth full of bread and cheese i looked into his open door a la sterne and saw the young woman sitting rigid and grim staring over his head and with a great pile of bread and butter in her lap he had only informed her most politely that she was to be transferred to another diligence and must do him the favour to descend but she evidently knew of but one way for a respectable young insulary of her sex to receive the politeness of a foreign adventurer guilty of an eye betraying latent pleasantry heaven only knew what he was saying i told her and she gathered up her parcels and emerged a part of the days great pleasure perhaps was my grave sense of being an instrument in the hands of the powers toward the safe consignment of this young woman and her boxes when once you have really bent to the helpless you are caught there is no such steel trap and it holds you fast my rather grim abigail was a neophyte in foreign travel though doubtless cunning enough at her trade which i inferred to be that of making up those prodigious chignons worn mainly by english ladies her mistress had gone on a mule over the mountains to cadenabbia and she herself was coming up with the wardrobe two big boxes and a bathtub i had played my part under the powers at bellinzona and had interposed between the poor girls frightened english and the dreadful ticinese french of the functionaries in the postyard at the customhouse on the italian frontier i was of peculiar service there was a kind of fateful fascination in it the wardrobe was voluminous i exchanged a paternal glance with my charge as the douanier plunged his brown fists into it who was the lady at cadenabbia what was she to me or i to her she wouldnt know when she rustled down to dinner next day that it was i who had guided the frail skiff of her public basis of vanity to port so unseen but not unfelt do we cross each others orbits the skiff however may have foundered that evening in sight of land i disengaged the young woman from among her fellowtravellers and placed her boxes on a handcart in the picturesque streets of como within a stones throw of that lovely striped and toned cathedral which has the facade of cameo medallions i could only make the facchino swear to take her to the steamboat he too was a jovial dog but i hope he was polite with precautions  1873      italy revisited   i  i waited in paris until after the elections for the new chamber they took place on the 14th of october as only after one had learned that the famous attempt of marshal macmahon and his ministers to drive the french nation to the polls like a flock of huddling sheep each with the white ticket of an official candidate round his neck had not achieved the success which the energy of the process might have promisedonly then it was possible to draw a long breath and deprive the republican party of such support as might have been conveyed in ones sympathetic presence seriously speaking too the weather had been enchantingthere were italian fancies to be gathered without leaving the banks of the seine day after day the air was filled with golden light and even those chalkish vistas of the parisian beaux quartiers assumed the iridescent tints of autumn autumn weather in europe is often such a very sorry affair that a fairminded american will have it on his conscience to call attention to a rainless and radiant october  the echoes of the electoral strife kept me company for a while after starting upon that abbreviated journey to turin which as you leave paris at night in a train unprovided with encouragements to slumber is a singular mixture of the odious and the charming the charming indeed i think prevails for the dark half of the journey is the least interesting the morning light ushers you into the romantic gorges of the jura and after a big bowl of cafe au lait at culoz you may compose yourself comfortably for the climax of your spectacle the day before leaving paris i met a french friend who had just returned from a visit to a tuscan countryseat where he had been watching the vintage italy he said is more lovely than words can tell and france steeped in this electoral turmoil seems no better than a beargarden the part of the beargarden through which you travel as you approach the mont cenis seemed to me that day very beautiful the autumn colouring thanks to the absence of rain had been vivid and crisp and the vines that swung their low garlands between the mulberries round about chambery looked like long festoons of coral and amber the frontier station of modane on the further side of the mont cenis tunnel is a very illregulated place but even the most irritable of tourists meeting it on his way southward will be disposed to consider it goodnaturedly there is far too much bustling and scrambling and the facilities afforded you for the obligatory process of ripping open your luggage before the officers of the italian customhouse are much scantier than should be but for myself there is something that deprecates irritation in the shabby green and grey uniforms of all the italian officials who stand loafing about and watching the northern invaders scramble back into marching order wearing an administrative uniform doesnt necessarily spoil a mans temper as in france one is sometimes led to believe for these excellent underpaid italians carry theirs as lightly as possible and their answers to your inquiries dont in the least bristle with rapiers buttons and cockades after leaving modane you slide straight downhill into the italy of your desire from which point the road edges after the grand manner along those it precipices that stand shoulder to shoulder in a prodigious perpendicular file till they finally admit you to a distant glimpse he ancient capital of piedmont  turin is no city of a name to conjure with and i pay an extravagant tribute to subjective emotion in speaking of it as ancient if the place is less bravely peninsular than florence and rome at least it is more in the scenic tradition than new york paris and while i paced the great arcades and looked at the fourthrate shop windows i didnt scruple to cultivate a shameless optimism relatively speaking turin touches a chord but there is after all no reason in a large collection of shabbilystuccoed houses disposed in a rigidly rectangular manner for passing a day of deep still gaiety the only reason i am afraid is the old superstition of italythat property in the very look of the written word the evocation of a myriad images that makes any lover of the arts take italian satisfactions on easier terms than any others the written word stands for something that eternally tricks us we juggle to our credulity even with such inferior apparatus as is offered to our hand at turin i roamed all the morning under the tall porticoes thinking it sufficient joy to take note of the soft warm air of that local colour of things that is at once so broken and so harmonious and of the comings and goings the physiognomy and manners of the excellent turinese i had opened the old book again the old charm was in the style i was in a more delightful world i saw nothing surpassingly beautiful or curious but your true taster of the most seasoned of dishes finds wellnigh the whole mixture in any mouthful above all on the threshold of italy he knows again the solid and perfectly definable pleasure of finding himself among the traditions of the grand style in architecture it must be said that we have still to go there to recover the sense of the domiciliary mass in northern cities there are beautiful houses picturesque and curious houses sculptured gables that hang over the street charming bay windows hooded doorways elegant proportions a profusion of delicate ornament but a good specimen of an old italian palazzo has a nobleness that is all its own we laugh at italian palaces at their peeling paint their nudity their dreariness but they have the great palatial qualityelevation and extent they make of smaller things the apparent abode of pigmies they round their great arches and interspace their huge windows with a proud indifference to the cost of materials these grand proportionsthe colossal basements the doorways that seem meant for cathedrals the far away cornicesimpart by contrast a humble and bourgeois expression to interiors founded on the sacrifice of the whole to the part and in which the air of grandeur depends largely on the help of the upholsterer at turin my first feeling was really one of renewed shame for our meaner architectural manners if the italians at bottom despise the rest of mankind and regard them as barbarians disinherited of the tradition of form the idea proceeds largely no doubt from our living in comparative molehills they alone were really to build their civilisation  illustration under the arcades turin  an impression which on coming back to italy i find even stronger than when it was first received is that of the contrast between the fecundity of the great artistic period and the vulgarity there of the genius of today the first few hours spent on italian soil are sufficient to renew it and the question i allude to is historically speaking one of the oddest that the people who but three hundred years ago had the best taste in the world should now have the worst that having produced the noblest loveliest costliest works they should now be given up to the manufacture of objects at once ugly and paltry that the race of which michael angelo and raphael leonardo and titian were characteristic should have no other title to distinction than thirdrate genre pictures and catchpenny statues all this is a frequent perplexity to the observer of actual italian life the flower of great art in these latter years ceased to bloom very powerfully anywhere but nowhere does it seem so drooping and withered as in the shadow of the immortal embodiments of the old italian genius you go into a church or a gallery and feast your fancy upon a splendid picture or an exquisite piece of sculpture and on issuing from the door that has admitted you to the beautiful past are confronted with something that has the effect of a very bad joke the aspect of your lodgingthe carpets the curtains the upholstery in general with their crude and violent colouring and their vulgar materialthe trumpery things in the shops the extreme bad taste of the dress of the women the cheapness and baseness of every attempt at decoration in the cafes and railwaystations the hopeless frivolity of everything that pretends to be a work of artall this modern crudity runs riot over the relics of the great period  we can do a thing for the first time but once it is but once for all that we can have a pleasure in its freshness this is a law not on the whole i think to be regretted for we sometimes learn to know things better by not enjoying them too much it is certain however at the same time that a visitor who has worked off the immediate ferment for this inexhaustibly interesting country has by no means entirely drained the cup after thinking of italy as historical and artistic it will do him no great harm to think of her for a while as panting both for a future and for a balance at the bank aspirations supposedly much at variance with the byronic the ruskinian the artistic poetic aesthetic manner of considering our eternally attaching peninsula he may granti dont say it is absolutely necessarythat its actual aspects and economics are ugly prosaic provokingly out of relation to the diary and the album it is nevertheless true that at the point things have come to modern italy in a manner imposes herself i hadnt been many hours in the country before that truth assailed me and i may add that the first irritation past i found myself able to accept it for if we think nothing is more easy to understand than an honest ire on the part of the young italy of today at being looked at by all the world as a kind of soluble pigment young italy preoccupied with its economical and political future must be heartily tired of being admired for its eyelashes and its pose in one of thackerays novels occurs a mention of a young artist who sent to the royal academy a picture representing a contadino dancing with a trasteverina at the door of a locanda to the music of a pifferaro it is in this attitude and with these conventional accessories that the world has hitherto seen fit to represent young italy and one doesnt wonder that if the youth has any spirit he should at last begin to resent our insufferable aesthetic patronage he has established a line of tramcars in rome from the porta del popolo to the ponte molle and it is on one of these democratic vehicles that i seem to see him taking his triumphant course down the vista of the future i wont pretend to rejoice with him any more than i really do i wont pretend as the sentimental tourists say about it all as if it were the setting of an intaglio or the border of a roman scarf to like it like it or not as we may it is evidently destined to be i see a new italy in the future which in many important respects will equal if not surpass the most enterprising sections of our native land perhaps by that time chicago and san francisco will have acquired a pose and their sons and daughters will dance at the doors of locande  however this may be the accomplished schism between the old order and the new is the promptest moral of a fresh visit to this eversuggestive part of the world the old has become more and more a museum preserved and perpetuated in the midst of the new but without any further relation to itit must be admitted indeed that such a relation is considerablethan that of the stock on his shelves to the shopkeeper or of the siren of the south to the showman who stands before his booth more than once as we move about nowadays in the italian cities there seems to pass before our eyes a vision of the coming years it represents to our satisfaction an italy united and prosperous but altogether scientific and commercial the italy indeed that we sentimentalise and romance about was an ardently mercantile country though i suppose it loved not its ledgers less but its frescoes and altarpieces more scattered through this paradise regained of tradethis country of a thousand portswe see a large number of beautiful buildings in which an endless series of dusky pictures are darkening dampening fading failing through the years by the doors of the beautiful buildings are little turnstiles at which there sit a great many uniformed men to whom the visitor pays a tenpenny fee inside in the vaulted and frescoed chambers the art of italy lies buried as in a thousand mausoleums it is well taken care of it is constantly copied sometimes it is restoredas in the case of that beautiful boyfigure of andrea del sarto at florence which may be seen at the gallery of the uffizi with its honourable duskiness quite peeled off and heaven knows what raw bleeding cuticle laid bare one evening lately near the same florence in the soft twilight i took a stroll among those encircling hills on which the massive villas are mingled with the vaporous olives presently i arrived where three roads met at a wayside shrine in which before some pious daub of an oldtime madonna a little votive lamp glimmered through the evening air the hour the atmosphere the place the twinkling taper the sentiment of the observer the thought that some one had been rescued here from an assassin or from some other peril and had set up a little grateful altar in consequence against the yellowplastered wall of a tangled podere all this led me to approach the shrine with a reverent an emotional step i drew near it but after a few steps i paused i became aware of an incongruous odour it seemed to me that the evening air was charged with a perfume which although to a certain extent familiar had not hitherto associated itself with rustic frescoes and wayside altars i wondered i gently sniffed and the question so put left me no doubt the odour was that of petroleum the votive taper was nourished with the essence of pennsylvania i confess that i burst out laughing and a picturesque contadino wending his homeward way in the dusk stared at me as if i were an iconoclast he noticed the petroleum only i imagine to snuff it fondly up but to me the thing served as a symbol of the italy of the future there is a horsecar from the porta del popolo to the ponte molle and the tuscan shrines are fed with kerosene   ii  if its very well meanwhile to come to turin first its better still to go to genoa afterwards genoa is the tightest topographic tangle in the world which even a second visit helps you little to straighten out in the wonderful crooked twisting climbing soaring burrowing genoese alleys the traveller is really up to his neck in the old italian sketchability the pride of the place i believe is a port of great capacity and the bequest of the late duke of galliera who left four millions of dollars for the purpose of improving and enlarging it will doubtless do much toward converting it into one of the great commercial stations of europe but as after leaving my hotel the afternoon i arrived i wandered for a long time at hazard through the tortuous byways of the city i said to myself not without an accent of private triumph that here at last was something it would be almost impossible to modernise i had found my hotel in the first place extremely entertainingthe croce di malta as it is called established in a gigantic palace on the edge of the swarming and not overclean harbour it was the biggest house i had ever enteredthe basement alone would have contained a dozen american caravansaries i met an american gentleman in the vestibule who as he had indeed a perfect right to be was annoyed by its troublesome dimensionsone was a quarter of an hour ascending out of the basementand desired to know if it were a fair sample of the genoese inns it appeared an excellent specimen of genoese architecture generally so far as i observed there were few houses perceptibly smaller than this titanic tavern i lunched in a dusky ballroom whose ceiling was vaulted frescoed and gilded with the fatal facility of a couple of centuries ago and which looked out upon another ancient housefront equally huge and equally battered separated from it only by a little wedge of dusky spaceone of the principal streets i believe of genoawhence out of dim abysses the population sent up to the windows i had to crane out very far to see it a perpetual clattering shuffling chaffering sound issuing forth presently into this crevice of a street i found myself up to my neck in that element of the rich and strangeas to visible and reproducible effect i meanfor the love of which one revisits italy it offered itself indeed in a variety of colours some of which were not remarkable for their freshness or purity but their combined charm was not to be resisted and the picture glowed with the rankly human side of southern lowlife  genoa as i have hinted is the crookedest and most incoherent of cities tossed about on the sides and crests of a dozen hills it is seamed with gullies and ravines that bristle with those innumerable palaces for which we have heard from our earliest years that the place is celebrated these great structures with their mottled and faded complexions lift their big ornamental cornices to a tremendous height in the air where in a certain indescribably forlorn and desolate fashion overtopping each other they seem to reflect the twinkle and glitter of the warm mediterranean down about the basements in the close crepuscular alleys the people are for ever moving to and fro or standing in their cavernous doorways and their dusky crowded shops calling chattering laughing lamenting living their lives in the conversational italian fashion i had for a long time had no such vision of possible social pressure i hadnt for a long time seen people elbowing each other so closely or swarming so thickly out of populous hives a traveller is often moved to ask himself whether it has been worth while to leave his homewhatever his home may have beenonly to encounter new forms of human suffering only to be reminded that toil and privation hunger and sorrow and sordid effort are the portion of the mass of mankind to travel is as it were to go to the play to attend a spectacle and there is something heartless in stepping forth into foreign streets to feast on character when character consists simply of the slightly different costume in which labour and want present themselves these reflections were forced upon me as i strolled as through a twilight patched with colour and charged with stale smells but after a time they ceased to bear me company the reason of this i think is becauseat least to foreign eyesthe sum of italian misery is on the whole less than the sum of the italian knowledge of life that people should thank you with a smile of striking sweetness for the gift of twopence is a proof certainly of extreme and constant destitution but keeping in mind the sweetness it also attests an enviable ability not to be depressed by circumstances i know that this may possibly be great nonsense that half the time we are acclaiming the fine quality of the italian smile the creature so constituted for physiognomic radiance may be in a sullen frenzy of impatience and pain our observation in any foreign land is extremely superficial and our remarks are happily not addressed to the inhabitants themselves who would be sure to exclaim upon the impudence of the fancypicture  the other day i visited a very picturesque old city upon a mountaintop where in the course of my wanderings i arrived at an old disused gate in the ancient townwall the gate hadnt been absolutely forfeited but the recent completion of a modern road down the mountain led most vehicles away to another egress the grassgrown pavement which wound into the plain by a hundred graceful twists and plunges was now given up to ragged contadini and their donkeys and to such wayfarers as were not alarmed at the disrepair into which it had fallen i stood in the shadow of the tall old gateway admiring the scene looking to right and left at the wonderful walls of the little town perched on the edge of a shaggy precipice at the circling mountains over against them at the road dipping downward among the chestnuts and olives there was no one within sight but a young man who slowly trudged upward with his coat slung over his shoulder and his hat upon his ear in the manner of a cavalier in an opera like an operatic performer too he sang as he came the spectacle generally was operatic and as his vocal flourishes reached my ear i said to myself that in italy accident was always romantic and that such a figure had been exactly what was wanted to set off the landscape it suggested in a high degree that knowledge of life for which i just now commended the italians i was turning back under the old gateway when the young man overtook me and suspending his song asked me if i could favour him with a match to light the hoarded remnant of a cigar this request led as i took my way again to the inn to my falling into talk with him he was a native of the ancient city and answered freely all my inquiries as to its manners and customs and its note of public opinion but the point of my anecdote is that he presently acknowledged himself a brooding young radical and communist filled with hatred of the present italian government raging with discontent and crude political passion professing a ridiculous hope that italy would soon have as france had had her 89 and declaring that he for his part would willingly lend a hand to chop off the heads of the king and the royal family he was an unhappy underfed unemployed young man who took a hard grim view of everything and was operatic only quite in spite of himself this made it very absurd of me to have looked at him simply as a graceful ornament to the prospect an harmonious little figure in the middle distance damn the prospect damn the middle distance would have been all his philosophy yet but for the accident of my having gossipped with him i should have made him do service in memory as an example of sensuous optimism  i am bound to say however that i believe a great deal of the sensuous optimism observable in the genoese alleys and beneath the low crowded arcades along the port was very real here every one was magnificently sunburnt and there were plenty of those queer types mahoganycoloured barechested mariners with earrings and crimson girdles that seem to people a southern seaport with the chorus of masaniello but it is not fair to speak as if at genoa there were nothing but lowlife to be seen for the place is the residence of some of the grandest people in the world nor are all the palaces ranged upon dusky alleys the handsomest and most impressive form a splendid series on each side of a couple of very proper streets in which there is plenty of room for a coachandfour to approach the big doorways many of these doorways are open revealing great marble staircases with couchant lions for balustrades and ceremonious courts surrounded by walls of sunsoftened yellow one of the great piles in the array is coloured a goodly red and contains in particular the grand people i just now spoke of they live indeed on the third floor but here they have suites of wonderful painted and gilded chambers in which foreshortened frescoes also cover the vaulted ceilings and florid mouldings emboss the ample walls these distinguished tenants bear the name of vandyck though they are members of the noble family of brignole sale one of whose childrenthe duchess of gallierahas lately given proof of nobleness in presenting the gallery of the red palace to the city of genoa   iii  on leaving genoa i repaired to spezia chiefly with a view of  accomplishing a sentimental pilgrimage which i in fact achieved in the most agreeable conditions the gulf of spezia is now the headquarters of the italian fleet and there were several big ironplated frigates riding at anchor in front of the town the streets were filled with lads in blue flannel who were receiving instruction at a schoolship in the harbour and in the evening there was a brilliant moonthe little breakwater which stretched out into the mediterranean offered a scene of recreation to innumerable such persons but this fact is from the point of view of the cherisher of quaintness of little account for since it has become prosperous spezia has grown ugly the place is filled with long dull stretches of dead wall and great raw expanses of artificial land it wears that look of monstrous of more than farwestern newness which distinguishes all the creations of the young italian state nor did i find any great compensation in an immense inn of recent birth an establishment seated on the edge of the sea in anticipation of a passeggiata which is to come that way some five years hence the region being in the meantime of the most primitive formation the inn was filled with grave english people who looked respectable and bored and there was of course a church of england service in the gaudilyfrescoed parlour neither was it the drive to porto venere that chiefly pleased mea drive among vines and olives over the hills and beside the mediterranean to a queer little crumbling village on a headland as sweetly desolate and superannuated as the name it bears there is a ruined church near the village which occupies the site according to tradition of an ancient temple of venus and if venus ever revisits her desecrated shrines she must sometimes pause a moment in that sunny stillness and listen to the murmur of the tideless sea at the base of the narrow promontory if venus sometimes comes there apollo surely does as much for close to the temple is a gateway surmounted by an inscription in italian and english which admits you to a curious and it must be confessed rather cockneyfied cave among the rocks it was here says the inscription that the great byron swimmer and poet defied the waves of the ligurian sea the fact is interesting though not supremely so for byron was always defying something and if a slab had been put up wherever this performance came off these commemorative tablets would be in many parts of europe as thick as milestones  no the great merit of spezia to my eye is that i engaged a boat there of a lovely october afternoon and had myself rowed across the gulfit took about an hour and a halfto the little bay of lerici which opens out of it this bay of lerici is charming the bosky greygreen hills close it in and on either side of the entrance perched on a bold headland a wonderful old crumbling castle keeps ineffectual guard the place is classic to all english travellers for in the middle of the curving shore is the now desolate little villa in which shelley spent the last months of his short life he was living at lerici when he started on that short southern cruise from which he never returned the house he occupied is strangely shabby and as sad as you may choose to find it it stands directly upon the beach with scarred and battered walls and a loggia of several arches opening to a little terrace with a rugged parapet which when the wind blows must be drenched with the salt spray the place is very lonelyall overwearied with sun and breeze and brine very close to nature as it was shelleys passion to be i can fancy a great lyric poet sitting on the terrace of a warm evening and feeling very far from england in the early years of the century in that place and with his genius he would as a matter of course have heard in the voice of nature a sweetness which only the lyric movement could translate it is a place where an englishspeaking pilgrim himself may very honestly think thoughts and feel moved to lyric utterance but i must content myself with saying in halting prose that i remember few episodes of italian travel more sympathetic as they have it here than that perfect autumn afternoon the halfhours station on the little battered terrace of the villa the climb to the singularly felicitous old castle that hangs above lerici the meditative lounge in the fading light on the vinedecked platform that looked out toward the sunset and the darkening mountains and far below upon the quiet sea beyond which the palefaced tragic villa stared up at the brightening moon   iv  i had never known florence more herself or in other words more attaching than i found her for a week in that brilliant october she sat in the sunshine beside her yellow river like the little treasurecity she has always seemed without commerce without other industry than the manufacture of mosaic paperweights and alabaster cupids without actuality or energy or earnestness or any of those rugged virtues which in most cases are deemed indispensable for civic cohesion with nothing but the little unaugmented stock of her mediaeval memories her tendercoloured mountains her churches and palaces pictures and statues there were very few strangers ones detested fellowpilgrim was infrequent the native population itself seemed scanty the sound of wheels in the streets was but occasional by eight oclock at night apparently every one had gone to bed and the musing wanderer still wandering and still musing had the place to himselfhad the thick shadowmasses of the great palaces and the shafts of moonlight striking the polygonal pavingstones and the empty bridges and the silvered yellow of the arno and the stillness broken only by a homeward step a step accompanied by a snatch of song from a warm italian voice my room at the inn looked out on the river and was flooded all day with sunshine there was an absurd orangecoloured paper on the walls the arno of a hue not altogether different flowed beneath and on the other side of it rose a line of sallow houses of extreme antiquity crumbling and mouldering bulging and protruding over the stream i seem to speak of their fronts but what i saw was their shabby backs which were exposed to the cheerful flicker of the river while the fronts stood for ever in the deep damp shadow of a narrow mediaeval street all this brightness and yellowness was a perpetual delight it was a part of that indefinably charming colour which florence always seems to wear as you look up and down at it from the river and from the bridges and quays this is a kind of grave radiancea harmony of high tintswhich i scarce know how to describe there are yellow walls and green blinds and red roofs there are intervals of brilliant brown and naturallooking blue but the picture is not spotty nor gaudy thanks to the distribution of the colours in large and comfortable masses and to the washingover of the scene by some happy softness of sunshine the riverfront of florence is in short a delightful composition part of its charm comes of course from the generous aspect of those highbased tuscan palaces which a renewal of acquaintance with them has again commended to me as the most dignified dwellings in the world nothing can be finer than that look of giving up the whole immense groundfloor to simple purposes of vestibule and staircase of court and higharched entrance as if this were all but a massive pedestal for the real habitation and people werent properly housed unless to begin with they should be lifted fifty feet above the pavement the great blocks of the basement the great intervals horizontally and vertically from window to window telling of the height and breadth of the rooms within the armorial shield hung forward at one of the angles the wide brimmed roof overshadowing the narrow street the rich old browns and yellows of the walls these definite elements put themselves together with admirable art  illustration roman gateway rimini  take a tuscan pile of this type out of its oblique situation in the town call it no longer a palace but a villa set it down by a terrace on one of the hills that encircle florence place a row of highwaisted cypresses beside it give it a grassy courtyard and a view of the florentine towers and the valley of the arno and you will think it perhaps even more worthy of your esteem it was a sunday noon and brilliantly warm when i again arrived and after i had looked from my windows a while at that quietly basking riverfront i have spoken of i took my way across one of the bridges and then out of one of the gatesthat immensely tall roman gate in which the space from the top of the arch to the cornice except that there is scarcely a cornice it is all a plain massive piece of wall is as great or seems to be as that from the ground to the former point then i climbed a steep and winding waymuch of it a little dull if one likes being bounded by mottled mossy gardenwallsto a villa on a hilltop where i found various things that touched me with almost too fine a point seeing them again often for a week both by sunlight and moonshine i never quite learned not to covet them not to feel that not being a part of them was somehow to miss an exquisite chance what a tranquil contented life it seemed with romantic beauty as a part of its daily texturethe sunny terrace with its tangled podere beneath it the bright grey olives against the bright blue sky the long serene horizontal lines of other villas flanked by their upward cypresses disposed upon the neighbouring hills the richest little city in the world in a softlyscooped hollow at ones feet and beyond it the most appealing of views the most majestic yet the most familiar within the villa was a great love of art and a paintingroom full of felicitous work so that if human life there confessed to quietness the quietness was mostly but that of the intent act a beautiful occupation in that beautiful position what could possibly be better that is what i spoke just now of envyinga way of life that doesnt wince at such refinements of peace and ease when labour selfcharmed presents itself in a dull or an ugly place we esteem it we admire it but we scarce feel it to be the ideal of good fortune when however its votaries move as figures in an ancient noble landscape and their walks and contemplations are like a turning of the leaves of history we seem to have before us an admirable case of virtue made easy meaning here by virtue contentment and concentration a real appreciation of the rare the exquisite though composite medium of life you neednt want a rush or a crush when the scene itself the mere scene shares with you such a wealth of consciousness  it is true indeed that i might after a certain time grow weary of a regular afternoon stroll among the florentine lanes of sitting on low parapets in intervals of flowertopped wall and looking across at fiesole or down the richhued valley of the arno of pausing at the open gates of villas and wondering at the height of cypresses and the depth of loggias of walking home in the fading light and noting on a dozen westwardlooking surfaces the glow of the opposite sunset but for a week or so all this was delightful the villas are innumerable and if youre an aching alien half the talk is about villas this one has a story that one has another they all look as if they had storiesnone in truth predominantly gay most of them are offered to rent many of them for sale at prices unnaturally low you may have a tower and a garden a chapel and an expanse of thirty windows for five hundred dollars a year in imagination you hire three or four you take possession and settle and stay your sense of the fineness of the finest is of something very grave and stately your sense of the bravery of two or three of the best something quite tragic and sinister from what does this latter impression come you gather it as you stand there in the early dusk with your eyes on the long palebrown facade the enormous windows the iron cages fastened to the lower ones part of the brooding expression of these great houses comes even when they have not fallen into decay from their look of having outlived their original use their extraordinary largeness and massiveness are a satire on their present fate they werent built with such a thickness of wall and depth of embrasure such a solidity of staircase and superfluity of stone simply to afford an economical winter residence to english and american families i dont know whether it was the appearance of these stony old villas which seemed so dumbly conscious of a change of manners that threw a tinge of melancholy over the general prospect certain it is that having always found this note as of a myriad old sadnesses in solution in the view of florence it seemed to me now particularly strong lovely lovely but it makes me blue the sensitive stranger couldnt but murmur to himself as in the late afternoon he looked at the landscape from over one of the low parapets and then with his hands in his pockets turned away indoors to candles and dinner   v  below in the city through all frequentation of streets and churches and museums it was impossible not to have a good deal of the same feeling but here the impression was more easy to analyse it came from a sense of the perfect separateness of all the great productions of the renaissance from the present and the future of the place from the actual life and manners the native ideal i have already spoken of the way in which the vast aggregation of beautiful works of art in the italian cities strikes the visitor nowadaysso far as present italy is concernedas the mere stockintrade of an impecunious but thrifty people it is this spiritual solitude this conscious disconnection of the great works of architecture and sculpture that deposits a certain weight upon the heart when we see a great tradition broken we feel something of the pain with which we hear a stifled cry but regret is one thing and resentment is another seeing one morning in a shopwindow the series of mornings in florence published a few years since by mr ruskin i made haste to enter and purchase these amusing little books some passages of which i remembered formerly to have read i couldnt turn over many pages without observing that the separateness of the new and old which i just mentioned had produced in their author the liveliest irritation with the more acute phases of this condition it was difficult to sympathise for the simple reason it seems to me that it savours of arrogance to demand of any people as a right of ones own that they shall be artistic be artistic yourselves is the very natural reply that young italy has at hand for english critics and censors when a people produces beautiful statues and pictures it gives us something more than is set down in the bond and we must thank it for its generosity and when it stops producing them or caring for them we may cease thanking but we hardly have a right to begin and rail the wreck of florence says mr ruskin is now too ghastly and heartbreaking to any human soul that remembers the days of old and these desperate words are an allusion to the fact that the little square in front of the cathedral at the foot of giottos tower with the grand baptistery on the other side is now the resort of a number of hackneycoaches and omnibuses this fact is doubtless lamentable and it would be a hundred times more agreeable to see among people who have been made the heirs of so priceless a work of art as the sublime campanile some such feeling about it as would keep it free even from the danger of defilement a cabstand is a very ugly and dirty thing and giottos tower should have nothing in common with such conveniences but there is more than one way of taking such things and the sensitive stranger who has been walking about for a week with his mind full of the sweetness and suggestiveness of a hundred florentine places may feel at last in looking into mr ruskins little tracts that discord for discord there isnt much to choose between the importunity of the authors personal illhumour and the incongruity of horse pails and bundles of hay and one may say this without being at all a partisan of the doctrine of the inevitableness of new desecrations for my own part i believe there are few things in this line that the new italian spirit isnt capable of and not many indeed that we arent destined to see pictures and buildings wont be completely destroyed because in that case the forestieri scatterers of cash would cease to arrive and the turnstiles at the doors of the old palaces and convents with the little patented slit for absorbing your halffranc would grow quite rusty would stiffen with disuse but its safe to say that the new italy growing into an old italy again will continue to take her elbowroom wherever she may find it  illustration santa maria novella florence  i am almost ashamed to say what i did with mr ruskins little books i put them into my pocket and betook myself to santa maria novella there i sat down and after i had looked about for a while at the beautiful church drew them forth one by one and read the greater part of them occupying ones self with light literature in a great religious edifice is perhaps as bad a piece of profanation as any of those rude dealings which mr ruskin justly deplores but a traveller has to make the most of odd moments and i was waiting for a friend in whose company i was to go and look at giottos beautiful frescoes in the cloister of the church my friend was a long time coming so that i had an hour with mr ruskin whom i called just now a light littérateur because in these little mornings in florence he is for ever making his readers laugh i remembered of course where i was and in spite of my latent hilarity felt i had rarely got such a snubbing i had really been enjoying the good old city of florence but i now learned from mr ruskin that this was a scandalous waste of charity i should have gone about with an imprecation on my lips i should have worn a face three yards long i had taken great pleasure in certain frescoes by ghirlandaio in the choir of that very church but it appeared from one of the little books that these frescoes were as naught i had much admired santa croce and had thought the duomo a very noble affair but i had now the most positive assurance i knew nothing about them after a while if it was only illhumour that was needed for doing honour to the city of the medici i felt that i had risen to a proper level only now it was mr ruskin himself i had lost patience with not the stupid brunelleschi not the vulgar ghirlandaio indeed i lost patience altogether and asked myself by what right this informal votary of form pretended to run riot through a poor charmed flaneurs quiet contemplations his attachment to the noblest of pleasures his enjoyment of the loveliest of cities the little books seemed invidious and insane and it was only when i remembered that i had been under no obligation to buy them that i checked myself in repenting of having done so  then at last my friend arrived and we passed together out of the church and through the first cloister beside it into a smaller enclosure where we stood a while to look at the tomb of the marchesa strozziridolfi upon which the great giotto has painted four superb little pictures it was easy to see the pictures were superb but i drew forth one of my little books again for i had observed that mr ruskin spoke of them hereupon i recovered my tolerance for what could be better in this case i asked myself than mr ruskins remarks they are in fact excellent and charmingfull of appreciation of the deep and simple beauty of the great painters work i read them aloud to my companion but my companion was rather as the phrase is put off by them one of the frescoesit is a picture of the birth of the virgin contains a figure coming through a door of ornament i quote there is only the entirely simple outline of the vase which the servant carries of colour two or three masses of sober red and pure white with brown and grey that is all mr ruskin continues and if you are pleased with this you can see florence but if not by all means amuse yourself there if you find it amusing as long as you like you can never see it you can never see it this seemed to my friend insufferable and i had to shuffle away the book again so that we might look at the fresco with the unruffled geniality it deserves we agreed afterwards when in a more convenient place i read aloud a good many more passages from the precious tracts that there are a great many ways of seeing florence as there are of seeing most beautiful and interesting things and that it is very dry and pedantic to say that the happy vision depends upon our squaring our toes with a certain particular chalkmark we see florence wherever and whenever we enjoy it and for enjoying it we find a great many more pretexts than mr ruskin seems inclined to allow my friend and i convinced ourselves also however that the little books were an excellent purchase on account of the great charm and felicity of much of their incidental criticism to say nothing as i hinted just now of their being extremely amusing nothing in fact is more comical than the familiar asperity of the authors style and the pedagogic fashion in which he pushes and pulls his unhappy pupils about jerking their heads toward this rapping their knuckles for that sending them to stand in corners and giving them scripture texts to copy but it is neither the felicities nor the aberrations of detail in mr ruskins writings that are the main affair for most readers it is the general tone that as i have said puts them off or draws them on for many persons he will never bear the test of being read in this rich old italy where art so long as it really lived at all was spontaneous joyous irresponsible if the reader is in daily contact with those beautiful florentine works which do still in away force themselves into notice through the vulgarity and cruelty of modern profanation it will seem to him that this commentators comment is pitched in the strangest falsetto key one may read a hundred pages of this sort of thing said my friend without ever dreaming that he is talking about art you can say nothing worse about him than that which is perfectly true art is the one corner of human life in which we may take our ease to justify our presence there the only thing demanded of us is that we shall have felt the representational impulse in other connections our impulses are conditioned and embarrassed we are allowed to have only so many as are consistent with those of our neighbours with their convenience and wellbeing with their convictions and prejudices their rules and regulations art means an escape from all this wherever her shining standard floats the need for apology and compromise is over there it is enough simply that we please or are pleased there the tree is judged only by its fruits if these are sweet the tree is justifiedand not less so the consumer  one may read a great many pages of mr ruskin without getting a hint of this delightful truth a hint of the not unimportant fact that art after all is made for us and not we for art this idea that the value of a work is in the amount of illusion it yields is conspicuous by its absence and as for mr ruskins worlds being a placehis world of artwhere we may take life easily woe to the luckless mortal who enters it with any such disposition instead of a garden of delight he finds a sort of assize court in perpetual session instead of a place in which human responsibilities are lightened and suspended he finds a region governed by a kind of draconic legislation his responsibilities indeed are tenfold increased the gulf between truth and error is for ever yawning at his feet the pains and penalties of this same error are advertised in apocalyptic terminology upon a thousand signposts and the rash intruder soon begins to look back with infinite longing to the lost paradise of the artless there can be no greater want of tact in dealing with those things with which men attempt to ornament life than to be perpetually talking about error a truce to all rigidities is the law of the place the only thing absolute there is that some force and some charm have worked the grim old bearer of the scales excuses herself she feels this not to be her province differences here are not iniquity and righteousness they are simply variations of temperament kinds of curiosity we are not under theological government   vi  it was very charming in the bright warm days to wander from one corner of florence to another paying ones respects again to remembered masterpieces it was pleasant also to find that memory had played no tricks and that the rarest things of an earlier year were as rare as ever to enumerate these felicities would take a great deal of space for i never had been more struck with the mere quantity of brilliant florentine work even giving up the duomo and santa croce to mr ruskin as very illarranged edifices the list of the florentine treasures is almost inexhaustible those long outer galleries of the uffizi had never beguiled me more sometimes there were not more than two or three figures standing there baedeker in hand to break the charming perspective one side of this upstairs portico it will be remembered is entirely composed of glass a continuity of old fashioned windows draped with white curtains of rather primitive fashion which hang there till they acquire a perceptible tone the light passing through them is softly filtered and diffused it rests mildly upon the old marbleschiefly antique roman bustswhich stand in the narrow intervals of the casements it is projected upon the numerous pictures that cover the opposite wall and that are not by any means as a general thing the gems of the great collection it imparts a faded brightness to the old ornamental arabesques upon the painted wooden ceiling and it makes a great soft shining upon the marble floor in which as you look up and down you see the strolling tourists and the motionless copyists almost reflected i dont know why i should find all this very pleasant but in fact i have seldom gone into the uffizi without walking the length of this thirdstory cloister between the for the most part thirdrate canvases and panels and the faded cotton curtains why is it that in italy we see a charm in things in regard to which in other countries we always take vulgarity for granted if in the city of new york a great museum of the arts were to be provided by way of decoration with a species of verandah enclosed on one side by a series of smallpaned windows draped in dirty linen and furnished on the other with an array of pictorial feebleness the place being surmounted by a thinlypainted wooden roof strongly suggestive of summer heat of winter cold of frequent leakage those amateurs who had had the advantage of foreign travel would be at small pains to conceal their contempt contemptible or respectable to the judicial mind this quaint old loggia of the uffizi admitted me into twenty chambers where i found as great a number of ancient favourites i dont know that i had a warmer greeting for any old friend than for andrea del sarto that most touching of painters who is not one of the first but it was on the other side of the arno that i found him in force in those dusky drawingrooms of the pitti palace to which you take your way along the tortuous tunnel that wanders through the houses of florence and is supported by the little goldsmiths booths on the ponte vecchio in the rich insufficient light of these beautiful rooms where to look at the pictures you sit in damask chairs and rest your elbows on tables of malachite the elegant andrea becomes deeply effective before long he has drawn you close but the great pleasure after all was to revisit the earlier masters in those specimens of them chiefly that bloom so unfadingly on the big plain walls of the academy fra angelico and filippo lippi botticelli and lorenzo di credi are the clearest the sweetest and best of all painters as i sat for an hour in their company in the cold great hall of the institution i have mentionedthere are shabby rafters above and an immense expanse of brick tiles below and many bad pictures as well as goodit seemed to me more than ever that if one really had to choose one couldnt do better than choose here you may rest at your ease at the academy in this big first roomat the upper end especially on the leftbecause more than many other places it savours of old florence more for instance in reality than the bargello though the bargello makes great pretensions beautiful and masterful though the bargello is it smells too strongly of restoration and much of old italy as still lurks in its furbished and renovated chambers it speaks even more distinctly of the illmannered young kingdom that hasas unavoidably as you pleaselifted down a hundred delicate works of sculpture from the conventwalls where their pious authors placed them if the early tuscan painters are exquisite i can think of no praise pure enough for the sculptors of the same period donatello and luca della robbia matteo civitale and mina da fiesole who as i refreshed my memory of them seemed to me to leave absolutely nothing to be desired in the way of straightness of inspiration and grace of invention the bargello is full of early tuscan sculpture most of the pieces of which have come from suppressed religious houses and even if the visitor be an ardent liberal he is uncomfortably conscious of the rather brutal process by which it has been collected one can hardly envy young italy the number of odious things she has had to do  the railway journey from florence to rome has been altered both for the better and for the worse for the better in that it has been shortened by a couple of hours for the worse inasmuch as when about half the distance has been traversed the train deflects to the west and leaves the beautiful old cities of assisi perugia terni narni unvisited of old it was possible to call at these places in a manner from the window of the train even if you didnt stop as you probably couldnt every time you passed the immensely interesting way in which like a loosened belt on an aged and shrunken person their ample walls held them easily together was something well worth noting now however for compensation the express train to rome stops at orvieto and in consequence in consequence what what is the result of the stop of an express train at orvieto as i glibly wrote that sentence i suddenly paused aware of the queer stuff i was uttering that an express train would graze the base of the horrid purple mountain from the apex of which this dark old catholic city uplifts the glittering front of its cathedral that might have been foretold by a keen observer of contemporary manners but that it would really have the grossness to hang about is a fact over which as he records it an inveterate a perverse cherisher of the sense of the past order the order still largely prevailing at the time of his first visit to italy may well make what is vulgarly called an ado the train does stop at orvieto not very long it is true but long enough to let you out the same phenomenon takes place on the following day when having visited the city you get in again i availed myself without scruple of both of these occasions having formerly neglected to drive to the place in a postchaise but frankly the railwaystation being in the plain and the town on the summit of an extraordinary hill you have time to forget the puffing indiscretion while you wind upwards to the citygate the position of orvieto is superbworthy of the middle distance of an eighteenthcentury landscape but as every one knows the splendid cathedral is the proper attraction of the spot which indeed save for this fine monument and for its craggy and crumbling ramparts is a meanly arranged and as italian cities go not particularly impressive little town i spent a beautiful sunday there and took in the charming church i gave it my best attention though on the whole i fear i found it inferior to its fame a high concert of colour however is the densely carved front richly covered with radiant mosaics the old white marble of the sculptured portions is as softly yellow as ancient ivory the large exceedingly bright pictures above them flashed and twinkled in the glorious weather very striking and interesting the theological frescoes of luca signorelli though i have seen compositions of this general order that appealed to me more characteristically fresh finally the clearfaced saints and seraphs in robes of pink and azure whom fra angelico has painted upon the ceiling of the great chapel along with a noble sitting figuremore expressive of movement than most of the creations of this pictorial peacemakerof christ in judgment yet the interest of the cathedral of orvieto is mainly not the visible result but the historical process that lies behind it those three hundred years of the applied devotion of a people of which an american scholar has written an admirable account1  1877  1 charles eliot norton notes of travel and study in italy      a roman holiday   it is certainly sweet to be merry at the right moment but the right moment hardly seems to me the ten days of the roman carnival it was my rather cynical suspicion perhaps that they wouldnt keep to my imagination the brilliant promise of legend but i have been justified by the event and have been decidedly less conscious of the festal influences of the season than of the inalienable gravity of the place there was a time when the carnival was a serious matterthat is a heartily joyous one but thanks to the sevenleague boots the kingdom of italy has lately donned for the march of progress in quite other directions the fashion of public revelry has fallen woefully out of step the state of mind and manners under which the carnival was kept in generous good faith i doubt if an american can exactly conceive he can only say to himself that for a month in the year there must have been thingsthings considerably of humiliationit was comfortable to forget but now that italy is made the carnival is unmade and we are not especially tempted to envy the attitude of a population who have lost their relish for play and not yet acquired to any striking extent an enthusiasm for work the spectacle on the corso has seemed to me on the whole an illustration of that great breach with the past of which catholic christendom felt the somewhat muffled shock in september 1870 a traveller acquainted with the fully papal rome coming back any time during the past winter must have immediately noticed that something momentous had happened something hostile to the elements of picture and colour and style my first warning was that ten minutes after my arrival i found myself face to face with a newspaper stand the impossibility in the other days of having anything in the journalistic line but the osservatore romano and the voce della verità used to seem to me much connected with the extraordinary leisure of thought and stillness of mind to which the place admitted you but now the slender piping of the voice of truth is stifled by the raucous note of eventide vendors of the capitale the libertà and the fanfulla and rome reading unexpurgated news is another rome indeed for every subscriber to the libertà there may well be an antique masker and reveller less as striking a sign of the new régime is the extraordinary increase of population the corso was always a wellfilled street but now its a perpetual crush i never cease to wonder where the newcomers are lodged and how such spotless flowers of fashion as the gentlemen who stare at the carriages can bloom in the atmosphere of those camere mobiliate of which i have had glimpses this however is their own question and bravely enough they meet it they proclaimed somehow to the first freshness of my wonder as i say that by force of numbers rome had been secularised an italian dandy is a figure visually to reckon with but these goodly throngs of them scarce offered compensation for the absent monsignori treading the streets in their purple stockings and followed by the solemn servants who returned on their behalf the bows of the meaner sort for the mourning gear of the cardinals coaches that formerly glittered with scarlet and swung with the weight of the footmen clinging behind for the certainty that youll not by the best of travellers luck meet the pope sitting deep in the shadow of his great chariot with uplifted fingers like some inaccessible idol in his shrine you may meet the king indeed who is as ugly as imposingly ugly as some idols though not so inaccessible the other day as i passed the quirinal he drove up in a low carriage with a single attendant and a group of men and women who had been waiting near the gate rushed at him with a number of folded papers the carriage slackened pace and he pocketed their offerings with a business like airhat of a goodnatured man accepting handbills at a streetcorner here was a monarch at his palace gate receiving petitions from his subjectsbeing adjured to right their wrongs the scene ought to have thrilled me but somehow it had no more intensity than a woodcut in an illustrated newspaper homely i should call it at most admirably so certainly for there were lately few sovereigns standing i believe with whom their people enjoyed these filial handtohand relations the king this year however has had as little to do with the carnival as the pope and the innkeepers and americans have marked it for their own  it was advertised to begin at halfpast two oclock of a certain saturday and punctually at the stroke of the hour from my room across a wide court i heard a sudden multiplication of sounds and confusion of tongues in the corso i was writing to a friend for whom i cared more than for any mere romp but as the minutes elapsed and the hubbub deepened curiosity got the better of affection and i remembered that i was really within eyeshot of an affair the fame of which had ministered to the daydreams of my infancy i used to have a scrapbook with a coloured print of the starting of the bedizened wild horses and the use of a library rich in keepsakes and annuals with a frontispiece commonly of a masked lady in a balcony the heroine of a delightful tale further on agitated by these tender memories i descended into the street but i confess i looked in vain for a masked lady who might serve as a frontispiece in vain for any object whatever that might adorn a tale masked and muffled ladies there were in abundance but their masks were of ugly wire perfectly resembling the little covers placed upon strong cheese in german hotels and their drapery was a shabby waterproof with the hood pulled over their chignons they were armed with great tin scoops or funnels with which they solemnly shovelled lime and flour out of bushelbaskets and down on the heads of the people in the street they were packed into balconies all the way along the straight vista of the corso in which their calcareous shower maintained a dense gritty unpalatable fog the crowd was compact in the street and the americans in it were tossing back confetti out of great satchels hung round their necks it was quite the youre another sort of repartee and less seasoned than i had hoped with the airy mockery tradition hangs about this festival the scene was striking in a word but somehow not as i had dreamed of its being i stood regardful i suppose but with a peculiarly tempting blankness of visage for in a moment i received half a bushel of flour on my toophilosophic head decidedly it was an ignoble form of humour i shook my ears like an emergent diver and had a sudden vision of how still and sunny and solemn how peculiarly and undisturbedly themselves how secure from any intrusion less sympathetic than ones own certain outlying parts of rome must just then be the carnival had received its deathblow in my imagination and it has been ever since but a thin and dusky ghost of pleasure that has flitted at intervals in and out of my consciousness  i turned my back accordingly on the corso and wandered away to the grassgrown quarters delightfully free even from the possibility of a fellowcountryman and so having set myself an example i have been keeping carnival by strolling perversely along the silent circumference of rome i have doubtless lost a great deal the princess margaret has occupied a balcony opposite the open space which leads into via condotti and i believe like the discreet princess she is has dealt in no missiles but bonbons bouquets and white doves i would have waited half an hour any day to see the princess margaret hold a dove on her forefinger but i never chanced to notice any preparation for that effect and yet do what you will you cant really elude the carnival as the days elapse it filters down into the manners of the common people and before the week is over the very beggars at the churchdoors seem to have gone to the expense of a domino when you meet these specimens of dingy drollery capering about in dusky backstreets at all hours of the day and night meet them flitting out of black doorways between the greasy groups that cluster about roman thresholds you feel that a love of pranks the more vivid the better must from far back have been implanted in the roman temperament with a strong hand an unsophisticated american is wonderstruck at the number of persons of every age and various conditions whom it costs nothing in the nature of an ingenuous blush to walk up and down the streets in the costume of a theatrical supernumerary fathers of families do it at the head of an admiring progeniture aunts and uncles and grandmothers do it all the family does it with varying splendour but with the same good conscience a pack of babies the doubtless too self conscious alien pronounces it for its pains and tries to imagine himself strutting along broadway in a battered tin helmet and a pair of yellow tights our vices are certainly different it takes those of the innocent sort to be so ridiculous a self consciousness lapsing so easily in fine strikes me as so near a relation to amenity urbanity and general gracefulness that for myself i should be sorry to lay a tax on it lest these other commodities should also cease to come to market  i was rewarded when i had turned away with my ears full of flour by a glimpse of an intenser life than the dingy foolery of the corso i walked down by the back streets to the steps mounting to the capitolthat long inclined plane rather broken at every two paces which is the unfailing disappointment i believe of tourists primed for retrospective raptures certainly the capitol seen from this side isnt commanding the hill is so low the ascent so narrow michael angelos architecture in the quadrangle at the top so meagre the whole place somehow so much more of a molehill than a mountain that for the first ten minutes of your standing there roman history seems suddenly to have sunk through a trapdoor it emerges however on the other side in the forum and here meanwhile if you get no sense of the sublime you get gradually a sense of exquisite composition nowhere in rome is more colour more charm more sport for the eye the mild incline during the winter months is always covered with lounging sunseekers and especially with those more constantly obvious members of the roman populationbeggars soldiers monks and tourists the beggars and peasants lie kicking their heels along that grandest of loafingplaces the great steps of the ara coeli the dwarfish look of the capitol is intensified i think by the neighbourhood of this huge blank staircase mouldering away in disuse the weeds thick in its crevices and climbing to the rudely solemn facade of the church the sunshine glares on this great unfinished wall only to light up its featureless despair its expression of conscious irremediable incompleteness sometimes massing its rusty screen against the deep blue sky with the little cross and the sculptured porch casting a clearcut shadow on the bricks it seems to have even more than a roman desolation it confusedly suggests spain and africalands with no latent risorgimenti with absolutely nothing but a fatal past the legendary wolf of rome has lately been accommodated with a little artificial grotto among the cacti and the palms in the fantastic triangular garden squeezed between the steps of the church and the ascent to the capitol where she holds a perpetual levee and draws apparently as powerfully as the pope himself above in the piazzetta before the stuccoed palace which rises so jauntily on a basement of thrice its magnitude are more loungers and knitters in the sun seated round the massively inscribed base of the statue of marcus aurelius hawthorne has perfectly expressed the attitude of this admirable figure in saying that it extends its arm with a command which is in itself a benediction i doubt if any statue of king or captain in the public places of the world has more to commend it to the general heart irrecoverable simplicityresiding so in irrecoverable stylehas no sturdier representative here is an impression that the sculptors of the last three hundred years have been laboriously trying to reproduce but contrasted with this mild old monarch their prancing horsemen suggest a succession of ridingmasters taking out young ladies schools the admirably human character of the figure survives the rusty decomposition of the bronze and the slight debasement of the art and one may call it singular that in the capital of christendom the portrait most suggestive of a christian conscience is that of a pagan emperor  you recover in some degree your stifled hopes of sublimity as you pass beyond the palace and take your choice of either curving slope to descend into the forum then you see that the little stuccoed edifice is but a modern excrescence on the mighty cliff of a primitive construction whose great squares of porous tufa as they underlie each other seem to resolve themselves back into the colossal cohesion of unhewn rock there are prodigious strangenesses in the union of this airy and comparatively fresh faced superstructure and these deepplunging hoary foundations and few things in rome are more entertaining to the eye than to measure the long plumbline which drops from the inhabited windows of the palace with their little overpeeping balconies their muslin curtains and their birdcages down to the rugged constructional work of the republic in the forum proper the sublime is eclipsed again though the late extension of the excavations gives a chance for it  nothing in rome helps your fancy to a more vigorous backward flight than to lounge on a sunny day over the railing which guards the great central researches it says more things to you than you can repeat to see the past the ancient world as you stand there bodily turned up with the spade and transformed from an immaterial inaccessible fact of time into a matter of soils and surfaces the pleasure is the samein kindas what you enjoy of pompeii and the pain the same it wasnt here however that i found my compensation for forfeiting the spectacle on the corso but in a little church at the end of the narrow byway which diverges up the palatine from just beside the arch of titus this byway leads you between high walls then takes a bend and introduces you to a long row of rusty dusty little pictures of the stations of the cross beyond these stands a small church with a front so modest that you hardly recognise it till you see the leather curtain i never see a leather curtain without lifting it it is sure to cover a constituted scene of some sortgood bad or indifferent the scene this time was meagrewhitewash and tarnished candlesticks and mouldy muslin flowers being its principal features i shouldnt have remained if i hadnt been struck with the attitude of the single worshippera young priest kneeling before one of the sidealtars who as i entered lifted his head and gave me a sidelong look so charged with the languor of devotion that he immediately became an object of interest he was visiting each of the altars in turn and kissing the balustrade beneath them he was alone in the church and indeed in the whole region there were no beggars even at the door they were plying their trade on the skirts of the carnival in the entirely deserted place he alone knelt for religion and as i sat respectfully by it seemed to me i could hear in the perfect silence the faraway uproar of the maskers it was my late impression of these frivolous people i suppose joined with the extraordinary gravity of the young priests face his pious fatigue his droning prayer and his isolationthat gave me just then and there a supreme vision of the religious passion its privations and resignations and exhaustions and its terribly small share of amusement he was young and strong and evidently of not too refined a fibre to enjoy the carnival but planted there with his face pale with fasting and his knees stiff with praying he seemed so stern a satire on it and on the crazy thousands who were preferring it to his way that i half expected to see some heavenly portent out of a monastic legend come down and confirm his choice yet i confess that though i wasnt enamoured of the carnival myself his seemed a grim preference and this forswearing of the world a terrible gamea gaining one only if your zeal never falters a hard fight when it does in such an hour to a stout young fellow like the hero of my anecdote the smell of incense must seem horribly stale and the muslin flowers and gilt candlesticks to figure no great bribe and it wouldnt have helped him much to think that not so very far away just beyond the forum in the corso there was sport for the million and for nothing i doubt on the other hand whether my young priest had thought of this he had made himself a temple out of the very elements of his innocence and his prayers followed each other too fast for the tempter to slip in a whisper and so as i say i found a solider fact of human nature than the love of coriandoli  one of course never passes the colosseum without paying it ones respectswithout going in under one of the hundred portals and crossing the long oval and sitting down a while generally at the foot of the cross in the centre i always feel as i do so as if i were seated in the depths of some alpine valley the upper portions of the side toward the esquiline look as remote and lonely as an alpine ridge and you raise your eyes to their rugged skyline drinking in the sun and silvered by the blue air with much the same feeling with which you would take in a grey cliff on which an eagle might lodge this roughly mountainous quality of the great ruin is its chief interest beauty of detail has pretty well vanished especially since the highgrowing wildflowers have been plucked away by the new government whose functionaries surely at certain points of their task must have felt as if they shared the dreadful trade of those who gather samphire even if you are on your way to the lateran you wont grudge the twenty minutes it will take you on leaving the colosseum to turn away under the arch of constantine whose noble battered basreliefs with the chain of tragic statuesfettered drooping barbariansround its summit i assume you to have profoundly admired toward the piazzetta of the church of san giovanni e paolo on the slope of caelian no spot in rome can show a cluster of more charming accidents the ancient brick apse of the church peeps down into the trees of the little wooded walk before the neighbouring church of san gregorio intensely venerable beneath its excessive modernisation and a series of heavy brick buttresses flying across to an opposite wall overarches the short steep paved passage which leads into the small square this is flanked on one side by the long mediaeval portico of the church of the two saints sustained by eight timeblackened columns of granite and marble on another rise the great scarcewindowed walls of a passionist convent and on the third the portals of a grand villa whose tall porter with his cockade and silvertopped staff standing sublime behind his grating seems a kind of mundane st peter i suppose to the beggars who sit at the church door or lie in the sun along the farther slope which leads to the gate of the convent the place always seems to me the perfection of an outoftheway cornera place you would think twice before telling people about lest you should find them there the next time you were to go it is such a group of objects singly and in their happy combination as one must come to rome to find at ones house door but what makes it peculiarly a picture is the beautiful dark red campanile of the church which stands embedded in the mass of the convent it begins as so many things in rome begin with a stout foundation of antique travertine and rises high in delicately quaint mediaeval brickworklittle tiers and apertures sustained on miniature columns and adorned with small cracked slabs of green and yellow marble inserted almost at random when there are three or four brownbreasted contadini sleeping in the sun before the convent doors and a departing monk leading his shadow down over them i think you will not find anything in rome more sketchable  if you stop however to observe everything worthy of your water colours you will never reach st john lateran my business was much less with the interior of that vast and empty that cold clean temple which i have never found peculiarly interesting than with certain charming features of its surrounding precinct the crooked old court beside it which admits you to the baptistery and to a delightful rearview of the queer architectural odds and ends that may in rome compose a florid ecclesiastical façade there are more of these a stranger jumble of chance detail of lurking recesses and wanton projections and inexplicable windows than i have memory or phrase for but the gem of the collection is the oddly perched peaked turret with its yellow travertine welded upon the rusty brickwork which was not meant to be suspected and the brickwork retreating beneath and leaving it in the odd position of a tower under which you may see the sky as to the great front of the church overlooking the porta san giovanni you are not admitted behind the scenes the term is quite in keeping for the architecture has a vastly theatrical air it is extremely imposingthat of st peters alone is more so and when from far off on the campagna you see the colossal images of the mitred saints along the top standing distinct against the sky you forget their coarse construction and their inflated draperies the view from the great space which stretches from the church steps to the city wall is the very prince of views just beside you beyond the great alcove of mosaic is the scala santa the marble staircase which says the legend christ descended under the weight of pilates judgment and which all christians must for ever ascend on their knees before you is the city gate which opens upon the via appia nuova the long gaunt file of arches of the claudian aqueduct their jagged ridge stretching away like the vertebral column of some monstrous mouldering skeleton and upon the blooming brown and purple flats and dells of the campagna and the glowing blue of the alban mountains spotted with their white highnestling towns while to your left is the great grassy space lined with dwarfish mulberrytrees which stretches across to the damp little sisterbasilica of santa croce in gerusalemme during a former visit to rome i lost my heart to this idle tract1  1 utterly overbuilt and gone1909  and wasted much time in sitting on the steps of the church and watching certain whitecowled friars who were sure to be passing there for the delight of my eyes there are fewer friars now and there are a great many of the kings recruits who inhabit the exconventual barracks adjoining santa croce and are led forward to practise their goosestep on the sunny turf here too the poor old cardinals who are no longer to be seen on the pincio descend from their mourningcoaches and relax their venerable knees these members alone still testify to the traditional splendour of the princes of the church for as they advance the lifted black petticoat reveals a flash of scarlet stockings and makes you groan at the victory of civilisation over colour  illustration the faÇade of st john lateran rome  if st john lateran disappoints you internally you have an easy compensation in pacing the long lane which connects it with santa maria maggiore and entering the singularly perfect nave of that most delightful of churches the first day of my stay in rome under the old dispensation i spent in wandering at random through the city with accident for my valetdeplace it served me to perfection and introduced me to the best things among others to an immediate happy relation with santa maria maggiore first impressions memorable impressions are generally irrecoverable they often leave one the wiser but they rarely return in the same form i remember of my coming uninformed and unprepared into the place of worship and of curiosity that i have named only that i sat for half an hour on the edge of the base of one of the marble columns of the beautiful nave and enjoyed a perfect revel ofwhat shall i call ittaste intelligence fancy perceptive emotion the place proved so endlessly suggestive that perception became a throbbing confusion of images and i departed with a sense of knowing a good deal that is not set down in murray i have seated myself more than once again at the base of the same column but you live your life only once the parts as well as the whole the obvious charm of the church is the elegant grandeur of the naveits perfect shapeliness and its rich simplicity its long double row of white marble columns and its high flat roof embossed with intricate gildings and mouldings it opens into a choir of an extraordinary splendour of effect which i recommend you to look out for of a fine afternoon at such a time the glowing western light entering the high windows of the tribune kindles the scattered masses of colour into sombre brightness scintillates on the great solemn mosaic of the vault touches the porphyry columns of the superb baldachino with ruby lights and buries its shining shafts in the deeptoned shadows that hang about frescoes and sculptures and mouldings the deeper charm even than in such things however is the social or historic note or tone or atmosphere of the churchi fumble you see for my right expression the sense it gives you in common with most of the roman churches and more than any of them of having been prayed in for several centuries by an endlessly curious and complex society it takes no great attention to let it come to you that the authority of italian catholicism has lapsed not a little in these days not less also perhaps than to feel that as they stand these deserted temples were the fruit of a society leavened through and through by ecclesiastical manners and that they formed for ages the constant background of the human drama they are as one may say the churchiest churches in europethe fullest of gathered memories of the experience of their office theres not a figure one has read of in oldworld annals that isnt to be imagined on proper occasion kneeling before the lampdecked confession beneath the altar of santa maria maggiore one sees after all however even among the most palpable realities very much what the play of ones imagination projects there and i present my remarks simply as a reminder that ones constant excursions into these places are not the least interesting episodes of ones walks in rome  i had meant to give a simple illustration of the churchhabit so to speak but i have given it at such a length as leaves scant space to touch on the innumerable topics brushed by the pen that begins to take roman notes it is by the aimless flânerie which leaves you free to follow capriciously every hint of entertainment that you get to know rome the greater part of the life about you goes on in the streets and for an observer fresh from a country in which town scenery is at the least monotonous incident and character and picture seem to abound i become conscious with compunction let me hasten to add that i have launched myself thus on the subject of roman churches and roman walks without so much as a preliminary allusion to st peters one is apt to proceed thither on rainy days with intentions of exerciseto put the case only at thatand to carry these out body and mind taken as a walk not less than as a church st peters of course reigns alone even for the profane constitutional it serves where the boulevards where piccadilly and broadway fall short and if it didnt offer to our use the grandest area in the world it would still offer the most diverting few great works of art last longer to the curiosity to the perpetually transcended attention you think you have taken the whole thing in but it expands it rises sublime again and leaves your measure itself poor you never let the ponderous leather curtain bang down behind youyour weak lift of a scant edge of whose padded vastness resembles the liberty taken in folding back the parchment corner of some mighty folio page without feeling all former visits to have been but missed attempts at apprehension and the actual to achieve your first real possession the conventional question is ever as to whether one hasnt been disappointed in the size but a few honest folk here and there i hope will never cease to say no the place struck me from the first as the hugest thing conceivablea real exaltation of ones idea of space so that ones entrance even from the great empty square which either glares beneath the deep blue sky or makes of the cool farcast shadow of the immense front something that resembles a big slatecoloured country on a map seems not so much a going in somewhere as a going out the mere man of pleasure in quest of new sensations might well not know where to better his encounter there of the sublime shock that brings him within the threshold to an immediate gasping pause there are days when the vast nave looks mysteriously vaster than on others and the gorgeous baldachino a longer journey beyond the farspreading tessellated plain of the pavement and when the light has yet a quality which lets things loom their largest while the scattered figuresi mean the human for there are plenty of othersmark happily the scale of items and parts then you have only to stroll and stroll and gaze and gaze to watch the glorious altarcanopy lift its bronze architecture its colossal embroidered contortions like a temple within a temple and feel yourself at the bottom of the abysmal shaft of the dome dwindle to a crawling dot  much of the constituted beauty resides in the fact that it is all general beauty that you are appealed to by no specific details or that these at least practically never importunate are as taken for granted as the lieutenants and captains are taken for granted in a great standing armyamong whom indeed individual aspects may figure here the rather shifting range of decorative dignity in which details when observed often prove poor though never not massive and substantially precious and sometimes prove ridiculous the sculptures with the sole exception of michael angelos ineffable pieta which lurks obscurely in a side chapelthis indeed to my sense the rarest artistic combination of the greatest things the hand of man has producedare either bad or indifferent and the universal incrustation of marble though sumptuous enough has a less brilliant effect than much later work of the same sort that for instance of st pauls without the walls the supreme beauty is the splendidly sustained simplicity of the whole the thing represents a prodigious imagination extraordinarily strained yet strained at its happiest pitch without breaking its happiest pitch i say because this is the only creation of its strenuous author in presence of which you are in presence of serenity you may invoke the idea of ease at st peters without a sense of sacrilegewhich you can hardly do if you are at all spiritually nervous in westminster abbey or notre dame the vast enclosed clearness has much to do with the idea there are no shadows to speak of no marked effects of shade only effects of light innumerablypoints at which this element seems to mass itself in airy density and scatter itself in enchanting gradations and cadences it performs the office of gloom or of mystery in gothic churches hangs like a rolling mist along the gilded vault of the nave melts into bright interfusion the mosaic scintillations of the dome clings and clusters and lingers animates the whole huge and otherwise empty shell a good catholic i suppose is the same catholic anywhere before the grandest as well as the humblest altars but to a visitor not formally enrolled st peters speaks less of aspiration than of full and convenient assurance the soul infinitely expands there if one will but all on its quite human level it marvels at the reach of our dreams and the immensity of our resources to be so impressed and put in our place we say is to be sufficiently saved we cant be more than the heaven itself and what specifically celestial beauty such a show or such a substitute may lack it makes up for in certainty and tangibility and yet if ones hours on the scene are not actually spent in praying the spirit seeks it again as for the finer comfort for the blessing exactly of its example its protection and its exclusion when you are weary of the swarming democracy of your fellowtourists of the unremunerative aspects of human nature on corso and pincio of the oppressively frequent combination of coronets on carriage panels and stupid faces in carriages of addled brains and lacquered boots of ruin and dirt and decay of priests and beggars and takers of advantage of the myriad tokens of a halting civilisation the image of the great temple depresses the balance of your doubts seems to rise above even the highest tide of vulgarity and make you still believe in the heroic will and the heroic act its a relief in other words to feel that theres nothing but a cab fare between your pessimism and one of the greatest of human achievements  illustration the colonnade of st peter rome  this might serve as a lenten peroration to these remarks of mine which have strayed so woefully from their jovial text save that i ought fairly to confess that my last impression of the carnival was altogether carnivalesque the merrymaking of shrove tuesday had life and felicity the dead letter of tradition broke out into nature and grace i pocketed my scepticism and spent a long afternoon on the corso almost every one was a masker but you had no need to conform the pelting rain of confetti effectually disguised you i cant say i found it all very exhilarating but here and there i noticed a brighter episodea capering clown inflamed with contagious jollity some finer humourist forming a circle every thirty yards to crow at his indefatigable sallies one clever performer so especially pleased me that i should have been glad to catch a glimpse of the natural man you imagined for him that he was taking a prodigious intellectual holiday and that his gaiety was in inverse ratio to his daily mood dressed as a needy scholar in an ancient eveningcoat and with a rusty black hat and gloves fantastically patched he carried a little volume carefully under his arm his humours were in excellent taste his whole manner the perfection of genteel comedy the crowd seemed to relish him vastly and he at once commanded a gleefully attentive audience many of his sallies i lost those i caught were excellent his trick was often to begin by taking some one urbanely and caressingly by the chin and complimenting him on the intelligenza della sua fisionomia i kept near him as long as i could for he struck me as a real ironic artist cherishing a disinterested and yet at the same time a motived and a moral passion for the grotesque i should have liked howeverif indeed i shouldnt have fearedto see him the next morning or when he unmasked that night over his hardearned supper in a smoky trattoria as the evening went on the crowd thickened and became a motley press of shouting pushing scrambling everything but squabbling revellers the rain of missiles ceased at dusk but the universal deposit of chalk and flour was trampled into a cloud made lurid by flaring pyramids of the gaslamps that replaced for the occasion the stingy roman luminaries early in the evening came off the classic exhibition of the moccoletti which i but half saw like a languid reporter resigned beforehand to be cashiered for want of enterprise from the mouth of a sidestreet over a thousand heads i caught a huge slowmoving illuminated car from which bluelights and rockets and roman candles were in course of discharge meeting all in a dim fuliginous glare far above the housetops it was like a glimpse of some public orgy in ancient babylon in the small hours of the morning walking homeward from a private entertainment i found ash wednesday still kept at bay the corso flaring with light smelt like a circus every one was taking friendly liberties with every one else and using up the dregs of his festive energy in convulsive hootings and gymnastics here and there certain indefatigable spirits clad all in red after the manner of devils and leaping furiously about with torches were supposed to affright you but they shared the universal geniality and bequeathed me no midnight fears as a pretext for keeping lent the carnevale dei preti as i read in that profanely radical sheet the capitale of this too i have been having glimpses going lately into santa francesca romana the picturesque church near the temple of peace i found a feast for the eyesa dim crimsontoned light through curtained windows a great festoon of tapers round the altar a bulging girdle of lamps before the sunken shrine beneath and a dozen whiterobed dominicans scattered in the happiest composition on the pavement it was better than the moccoletti  1873      roman rides   i shall always remember the first i took out of the porta del popolo to where the ponte molle whose single arch sustains a weight of historic tradition compels the sallow tiber to flow between its four greatmannered ecclesiastical statues over the crest of the hill and along the old postingroad to florence it was mild midwinter the season peculiarly of colour on the roman campagna and the light was full of that mellow purple glow that tempered intensity which haunts the aftervisions of those who have known rome like the memory of some supremely irresponsible pleasure an hour away i pulled up and at the edge of a meadow gazed away for some time into remoter distances then and there it seemed to me i measured the deep delight of knowing the campagna but i saw more things in it than i can easily tell the country rolled away around me into slopes and dells of longdrawn grace chequered with purple and blue and blooming brown the lights and shadows were at play on the sabine mountainsan alternation of tones so exquisite as to be conveyed only by some fantastic comparison to sapphire and amber in the foreground a contadino in his cloak and peaked hat jogged solitary on his ass and here and there in the distance among blue undulations some white village some grey tower helped deliciously to make the picture the typical italian landscape of oldfashioned art it was so bright and yet so sad so still and yet so charged to the supersensuous ear with the murmur of an extinguished life that you could only say it was intensely and adorably strange could only impute to the whole overarched scene an unsurpassed secret for bringing tears of appreciation to no matter how ignorant archaeologically ignoranteyes to ride once in these conditions is of course to ride again and to allot to the campagna a generous share of the time one spends in rome  it is a pleasure that doubles ones horizon and one can scarcely say whether it enlarges or limits ones impression of the city proper it certainly makes st peters seem a trifle smaller and blunts the edge of ones curiosity in the forum it must be the effect of the experience at all extended that when you think of rome afterwards you will think still respectfully and regretfully enough of the vatican and the pincio the streets and the picturemaking street life but will even more wonder with an irrepressible contraction of the heart when again you shall feel yourself bounding over the flowersmothered turf or pass from one framed picture to another beside the open arches of the crumbling aqueducts you look back at the city so often from some grassy hilltophugely compact within its walls with st peters overtopping all things and yet seeming small and the vast girdle of marsh and meadow receding on all sides to the mountains and the seathat you come to remember it at last as hardly more than a respectable parenthesis in a great sweep of generalisation within the walls on the other hand you think of your intended ride as the most romantic of all your possibilities of the campagna generally as an illimitable experience ones rides certainly give rome an inordinate scope for the reflectiveby which i suppose i mean after all the aesthetic and the esotericlife to dwell in a city which much as you grumble at it is after all very fairly a modern city with crowds and shops and theatres and cafes and balls and receptions and dinnerparties and all the modern confusion of social pleasures and pains to have at your door the good and evil of it all and yet to be able in half an hour to gallop away and leave it a hundred miles a hundred years behind and to look at the tufted broom glowing on a lonely towertop in the still blue air and the pale pink asphodels trembling none the less for the stillness and the shaggylegged shepherds leaning on their sticks in motionless brotherhood with the heaps of ruin and the scrambling goats and staggering little kids treading out wild desert smells from the top of hollowsounding mounds and then to come back through one of the great gates and a couple of hours later find yourself in the world dressed introduced entertained inquiring talking about middlemarch to a young english lady or listening to neapolitan songs from a gentleman in a very lowcut shirtall this is to lead in a manner a double life and to gather from the hurrying hours more impressions than a mind of modest capacity quite knows how to dispose of  i touched lately upon this theme with a friend who i fancied would understand me and who immediately assured me that he had just spent a day that this mingled diversity of sensation made to the days one spends elsewhere what an uncommonly good novel may be to the daily paper there was an air of idleness about it if you will he said and it was certainly pleasant enough to have been wrong perhaps being after all unused to long stretches of dissipation this was why i had a halffeeling that i was reading an odd chapter in the history of a person very much more of a héros de roman than myself then he proceeded to relate how he had taken a long ride with a lady whom he extremely admired we turned off from the tor di quinto road to that castellated farmhouse you know ofonce a ghibelline fortress whither claude lorraine used to come to paint pictures of which the surrounding landscape is still so artistically so compositionally suggestive we went into the inner court a cloister almost with the carven capitals of its loggia columns and looked at a handsome child swinging shyly against the half opened door of a room whose impenetrable shadow behind her made her as it were a sketch in bituminous watercolours we talked with the farmer a handsome pale fevertainted fellow with a welltodo air that didnt in the least deter his affability from a turn compatible with the acceptance of small coin and then we galloped away and away over the meadows which stretch with hardly a break to veii the day was strangely delicious with a cool grey sky and just a touch of moisture in the air stirred by our rapid motion the campagna in the colourless even light was more solemn and romantic than ever and a ragged shepherd driving a meagre straggling flock whom we stopped to ask our way of was a perfect type of pastoral weatherbeaten misery he was precisely the shepherd for the foreground of a scratchy etching there were faint odours of spring in the air and the grass here and there was streaked with great patches of daisies but it was spring with a foreknowledge of autumn a day to be enjoyed with a substrain of sadness the foreboding of regret a day somehow to make one feel as if one had seen and felt a great dealquite as i say like a heros de roman touching such characters it was the illustrious pelham i think who on being asked if he rode replied that he left those violent exercises to the ladies but under such a sky in such an air over acres of daisied turf a long long gallop is certainly a supersubtle joy the elastic bound of your horse is the poetry of motion and if you are so happy as to add to it not the prose of companionship riding comes almost to affect you as a spiritual exercise my gallop at any rate said my friend threw me into a mood which gave an extraordinary zest to the rest of the day he was to go to a dinnerparty at a villa on the edge of rome and madam x who was also going called for him in her carriage it was a long drive he went on through the forum past the colosseum she told me a long story about a most interesting person toward the end my eyes caught through the carriage window a slab of rugged sculptures we were passing under the arch of constantine in the hall pavement of the villa is a rare antique mosaicone of the largest and most perfect the ladies on their way to the drawing room trail over it the flounces of worth we drove home late and theres my day  on your exit from most of the gates of rome you have generally halfanhours progress through winding lanes many of which are hardly less charming than the open meadows on foot the walls and high hedges would vex you and spoil your walk but in the saddle you generally overtop them to an endless peopling of the minor vision yet a roman wall in the springtime is for that matter almost as interesting as anything it conceals crumbling grain by grain coloured and mottled to a hundred tones by sun and storm with its rugged structure of brick extruding through its coarse complexion of peeling stucco its creeping lacework of wandering ivy starred with miniature violets and its wild fringe of stouter flowers against the skyit is as little as possible a blank partition it is practically a luxury of landscape at the moment at which i write in midapril all the ledges and cornices are wreathed with flaming poppies nodding there as if they knew so well what faded greys and yellows are an offset to their scarlet but the best point in a dilapidated enclosing surface of vineyard or villa is of course the gateway lifting its great arch of cheap rococo scrollwork its balls and shields and mossy dishcoversas they always perversely figure to me and flanked with its dusky cypresses i never pass one without taking out my mental sketchbook and jotting it down as a vignette in the insubstantial record of my ride they are as sad and dreary as if they led to the moated grange where mariana waited in desperation for something to happen and its easy to take the usual inscription over the porch as a recommendation to those who enter to renounce all hope of anything but a glass of more or less agreeably acrid vino romano for what you chiefly see over the walls and at the end of the straight short avenue of rusty cypresses are the appurtenances of a vignaa couple of acres of little upright sticks blackening in the sun and a vast sallowfaced scantily windowed mansion whose expression denotes little of the life of the mind beyond what goes to the driving of a hard bargain over the tasted hogsheads if mariana is there she certainly has no pile of old magazines to beguile her leisure the life of the mind if the term be in any application here not ridiculous appears to any asker of curious questions as he wanders about rome the very thinnest deposit of the past within the rococo gateway which itself has a vaguely esthetic selfconsciousness at the end of the cypress walk you will probably see a mythological group in rusty marblea cupid and psyche a venus and paris an apollo and daphnethe relic of an age when a roman proprietor thought it fine to patronise the arts but i imagine you are safe in supposing it to constitute the only allusion savouring of culture that has been made on the premises for three or four generations  there is a franker cheerfulnessthough certainly a proper amount of that forlornness which lurks about every object to which the campagna forms a backgroundin the primitive little taverns where on the homeward stretch in the waning light you are often glad to rein up and demand a bottle of their best their best and their worst are indeed the same though with a shifting price and plain vino bianco or vino rosso rarely both is the sole article of refreshment in which they deal there is a ragged bush over the door and within under a dusky vault on crooked cobblestones sit halfadozen contadini in their indigo jackets and goatskin breeches and with their elbows on the table there is generally a rabble of infantile beggars at the door pretty enough in their dusty rags with their fine eyes and intense italian smile to make you forget your private vow of doing your individual best i to make these people whom you like so much unlearn their old vices was porta pia bombarded three years ago that peppino should still grow up to whine for a copper but the italian shells had no direct message for peppinos stomachand you are going to a dinnerparty at a villa so peppino points an instant for the copper in the dust and grows up a roman beggar the whole little place represents the most primitive form of hostelry but along any of the roads leading out of the city you may find establishments of a higher type with garibaldi superbly mounted and foreshortened painted on the wall or a lady in a lownecked dress opening a fictive lattice with irresistible hospitality and a yard with the classic vinewreathed arbour casting thin shadows upon benches and tables draped and cushioned with the white dust from which the highways from the gates borrow most of their local colour none the less i say you avoid the highroads and if you are a person of taste dont grumble at the occasional need of following the walls of the city city walls to a properly constituted american can never be an object of indifference and it is emphatically no end of a sensation to pace in the shadow of this massive cincture of rome i have found myself as i skirted its base talking of trivial things but never without a sudden reflection on the deplorable impermanence of first impressions a twelvemonth ago the raw plank fences of a boston suburb inscribed with the virtues of healing drugs bristled along my horizon now i glance with idle eyes at a compacted antiquity in which a more learned sense may read portentous dates and signsservius aurelius honorius but even to idle eyes the prodigious the continuous thing bristles with eloquent passages in some places where the huge brickwork is black with time and certain strange square towers look down at you with still blue eyes the roman sky peering through lidless loopholes and there is nothing but white dust in the road and solitude in the air i might take myself for a wandering tartar touching on the confines of the celestial empire the wall of china must have very much such a gaunt robustness the colour of the roman ramparts is everywhere fine and their rugged patchwork has been subdued by time and weather into a mellow harmony that the brush only asks to catch up on the northern side of the city behind the vatican st peters and the trastevere i have seen them glowing in the late afternoon with the tones of ancient bronze and rusty gold here at various points they are embossed with the papal insignia the tiara with its flying bands and crossed keys to the high style of which the grace that attaches to almost any lost causeeven if not quite the tender grace of a day that is deadconsiderably adds a style with the dome of st peters resting on their cornice and the hugely clustered architecture of the vatican rising from them as from a terrace they seem indeed the valid bulwark of an ecclesiastical city vain bulwark alas sighs the sentimental tourist fresh from the meagre entertainment of this latter holy week but he may find monumental consolation in this neighbourhood at a source where as i pass i never fail to apply for it at halfanhours walk beyond porta san pancrazio beneath the wall of the villa doria is a delightfully pompous ecclesiastical gateway of the seventeenth century erected by paul v to commemorate his restoration of the aqueducts through which the stream bearing his name flows towards the fine florid portico protecting its clear sheeted outgush on the crest of the janiculan it arches across the road in the most ornamental manner of the period and one can hardly pause before it without seeming to assist at a ten minutes revival of old italywithout feeling as if one were in a cocked hat and sword and were coming up to rome in another mood than luthers with a letter of recommendation to the mistress of a cardinal  the campagna differs greatly on the two sides of the tiber and it is hard to say which for the rider has the greater charm the halfdozen rides you may take from porta san giovanni possess the perfection of traditional roman interest and lead you through a farstrewn wilderness of ruinsa scattered maze of tombs and towers and nameless fragments of antique masonry the landscape here has two great features close before you on one side is the long gentle swell of the alban hills deeply fantastically blue in most weathers and marbled with the vague white masses of their scattered towns and villas it would be difficult to draw the hard figure to a softer curve than that with which the heights sweep from albano to the plain this a perfect example of the classic beauty of line in the italian landscapethat beauty which when it fills the background of a picture makes us look in the foreground for a broken column couched upon flowers and a shepherd piping to dancing nymphs at your side constantly you have the broken line of the claudian aqueduct carrying its broad arches far away into the plain the meadows along which it lies are not the smoothest in the world for a gallop but there is no pleasure greater than to wander near it it stands kneedeep in the flowerstrewn grass and its rugged piers are hung with ivy as the columns of a church are draped for a festa every archway is a picture massively framed of the distance beyondof the snowtipped sabines and lonely soracte as the spring advances the whole campagna smiles and waves with flowers but i think they are nowhere more rank and lovely than in the shifting shadow of the aqueducts where they muffle the feet of the columns and smother the halfdozen brooks which wander in and out like silver meshes between the legs of a file of giants they make a niche for themselves too in every crevice and tremble on the vault of the empty conduits the ivy hereabouts in the springtime is peculiarly brilliant and delicate and though it cloaks and muffles these roman fragments far less closely than the castles and abbeys of england it hangs with the light elegance of all italian vegetation it is partly doubtless because their mighty outlines are still unsoftened that the aqueducts are so impressive they seem the very source of the solitude in which they stand they look like architectural spectres and loom through the light mists of their grassy desert as you recede along the line with the same insubstantial vastness as if they rose out of egyptian sands it is a great neighbourhood of ruins many of which it must be confessed you have applauded in many an album but station a peasant with sheepskin coat and bandaged legs in the shadow of a tomb or tower best known to drawingroom art and scatter a dozen goats on the mound above him and the picture has a charm which has not yet been sketched away  the other quarter of the campagna has wider fields and smoother turf and perhaps a greater number of delightful rides the earth is sounder and there are fewer pitfalls and ditches the land for the most part lies higher and catches more wind and the grass is here and there for great stretches as smooth and level as a carpet you have no alban mountains before you but you have in the distance the waving ridge of the nearer apennines and west of them along the course of the tiber the long seaward level of deepcoloured fields deepening as they recede to the blue and purple of the sea itself beyond them of a very clear day you may see the glitter of the mediterranean these are the occasions perhaps to remember most fondly for they lead you to enchanting nooks and the landscape has details of the highest refinement indeed when my sense reverts to the lingering impressions of so blest a time it seems a fools errand to have attempted to express them and a waste of words to do more than recommend the reader to go citywards at twilight of the end of march making for porta cavalleggieri and note what he sees at this hour the campagna is to the last point its melancholy self and i remember roadside effects of a strange and intense suggestiveness certain mean mouldering villas behind grass grown courts have an indefinably sinister look there was one in especial of which it was impossible not to argue that a despairing creature must have once committed suicide there behind bolted door and barred window and that no one has since had the pluck to go in and see why he never came out every wayside mark of manners of history every stamp of the past in the country about rome touches my sense to a thrill and i may thus exaggerate the appeal of very common things this is the more likely because the appeal seems ever to rise out of heaven knows what depths of ancient trouble to delight in the aspects of sentient ruin might appear a heartless pastime and the pleasure i confess shows the note of perversity the sombre and the hard are as common an influence from southern things as the soft and the bright i think sadness rarely fails to assault a northern observer when he misses what he takes for comfort beauty is no compensation for the loss only making it more poignant enough beauty of climate hangs over these roman cottages and farmhousesbeauty of light of atmosphere and of vegetation but their charm for the makerout of the stories in things is the way the golden air shows off their desolation man lives more with nature in italy than in new or than in old england she does more work for him and gives him more holidays than in our shortsummered climes and his home is therefore much more bare of devices for helping him to do without her forget her and forgive her these reflections are perhaps the source of the character you find in a mosscoated stone stairway climbing outside of a wall in a queer inner court befouled with rubbish and drearily bare of convenience in an ancient quaintly carven well worked with infinite labour from an overhanging window in an arbour of timetwisted vines under which you may sit with your feet in the dirt and remember as a dim fable that there are races for which the type of domestic allurement is the parlour hearth rug for reasons apparent or otherwise these things amuse me beyond expression and i am never weary of staring into gateways of lingering by dreary shabby halfbarbaric farmyards of feasting a foolish gaze on suncracked plaster and unctuous indoor shadows i mustnt forget however that its not for wayside effects that one rides away behind st peters but for the strong sense of wandering over boundless space of seeing great classic lines of landscape of watching them dispose themselves into pictures so full of style that you can think of no painter who deserves to have you admit that they suggest him hardly knowing whether it is better pleasure to gallop far and drink deep of air and grassy distance and the whole delicious opportunity or to walk and pause and linger and try and grasp some ineffaceable memory of sky and colour and outline your pace can hardly help falling into a contemplative measure at the time everywhere so wonderful but in rome so persuasively divine when the winter begins palpably to soften and quicken far out on the campagna early in february you feel the first vague earthly emanations which in a few weeks come wandering into the heart of the city and throbbing through the close dark streets springtime in rome is an immensely poetic affair but you must stand often far out in the ancient waste between grass and sky to measure its deep full steadily accelerated rhythm the winter has an incontestable beauty and is preeminently the time of colourthe time when it is no affectation but homely verity to talk about the purple tone of the atmosphere as february comes and goes your purple is streaked with green and the rich dark bloom of the distance begins to lose its intensity but your loss is made up by other gains none more precious than that inestimable gain to the earthe disembodied voice of the lark it comes with the early flowers the white narcissus and the cyclamen the halfburied violets and the pale anemones and makes the whole atmosphere ring like a vault of tinkling glass you never see the source of the sound and are utterly unable to localise his note which seems to come from everywhere at once to be some hundredthroated voice of the air sometimes you fancy you just catch him a mere vague spot against the blue an intenser throb in the universal pulsation of light as the weeks go on the flowers multiply and the deep blues and purples of the hills turning to azure and violet creep higher toward the narrowing snowline of the sabines the temperature rises the first hour of your ride you feel the heat but you beguile it with brushing the hawthornblossoms as you pass along the hedges and catching at the wild rose and honeysuckle and when you get into the meadows there is stir enough in the air to lighten the dead weight of the sun the roman air however is not a tonic medicine and it seldom suffers exercise to be all exhilarating it has always seemed to me indeed part of the charm of the latter that your keenest consciousness is haunted with a vague languor occasionally when the sirocco blows that sensation becomes strange and exquisite then under the grey sky before the dim distances which the southwind mostly brings with it you seem to ride forth into a world from which all hope has departed and in which in spite of the flowers that make your horses footfalls soundless nothing is left save some queer probability that your imagination is unable to measure but from which it hardly shrinks this quality in the roman element may now and then relax you almost to ecstasy but a season of sirocco would be an overdose of morbid pleasure you may at any rate best feel the peculiar beauty of the campagna on those mild days of winter when the mere quality and temper of the sunshine suffice to move the landscape to joy and you pause on the brown grass in the sunny stillness and by listening long enough almost fancy you hear the shrill of the midsummer cricket it is detail and ornament that vary from month to month from week to week even and make your returns to the same places a constant feast of unexpectedness but the great essential features of the prospect preserve throughout the year the same impressive serenity soracte be it january or may rises from its blue horizon like an island from the sea and with an elegance of contour which no mood of the year can deepen or diminish you know it well you have seen it often in the mellow backgrounds of claude and it has such an irresistibly classic academic air that while you look at it you begin to take your saddle for a faded old arm chair in a palace gallery a months rides in different directions will show you a dozen prime claudes after i had seen them all i went piously to the doria gallery to refresh my memory of its two famous specimens and to enjoy to the utmost their delightful air of reference to something that had become a part of my personal experience delightful it certainly is to feel the common element in ones own sensibility and those of a genius whom that element has helped to do great things claude must have haunted the very places of ones personal preference and adjusted their divine undulations to his splendid scheme of romance his view of the poetry of life he was familiar with aspects in which there wasnt a single uncompromising line i saw a few days ago a small finished sketch from his hand in the possession of an american artist which was almost startling in its clear reflection of forms unaltered by the two centuries that have dimmed and cracked the paint and canvas  this unbroken continuity of the impressions i have tried to indicate is an excellent example of the intellectual background of all enjoyment in rome it effectually prevents pleasure from becoming vulgar for your sensation rarely begins and ends with itself it reverberatesit recalls commemorates resuscitates something else at least half the merit of everything you enjoy must be that it suits you absolutely but the larger half here is generally that it has suited some one else and that you can never flatter yourself you have discovered it it has been addressed to some use a million miles out of your range and has had great adventures before ever condescending to please you it was in admission of this truth that my discriminating friend who showed me the claudes found it impossible to designate a certain delightful region which you enter at the end of an hours riding from porta cavalleggieri as anything but arcadia the exquisite correspondence of the term in this case altogether revived its faded bloom here veritably the oaten pipe must have stirred the windless air and the satyrs have laughed among the brookside reeds three or four long grassy dells stretch away in a chain between low hills over which delicate trees are so discreetly scattered that each one is a resting place for a shepherd the elements of the scene are simple enough but the composition has extraordinary refinement by one of those happy chances which keep observation in italy always in her best humour a shepherd had thrown himself down under one of the trees in the very attitude of meliboeus he had been washing his feet i suppose in the neighbouring brook and had found it pleasant afterwards to roll his short breeches well up on his thighs lying thus in the shade on his elbow with his naked legs stretched out on the turf and his soft peaked hat over his long hair crushed back like the veritable bonnet of arcady he was exactly the figure of the background of this happy valley the poor fellow lying there in rustic weariness and ignorance little fancied that he was a symbol of oldworld meanings to newworld eyes  such eyes may find as great a store of picturesque meanings in the corkwoods of monte mario tenderly loved of all equestrians these are less severely pastoral than our arcadia and you might more properly lodge there a damosel of ariosto than a nymph of theocritus among them is strewn a lovely wilderness of flowers and shrubs and the whole place has such a charming woodland air that casting about me the other day for a compliment i declared that it reminded me of new hampshire my compliment had a double edge and i had no sooner uttered it than i smiledor sighedto perceive in all the undiscriminated botany about me the wealth of detail the idle elegance and grace of italy alone the natural stamp of the land which has the singular privilege of making one love her unsanctified beauty all but as well as those features of ones own country toward which natures small allowance doubles that of ones own affection for this effect of casting a spell no rides have more value than those you take in villa doria or villa borghese or dont take possibly if you prefer to reserve these particular regionsthe latter in especialfor your walking hours people do ride however in both villas which deserve honourable mention in this regard villa doria with its noble site its splendid views its great groups of stonepines so clustered and yet so individual its lawns and flowers and fountains its altogether princely disposition is a place where one may pace well mounted of a brilliant day with an agreeable sense of its being rather a more elegant pastime to balance in ones stirrups than to trudge on even the smoothest gravel but at villa borghese the walkers have the best of it for they are free of those adorable outlying corners and bosky byways which the rumble of barouches never reaches in march the place becomes a perfect epitome of the spring you cease to care much for the melancholy greenness of the disfeatured statues which has been your chief winters intimation of verdure and before you are quite conscious of the tender streaks and patches in the great quaint grassy arena round which the propaganda students in their long skirts wander slowly like dusky seraphs revolving the gossip of paradise you spy the brave little violets uncapping their azure brows beneath the highstemmed pines ones walks here would take us too far and ones pauses detain us too long when in the quiet parts under the wall one comes across a group of charming small school boys in fulldress suits and white cravats shouting over their play in clear italian while a grave young priest beneath a tree watches them over the top of his book it sounds like nothing but the force behind it and the frame round it the setting the air the chord struck make it a hundred wonderful things  1873      roman neighbourhoods   i made a note after my first stroll at albano to the effect that i had been talking of the picturesque all my life but that now for a change i beheld it i had been looking all winter across the campagna at the freeflowing outline of the alban mount with its halfdozen towns shining on its purple side even as vague sunspots in the shadow of a cloud and thinking it simply an agreeable incident in the varied background of rome but now that during the last few days i have been treating it as a foreground have been suffering st peters to play the part of a small mountain on the horizon with the campagna swimming mistily through the ambiguous lights and shadows of the interval i find the interest as great as in the best of the byplay of rome the walk i speak of was just out of the village to the south toward the neighbouring town of lariccia neighbouring these twenty years since the pope the late pope i was on the point of calling him threw his superb viaduct across the deep ravine which divides it from albano at the risk of seeming to fantasticate i confess that the popes having built the viaduct in this very recent antiquitymade me linger there in a pensive posture and marvel at the march of history and at pius the ninths beginning already to profit by the sentimental allowances we make to vanished powers an ardent nero then would have had his own way with me and obtained a frank admission that the pope was indeed a father to his people far down into the charming valley which slopes out of the ancestral woods of the chigis into the level campagna winds the steep stonepaved road at the bottom of which in the good old days tourists in no great hurry saw the mules and oxen tackled to their carriage for the opposite ascent and indeed even an impatient tourist might have been content to lounge back in his jolting chaise and look out at the mouldy foundations of the little city plunging into the verdurous flank of the gorge questioned as a cherisher of quaintness as to the best bit hereabouts i should certainly name the way in which the crumbling black houses of these ponderous villages plant their weary feet on the flowery edges of all the steepest chasms before you enter one of them you invariably find yourself lingering outside its pretentious old gateway to see it clutched and stitched to the stony hillside by this rank embroidery of the wildest and bravest things that grow just at this moment nothing is prettier than the contrast between their dusky ruggedness and the tender the yellow and pink and violet fringe of that mantle all this you may observe from the viaduct at the ariccia but you must wander below to feel the full force of the eloquence of our imaginary papalino the pillars and arches of pale grey peperino arise in huge tiers with a magnificent spring and solidity the older romans built no better and the work has a deceptive air of being one of their sturdy bequests which help one to drop another sigh over the antecedents the italians of today are so eager to repudiate will those they give their descendants be as good  at the ariccia in any case i found a little square with a couple of mossy fountains occupied on one side by a vast dusky faced palazzo chigi and on the other by a goodly church with an imposing dome the dome within covers the whole edifice and is adorned with some extremely elegant stuccowork of the seventeenth century it gave a great value to this fine old decoration that preparations were going forward for a local festival and that the village carpenter was hanging certain mouldy strips of crimson damask against the piers of the vaults the damask might have been of the seventeenth century too and a group of peasantwomen were seeing it unfurled with evident awe i regarded it myself with interestit seemed so the tattered remnant of a fashion that had gone out for ever i thought again of the poor disinherited pope wondering whether when such venerable frippery will no longer bear the carpenters nails any more will be provided it was hard to fancy anything but shreds and patches in that musty tabernacle wherever you go in italy you receive some such intimation as this of the shrunken proportions of catholicism and every church i have glanced into on my walks hereabouts has given me an almost pitying sense of it one finds ones self at lastwithout fatuity i hope feeling sorry for the solitude of the remaining faithful its as if the churches had been made so for the world in its social sense and the world had so irrevocably moved away they are in size out of all modern proportion to the local needs and the only thing at all alive in the melancholy waste they collectively form is the smell of stale incense there are pictures on all the altars by respectable thirdrate painters pictures which i suppose once were ordered and paid for and criticised by worshippers who united taste with piety at genzano beyond the ariccia rises on the grey village street a pompous renaissance temple whose imposing nave and aisles would contain the population of a capital but where is the taste of the ariccia and genzano where are the choice spirits for whom antonio raggi modelled the garlands of his dome and a hundred clever craftsmen imitated guido and caravaggio here and there from the pavement as you pass a dusky crone interlards her devotions with more profane importunities or a grizzled peasant on rustyjointed knees tilted forward with his elbows on a bench reveals the dimensions of the patch in his blue breeches but where is the connecting link between guido and caravaggio and those poor souls for whom an undoubted original is only a something behind a row of candlesticks of no very clear meaning save that you must bow to it you find a vague memory of it at best in the useless grandeurs about you and you seem to be looking at a structure of which the stubborn earthscented foundations alone remain with the carved and painted shell that bends above them while the central substance has utterly crumbled away  i shall seem to have adopted a more meditative pace than befits a brisk constitutional if i say that i also fell athinking before the shabby façade of the old chigi palace but it seemed somehow in its grey forlornness to respond to the sadly superannuated expression of the opposite church and indeed in any condition what selfrespecting cherisher of quaintness can forbear to do a little romancing in the shadow of a provincial palazzo on the face of the matter i know there is often no very salient peg to hang a romance on a sort of dusky blankness invests the establishment which has often a rather imbecile old age but a hundred brooding secrets lurk in this inexpressive mask and the chigi palace did duty for me in the suggestive twilight as the most haunted of houses its basement walls sloped outward like the beginning of a pyramid and its lower windows were covered with massive iron cages within the doorway across the court i saw the pale glimmer of flowers on a terrace and i made much for the effect of the roof of a great covered loggia or belvedere with a dozen windowpanes missing or mended with paper nothing gives one a stronger impression of old manners than an ancestral palace towering in this haughty fashion over a shabby little town you hardly stretch a point when you call it an impression of feudalism the scene may pass for feudal to american eyes for which a hundred windows on a facade mean nothing more exclusive than a hotel kept at the most invidious on the european plan the mouldy grey houses on the steep crooked street with their black cavernous archways pervaded by bad smells by the braying of asses and by human intonations hardly more musical the haggard and tattered peasantry staring at you with hungryheavy eyes the brutishlooking monks there are still enough to point a moral the soldiers the mounted constables the dirt the dreariness the misery and the dark overgrown palace frowning over it all from barred window and guarded gatewaywhat more than all this do we dimly descry in a mental image of the dark ages for all his desire to keep the peace with the vivid image of things if it be only vivid enough the votary of this ideal may well occasionally turn over such values with the wonder of what one takes them as paying for they pay sometimes for such sorry facts of life at genzano out of the very midst of the village squalor rises the palazzo cesarini separated from its gardens by a dirty lane between peasant and prince the contact is unbroken and one would suppose italian goodnature sorely taxed by their mutual allowances that the prince in especial must cultivate a firm impervious shell there are no comfortable townsfolk about him to remind him of the blessings of a happy mediocrity of fortune when he looks out of his window he sees a battered old peasant against a sunny wall sawing off his dinner from a hunch of black bread  i must confess however that feudal as it amused me to find the little piazza of the ariccia it appeared to threaten in no manner an exasperated rising on the contrary the afternoon being cool many of the villagers were contentedly muffled in those ancient cloaks lined with green baize which when tossed over the shoulder and surmounted with a peaked hat form one of the few lingering remnants of costume in italy others were tossing wooden balls lightheartedly enough on the grass outside the town the egress on this side is under a great stone archway thrown out from the palace and surmounted with the family arms nothing could better confirm your theory that the townsfolk are groaning serfs the road leads away through the woods like many of the roads hereabouts among trees less remarkable for their size than for their picturesque contortions and posturings the woods at the moment at which i write are full of the raw green light of early spring a jour vastly becoming to the various complexions of the wild flowers that cover the waysides i have never seen these untended parterres in such lovely exuberance the sturdiest pedestrian becomes a lingering idler if he allows them to catch his eye the pale purple cyclamen with its hood thrown back stands up in masses as dense as tulipbeds and here and there in the duskier places great sheets of forget menot seem to exhale a faint blue mist these are the commonest plants there are dozens more i know no name fora rich profusion in especial of a beautiful fivepetalled flower whose white texture is pencilled with hairstrokes certain fair copyists i know of would have to hold their breath to imitate an italian oak has neither the girth nor the height of its english brothers but it contrives in proportion to be perhaps even more effective it crooks its back and twists its arms and clinches its hundred fists with the queerest extravagance and wrinkles its bark into strange rugosities from which its first scattered sprouts of yellow green seem to break out like a morbid fungus but the tree which has the greatest charm to northern eyes is the cold greygreen ilex whose clear crepuscular shade drops against a roman sun a veil impenetrable yet not oppressive the ilex has even less colour than the cypress but it is much less funereal and a landscape in which it is frequent may still be said to smile faintly though by no means to laugh it abounds in old italian gardens where the boughs are trimmed and interlocked into vaulted corridors in which from point to point as in the niches of some dimly frescoed hall you see mildewed busts stare at you with a solemnity which the even grey light makes strangely intense a humbler relative of the ilex though it does better things than help brokennosed emperors to look dignified is the olive which covers many of the neighbouring hillsides with its little smoky puffs of foliage a stroke of composition i never weary of is that long blue stretch of the campagna which makes a high horizon and rests on this vaporous base of olivetops a reporter intent upon a simile might liken it to the ocean seen above the smoke of watchfires kindled on the strand  to do perfect justice to the woodwalk away from the ariccia i ought to touch upon the birds that were singing vespers as i passed but the reader would find my rhapsody as poor entertainment as the programme of a concert he had been unable to attend i have no more learning about birdmusic than would help me to guess that a dull dissyllabic refrain in the heart of the wood came from the cuckoo and when at moments i heard a twitter of fuller tone with a more suggestive modulation i could only hope it was the nightingale i have listened for the nightingale more than once in places so charming that his song would have seemed but the articulate expression of their beauty and have never heard much beyond a provoking snatch or twoa prelude that came to nothing in spite of a natural grudge however i generously believe him a great artist or at least a great geniusa creature who despises any prompting short of absolute inspiration for the rich the multitudinous melody around me seemed but the offering to my ear of the prodigal spirit of tradition the wood was ringing with sound because it was twilight spring and italy it was also because of these good things and various others besides that i relished so keenly my visit to the capuchin convent upon which i emerged after halfan hour in the wood it stands above the town on the slope of the alban mount and its wild garden climbs away behind it and extends its melancholy influence before it is a small stiff avenue of trimmed liveoaks which conducts you to a grotesque little shrine beneath the staircase ascending to the church just here if you are apt to grow timorous at twilight you may take a very pretty fright for as you draw near you catch behind the grating of the shrine the startling semblance of a gaunt and livid monk a sickly lamplight plays down upon his face and he stares at you from cavernous eyes with a dreadful air of death in life horror of horrors you murmur is this a capuchin penance you discover of course in a moment that it is only a capuchin joke that the monk is a pious dummy and his spectral visage a matter of the paintbrush you resent his intrusion on the surrounding loveliness and as you proceed to demand entertainment at their convent you pronounce the capuchins very foolish fellows this declaration as i made it was supported by the conduct of the simple brother who opened the door of the cloister in obedience to my knock and on learning my errand demurred about admitting me at so late an hour if i would return on the morrow morning hed be most happy he broke into a blank grin when i assured him that this was the very hour of my desire and that the garish morning light would do no justice to the view these were mysteries beyond his ken and it was only his goodnature of which he had plenty and not his imagination that was moved so that when passing through the narrow cloister and out upon the grassy terrace i saw another cowled brother standing with folded hands profiled against the sky in admirable harmony with the scene i questioned his knowing the uses for which he is still most precious this however was surely too much to ask of him and it was cause enough for gratitude that though he was there before me he was not a fellowtourist with an operaglass slung over his shoulder there was support to my idea of the convent in the expiring light for the scene was in its way unsurpassable directly below the terrace lay the deep set circle of the alban lake shining softly through the light mists of evening this beautiful poolit is hardly more occupies the crater of a prehistoric volcano a perfect cup shaped and smelted by furnacefires the rim of the cup rising high and densely wooded round the placid stoneblue water has a sort of natural artificiality the sweep and contour of the long circle are admirable never was a lake so charmingly lodged it is said to be of extraordinary depth and though stoneblue water seems at first a very innocent substitute for boiling lava it has a sinister look which betrays its dangerous antecedents the winds never reach it and its surface is never ruffled but its deepbosomed placidity seems to cover guilty secrets and you fancy it in communication with the capricious and treacherous forces of nature its very colour is of a joyless beauty a blue as cold and opaque as a solidified sheet of lava streaked and wrinkled by a mysterious motion of its own it affects the very type of a legendary pool and i could easily have believed that i had only to sit long enough into the evening to see the ghosts of classic nymphs and naiads cleave its sullen flood and beckon me with irresistible arms is it because its shores are haunted with these vague pagan influences that two convents have risen there to purge the atmosphere from the capuchin terrace you look across at the grey franciscan monastery of palazzuola which is not less romantic certainly than the most obstinate myth it may have exorcised the capuchin garden is a wild tangle of great trees and shrubs and clinging trembling vines which in these hard days are left to take care of themselves a weedy garden if there ever was one but none the less charming for that in the deepening dusk with its steep grassy vistas struggling away into impenetrable shadow i braved the shadow for the sake of climbing upon certain little flatroofed crumbling pavilions that rise from the corners of the further wall and give you a wider and lovelier view of lake and hills and sky  i have perhaps justified to the reader the mild proposition with which i startedconvinced him that is that albano is worth a walk it may be a different walk each day moreover and not resemble its predecessors save by its keeping in the shade galleries the roads are prettily called and with the justice that they are vaulted and draped overhead and hung with an immense succession of pictures as you follow the few miles from genzano to frascati you have perpetual views of the campagna framed by clusters of trees the vast iridescent expanse of which completes the charm and comfort of your verdurous dusk i compared it just now to the sea and with a good deal of truth for it has the same incalculable lights and shades the same confusion of glitter and gloom but i have seen it at moments chiefly in the misty twilightwhen it resembled less the waste of waters than something more portentous the land itself in fatal dissolution i could believe the fields to be dimly surging and tossing and melting away into quicksands and that ones very last chance of an impression was taking place a view however which has the merit of being really as interesting as it seems is that of the lake of nemi which the enterprising traveller hastens to compare with its sister sheet of albano comparison in this case is particularly odious for in order to prefer one lake to the other you have to discover faults where there are none nemi is a smaller circle but lies in a deeper cup and if with no grey franciscan pile to guard its woody shores at least in the same position the little highperched black town to which it gives its name and which looks across at genzano on the opposite shore as palazzuola regards castel gandolfo the walk from the ariccia to genzano is charming most of all when it reaches a certain grassy piazza from which three public avenues stretch away under a double row of stunted and twisted elms the duke cesarini has a villa at genzanoi mentioned it just nowwhose gardens overhang the lake but he has also a porter in a faded rakishlooking livery who shakes his head at your proffered franc unless you can reinforce it with a permit countersigned at rome for this annoying complication of dignities he is justly to be denounced but i forgive him for the sake of that ancestor who in the seventeenth century planted this shady walk never was a prettier approach to a town than by these lowroofed light chequered corridors their only defect is that they prepare you for a town of rather more rustic coquetry than genzano exhibits it has quite the usual allowance the common cynicism of accepted decay and looks dismally as if its best families had all fallen into penury together and lost the means of keeping anything better than donkeys in their great dark vaulted basements and mending their broken windowpanes with anything better than paper it was on the occasion of this drear genzano that i had a difference of opinion with a friend who maintained that there was nothing in the same line so pretty in europe as a pretty new england village the proposition seemed to a cherisher of quaintness on the face of it inacceptable but calmly considered it has a measure of truth i am not fond of chalk white painted planks certainly i vastly prefer the dusky tones of ancient stucco and peperino but i succumb on occasion to the charms of a vineshaded porch of tulips and dahlias glowing in the shade of higharching elms of heavyscented lilacs bending over a white paling to brush your cheek  i prefer siena to lowell said my friend but i prefer farmington to such a thing as this in fact an italian village is simply a miniature italian city and its various parts imply a town of fifty times the size at genzano are neither dahlias nor lilacs and no odours but foul ones flowers and other graces are all confined to the highwalled precincts of duke cesarini to which you must obtain admission twenty miles away the houses on the other hand would generally lodge a new england cottage porch and garden and higharching elms included in one of their cavernous basements these vast grey dwellings are all of a fashion denoting more generous social needs than any they serve nowadays they speak of better days and of a fabulous time when italy was either not shabby or could at least carry off her shabbiness for what follies are they doing penance through what melancholy stages have their fortunes ebbed you ask these questions as you choose the shady side of the long blank street and watch the hot sun glare upon the dustcoloured walls and pause before the fetid gloom of open doors  i should like to spare a word for mouldy little nemi perched upon a cliff high above the lake at the opposite side but after all when i had climbed up into it from the waterside passing beneath a great arch which i suppose once topped a gateway and counted its twenty or thirty apparent inhabitants peeping at me from black doorways and looked at the old round tower at whose base the village clusters and declared that it was all queer queer desperately queer i had said all that is worth saying about it nemi has a much better appreciation of its lovely position than genzano where your only view of the lake is from a dunghill behind one of the houses at the foot of the round tower is an overhanging terrace from which you may feast your eyes on the only freshness they find in these dusky human hivesthe blooming seam as one may call it of strong wild flowers which binds the crumbling walls to the face of the cliff of rocca di papa i must say as little it consorted generally with the bravery of its name but the only object i made a note of as i passed through it on my way to monte cavo which rises directly above it was a little black house with a tablet in its face setting forth that massimo d azeglio had dwelt there the story of his sojourn is not the least attaching episode in his delightful ricordi from the summit of monte cavo is a prodigious view which you may enjoy with whatever goodnature is left you by the reflection that the modern passionist convent occupying this admirable site was erected by the cardinal of york grandson of james ii on the demolished ruins of an immemorial temple of jupiter the last foolish act of a foolish race for me i confess this folly spoiled the convent and the convent all but spoiled the view for i kept thinking how fine it would have been to emerge upon the old pillars and sculptures from the lava pavement of the via triumphalis which wanders grassgrown and untrodden through the woods a convent however which nothing spoils is that of palazzuola to which i paid my respects on this same occasion it rises on a lower spur of monte cavo on the edge as we have seen of the alban lake and though it occupies a classic site that of early alba longa it displaced nothing more precious than memories and legends so dim that the antiquarians are still quarrelling about them it has a meagre little church and the usual sham perugino with a couple of tinsel crowns for the madonna and the infant inserted into the canvas and it has also a musty old room hung about with faded portraits and charts and queer ecclesiastical knickknacks which borrowed a mysterious interest from the sudden assurance of the simple franciscan brother who accompanied me that it was the room of the son of the king of portugal but my peculiar pleasure was the little thickshaded garden which adjoins the convent and commands from its massive artificial foundations an enchanting view of the lake part of it is laid out in cabbages and lettuce over which a rubicund brother with his frock tucked up was bending with a solicitude which he interrupted to remove his skullcap and greet me with the unsophisticated sweethumoured smile that every now and then in italy does so much to make you forget the ambiguities of monachism the rest is occupied by cypresses and other funereal umbrage making a dank circle round an old cracked fountain black with watermoss the parapet of the terrace is furnished with good stone seats where you may lean on your elbows to gaze away a sunny halfhour and feeling the general charm of the scene declare that the best mission of such a country in the world has been simply to produce in the way of prospect and picture these masterpieces of mildness mild here as a dream the whole attained effect mild as resignation mild as ones thoughts of another life such a session wasnt surely an experience of the irritable flesh it was the deep degustation on a summers day of something immortally expressed by a man of genius  illustration castel gandolfo  from albano you may take your way through several ancient little cities to frascati a rival centre of villeggiatura the road following the hillside for a long mornings walk and passing through alternations of denser and clearer shadethe dark vaulted alleys of ilex and the brilliant corridors of fresh sprouting oak the campagna is beneath you continually with the sea beyond ostia receiving the silver arrows of the sun upon its chased and burnished shield and mighty rome to the north lying at no great length in the idle immensity around it the highway passes below castel gandolfo which stands perched on an eminence behind a couple of gateways surmounted with the papal tiara and twisted cordon and i have more than once chosen the roundabout road for the sake of passing beneath these pompous insignia castel gandolfo is indeed an ecclesiastical village and under the peculiar protection of the popes whose huge summerpalace rises in the midst of it like a rural vatican in speaking of the road to frascati i necessarily revert to my first impressions gathered on the occasion of the feast of the annunziata which falls on the 25th of march and is celebrated by a peasants fair as murray strongly recommends you to visit this spectacle at which you are promised a brilliant exhibition of all the costumes of modern latium i took an early train to frascati and measured in company with a prodigious stream of humble pedestrians the halfhours interval to grotta ferrata where the fair is held the road winds along the hillside among the silversprinkled olives and through a charming wood where the ivy seemed tacked upon the oaks by womens fingers and the birds were singing to the late anemones it was covered with a very jolly crowd of vulgar pleasuretakers and the only creatures not in a state of manifest hilarity were the pitiful little overladen overbeaten donkeys who surely deserve a chapter to themselves in any description of these neighbourhoods and the horrible beggars who were thrusting their sores and stumps at you from under every tree every one was shouting singing scrambling making light of dust and distance and filling the air with that childlike jollity which the blessed italian temperament never goes roundabout to conceal there is no crowd surely at once so jovial and so gentle as an italian crowd and i doubt if in any other country the tightly packed thirdclass car in which i went out from rome would have introduced me to so much smiling and so little swearing grotta ferrata is a very dirty little village with a number of raw new houses baking on the hot hillside and nothing to charm the fond gazer but its situation and its old fortified abbey after pushing about among the shabby little booths and declining a number of fabulous bargains in tinware shoes and pork i was glad to retire to a comparatively uninvaded corner of the abbey and divert myself with the view this grey ecclesiastical stronghold is a thoroughly scenic affair hanging over the hillside on plunging foundations which bury themselves among the dense olives it has massive round towers at the corners and a grassgrown moat enclosing a church and a monastery the forecourt within the abbatial gateway now serves as the public square of the village and in fairtime of course witnesses the best of the fun the best of the fun was to be found in certain great vaults and cellars of the abbey where wine was in free flow from gigantic hogsheads at the exit of these trickling grottos shady trellises of bamboo and gathered twigs had been improvised and under them a grand guzzling proceeded all of which was so in the fine old style that i was roughly reminded of the weddingfeast of gamacho the banquet was far less substantial of course but it had a note as of immemorial manners that couldnt fail to suggest romantic analogies to a pilgrim from the land of no cooks there was a feast of reason close at hand however and i was careful to visit the famous frescoes of domenichino in the adjoining church it sounds rather brutal perhaps to say that when i came back into the clamorous little piazza the sight of the peasants swilling down their sour wine appealed to me more than the masterpiecesmurray calls them soof the famous bolognese it amounts after all to saying that i prefer teniers to domenichino which i am willing to let pass for the truth the scene under the rickety trellises was the more suggestive of teniers that there were no costumes to make it too italian murrays attractive statement on this point was like many of his statements much truer twenty years ago than today costume is gone or fast going i saw among the women not a single crimson bodice and not a couple of classic headcloths the poorer sort dressed in vulgar rags of no fashion and colour and the smarter ones in calico gowns and printed shawls of the vilest modern fabric had honoured their dusky tresses but with rich applications of grease the men are still in jackets and breeches and with their slouched and pointed hats and openbreasted shirts and rattling leather leggings may remind one sufficiently of the italian peasant as he figured in the woodcuts familiar to our infancy after coming out of the church i found a delightful nooka queer little terrace before a more retired and tranquil drinkingshopwhere i called for a bottle of wine to help me to guess why i drew the line at domenichino  this little terrace was a capricious excrescence at the end of the piazza itself simply a greater terrace and one reached it picturesquely by ascending a short inclined plane of grassgrown cobblestones and passing across a little dusky kitchen through whose narrow windows the light of the mighty landscape beyond touched up old earthen pots the terrace was oblong and so narrow that it held but a single small table placed lengthwise yet nothing could be pleasanter than to place ones bottle on the polished parapet here you seemed by the time you had emptied it to be swinging forward into immensityhanging poised above the campagna a beautiful gorge with a twinkling stream wandered down the hill far below you beyond which marino and castel gandolfo peeped above the trees in front you could count the towers of rome and the tombs of the appian way i dont know that i came to any very distinct conclusion about domenichino but it was perhaps because the view was perfection that he struck me as more than ever mediocrity and yet i dont think it was ones bottle of wine either that made one after all maudlin about him it was the sense of the foolishly usurped in his tenure of fame of the derisive in his ever having been put forward to say so indeed savours of flogging a dead horse but it is surely an unkind stroke of fate for him that murray assures ten thousand britons every winter in the most emphatic manner that his communion of st jerome is the second finest picture in the world if this were so one would certainly here in rome where such institutions are convenient retire into the very nearest convent with such a world one would have a standing quarrel and yet this sport of destiny is an interesting case in default of being an interesting painter and i would take a moderate walk in most moods to see one of his pictures he is so supremely good an example of effort detached from inspiration and school merit divorced from spontaneity that one of his fine frigid performances ought to hang in a conspicuous place in every academy of design few things of the sort contain more urgent lessons or point a more precious moral and i would have the headmaster in the drawingschool take each ingenuous pupil by the hand and lead him up to the triumph of david or the chase of diana or the rednosed persian sibyl and make him some such little speech as the following this great picture my son was hung here to show you how you must never paint to give you a perfect specimen of what in its boundless generosity the providence of nature created for our fuller knowledgean artist whose development was a negation the great thing in art is charm and the great thing in charm is spontaneity domenichino having talent is here and there an excellent modelhe was devoted conscientious observant industrious but now that weve seen pretty well what can simply be learned do its best these things help him little with us because his imagination was cold it loved nothing it lost itself in nothing its efforts never gave it the heartache it went about trying this and that concocting cold pictures after cold receipts dealing in the secondhand in the readymade and putting into its performances a little of everything but itself when you see so many things in a composition you might suppose that among them all some charm might be born yet theyre really but the hundred mouths through which you may hear the unhappy thing murmur im dead its by the simplest thing it has that a picture livesby its temper look at all the great talents domenichino as well as at titian but think less of dogma than of plain nature and i can almost promise you that yours will remain true this is very little to what the aesthetic sage i have imagined might say and we are after all unwilling to let our last verdict be an unkind one on any great bequest of human effort the faded frescoes in the chapel at grotta ferrata leave us a memory the more of mans effort to dream beautifully and they thus mingle harmoniously enough with our multifold impressions of italy where dreams and realities have both kept such pace and so strangely diverged it was absurdthat was the truthto be critical at all among the appealing old italianisms round me and to treat the poor exploded bolognese more harshly than when i walked back to frascati i treated the charming old waterworks of the villa aldobrandini i confound these various products of antiquated art in a genial absolution and should like especially to tell how fine it was to watch this prodigious fountain come tumbling down its channel of mouldy rockwork through its magnificent vista of ilex to the fantastic old hemicycle where a dozen tritons and naiads sit posturing to receive it the sky above the ilexes was incredibly blue and the ilexes themselves incredibly black and to see the young white moon peeping above the trees you could easily have fancied it was midnight i should like furthermore to expatiate on villa mondragone the most grandly impressive hereabouts of all such domestic monuments the casino in the midst is as big as the vatican which it strikingly resembles and it stands perched on a terrace as vast as the parvise of st peters looking straight away over black cypresstops into the shining vastness of the campagna everything somehow seemed immense and solemn there was nothing small but certain little nestling blue shadows on the sabine mountains to which the terrace seems to carry you wonderfully near the place been for some time lost to private uses since it figures fantastically in a novel of george sand la daniellaand now in quite another way as a jesuit college for boys the afternoon was perfect and as it waned it filled the dark alleys with a wonderful golden haze into this came leaping and shouting a herd of little collegians with a couple of longskirted jesuits striding at their heels we all knowi make the point for my antithesisthe monstrous practices of these people yet as i watched the group i verily believe i declared that if i had a little son he should go to mondragone and receive their crooked teachings for the sake of the other memories the avenues of cypress and ilex the view of the campagna the atmosphere of antiquity but doubtless when a sense of mere character shameless incomparable character has brought one to this it is time one should pause      the afterseason in rome   one may at the blest end of may say without injustice to anybody that the state of mind of many a forestiero in rome is one of intense impatience for the moment when all other forestieri shall have taken themselves off one may confess to this state of mind and be no misanthrope the place has passed so completely for the winter months into the hands of the barbarians that that estimable character the passionate pilgrim finds it constantly harder to keep his passion clear he has a rueful sense of impressions perverted and adulterated the allvenerable visage disconcerts us by a vain eagerness to see itself mirrored in english american german eyes it isnt simply that you are never first or never alone at the classic or historic spots where you have dreamt of persuading the shy genius loci into confidential utterance it isnt simply that st peters the vatican the palatine are for ever ringing with the false note of the languages without style it is the general oppressive feeling that the city of the soul has become for the time a monstrous mixture of wateringplace and curiosity shop and that its most ardent life is that of the tourists who haggle over false intaglios and yawn through palaces and temples but you are told of a happy time when these abuses begin to pass away when rome becomes rome again and you may have her all to yourself you may like her more or less now i was assured at the height of the season but you must wait till the month of may when shell give you all she has to love her then the foreigners or the excess of them are gone the galleries and ruins are empty and the place said my informant who was a happy frenchman of the académie de france renait a ellememe indeed i was haunted all winter by an irresistible prevision of what rome must be in declared spring certain charming places seemed to murmur ah this is nothing come back at the right weeks and see the sky above us almost black with its excess of blue and the new grass already deep but still vivid and the white roses tumble in odorous spray and the warm radiant air distil gold for the smeltingpot that the genius loci then dips his brush into before making play with it in his inimitable way for the general effect of complexion  a month ago i spent a week in the country and on my return the first time i approached the corso became conscious of a change something delightful had happened to which at first i couldnt give a name but which presently shone out as the fact that there were but half as many people present and that these were chiefly the natural or the naturalised we had been docked of half our irrelevance our motley excess and now physically morally æesthetically there was elbowroom in the afternoon i went to the pincio and the pincio was almost dull the band was playing to a dozen ladies who lay in landaus poising their lacefringed parasols but they had scarce more than a lightgloved dandy apiece hanging over their carriage doors by the parapet to the great terrace that sweeps the city stood but three or four interlopers looking at the sunset and with their baedekers only just showing in their pocketsthe sunsets not being down among the tariffed articles in these precious volumes i went so far as to hope for them that like myself they were under every precaution taking some amorous intellectual liberty with the scene  practically i violate thus the instinct of monopoly since its a shame not to publish that rome in may is indeed exquisitely worth your patience i have just been so gratified at finding myself in undisturbed possession for a couple of hours of the museum of the lateran that i can afford to be magnanimous its almost as if the old allpapal paradise had come back the weather for a month has been perfect the sky an extravagance of blue the air lively enough the nights cool nippingly cool and the whole ancient greyness lighted with an irresistible smile rome which in some moods especially to newcomers seems a place of almost sinister gloom has an occasional art as one knows her better of brushing away care by the grand gesture with which some splendid impatient mourning matronjust the niobe of nations surviving emerging and looking about her againmight pull off and cast aside an oppression of muffling crape this admirable power still temperamentally to react and take notice lurks in all her darkness and dirt and decaya something more careless and hopeless than our thrifty northern cheer and yet more genial and urbane than the parisian spirit of blague the collective roman nature is a healthy and hearty one and you feel it abroad in the streets even when the sirocco blows and the medium of life seems to proceed more or less from the mouth of a furnace but who shall analyse even the simplest roman impression it is compounded of so many things it says so much it involves so much it so quickens the intelligence and so flatters the heart that before we fairly grasp the case the imagination has marked it for her own and exposed us to a perilous likelihood of talking nonsense about it  the smile of rome as i have called it and its insidious message to those who incline to ramble irresponsibly and take things as they come is ushered in with the first breath of spring and then grows and grows with the advancing season till it wraps the whole place in its tenfold charm as the process develops you can do few better things than go often to villa borghese and sit on the grasson a stout bit of draperyand watch its exquisite stages it has a frankness and a sweetness beyond any relenting of our clumsy climates even when ours leave off their damnable faces and begin nature departs from every reserve with a confidence that leaves one at a loss where as it were to lookleaves one as i say nothing to do but to lay ones head among the anemones at the base of a highstemmed pine and gaze up crestward and skyward along its slanting silvery column you may watch the whole business from a dozen of these choice standpoints and have a different villa for it every day in the week the doria the ludovisi the medici the albani the wolkonski the chigi the mellini the massimothere are more of them with all their sights and sounds and odours and memories than you have senses for but i prefer none of them to the borghese which is free to all the world at all times and yet never crowded for when the whirl of carriages is great in the middle regions you may find a hundred untrodden spots and silent corners tenanted at the worst by a group of those longskirted young propagandists who stalk about with solemn angularity each with a book under his arm like silhouettes from a medieval missal and compose so extremely well with the still more processional cypresses and with stretches of goldenrusset wall overtopped by ultramarine and yet if the borghese is good the medici is strangely charming and you may stand in the little belvedere which rises with such surpassing oddity out of the dusky heart of the boschetto at the latter establishmenta miniature presentation of the wood of the sleeping beautyand look across at the ludovisi pines lifting their crooked parasols into a sky of what a painter would call the most morbid blue and declare that the place where they grow is the most delightful in the world villa ludovisi has been all winter the residence of the lady familiarly known in roman society as rosina victor emmanuels morganatic wife the only familiarity it would seem that she allows for the grounds were rigidly closed to the inconsolable regret of old roman sojourners just as the nightingales began to sing however the quasiaugust padrona departed and the public with certain restrictions have been admitted to hear them the place takes where it lies a princely ease and there could be no better example of the expansive tendencies of ancient privilege than the fact that its whole vast extent is contained by the city walls it has in this respect very much the same enviable air of having got up early that marks the great intramural demesne of magdalen college at oxford the stern old ramparts of rome form the outer enclosure of the villa and hence a series of striking scenic effects which it would be unscrupulous flattery to say you can imagine the grounds are laid out in the formal last century manner but nowhere do the straight black cypresses lead off the gaze into vistas of a melancholy more charged with associationspoetic romantic historic nowhere are there grander smoother walls of laurel and myrtle  i recently spent an afternoon hour at the little protestant cemetery close to st pauls gate where the ancient and the modern world are insidiously contrasted they make between them one of the solemn places of romealthough indeed when funereal things are so interfused it seems ungrateful to call them sad here is a mixture of tears and smiles of stones and flowers of mourning cypresses and radiant sky which gives us the impression of our looking back at death from the brighter side of the grave the cemetery nestles in an angle of the city wall and the older graves are sheltered by a mass of ancient brickwork through whose narrow loopholes you peep at the wide purple of the campagna shelleys grave is here buried in rosesa happy grave every way for the very type and figure of the poet nothing could be more impenetrably tranquil than this little corner in the bend of the protecting rampart where a cluster of modern ashes is held tenderly in the rugged hand of the past the past is tremendously embodied in the hoary pyramid of caius cestius which rises hard by half within the wall and half without cutting solidly into the solid blue of the sky and casting its pagan shadow upon the grass of english gravesthat of keats among themwith an effect of poetic justice it is a wonderful confusion of mortality and a grim enough admonition of our helpless promiscuity in the crucible of time but the most touching element of all is the appeal of the pious english inscriptions among all these roman memories touching because of their universal expression of that trouble within trouble misfortune in a foreign land something special stirs the heart through the fine scriptural language in which everything is recorded the echoes of massive latinity with which the atmosphere is charged suggest nothing more majestic and monumental i may seem unduly to refine but the injunction to the reader in the monument to miss bathurst drowned in the tiber in 1824 if thou art young and lovely build not thereon for she who lies beneath thy feet in death was the loveliest flower ever cropt in its bloom affects us irresistibly as a case for tears on the spot the whole elaborate inscription indeed says something over and beyond all it does say the english have the reputation of being the most reticent people in the world and as there is no smoke without fire i suppose they have done something to deserve it yet who can say that one doesnt constantly meet the most startling examples of the insular faculty to gush in this instance the mother of the deceased takes the public into her confidence with surprising frankness and omits no detail seizing the opportunity to mention by the way that she had already lost her husband by a most mysterious visitation the appeal to ones attention and the confidence in it are withal most moving the whole record has an oldfashioned gentility that makes its frankness tragic you seem to hear the garrulity of passionate grief  to be choosing these positive commonplaces of the roman tone for a theme when there are matters of modern moment going on may seem none the less to require an apology but i make no claim to your special correspondents faculty for getting an inside view of things and i have hardly more than a pictorial impression of the popes illness and of the discussion of the law of the convents indeed i am afraid to speak of the popes illness at all lest i should say something egregiously heartless about it recalling too forcibly that unnatural husband who was heard to wish that his wife would either get well he had his reasons and roman tourists have theirs in the shape of a vague longing for something spectacular at st peters if it takes the sacrifice of somebody to produce it let somebody then be sacrificed meanwhile we have been having a glimpse of the spectacular side of the religious corporations bill hearing one morning a great hubbub in the corso i stepped forth upon my balcony a couple of hundred men were strolling slowly down the street with their hands in their pockets shouting in unison abbasso il ministero and huzzaing in chorus just beneath my window they stopped and began to murmur al quirinale al quirinale the crowd surged a moment gently and then drifted to the quirinal where it scuffled harmlessly with halfadozen of the kings soldiers it ought to have been impressive for what was it strictly unless the seeds of revolution but its carriage was too gentle and its cries too musical to send the most timorous tourist to packing his trunk as i began with saying in rome in may everything has an amiable side even popular uprisings      from a roman notebook   december 28 1872in rome again for the last three daysthat second visit which when the first isnt followed by a fatal illness in florence the story goes that one is doomed to pay i didnt drink of the fountain of trevi on the eve of departure the other time but i feel as if i had drunk of the tiber itself nevertheless as i drove from the station in the evening i wondered what i should think of it at this first glimpse hadnt i already known it all manner of evil perhaps paris as i passed along the boulevards three evenings before to take the train was swarming and glittering as befits a great capital here in the black narrow crooked empty streets i saw nothing i would fain regard as eternal but there were new gaslamps round the spouting triton in piazza barberini and a newspaper stall on the corner of the condotti and the corsosalient signs of the emancipated state an hour later i walked up to via gregoriana by piazza di spagna it was all silent and deserted and the great flight of steps looked surprisingly small everything seemed meagre dusky provincial could rome after all really be a worldcity that queer old rococo garden gateway at the top of the gregoriana stirred a dormant memory it awoke into a consciousness of the delicious mildness of the air and very soon in a little crimson drawingroom i was reconciled and re initiated everything is dear in the way of lodgings but it hardly matters as everything is taken and some one else paying for it i must make up my mind to a bare perch but it seems poorly perverse here to aspire to an interior or to be conscious of the economic side of life the æesthetic is so intense that you feel you should live on the taste of it should extract the nutritive essence of the atmosphere for positively its such an atmosphere the weather is perfect the sky as blue as the most exploded tradition fames it the whole air glowing and throbbing with lovely colour the glitter of paris is now all gaslight and oh the monotonous miles of rainwashed asphalte  december 30thi have had nothing to do with the ceremonies in fact i believe there have hardly been anyno midnight mass at the sistine chapel no silver trumpets at st peters everything is remorselessly clipped and curtailedthe vatican in deepest mourning but i saw it in its superbest scarlet in 69 i went yesterday with l to the colonna gardensan adventure that would have reconverted me to rome if the thing werent already done its a rare old placerising in mouldy bosky terraces and mossy stairways and winding walks from the back of the palace to the top of the quirinal its the grand style of gardening and resembles the present natural manner as a chapter of johnsonian rhetoric resembles a piece of clever contemporary journalism but its a better style in horticulture than in literature i prefer one of the longdrawn bluegreen colonna vistas with a maimed and mossycoated garden goddess at the end to the finest possible quotation from a lastcentury classic perhaps the best thing there is the old orangery with its trees in fantastic terracotta tubs the late afternoon light was gilding the monstrous jars and suspending golden chequers among the goldenfruited leaves or perhaps the best thing is the broad terrace with its mossy balustrade and its benches also its view of the great naked torre di nerone i think which might look stupid if the rosy brickwork didnt take such a colour in the blue air delightful at any rate to stroll and talk there in the afternoon sunshine  january 2nd 1873 two or three drives with aone to st pauls without the walls and back by a couple of old churches on the aventine i was freshly struck with the rare distinction of the little protestant cemetery at the gate lying in the shadow of the black sepulchral pyramid and the thickgrowing black cypresses bathed in the clear roman light the place is heartbreaking for what it asks youin such a world as thisto renounce if it should make one in love with death to lie there thats only if death should be conscious as the case stands the weight of a tremendous past presses upon the flowery sod and the sleepers mortality feels the contact of all the mortality with which the brilliant air is tainted the restored basilica is incredibly splendid it seems a last pompous effort of formal catholicism and there are few more striking emblems of later romethe rome foredoomed to see victor emmanuel in the quirinal the rome of abortive councils and unheeded anathemas it rises there gorgeous and useless on its miasmatic site with an air of conscious bravadoa florid advertisement of the superabundance of faith within its magnificent and its magnificence has no shabby spotsa rare thing in rome marble and mosaic alabaster and malachite lapis and porphyry incrust it from pavement to cornice and flash back their polished lights at each other with such a splendour of effect that you seem to stand at the heart of some immense prismatic crystal one has to come to italy to know marbles and love them i remember the fascination of the first great show of them i met in veniceat the scalzi and gesuiti colour has in no other form so cool and unfading a purity and lustre softness of tone and hardness of substanceisnt that the sum of the artists desire g with his beautiful caressing openlipped roman utterance so easy to understand and to my ear so finely suggestive of genuine latin not our horrible anglosaxon and protestant kind urged upon us the charms of a return by the aventine and the sight of a couple of old churches the best is santa sabina a very fine old structure of the fifth century mouldering in its dusky solitude and consuming its own antiquity what a massive heritage christianity and catholicism are leaving here what a substantial fact in all its decay this memorial christian temple outliving its uses among the sunny gardens and vineyards it has a noble nave filled with a stale smell which like that of the onion brought tears to my eyes and bordered with twentyfour fluted marble columns of pagan origin the crudely primitive little mosaics along the entablature are extremely curious a dominican monk still young who showed us the church seemed a creature generated from its musty shadows i odours his physiognomy was wonderfully de lemploi and his voice most agreeable had the strangest jaded humility his lugubrious salute and sanctimonious impersonal appropriation of my departing franc would have been a mastertouch on the stage while we were still in the church a bell rang that he had to go and answer and as he came back and approached us along the nave he made with his white gown and hood and his cadaverous face against the dark church background one of those pictures which thank the muses have not yet been reformed out of italy it was the exact illustration for insertion in a text of heaven knows how many old romantic and conventional literary italianisms plays poems mysteries of udolpho we got back into the carriage and talked of profane things and went home to dinnerdrifting recklessly it seemed to me from aesthetic luxury to social  on the 31st we went to the musical vesperservice at the gesu hitherto done so splendidly before the pope and the cardinals the manner of it was eloquent of changeno pope no cardinals and indifferent music but a great miseenscène nevertheless the church is gorgeous late renaissance of great proportions and full like so many others but in a preeminent degree of seventeenth and eighteenth century romanism it doesnt impress the imagination but richly feeds the curiosity by which i mean ones sense of the curious suggests no legends but innumerable anecdotes à la stendhal there is a vast dome filled with a florid concave fresco of tumbling foreshortened angels and all over the ceilings and cornices a wonderful outlay of dusky gildings and mouldings there are various bernini saints and seraphs in stuccosculpture astride of the tablets and door tops backing against their rusty machinery of coppery nimbi and eggshaped cloudlets marble damask and tapers in gorgeous profusion the high altar a great screen of twinkling chandeliers the choir perched in a little loft high up in the right transept like a balcony in a sidescene at the opera and indulging in surprising roulades and flourishes near me sat a handsome opulentlooking nunpossibly an abbess or prioress of noble lineage can a holy woman of such a complexion listen to a fine operatic barytone in a sumptuous temple and receive none but ascetic impressions what a crossfire of influences does catholicism provide  january 4tha drive with a out of porta san giovanni and along via appia nuova more and more beautiful as you get well away from the walls and the great view opens out before you the rolling greenbrown dells and flats of the campagna the long disjointed arcade of the aqueducts the deepshadowed blue of the alban hills touched into pale lights by their scattered towns we stopped at the ruined basilica of san stefano an affair of the fifth century rather meaningless without a learned companion but the perfect little sepulchral chambers of the pancratii disinterred beneath the church tell their own tale in their hardly dimmed frescoes their beautiful sculptured coffin and great sepulchral slab better still the tomb of the valerii adjoining ita single chamber with an arched roof covered with stucco mouldings perfectly intact exquisite figures and arabesques as sharp and delicate as if the plasterers scaffold had just been taken from under them strange enough to think of these thingsso many of them as there aresurviving their immemorial eclipse in this perfect shape and coming up like longlost divers on the sea of time  january 16tha delightful walk last sunday with f to monte mario we drove to porta angelica the little gate hidden behind the right wing of berninis colonnade and strolled thence up the winding road to the villa mellini where one of the greasy peasants huddled under the wall in the sun admits you for half franc into the finest old ilexwalk in italy it is all vaulted greygreen shade with blue campagna stretches in the interstices the day was perfect the still sunshine as we sat at the twisted base of the old trees seemed to have the drowsy hum of mid summer with that charm of italian vegetation that comes to us as its confession of having scenically served to weariness at last for some pastoral these many centuries a classic in a certain cheapness and thinness of substanceas compared with the english stoutness never left athirstit reminds me of our own and it is relatively dry enough and pale enough to explain the contempt of many unimaginative britons but it has an idle abundance and wantonness a romantic shabbiness and dishevelment at the villa mellini is the famous lonely pine which tells so in the landscape from other points bought off from the axe by i believe sir george beaumont commemorated in a like connection in wordsworths great sonnet he at least was not an unimaginative briton as you stand under it its faraway shallow dome supported on a single column almost white enough to be marble seems to dwell in the dizziest depths of the blue its pale greyblue boughs and its silvery stem make a wonderful harmony with the ambient air the villa mellini is full of the elder italy of ones imaginationthe italy of boccaccio and ariosto there are twenty places where the florentine story tellers might have sat round on the grass outside the villa walls beneath the overcrowding orangeboughs straggled old italy as wellbut not in boccaccios velvet a row of ragged and livid contadini some simply stupid in their squalor but some downright brigands of romance or of reality with matted locks and terribly sullen eyes  a couple of days later i walked for old acquaintance sake over to san onofrio on the janiculan the approach is one of the dirtiest adventures in rome and though the view is fine from the little terrace the church and convent are of a meagre and musty pattern yet herealmost like pearls in a dunghillare hidden mementos of two of the most exquisite of italian minds torquato tasso spent the last months of his life here and you may visit his room and various warped and faded relics the most interesting is a cast of his face taken after deathlooking like all such casts almost more than mortally gallant and distinguished but who should look all ideally so if not he in a little shabby chilly corridor adjoining is a fresco of leonardo a virgin and child with the donatorio it is very small simple and faded but it has all the artists magic that mocking illusive refinement and hint of a vague arriere pensee which mark every stroke of leonardos brush is it the perfection of irony or the perfection of tenderness what does he mean what does he affirm what does he deny magic wouldnt be magic nor the author of such things stand so absolutely alone if we were ready with an explanation as i glanced from the picture to the poor stupid little redfaced brother at my side i wondered if the thing mightnt pass for an elegant epigram on monasticism certainly at any rate there is more intellect in it than under all the monkish tonsures it has seen coming and going these three hundred years  january 21stthe last three or four days i have regularly spent a couple of hours from noon baking myself in the sun of the pincio to get rid of a cold the weather perfect and the crowd especially today amazing such a staring lounging dandified amiable crowd who does the vulgar stayathome work of rome all the grandees and half the foreigners are there in their carriages the bourgeoisie on foot staring at them and the beggars lining all the approaches the great difference between public places in america and europe is in the number of unoccupied people of every age and condition sitting about early and late on benches and gazing at you from your hat to your boots as you pass europe is certainly the continent of the practised stare the ladies on the pincio have to run the gauntlet but they seem to do so complacently enough the european woman is brought up to the sense of having a definite part in the way of manners or manner to play in public to lie back in a barouche alone balancing a parasol and seeming to ignore the extremely immediate gaze of two serried ranks of male creatures on each side of her path save here and there to recognise one of them with an imperceptible nod is one of her daily duties the number of young men here who like the coenobites of old lead the purely contemplative life is enormous they muster in especial force on the pincio but the corso all day is thronged with them they are welldressed good humoured goodlooking polite but they seem never to do a harder stroke of work than to stroll from the piazza colonna to the hotel de rome or vice versa some of them dont even stroll but stand leaning by the hour against the doorways sucking the knobs of their canes feeling their back hair and settling their shirtcuffs at my cafe in the morning several stroll in already at nine oclock in light in evening gloves but they order nothing turn on their heels glance at the mirrors and stroll out again when it rains they herd under the portescochères and in the smaller cafes yesterday prince humberts little primogenito was on the pincio in an open landau with his governess hes a sturdy blond little man and the image of the king they had stopped to listen to the music and the crowd was planted about the carriagewheels staring and criticising under the childs snub little nose it appeared bold cynical curiosity without the slightest manifestation of loyalty and it gave me a singular sense of the vulgarisation of rome under the new regime when the pope drove abroad it was a solemn spectacle even if you neither kneeled nor uncovered you were irresistibly impressed but the pope never stopped to listen to opera tunes and he had no little popelings under the charge of superior nursemaids whom you might take liberties with the family at the quirinal make something of a merit i believe of their modest and inexpensive way of life the merit is great yet representationally what a change for the worse from an order which proclaimed stateliness a part of its essence the divinity that doth hedge a king must be pretty well on the wane but how many more fine old traditions will the extremely sentimental traveller miss in the italians over whom that little jostled prince in the landau will have come into his kinghood  the pincio continues to beguile its a great resource i am for ever being reminded of the aesthetic luxury as i called it above of living in rome to be able to choose of an afternoon for a lounge respectfully speaking between st peters and the high precinct you approach by the gate just beyond villa medicicounting nothing elseis a proof that if in rome you may suffer from ennui at least your ennui has a throbbing soul in it it is something to say for the pincio that you dont always choose st peters sometimes i lose patience with its parade of eternal idleness but at others this very idleness is balm to ones conscience life on just these terms seems so easy so monotonously sweet that you feel it would be unwise would be really unsafe to change the roman air is charged with an elixir the roman cup seasoned with some insidious drop of which the action is fatally yet none the less agreeably lowering  january 26thwith s to the villa mediciperhaps on the whole the most enchanting place in rome the part of the garden called the boschetto has an incredible impossible charm an upper terrace behind locked gates covered with a little dusky forest of evergreen oaks such a dim light as of a fabled haunted place such a soft suffusion of tender greygreen tones such a company of gnarled and twisted little miniature trunks dwarfs playing with each other at being giantsand such a shower of golden sparkles drifting in from the vivid west at the end of the wood is a steep circular mound up which the short trees scramble amain with a long mossy staircase climbing up to a belvedere this staircase rising suddenly out of the leafy dusk to you dont see where is delightfully fantastic you expect to see an old woman in a crimson petticoat and with a distaff come hobbling down and turn into a fairy and offer you three wishes i should name for my own first wish that one didnt have to be a frenchman to come and live and dream and work at the académie de france can there be for a while a happier destiny than that of a young artist conscious of talent and of no errand but to educate polish and perfect it transplanted to these sacred shades one has fancied platos academyhis gleaming colonnades his blooming gardens and athenian sky but was it as good as this one where monsieur hebert does the platonic the blessing in rome is not that this or that or the other isolated object is so very unsurpassable but that the general air so contributes to interest to impressions that are not as any other impressions anywhere in the world and from this general air the villa medici has distilled an essence of its ownwalled it in and made it delightfully private the great façade on the gardens is like an enormous rococo clockface all incrusted with images and arabesques and tablets what mornings and afternoons one might spend there brush in hand unpreoccupied untormented pensioned satisfiedeither persuading ones self that one would be doing something in consequence or not caring if one shouldnt be  at a later datemiddle of marcha ride with s w out of the porta pia to the meadows beyond the ponte nomentana close to the site of phaons villa where nero in hiding had himself stabbed it all spoke as things here only speak touching more chords than one can now really know or say for these are predestined memories and the stuff that regrets are made of the mild divine efflorescence of spring the wonderful landscape the talk suspended for another gallop returning we dismounted at the gate of the villa medici and walked through the twilight of the vaguely perfumed birdhaunted alleys to hs studio hidden in the wood like a cottage in a fairy tale i spent there a charming halfhour in the fading light looking at the pictures while my companion discoursed of her errand the studio is small and more like a little salon the painting refined imaginative somewhat morbid full of consummate french ability a portrait idealised and etherealised but a likeness of mme defrom last years salon in white satin quantities of lace a coronet diamonds and pearls a striking combination of brilliant silvery tones a femme sauvage a naked dusky girl in a wood with a wonderfully clever pair of shy passionate eyes the author is different enough from any of the numerous american artists they may be producers but hes a product as wella product of influences of a sort of which we have as yet no general command one of them is his charmed lapse of life in that unprofessionallooking little studio with his enchanted wood on one side and the plunging wall of rome on the other  january 30tha drive the other day with a friend to villa madama on the side of monte mario a place like a page out of one of brownings richest evocations of this clime and civilisation wondrous in its haunting melancholy it might have inspired half the ring and the book at a stroke what a grim commentary on history such a scenewhat an irony of the past the road up to it through the outer enclosure is almost impassable with mud and stones at the end on a terrace rises the once elegant casino with hardly a whole pane of glass in its façade reduced to its sallow stucco and degraded ornaments the front away from rome has in the basement a great loggia now walled in from the weather preceded by a grassy be littered platform with an immense sweeping view of the campagna the sad looking more than sadlooking evillooking tiber beneath the colour of gold the sentimentalists say the colour of mustard the realists a great vague stretch beyond of various complexions and uses and on the horizon the everiridescent mountains the place has become the shabbiest farmhouse with muddy water in the old pièces deau and dunghills on the old parterres the feature is the contents of the loggia a vaulted roof and walls decorated by giulio romano exquisite stuccowork and still brilliant frescoes arabesques and figurini nymphs and fauns animals and flowersgracefully lavish designs of every sort much of the colourespecially the bluesstill almost vivid and all the work wonderfully ingenious elegant and charming apartments so decorated can have been meant only for the recreation of people greater than any we know people for whom life was impudent ease and success margaret farnese was the lady of the house but where she trailed her cloth of gold the chickens now scamper between your legs over rotten straw it is all inexpressibly dreary a stupid peasant scratching his head a couple of critical americans picking their steps the walls tattered and befouled breasthigh dampness and decay striking in on your heart and the scene overbowed by these heavenly frescoes moulering there in their airy artistry its poignant it provokes tears it tells so of the waste of effort something human seems to pant beneath the grey pall of time and to implore you to rescue it to pity it to stand by it somehow but you leave it to its lingering death without compunction almost with pleasure for the place seems vaguely crimehaunted paying at least the penalty of some hard immorality the end of a renaissance pleasurehouse endless for the didactic observer the moral abysmal for the storyseeker the tale  february 12thyesterday to the villa albani overformal and as my companion says too much like a teagarden but with beautiful stairs and splendid geometrical lines of immense box hedge intersected with high pedestals supporting little antique busts the light today magnificent the alban hills of an intenser broken purple than i had yet seen themtheir white towns blooming upon it like vague projected lights it was like a piece of very modern painting and a good example of how nature has at times a sort of mannerism which ought to make us careful how we condemn out of hand the more refined and affected artists the collection of marbles in the casino winckelmanns admirable and to be seen again the famous antinous crowned with lotus a strangely beautiful and impressive thing the greek manner on the showing of something now and again encountered here moves one to feel that even for purely romantic and imaginative effects it surpasses any since invented if there be not imagination even in our comparatively modern sense of the word in the baleful beauty of that perfect young profile there is none in hamlet or in lycidas there is five hundred times as much as in the transfiguration with this at any rate to point to its not for sculpture not professedly to produce any emotion producible by painting there are numbers of small and delicate fragments of basreliefs of exquisite grace and a huge piece two combatantsone on horseback beating down anothermurder made eternal and beautiful attributed to the parthenon and certainly as grandly impressive as anything in the elgin marbles s w suggested again the roman villas as a subject excellent if one could find a feast of facts à la stendhal a lot of vague ecstatic descriptions and anecdotes wouldnt at all pay there have been too many already enough facts are recorded i suppose one should discover them and soak in them for a twelvemonth and yet a roman villa in spite of statues ideas and atmosphere affects me as of a scanter human and social portee a shorter thinner reverberation than an old english country house round which experience seems piled so thick but this perhaps is either hairsplitting or racial prejudice  illustration entrance to the vatican rome  march 9th the vatican is still deadly cold a couple of hours there yesterday with r w e yet he illustrious and enviable man fresh from the east had no overcoat and wanted none perfect bliss i think would be to live in rome without thinking of overcoats the vatican seems very familiar but strangely smaller than of old i never lost the sense before of confusing vastness sancta simplicitas all my old friends however stand there in undimmed radiance keeping most of them their old pledges i am perhaps more struck now with the enormous amount of paddingthe number of thirdrate fourthrate things that weary the eye desirous to approach freshly the twenty and thirty best in spite of the padding there are dozens of treasures that one passes regretfully but the impression of the whole place is the great thingthe feeling that through these solemn vistas flows the source of an incalculable part of our present conception of beauty  april 10th last night in the rain to the teatro valle to see a comedy of goldoni in venetian dialecti quattro rustighi i could but half follow it enough however to be sure that for all its humanity of irony it wasnt so good as molière the acting was capitalbroad free and natural the play of talk easier even than life itself but like all the italian acting i have seen it was wanting in finesse that shade of the shade by which and by which alone one really knows art i contrasted the affair with the evening in december last that i walked over also in the rain to the odeon and saw the plaideurs and the malade lmaginaire there too was hardly more than a handful of spectators but what rich ripe fully representational and above all intellectual comedy and what polished educated playing these venetians in particular however have a marvellous entrain of their own they seem even less than the french to recite in some of the womenugly with red hands and shabby dressesan extraordinary gift of natural utterance of seeming to invent joyously as they go  laterlast evening in hs box at the apollo to hear ernesto rossi in othello he shares supremacy with salvini in italian tragedy beautiful great theatre with boxes you can walk about in brilliant audience the princess margaret was therei have never been to the theatre that she was notand a number of other princesses in neighbouring boxes g g came in and instructed us that they were the m the l the p c rossi is both very bad and very fine bad where anything like taste and discretion is required but all there and more than there in violent passion the last act reduced too much however to mere exhibitional sensibility the interesting thing to me was to observe the italian conception of the partto see how crude it was how little it expressed the heros moral side his depth his dignityanything more than his being a creature terrible in mere tantrums the great point was his seizing iagos head and whacking it halfadozen times on the floor and then flinging him twenty yards away it was wonderfully done but in the doing of it and in the evident relish for it in the house there was i scarce knew what force of easy and thereby rather cheap expression  april 27tha morning with l b at villa ludovisi which we agreed that we shouldnt soon forget the villa now belongs to the king who has lodged his morganatic wife there there is nothing so blissfully right in rome nothing more consummately consecrated to style the grounds and gardens are immense and the great rustyred city wall stretches away behind them and makes the burden of the seven hills seem vast without making them seem small there is everythingdusky avenues trimmed by the clippings of centuries groves and dells and glades and glowing pastures and reedy fountains and great flowering meadows studded with enormous slanting pines the day was delicious the trees all one melody the whole place a revelation of what italy and hereditary pomp can do together nothing could be more in the grand manner than this garden view of the city ramparts lifting their fantastic battlements above the trees and flowers they are all tapestried with vines and made to serve as sunny fruitwallsgrim old defence as they once were now giving nothing but a splendid buttressed privacy the sculptures in the little casino are few but there are two great onesthe beautiful sitting mars and the head of the great juno the latter thrust into a corner behind a shutter these things its almost impossible to praise we can only mark them well and keep them clear as we insist on silence to hear great music if i dont praise guercinos aurora in the greater casino its for another reason this is certainly a very muddy masterpiece it figures on the ceiling of a small low hall the painting is coarse and the ceiling too near besides its unfair to pass straight from the greek mythology to the bolognese we were left to roam at will through the house the custode shut us in and went to walk in the park the apartments were all open and i had an opportunity to reconstruct from its milieu at least the character of a morganatic queen i saw nothing to indicate that it was not amiable but i should have thought more highly of the ladys discrimination if she had had the juno removed from behind her shutter in such a house girdled about with such a park me thinks i could be amiableand perhaps discriminating too the ludovisi casino is small but the perfection of the life of ease might surely be led there there are english houses enough in wondrous parks but they expose you to too many small needs and observancesto say nothing of a redfaced butler dropping his hs you are oppressed with the detail of accommodation here the billiardtable is oldfashioned perhaps a trifle crooked but you have guercino above your head and guercino after all is almost as good as guido the rooms i noticed all pleased by their shape by a lovely proportion by a mass of delicate ornamentation on the high concave ceilings one might live over again in them some deliciously benighted life of a forgotten typewith graceful old sale and immensely thick walls and a winding stone staircase and a view from the loggia at the top a view of twisted parasolpines balanced high above a wooden horizon against a sky of faded sapphire  may 17thit was wonderful yesterday at st john lateran the spring now has turned to perfect summer there are cascades of verdure over all the walls the early flowers are a fading memory and the new grass kneedeep in the villa borghese the winter aspect of the region about the lateran is one of the best things in rome the sunshine is nowhere so golden and the lean shadows nowhere so purple as on the long grassy walk to santa croce but yesterday i seemed to see nothing but green and blue the expanse before santa croce was vivid green the campagna rolled away in great green billows which seemed to break high about the gaunt aqueducts and the alban hills which in january and february keep shifting and melting along the whole scale of azure were almost monotonously fresh and had lost some of their finer modelling but the sky was ultramarine and everything radiant with light and warmthwarmth which a soft steady breeze kept from excess i strolled some time about the church which has a grand air enough though i dont seize the point of view of miss who told me the other day how vastly finer she thought it than st peters but on misss lips this seemed a very pretty paradox the choir and transepts have a sombre splendour and i like the old vaulted passage with its slabs and monuments behind the choir the charm of charms at st john lateran is the admirable twelfthcentury cloister which was never more charming than yesterday the shrubs and flowers about the ancient well were blooming away in the intense light and the twisted pillars and chiselled capitals of the perfect little colonnade seemed to enclose them like the sculptured rim of a precious vase standing out among the flowers you may look up and see a section of the summit of the great façade of the church the robed and mitred apostles bleached and rainwashed by the ages rose into the blue air like huge snow figures i spent at the incorporated museum a subsequent hour of fond vague attention having it quite to myself it is rather scantily stocked but the great cool halls open out impressively one after the other and the wide spaces between the statues seem to suggest at first that each is a masterpiece i was in the loving mood of ones last days in rome and when i had nothing else to admire i admired the magnificent thickness of the embrasures of the doors and windows if there were no objects of interest at all in the lateran the palace would be worth walking through every now and then to keep up ones idea of solid architecture i went over to the scala santa where was no one but a very shabby priest sitting like a tickettaker at the door but he let me pass and i ascended one of the profane lateral stairways and treated myself to a glimpse of the sanctum sanctorum its threshold is crossed but once or twice a year i believe by three or four of the most exalted divines but you may look into it freely enough through a couple of gilded lattices it is very sombre and splendid and conveys the impression of a very holy place and yet somehow it suggested irreverent thoughts it had to my fancyperhaps on account of the latticean oriental a mahometan note i expected every moment to see a sultana appear in a silver veil and silken trousers and sit down on the crimson carpet  farewell packing the sharp pang of going one would like to be able after five months in rome to sum up for tribute and homage ones experience ones gains the whole adventure of ones sensibility but one has really vibrated too muchthe addition of so many items isnt easy what is simply clear is the sense of an acquired passion for the place and of an incalculable number of gathered impressions many of these have been intense and momentous but one has trodden on the otherthere are always the big fish that swallow up the littleand one can hardly say what has become of them they store themselves noiselessly away i suppose in the dim but safe places of memory and taste and we live in a quiet faith that they will emerge into vivid relief if life or art should demand them as for the passion we neednt perhaps trouble ourselves about that fifty swallowed palmfuls of the fountain of trevi couldnt make us more ardently sure that we shall at any cost come back  1873      a few other roman neighbourhoods   if i find my old notes in all these roman connections inevitably bristle with the spirit of the postscript so i give way to this prompting to the extent of my scant space and with the sense of other occasions awaiting me on which i shall have to do no less the impression of rome was repeatedly to renew itself for the author of these now rather antique and artless accents was to overlay itself again and again with almost heavy thicknesses of experience the last of which is as i write quite fresh to memory and he has thus felt almost ashamed to drop his subject though it be one that tends so easily to turn to the infinite as if the law of change had in all the years had nothing to say to his case its of course but of his case alone that he speakswondering little what he may make of it for the profit of others by an attempt however brief to point the moral of the matter or in other words compare the musing mature visitors feeling about rome with that of the extremely agitated even if though extremely inexpert consciousness reflected in the previous pages the actual the current rome affects him as a world governed by new conditions altogether and ruefully pleading that sorry fact in the ear of the antique wanderer wherever he may yet mournfully turn for some recapture of what he misses the city of his first unpremeditated rapture shines to memory on the other hand in the manner of a lost paradise the rustle of whose gardens is still just audible enough in the air to make him wonder if some sudden turn some recovered vista maynt lead him back to the thing itself my genial my helpful tag at this point would doubtless properly resolve itself for the reader into a clue toward some such successful ingenuity of quest a remark i make i may add even while reflecting that the paradise isnt apparently at all lost to visitors not of my generation it is the seekers of that remote and romantic tradition who have seen it from one period of ten or even of five years to another systematically and remorselessly built out from their view their helpless plaint their sense of the generally irrecoverable and unspeakable is not however what i desire here most to express i should like on the contrary with ampler opportunity positively to enumerate the cases the cases of contact impression experience in which the cold ashes of a longchilled passion may fairly feel themselves made to glow again no one who has ever loved rome as rome could be loved in youth and before her poised basketful of the finer appeals to fond fancy was actually upset wants to stop loving her so that our bleeding and wounded though perhaps not wholly moribund loyalty attends us as a hovering admonitory anticipatory ghost one of those magnanimous lifecompanions who before complete extinction designate to the other member of the union their approved successor so it is at any rate that i conceive the pilgrim old enough to have become aware in all these later years of what he misses to be counselled and pacified in the interest of recognitions that shall a little make up for it  it was this wisdom i was putting into practice no doubt for instance when i lately resigned myself to motoring of a splendid june day out to subiaco as a substitute for a resignation that had anciently taken alas but the form of my never getting there at all everything that day moreover seemed right surely everything on certain other days that were like it through their large indebtedness at this that and the other point to the last new thing seemed so right that they come back to me now after a moderate interval in the full light of that unchallenged felicity i couldnt at all gloriously recall for instance as i floated to subiaco on vast brave wings how on the occasion of my first visit to rome thirtyeight years before i had devoted certain evenings evenings of artless preparation in my room at the inn to the perusal of alphonse dantiers admirable monastères bénédictins dltalie taking piously for granted that i should get myself somehow conveyed to monte cassino and to subiaco at least such an affront to the passion of curiosity the generally infatuated state then kindled would any suspicion of my foredoomed my all but interminable privation during visits to come have seemed to me fortune in the event had never favoured my going but i was to give myself up at last to the sense of her quite taking me by the hand and that is how i now think of our splendid june day at subiaco the note of the wondrous place itself is conventional wild italy raised to the highest intensity the ideally the sublimely conventional and wild complete and supreme in itself without a disparity or a flaw which character of perfect picturesque orthodoxy seemed more particularly to begin for me i remember as we passed on our way through that indescribable and indestructible tivoli where the jumble of the elements of the familiarly and exploitedly the all too notoriously fair and queer was more violent and vociferous than everso the whole spectacle there seemed at once to rejoice in cockneyfication and to resist it there at least i had old memories to renew including that in especial from a few years back of one of the longest hottest dustiest returndrives to rome that the campagna on a sirocco day was ever to have treated me to  illustration villa deste tivoli  that was to be more than made up on this later occasion by an hour of early evening snatched on the run back to rome that remains with me as one of those felicities we are wise to leave for ever just as they are just that is where they fell never attempting to renew or improve them so happy a chance was it that ensured me at the afternoons end a solitary stroll through the villa d este where the days invasion whatever it might have been had left no traces and where i met nobody in the great rococo passages and chambers and in the prodigious alleys and on the repeated flights of tortuous steps but the haunting genius of style into whose noble battered old face as if it had come out clearer in the golden twilight and on recognition of response so deeply moved i seemed to exhale my sympathy this was truly amid a conception and order of things all mossed over from disuse but still without a form abandoned or a principle disowned one of the hours that one doesnt forget the ruined fountains seemed strangely to wait in the stillness and under cover of the approaching dusk not to begin ever again to play also but just only to be tenderly imagined to do so quite as everything held its breath at the mystic moment for the drop of the cruel and garish exposure for the spirit of the place to steal forth and go his round the vistas of the innumerable mighty cypresses ranged themselves in their files and companies like beaten heroes for their captains review the great artificial works of every description cascades hemicycles all graded and grassed and stoneseated as for floral games mazes and bowers and alcoves and grottos brave indissoluble unions of the planted and the builded symmetry with the terraces and staircases that overhang and the arcades and cloisters that underspread made common cause together as for ones taking up a little in kindly lingering wonder the feeling out of which they have sprung one didnt see it under the actual influence one wouldnt for the world have seen it as that they longed to be justified during a few minutes in the twentyfour hours of their absurdity of pomp and circumstancebut only that they asked for company once in a way as they were so splendidly formed to give it and that the best company in a changed world at the end of time what could they hope it to be but just the lone the dawdling person of taste the visitor with a flicker of fancy not to speak of a pang of pity to spare for them it was in the flicker of fancy no doubt that as i hung about the great topmost terrace in especial and then again took my way through the high gaunt corridors and the square and bare alcoved and recessed saloons all overscored with such a dim waste of those painted those delicate and capricious decorations which the loggie of the vatican promptly borrowed from the ruins of the palatine or from whatever other revealed and inspiring ancientries and which make ghostly confession here of that descent i gave the rein to my sense of the sinister too of that vague aftertaste as of evil things that lurks so often for a suspicious sensibility wherever the terrible game of the life of the renaissance was played as the italians played it wherever the huge tessellated chessboard seems to stretch about us swept bare almost always violently swept bare of its chiselled and shifting figures of every value and degree but with this echoing desolation itself representing the long gasp as it were of overstrained time the great afterhush that follows on things too wonderful or dreadful  i am putting here however my cart before my horse for the hour just glanced at was but a final tag to a day of much brighter curiosity and which seemed to take its baptism as we passed through prodigious perched and huddled adorably scattered and animated and even crowded tivoli from the universal happy spray of the drumming anio waterfalls all set in their permanent rainbows and sibylline temples and classic allusions and byronic quotations a wondrous romantic jumble of such things and quite othersheterogeneous inns and clamorous guingettes and factories grabbing at the torrent to say nothing of innumerable guides and donkeys and whitetied swallowtailed waiters dashing out of grottos and from under cataracts and of the air on the part of the whole population of standing about in the most characteristic contadino manner to pounce on you and take you somewhere snatch you from somebody else shout something at you the aqueous and other uproar permitting and then charge you for it your innocence aiding im afraid our run the rest of the way to subiaco remains with me but as an aftersense of that exhilaration in spite of our rising admirably higher all the while and plunging constantly deeper into splendid solitary gravities supreme romantic solemnities and sublimities of landscape the benedictine convent which clings to certain more or less vertiginous ledges and slopes of a vast precipitous gorge constitutes with the whole perfection of its setting the very ideal of the tradition of that extraordinary in the romantic handed down to us as the most attaching and inviting spell of italy by all the old academic literature of travel and art of the salvator rosas and claudes this is the main tribute i may pay in a few words to an impression of which a sort of divine rightness of oddity a pictorial felicity that was almost not of this world but of a higher degree of distinction altogether affected me as the leading note yet about the whole exquisite complexity of which i cant pretend to be informing  all the elements of the scene melted for me together even from the pause for luncheon on a grassy wayside knoll over heaven knows what admirable preparatory headlong slopes and ravines and iridescent distances under spreading chestnuts and in the high air that was cool and sweet to the final pedestrian climb of sinuous mountainpaths that the shining limestone and the strong green of shrub and herbage made as white as silver there the miraculous home of st benedict awaited us in the form of a builded and picturedover maze of chapels and shrines cells and corridors stupefying rockchambers and caves places all at an extraordinary variety of different levels and with labyrinthine intercommunications there the spirit of the centuries sat like some invisible icy presence that only permits you to stare and wonder i stared i wondered i went up and down and in and out and lost myself in the fantastic fable of the innumerable hard facts themselves and whenever i could above all i peeped out of small windows and hung over chance terraces for the love of the general outer picture the splendid fashion in which the fretted mountains of marble as they might have been round about seemed to inlay themselves for the effect of the distinction i speak of with vegetations of dark emerald there above allor at least in what such aspects did further for the prodigy of the convent whatever that prodigy might for do themwas to a lifelong victim of italy almost verily as never before the operation of the old lovephiltre there were the inexhaustible sources of interest and charm  illustration subiaco  these mystic fountains broke out for me elsewhere again and again i rejoice to sayand perhaps more particularly to be frank about it where the ground about them was pressed with due emphasis of appeal by the firm wheels of the great winged car i motored under invitation and protection repeatedly back into the sense of the other years that sense of the old and comparatively idle rome of my particular infatuated prime which i was living to see superseded and this even when the fond vista bristled with innumerable signs of the times unmistakable features of the new era that by i scarce know what perverse law succeeded in ministering to a happy effect some of these false notes proceed simply from the immense growth of every sort of facilitationso that people are much more free than of old to come and go and do to inquire and explore to pervade and generally infest with a consequent loss for the fastidious individual of his blest earlier sense not infrequent of having the occasion and the impression as he used complacently to say all to himself we none of us had anything quite all to ourselves during an afternoon at ostia on a beautiful june sunday it was a different affair rather from the long the comparatively slow and quite unpeopled drive that i was to remember having last taken early in the autumn thirty years before and which occupied the daywith the aid of a hamper from once supreme old spillman the provider for picnics to a vanished world since i suspect the antique ideal of a picnic in the campagna the fondest conception of a happy day has lost generally much of its glamour our idyllic afternoon at any rate left no chord of sensibility that could possibly have been in question untouched not even that of tea on the shore at fiumincino after we had spent an hour among the ruins of ostia and seen our car ferried across the tiber almost saffroncoloured here and swirling towards its mouth on a boat that was little more than a big rustic raft and that yet bravely resisted the prodigious weight what shall i say in the way of the particular of the general felicity before me for the sweetness of the hour to which the incident just named with its strange and amusing juxtapositions of the patriarchally primitive and the insolently supersubtle the earliest and the latest efforts of restless science were almost immediately to succeed  we had but skirted the old goldandbrown walls of castel fusano where the massive chigi tower and the immemorial stonepines and the afternoon sky and the desolate sweetness and concentrated rarity of the picture all kept their appointment to fond memory with that especial form of roman faith the fine aesthetic conscience in things that is never never broken we had wound through tangled lanes and met handsome sallow countryfolk lounging at leisure as became the sunday and ever so pleasantly and garishly clothed if not quite consistently costumed as just on purpose to feed our wanton optimism and then we had addressed ourselves with a soft superficiality to the open the exquisite little ostian reliquary an exhibition of stony vaguenesses half straightened out the ruins of the ancient port of rome the still recoverable identity of streets and habitations and other forms of civil life are a not inconsiderable handful though making of the place at best a very small sister to pompeii but a soft superficiality is ever the refuge of my shy sense before any ghost of informed reconstitution and i plead my surrender to it with the less shame that i believe i enjoy such scenes even on such futile pretexts as much as it can be appointed them by the invidious spirit of history to be enjoyed it may be said of course that enjoyment questionbegging term at best isnt in these austere connections designatedbut rather some principle of appreciation that can at least give a coherent account of itself on that basis thenas i could i profess but revel in the looseness of my apprehension so wide it seemed to fling the gates of vision and divinationi wont pretend to dot as it were too many of the is of my incompetence i was competent only to have been abjectly interested on reflection moreover i see that no impression of overmuch company invaded the picture till the point was exactly reached for its contributing thoroughly to character and amusement across at fiumincino which the age of the bicycle has made in a small way the handy gravesend or coney island of rome the cafés and birrerie were at high pressure and the bustle all motley and friendly beside the melancholy river where the waterside life itself had twenty quaint and vivid notes and where a few upstanding objects ancient or modern looked eminent and interesting against the delicate roman sky that dropped down and down to the farspreading marshes of malaria besides which company is ever intensely gregarious hanging heavily together and easily outwitted so that we had but to proceed a scant distance further and meet the tideless mediterranean where it tumbled in a trifle breezily on the sands to be all to ourselves with our teabasket quite as in the good old fashiononly in truth with the advantage that the contemporary teabasket is so much improved  i jumble my memories as a tribute to the whole idylli give the golden light in which they come back to me for what it is worth worth i mean as allowing that the possibilities of charm of the witch of the seven hills as we used to call her in magazines havent all been vulgarised away it was precisely there on such an occasion and in such a place that this might seem signally to have happened whereas in fact the mild suburban riot in which the so gay but so light potations before the array of little houses of entertainment were what struck one as really making most for mildness was brushed over with a fabled grace was harmonious felicitous distinguished quite after the fashion of some thoroughly trained chorus or phalanx of opera or ballet bicycles were stacked up by the hundred the youth of rome are ardent cyclists with a great taste for flashing about in more or less denuded or costumed athletic and romantic bands and guilds and on our return cityward toward evening along the right bank of the river the road swarmed with the patient wheels and bent backs of these budding cives romani quite to the effect of its finer interest such at least i felt could only be ones acceptance of almost any feature of a scene bathed in that extraordinarily august air that the waning roman day is so insidiously capable of taking on when any other element of style happens at all to contribute werent they present these other elements in the great classic lines and folds the fine academic or historic attitudes of the darkening land itself as it hung about the old highway varying its vague accidents but achieving always perfect composition i shamelessly add that cockneyfied impression at all events to what i have called my jumble rome to which we all swept on together in the wondrous glowing medium saved everything spreading afar her wide wing and applying after all but her supposed grand gift of the secret of salvation we kept on and on into the great dim rather sordidly papal streets that approach the quarter of st peters to the accompaniment finally of that markedly felt provocation of fond wonder which had never failed to lie in wait for me under any question of a renewed glimpse of the huge unvisited rear of the basilica there was no renewed glimpse just then in the gloaming but the region i speak of had been for me in fact during the previous weeks less unvisited than ever before so that i had come to count an occasional walk round and about it as quite of the essence of the convenient small change with which the heterogeneous city may still keep paying you these frequentations in the company of a sculptor friend had been incidental to our reaching a small artistic foundry of fine metal an odd and interesting little establishment placed as who should say in the case of such a mere leftover scrap of a large loose margin nowhere it lurked so unsuspectedly that is among the various queer things that rome comprehensively refers to as behind st peters  we had passed then on the occasion of our several pilgrimages in beneath the great flying or at least straddling buttresses to the left of the mighty façade where you enter that great idle precinct of fine dense pavement and averted and sacrificed grandeur the reverse of the monstrous medal of the front here the architectural monster rears its back and shoulders on an equal scale and this whole unregarded world of colossal consistent symmetry and hidden high finish gives you the measure of the vast total treasure of items and features the outward face of all sorts of inward majesties of utility and ornament here above all correspondingly reproduces itself the expanses of golden travertinethe freshness of tone the cleanness of surface in the sunny air being extraordinaryclimb and soar and spread under the crushing weight of a scheme carried out in every ponderous particular never was such a show of wasted art of pomp for pomps sake as where all the chapels bulge and all the windows each one a separate constructional masterpiece tower above almost grassgrown vacancy with the full and immediate effect of course of reading us a lesson on the value of lawful pride the pride is the pride of indifference as to whether a greatness so founded be gaped at in all its features or not my friend and i were alone to gape at them most often while for the unfailing impression of them on our way to watch the casting of our figure we extended our circuit of the place to which i may add as another example of that tentative that appealing twitch of the garment of roman association of which one kept renewing ones consciousness the halfhour at the little foundry itself was all charmingwith its quite shabby and belittered and ramshackle recall of the old roman artlife of ones early dreams everything was somehow in the picture the rickety sheds the loose paraphernalia the sunny grassy yard where a goat was browsing then the queer interior gloom of the pits frilled with little overlooking scaffoldings and bridges for the sinking fireward of the image that was to take on hardness and all the pleasantness and quickness the beguiling refinement of the three or four light fine hands of whom the staff consisted and into whose type and tone one liked to read with whatever harmless extravagance so many signs that a lively sense of stiff processes even in humble life could still leave untouched the traditional rare feeling for the artistic how delightful such an occupation in such a general settingthose of my friend i at such moments irrepressibly moralised and how one might after such a fashion endlessly go and come and ask nothing better or if better only so to the extent of another impression i was to owe to him that of an evening meal spread in the warm still darkness that made no candle flicker on the wide high space of an old loggia that overhung in one quarter the great obelisked square preceding one of the gates and in the other the tiber and the far trastevere and more things than i can sayabove all as it were the whole backward past the mild confused romance of the rome one had loved and of which one was exactly taking leave under protection of the friendly lanterned and garlanded feast and the commanding allembracing roofgarden it was indeed a reconciling it was an altogether penetrating last hour  1909      a chain of cities  one day in midwinter some years since during a journey from rome to florence perforce too rapid to allow much wayside sacrifice to curiosity i waited for the train at narni there was time to stroll far enough from the station to have a look at the famous old bridge of augustus broken short off in midtiber while i stood admiring the measure of impression was made to overflow by the gratuitous grace of a whitecowled monk who came trudging up the road that wound to the gate of the town narni stood in its own presented felicity on a hill a good space away boxed in behind its perfect grey wall and the monk to oblige me crept slowly along and disappeared within the aperture everything was distinct in the clear air and the view exactly as like the bit of background by an umbrian master as it ideally should have been the winter is bare and brown enough in southern italy and the earth reduced to more of a mere anatomy than among ourselves for whom the very crânerie of its exposed state naked and unashamed gives it much of the robust serenity not of a fleshless skeleton but of a fine nude statue in these regions at any rate the tone of the air for the eye during the brief desolation has often an extraordinary charm nature still smiles as with the deputed and provisional charity of colour and light the duty of not ceasing to cheer mans heart her whole behaviour at the time cast such a spell on the broken bridge the little walled town and the trudging friar that i turned away with the impatient vow and the fond vision of how i would take the journey again and pause to my hearts content at narni at spoleto at assisi at perugia at cortona at arezzo but we have generally to clip our vows a little when we come to fulfil them and so it befell that when my blest springtime arrived i had to begin as resignedly as possible yet with comparative meagreness at assisi  illustration assisi  i suppose enjoyment would have a simple zest which it often lacks if we always did things at the moment we want to for its mostly when we cant that were thoroughly sure we would and we can answer too little for moods in the future conditional winter at least seemed to me to have put something into these seats of antiquity that the may sun had more or less melted awaya desirable strength of tone a depth upon depth of queerness and quaintness assisi had been in the january twilight after my mere snatch at narni a vignette out of some brown old missal but youll have to be a fearless explorer now to find of a fine spring day any such cluster of curious objects as doesnt seem made to match before anything else mr baedekers polyglot estimate of its chief recommendations this great man was at assisi in force and a brandnew inn for his accommodation has just been opened cheek by jowl with the church of st francis i dont know that even the dire discomfort of this harbourage makes it seem less impertinent but i confess i sought its protection and the great view seemed hardly less beautiful from my window than from the gallery of the convent this view embraces the whole wide reach of umbria which becomes as twilight deepens a purple counterfeit of the misty sea the visitors first errand is with the church and its fair furthermore to admit that when he has crossed that threshold the position and quality of his hotel cease for the time to be matters of moment this twofold temple of st francis is one of the very sacred places of italy and it would be hard to breathe anywhere an air more heavy with holiness such seems especially the case if you happen thus to have come from rome where everything ecclesiastical is in aspect so very much of this worldso florid so elegant so full of accommodations and excrescences the mere site here makes for authority and they were brave builders who laid the foundationstones the thing rises straight from a steep mountainside and plunges forward on its great substructure of arches even as a crowned headland may frown over the main before it stretches a long grassy piazza at the end of which you look up a small grey street to see it first climb a little way the rest of the hill and then pause and leave a broad green slope crested high in the air with a ruined castle when i say before it i mean before the upper church for by way of doing something supremely handsome and impressive the sturdy architects of the thirteenth century piled temple upon temple and bequeathed a double version of their idea one may imagine them to have intended perhaps an architectural image of the relation between heart and head entering the lower church at the bottom of the great flight of steps which leads from the upper door you seem to push at least into the very heart of catholicism  for the first minutes after leaving the clearer gloom you catch nothing but a vista of low black columns closed by the great fantastic cage surrounding the altar which is thus placed by your impression in a sort of gorgeous cavern gradually you distinguish details become accustomed to the penetrating chill and even manage to make out a few frescoes  but the general effect remains splendidly sombre and subterranean the vaulted roof is very low and the pillars dwarfish though immense in girth as befits pillars supporting substantially a cathedral the tone of the place is a triumph of mystery the richest harmony of lurking shadows and dusky corners all relieved by scattered images and scintillations there was little light but what came through the windows of the choir over which the red curtains had been dropped and were beginning to glow with the downward sun the choir was guarded by a screen behind which a dozen venerable voices droned vespers  but over the top of the screen came the heavy radiance and played among the ornaments of the high fence round the shrine casting the shadow of the whole elaborate mass forward into the obscured nave the darkness of vaults and sidechapels is overwrought with vague frescoes most of them by giotto and his school out of which confused richness the terribly distinct little faces characteristic of these artists stare at you with a solemn formalism some are faded and injured and many so illlighted and illplaced that you can only glance at them with decent conjecture the great group however four paintings by giotto on the ceiling above the altarmay be examined with some success like everything of that grim and beautiful master they deserve examination but with the effect ever of carrying ones appreciation in and in as it were rather than of carrying it out and out off and off as happens for us with those artists who have been helped by the process of evolution to grow wings this one going in for emphasis at any price stamps hard as who should say on the very spot of his ideathanks to which fact he has a concentration that has never been surpassed he was in other words in proportion to his means a genius supremely expressive he makes the very shade of an intended meaning or a represented attitude so unmistakable that his figures affect us at moments as creatures all too suddenly too alarmingly too menacingly met meagre primitive undeveloped he yet is immeasurably strong he even suggests that if he had lived the due span of years later michael angelo might have found a rival not that he is given however to complicated postures or superhuman flights the something strange that troubles and haunts us in his work springs rather from a kind of fierce familiarity  it is part of the wealth of the lower church that it contains an admirable primitive fresco by an artist of genius rarely encountered pietro cavallini pupil of giotto this represents the crucifixion the three crosses rising into a sky spotted with the winged heads of angels while a dense crowd presses below you will nowhere see anything more direfully lugubrious or more approaching for direct force though not of course for amplitude of style tintorettos great renderings of the scene in venice the abject anguish of the crucified and the straddling authority and brutality of the mounted guards in the foreground are contrasted in a fashion worthy of a great dramatist but the most poignant touch is the tragic grimaces of the little angelic heads that fall like hailstones through the dark air it is genuine realistic weeping the act of irrepressible crying that the painter has depicted and the effect is pitiful at the same time as grotesque there are many more frescoes besides all the chapels on one side are lined with them but these are chiefly interesting in their general impressivenessas they people the dim recesses with startling presences with apparitions out of scale before leaving the place i lingered long near the door for i was sure i shouldnt soon again enjoy such a feast of scenic composition the opposite end glowed with subdued colour the middle portion was vague and thick and brown with two or three scattered worshippers looming through the obscurity while all the way down the polished pavement its uneven slabs glittering dimly in the obstructed light was of the very essence of expensive picture it is certainly desirable if one takes the lower church of st francis to represent the human heart that one should find a few bright places there but if the general effect is of brightness terrorised and smothered is the symbol less valid for the contracted prejudiced passionate heart let it stand  one thing at all events we can say that we should rejoice to boast as capacious symmetrical and wellordered a head as the upper sanctuary thanks to these merits in spite of a brave array of giottesque work which has the advantage of being easily seen it lacks the great character of its counterpart the frescoes which are admirable represent certain leading events in the life of st francis and suddenly remind you by one of those anomalies that are half the secret of the consummate miseenscene of catholicism that the apostle of beggary the saint whose only tenement in life was the ragged robe which barely covered him is the hero of this massive structure church upon church nothing less will adequately shroud his consecrated clay the great reality of giottos designs adds to the helpless wonderment with which we feel the passionate pluck of the hero the sense of being separated from it by an impassable gulf the reflection on all that has come and gone to make morality at that vertiginous pitch impossible there are no such high places of humility left to climb to an observant friend who has lived long in italy lately declared to me however that she detested the name of this moralist deeming him chief propagator of the italian vice most trying to the wouldbe lover of the people the want of personal selfrespect there is a solidarity in the use of soap and every cringing beggar idler liar and pilferer flourished for her under the shadow of the great francisan indifference to it she was possibly right at rome at naples i might have admitted she was right but at assisi face to face with giottos vivid chronicle we admire too much in its main subject the exquisite play of that subjects geniuswe dont remit to him and this for very envy a single throb of his consciousness it took in that human that divine embrace everything but soap  i should find it hard to give an orderly account of my next adventures or impressions at assisi which could nt well be anything more than mere romantic flanerie one may easily plead as the final result of a meditation at the shrine of st francis a great and even an amused charity this state of mind led me slowly up and down for a couple of hours through the steep little streets and at last stretched itself on the grass with me in the shadow of the great ruined castle that decorates so grandly the eminence above the town i remember edging along the sunless side of the small mouldy houses and pausing very often to look at nothing in particular it was all very hot very hushed very resignedly but very persistently old a wheeled vehicle in such a place is an event and the forestieros interrogative tread in the blank sonorous lanes has the privilege of bringing the inhabitants to their doorways some of the better houses however achieve a sombre stillness that protests against the least curiosity as to what may happen in any such century as this you wonder as you pass what lingering oldworld social types vegetate there but you wont find out albeit that in one very silent little street i had a glimpse of an open door which i have not forgotten a longhaired peddler who must have been a jew and who yet carried without prejudice a burden of massbooks and rosaries was offering his wares to a stout old priest the priest had opened the door rather stingily and appeared half heartedly to dismiss him but the peddler held up something i couldnt see the priest wavered with a timorous concession to profane curiosity and then furtively pulled the agent of sophistication or whatever it might be into the house i should have liked to enter with that worthy  i saw later some gentlemen of assisi who also seemed bored enough to have found entertainment in his tray they were at the door of the cafe on the piazza and were so thankful to me for asking them the way to the cathedral that answering all in chorus they lighted up with smiles as sympathetic as if i had done them a favour of that type were my mild my delicate adventures the piazza has a fine old portico of an ancient temple of minerva six fluted columns and a pediment of beautiful proportions but sadly battered and decayed goethe i believe found it much more interesting than the mighty mediaeval church and goethe as a cicerone doubtless could have persuaded one that it was so but in the humble society of murray we shall most of us find a richer sense in the later monument i found quaint old meanings enough in the dark yellow facade of the small cathedral as i sat on a stone bench by the oblong green stretched before it this is a pleasing piece of italian gothic and like several of its companions at assisi has an elegant wheel window and a number of grotesque little carvings of creatures human and bestial if with goethe i were to balance anything against the attractions of the double church i should choose the ruined castle on the hill above the town i had been having glimpses of it all the afternoon at the end of steep streetvistas and promising myself halfanhour beside its grey walls at sunset the sun was very late setting and my halfhour became a long lounge in the lee of an abutment which arrested the gentle uproar of the wind the castle is a splendid piece of ruin perched on the summit of the mountain to whose slope assisi clings and dropping a pair of stony arms to enclose the little town in its embrace the city wall in other words straggles up the steep green hill and meets the crumbling skeleton of the fortress on the side off from the town the mountain plunges into a deep ravine the opposite face of which is formed by the powerful undraped shoulder of monte subasio a fierce reflector of the sun gorge and mountain are wild enough but their frown expires in the teeming softness of the great vale of umbria to lie aloft there on the grass with silvergrey ramparts at ones back and the warm rushing wind in ones ears and watch the beautiful plain mellow into the tones of twilight was as exquisite a form of repose as ever fell to a tired tourists lot  illustration perugia  perugia too has an ancient stronghold which one must speak of in earnest as that unconscious humorist the classic american traveller is supposed invariably to speak of the colosseum it will be a very handsome building when its finished even perugia is going the way of all italystraightening out her streets preparing her ruins laying her venerable ghosts the castle is being completely remis a neufa massachusetts schoolhouse could nt cultivate a smarter ideal there are shops in the basement and fresh putty on all the windows so that the only thing proper to a castle it has kept is its magnificent position and range which you may enjoy from the broad platform where the perugini assemble at eventide perugia is chiefly known to fame as the city of raphaels master but it has a still higher claim to renown and ought to figure in the gazetteer of fond memory as the little city of the infinite view the small dusky crooked place tries by a hundred prompt pretensions immediate contortions rich mantling flushes and other ingenuities to waylay your attention and keep it at home but your consciousness alert and uneasy from the first moment is all abroad even when your back is turned to the vast alternative or when fifty housewalls conceal it and you are for ever rushing up bystreets and peeping round corners in the hope of another glimpse or reach of it as it stretches away before you in that eminent indifference to limits which is at the same time at every step an eminent homage to style it is altogether too free and fair for compasses and terms you can only say and rest upon it that you prefer it to any other visible fruit of position or claimed empire of the eye that you are anywhere likely to enjoy  for it is such a wondrous mixture of blooming plain and gleaming river and wavilymultitudinous mountain vaguely dotted with pale grey cities that placed as you are roughly speaking in the centre of italy you all but span the divine peninsula from sea to sea up the long vista of the tiber you lookalmost to rome past assisi spello foligno spoleto all perched on their respective heights and shining through the violet haze to the north to the east to the west you see a hundred variations of the prospect of which i have kept no record two notes only i have made onethough who hasnt made it over and over again on the exquisite elegance of mountain forms in this endless play of the excrescence it being exactly as if there were variation of sex in the upheaved mass with the effect here mainly of contour and curve and complexion determined in the feminine sense it further came home to me that the command of such an outlook on the world goes far surely to give authority and centrality and experience those of the great seats of dominion even to so scant a cluster of attesting objects as here it must deepen the civic consciousness and take off the edge of ennui it performs this kindly office at any rate for the traveller who may overstay his curiosity as to perugino and the etruscan relics it continually solicits his wonder and praiseit reinforces the historic page i spent a week in the place and when it was gone i had had enough of perugino but had nt had enough of the view  i should perhaps do the reader a service by telling him just how a week at perugia may be spent his first care must be to ignore the very dream of haste walking everywhere very slowly and very much at random and to impute an esoteric sense to almost anything his eye may happen to encounter almost everything in fact lends itself to the historic the romantic the æsthetic fallacyalmost everything has an antique queerness and richness that ekes out the reduced state that of a grim and battered old adventuress the heroine of many shames and scandals surviving to an extraordinary age and a considerable penury but with ancient gifts of princes and other forms of the wages of sin to show and the most beautiful garden of all the world to sit and doze and count her beads in and remember he must hang a great deal about the huge palazzo pubblico which indeed is very well worth any acquaintance you may scrape with it it masses itself gloomily above the narrow street to an immense elevation and leads up the eye along a clifflike surface of rugged wall mottled with old scars and new repairs to the loggia dizzily perched on its cornice he must repeat his visit to the etruscan gate by whose immemorial composition he must indeed linger long to resolve it back into the elements originally attending it he must uncap to the irrecoverable the inimitable style of the statue of pope julius iii before the cathedral remembering that hawthorne fabled his miriam in an air of romance from which we are wellnigh as far today as from the building of etruscan gates to have given rendezvous to kenyon at its base its material is a vivid green bronze and the mantle and tiara are covered with a delicate embroidery worthy of a silversmith  then our leisurely friend must bestow on peruginos frescoes in the exchange and on his pictures in the university all the placid contemplation they deserve he must go to the theatre every evening in an orchestrachair at twentytwo soldi and enjoy the curious didacticism of amore senza stima severita e debolezza la societa equivoca and other popular specimens of contemporaneous italian comedyunless indeed the lastnamed be not the edifying title applied for peninsular use to le demi monde of the younger dumas i shall be very much surprised if at the end of a week of this varied entertainment he hasnt learnt how to live not exactly in but with perugia his strolls will abound in small accidents and mercies of vision but of which a dozen pencilstrokes would be a better memento than this poor wordsketching from the hill on which the town is planted radiate a dozen ravines down whose sides the houses slide and scramble with an alarming indifference to the cohesion of their little rugged blocks of flinty red stone you ramble really nowhither without emerging on some small court or terrace that throws your view across a gulf of tangled gardens or vineyards and over to a cluster of serried black dwellings which have to hollow in their backs to keep their balance on the opposite ledge on archways and streetstaircases and dark alleys that bore through a density of massive basements and curve and climb and plunge as they go all to the truest mediaeval tune you may feast your fill these are the local the architectural the compositional commonplaces some of the little streets in outoftheway corners are so rugged and brown and silent that you may imagine them passages long since hewn by the pickaxe in a deserted stonequarry the battered black houses of the colour of buried thingsthings buried that is in accumulations of time closer packed even as such are than spadefuls of earth resemble exposed sections of natural rock none the less so when beyond some narrow gap you catch the blue and silver of the sublime circle of landscape  illustration etruscan gateway perugia  but i ought nt to talk of mouldy alleys or yet of azure distances as if they formed the main appeal to taste in this accomplished little city in the sala del cambio where in ancient days the moneychangers rattled their embossed coin and figured up their profits you may enjoy one of the serenest aesthetic pleasures that the golden age of art anywhere offers us bank parlours i believe are always handsomely appointed but are even those of messrs rothschild such models of mural bravery as this little countinghouse of a bygone fashion the bravery is peruginos own for invited clearly to do his best he left it as a lesson to the ages covering the four low walls and the vault with scriptural and mythological figures of extraordinary beauty they are ranged in artless attitudes round the upper half of the roomthe sibyls the prophets the philosophers the greek and roman heroeslooking down with broad serene faces with small mild eyes and sweet mouths that commit them to nothing in particular unless to being comfortably and charmingly alive at the incongruous proceedings of a board of brokers had finance a very high tone in those days or were genius and faith then simply as frequent as capital and enterprise are among ourselves the great distinction of the sala del cambio is that it has a friendly yes for both these questions there was a rigid transactional probity it seems to say there was also a high tide of inspiration about the artist himself many things come up for usmore than i can attempt in their order for he was not i think to an attentive observer the mere smooth and entire and devout spirit we at first are inclined to take him for he has that about him which leads us to wonder if he may not after all play a proper part enough here as the patron of the moneychangers he is the delight of a million of young ladies but who knows whether we should nt find in his works might we go into them a little a trifle more of manner than of conviction and of system than of deep sincerity  this i allow would put no great affront on them and one speculates thus partly but because its a pleasure to hang about him on any pretext and partly because his immediate effect is to make us quite inordinately embrace the pretext of his lovely soul his portrait painted on the wall of the sala you may see it also in rome and florence might at any rate serve for the likeness of mr worldlywiseman in bunyans allegory he was fond of his glass i believe and he made his art lucrative this tradition is not refuted by his preserved face and after some experienceor rather after a good deal since you cant have a little of perugino who abounds wherever old masters congregate so that one has constantly the sense of being in for all there isyou may find an echo of it in the uniform type of his creatures their monotonous grace their prodigious invariability he may very well have wanted to produce figures of a substantial yet at the same time of an impeccable innocence but we feel that he had taught himself how even beyond his own belief in them and had arrived at a process that acted at last mechanically i confess at the same time that so interpreted the painter affects me as hardly less interesting and one cant but become conscious of ones style when ones style has become as it were so conscious of ones or at least of its own fortune if he was the inventor of a remarkably calculable facture a calculation that never fails is in its way a grace of the first order and there are things in this special appearance of perfection of practice that make him the forerunner of a mighty and more modern race more than any of the early painters who strongly charm you may take all his measure from a single specimen the other samples infallibly match reproduce unerringly the one type he had mastered but which had the good fortune to be adorably fair to seem to have dawned on a vision unsullied by the shadows of earth which truth moreover leaves perugino all delightful as composer and draughtsman he has in each of these characters a sort of spacious neatness which suggests that the whole conception has been washed clean by some spiritual chemistry the last thing before reaching the canvas after which it has been applied to that surface with a rare economy of time and means giotto and fra angelico beside him are full of interesting waste and irrelevant passion in the sacristy of the charming church of san pietroa museum of pictures and carvingsis a row of small heads of saints formerly covering the frame of the artists ascension carried off by the french it is almost miniature work and here at least perugino triumphs in sincerity in apparent candour as well as in touch two of the holy men are reading their breviaries but with an air of infantine innocence quite consistent with their holding the book upside down  between perugia and cortona lies the large weedy water of lake thrasymene turned into a witching word for ever by hannibals recorded victory over rome dim as such records have become to us and remote such realities he is yet a passionless pilgrim who does nt as he passes of a heavy summers day feel the air and the light and the very faintness of the breeze all charged and haunted with them all interfused as with the wasted ache of experience and with the vague historic gaze processions of indistinguishable ghosts bore me company to cortona itself most sturdily ancient of italian towns it must have been a seat of ancient knowledge even when hannibal and flaminius came to the shock of battle and have looked down afar from its grey ramparts on the contending swarm with something of the philosophic composure suitable to a survivor of pelasgic and etruscan revolutions these grey ramparts are in great part still visible and form the chief attraction of cortona it is perched on the very pinnacle of a mountain and i wound and doubled interminably over the face of the great hill while the jumbled roofs and towers of the arrogant little city still seemed nearer to the sky than to the railwaystation rather rough murray pronounces the local inn and rough indeed it was there was scarce a square foot of it that you would have cared to stroke with your hand the landlord himself however was all smoothness and the best fellow in the world he took me up into a rickety old loggia on the tiptop of his establishment and played showman as to half the kingdoms of the earth i was free to decide at the same time whether my loss or my gain was the greater for my seeing cortona through the medium of a festa on the one hand the museum was closed and in a certain sense the smaller and obscurer the town the more i like the museum the churchesan interesting note of manners and moralswere impenetrably crowded though for that matter so was the cafe where i found neither an empty stool nor the edge of a table i missed a sight of the famous painted muse the arttreasure of cortona and supposedly the most precious as it falls little short of being the only sample of the greek painted picture that has come down to us on the other hand i sawbut this is what i saw  illustration a street cortona  a part of the mountaintop is occupied by the church of st margaret and this was st margarets day the houses pause roundabout it and leave a grassy slope planted here and there with lean black cypresses the contadini from near and far had congregated in force and were crowding into the church or winding up the slope when i arrived they were all kneeling or uncovered a bedizened procession with banners and censers bearing abroad i believe the relics of the saint was reentering the church the scene made one of those pictures that italy still brushes in for you with an incomparable hand and from an inexhaustible palette when you find her in the mood the day was superbthe sky blazed overhead like a vault of deepest sapphire the grave brown peasantry with no great accent of costume but with sundry small onesdecked that is in cheap fineries of scarlet and yellowmade a mass of motley colour in the high windstirred light the procession halted in the pious hush and the lovely land around and beneath us melted away almost to either sea in tones of azure scarcely less intense than the sky behind the church was an empty crumbling citadel with halfadozen old women keeping the gate for coppers here were views and breezes and sun and shade and grassy corners to the hearts content together with one could nt say what huge seated mystic melancholy presence the aftertaste of everything the still open maw of time had consumed i chose a spot that fairly combined all these advantages a spot from which i seemed to look as who should say straight down the throat of the monster no dark passage now but with all the glorious day playing into it and spent a good part of my stay at cortona lying there at my length and observing the situation over the top of a volume that i must have brought in my pocket just for that especial wanton luxury of the resource provided and slighted in the afternoon i came down and hustled a while through the crowded little streets and then strolled forth under the scorching sun and made the outer circuit of the wall there i found tremendous uncemented blocks they glared and twinkled in the powerful light and i had to put on a blue eyeglass in order to throw into its proper perspective the vague etruscan past obtruded and magnified in such masses quite as with the effect of inadequatelywithdrawn hands and feet in photographs  i spent the next day at arezzo but i confess in very much the same uninvestigating fashiontaking in the general impression i dare say at every pore but rather systematically leaving the dust of the ages unfingered on the stored records i should doubtless in the poor time at my command have fingered it to so little purpose the seeker for the story of things has moreover if he be worth his salt a hundred insidious arts and in that case indeedby which i mean when his sensibility has come duly to adjust itselfthe story assaults him but from too many sides he even feels at moments that he must sneak along on tiptoe in order not to have too much of it besides which the case all depends on the kind of use the range of application his tangled consciousness or his intelligible genius say may come to recognize for it at arezzo however this might be one was far from rome one was well within genial tuscany and the historic the romantic decoction seemed to reach ones lips in less stiff doses there at once was the general impressionthe exquisite sense of the scarce expressible tuscan quality which makes immediately for the whole pitch of ones perception a grateful a not at all strenuous difference attaches to almost any coherent group of objects to any happy aspect of the scene for a main note some mild recall through pleasant friendly colour through settled ample form through something homely and economic too at the very heart of style of an identity of temperament and habit with those of the divine little florence that one originally knew adorable italy in which for the constant renewal of interest of attention of affection these refinements of variety these so harmoniouslygrouped and individuallyseasoned fruits of the great garden of history keep presenting themselves it seemed to fall in with the cheerful tuscan mildness for instancesticking as i do to that ineffectual expression of the tuscan charm of the yellowbrown tuscan dignity at largethat the ruined castle on the hill with which agreeable feature arezzo is no less furnished than assisi and cortona had been converted into a great blooming and i hope all profitable podere or marketgarden i lounged away the half hours there under a spell as potent as the wildest forecast of proprietypropriety to all the particular conditionscould have figured it i had seen santa maria della pieve and its campanile of quaint colonnades the stately dusky cathedralgrassplotted and residenced about almost after the fashion of an english closeand john of pisas elaborate marble shrine i had seen the museum and its etruscan vases and majolica platters these were very well but the old pacified citadel somehow through a day of soft saturation placed me most in relation beautiful hills surrounded it cypresses cast straight shadows at its corners while in the middle grew a wondrous italian tangle of wheat and corn vines and figs peaches and cabbages memories and images anything and everything  1873      siena early and late   i   florence being oppressively hot and delivered over to the mosquitoes the occasion seemed to favour that visit to siena which i had more than once planned and missed i arrived late in the evening by the light of a magnificent moon and while a couple of benignantlymumbling old crones were making up my bed at the inn strolled forth in quest of a first impression five minutes brought me to where i might gather it unhindered as it bloomed in the white moonshine the great piazza of siena is famous and though in this day of multiplied photographs and blunted surprises and profaned revelations none of the worlds wonders can pretend like wordsworths phantom of delight really to startle and waylay yet as i stepped upon the waiting scene from under a dark archway i was conscious of no loss of the edge of a precious presented sensibility the waiting scene as i have called it was in the shape of a shallow horseshoeas the untravelled reader who has turned over his travelled friends portfolios will respectfully remember or better of a bow in which the high wide face of the palazzo pubblico forms the cord and everything else the arc it was void of any human presence that could figure to me the current year so that the moonshine assisting i had halfanhours infinite vision of mediæval italy the piazza being built on the side of a hillor rather as i believe science affirms in the cup of a volcanic crater the vast pavement converges downwards in slanting radiations of stone the spokes of a great wheel to a point directly before the palazzo which may mark the hub though it is nothing more ornamental than the mouth of a drain the great monument stands on the lower side and might seem in spite of its goodly mass and its embattled cornice to be rather defiantly outcountenanced by vast private constructions occupying the opposite eminence this might be without the extraordinary dignity of the architectural gesture with which the huge highshouldered pile asserts itself  on the firm edge of the palace from bracketed base to grey capped summit against the sky where grows a tall slim tower which soars and soars till it has given notice of the citys greatness over the blue mountains that mark the horizon it rises as slender and straight as a pennoned lance planted on the steel shod toe of a mounted knight and keeps all to itself in the blue air far above the changing fashions of the market the proud consciousness or rare arrogance once built into it this beautiful tower the finest thing in siena and in its rigid fashion as permanently fine thus as a really handsome nose on a face of no matter what accumulated age figures there still as a declaration of independence beside which such an affair as ours thrown off at philadelphia appears to have scarce done more than helplessly give way to time our independence has become a dependence on a thousand such dreadful things as the incorrupt declaration of siena strikes us as looking for ever straight over the level of as it stood silvered by the moonlight while my greeting lasted it seemed to speak all as from soul to soul very much indeed as some ancient worthy of a lower order buttonholing one on the coveted chance and at the quiet hour might have done of a state of things long and vulgarly superseded but to the pride and power the once prodigious vitality of which who could expect any one effect to testify more incomparably more indestructibly quite as it were more immortally the gigantic houses enclosing the rest of the piazza took up the tale and mingled with it their burden we are very old and a trifle weary but we were built strong and piled high and we shall last for many an age the present is cold and heedless but we keep ourselves in heart by brooding over our store of memories and traditions we are haunted houses in every creaking timber and aching stone such were the gossiping connections i established with siena before i went to bed  since that night i have had a weeks daylight knowledge of the surface of the subject at least and dont know how i can better present it than simply as another and a vivider page of the lesson that the everhungry artist has only to trust old italy for her to feed him at every single step from her handand if not with one sort of sweetlystale grain from that wondrous mill of history which during so many ages ground finer than any other on earth why then always with something else siena has at any rate preserved appearanceskept the greatest number of them that is unaltered for the eyeabout as consistently as one can imagine the thing done other places perhaps may treat you to as drowsy an odour of antiquity but few exhale it from so large an area lying massed within her walls on a dozen clustered hilltops she shows you at every turn in how much greater a way she once lived and if so much of the grand manner is extinct the receptacle of the ashes still solidly rounds itself this heavy general stress of all her emphasis on the past is what she constantly keeps in your eyes and your ears and if you be but a casual observer and admirer the generalised response is mainly what you give her the casual observer however beguiled is mostly not very learned not overequipped in advance with data he hasnt specialised his notions are necessarily vague the chords of his imagination for all his goodwill are inevitably muffled and weak but such as it is his received his welcome impression serves his turn so far as the life of sensibility goes and reminds him from time to time that even the lore of german doctors is but the shadow of satisfied curiosity i have been living at the inn walking about the streets sitting in the piazza these are the simple terms of my experience but streets and inns in italy are the vehicles of half ones knowledge if one has no fancy for their lessons one may burn ones notebook in siena everything is sienese the inn has an english sign over the doora little battered plate with a rusty representation of the lion and the unicorn but advance hopefully into the mouldy stone alley which serves as vestibule and you will find local colour enough the landlord i was told had been servant in an english family and i was curious to see how he met the probable argument of the casual anglosaxon after the latters first twelve hours in his establishment as he failed to appear i asked the waiter if he werent at home oh said the latter hes a piccolo grasso vecchiotto who doesnt like to move im afraid this little fat old man has simply a bad conscience its no small burden for one who likes the italiansas who doesnt under this restrictionto have so much indifference even to rudimentary purifying processes to dispose of what is the real philosophy of dirty habits and are foul surfaces merely superficial if unclean manners have in truth the moral meaning which i suspect in them we must love italy better than consistency this a number of us are prepared to do but while we are making the sacrifice it is as well we should be aware  we may plead moreover for these impecunious heirs of the past that even if it were easy to be clean in the midst of their mouldering heritage it would be difficult to appear so at the risk of seeming to flaunt the silly superstition of restless renovation for the sake of renovation which is but the challenge of the infinitely precious principle of duration one is still moved to say that the prime result of ones contemplative strolls in the dusky alleys of such a place is an ineffable sense of disrepair everything is cracking peeling fading crumbling rotting no young sienese eyes rest upon anything youthful they open into a world battered and befouled with long use everything has passed its meridian except the brilliant façade of the cathedral which is being diligently retouched and restored and a few private palaces whose broad fronts seem to have been lately furbished and polished siena was long ago mellowed to the pictorial tone the operation of time is now to deposit shabbiness upon shabbiness but its for the most part a patient sturdy sympathetic shabbiness which soothes rather than irritates the nerves and has in many cases doubtless as long a career to run as most of our pert and shallow freshnesses it projects at all events a deeper shadow into the constant twilight of the narrow streetsthat vague historic dusk as i may call it in which one walks and wonders these streets are hardly more than sinuous flagged alleys into which the huge black houses between their almost meeting cornices suffer a meagre light to filter down over roughhewn stone past windows often of graceful gothic form and great pendent iron rings and twisted sockets for torches scattered over their manyheaded hill they suffer the roadway often to incline to the perpendicular becoming so impracticable for vehicles that the sound of wheels is only a trifle less anomalous than it would be in venice but all day long there comes up to my window an incessant shuffling of feet and clangour of voices the weather is very warm for the season all the world is out of doors and the tuscan tongue which in siena is reputed to have a classic purity wags in every imaginable key it doesnt rest even at night and i am often an uninvited guest at concerts and conversazioni at two oclock in the morning the concerts are sometimes charming i not only dont curse my wakefulness but go to my window to listen three men come carolling by trolling and quavering with voices of delightful sweetness or a lonely troubadour in his shirtsleeves draws such artful lovenotes from his clear fresh tenor that i seem for the moment to be behind the scenes at the opera watching some rubini or mario go on and waiting for the round of applause in the intervals a couple of friends or enemies stopitalians always make their points in conversation by pulling up letting you walk on a few paces to turn and find them standing with finger on nose and engaging your interrogative eyethey pause by a happy instinct directly under my window and dispute their point or tell their story or make their confidence one scarce is sure which it may be everything has such an explosive promptness such a redundancy of inflection and action but everything for that matter takes on such dramatic life as our lame colloquies never knowso that almost any uttered communications here become an acted play improvised mimicked proportioned and rounded carried bravely to its dénoûment the speaker seems actually to establish his stage and face his footlights to create by a gesture a little scenic circumscription about him he rushes to and fro and shouts and stamps and postures he ranges through every phase of his inspiration i noted the other evening a striking instance of the spontaneity of the italian gesture in the person of a small sienese of i hardly know what exact agethe age of inarticulate sounds and the experimental use of a spoon it was a sunday evening and this little man had accompanied his parents to the café the caffè greco at siena is a most delightful institution you get a capital demitasse for three sous and an excellent ice for eight and while you consume these easy luxuries you may buy from a little hunchback the local weekly periodical the vita nuova for three centimes the two centimes left from your sou if you are under the spell of this magical frugality will do to give the waiter my young friend was sitting on his fathers knee and helping himself to the half of a strawberryice with which his mamma had presented him he had so many misadventures with his spoon that this lady at length confiscated it there being nothing left of the ice but a little crimson liquid which he might dispose of by the common instinct of childhood but he was no friend it appeared to such freedoms he was a perfect little gentleman and he resented it being expected of him that he should drink down his remnant he protested therefore and it was the manner of his protest that struck me he didnt cry audibly though he made a very wry face it was no stupid squall and yet he was too young to speak it was a penetrating concord of inarticulately pleading accusing sounds accompanied by gestures of the most exquisite propriety these were perfectly mature he did everything that a man of forty would have done if he had been pouring out a flood of sonorous eloquence he shrugged his shoulders and wrinkled his eyebrows tossed out his hands and folded his arms obtruded his chin and bobbed about his headand at last i am happy to say recovered his spoon if i had had a solid little silver one i would have presented it to him as a testimonial to a perfect though as yet unconscious artist  my actual tribute to him however has diverted me from what i had in minda much weightier matterthe great private palaces which are the massive majestic syllables sentences periods of the strange message the place addresses to us they are extraordinarily spacious and numerous and one wonders what part they can play in the meagre economy of the actual city the siena of today is a mere shrunken semblance of the rabid little republic which in the thirteenth century waged triumphant war with florence cultivated the arts with splendour planned a cathedral though it had ultimately to curtail the design of proportions almost unequalled and contained a population of two hundred thousand souls many of these dusky piles still bear the names of the old mediaeval magnates the vague mild occupancy of whose descendants has the effect of armour of proof worn over pot hats and tweed jackets and trousers halfadozen of them are as high as the strozzi and riccardi palaces in florence they couldnt well be higher the very essence of the romantic and the scenic is in the way these colossal dwellings are packed together in their steep streets in the depths of their little enclosed agglomerated city when we in our day and country raise a structure of half the mass and dignity we leave a great space about it in the manner of a pause after a showy speech but when a sienese countess as things are here is doing her hair near the window she is a wonderfully near neighbour to the cavalier opposite who is being shaved by his valet possibly the countess doesnt object to a certain chosen publicity at her toilet what does an italian gentleman assure me but that the aristocracy make very free with each other some of the palaces are shown but only when the occupants are at home and now they are in villeggiatura their villeggiatura lasts eight months of the year the waiter at the inn informs me and they spend little more than the carnival in the city the gossip of an innwaiter ought perhaps to be beneath the dignity of even such thin history as this but i confess that when as a storyseeker always and ever i have come in from my strolls with an irritated sense of the dumbness of stones and mortar it has been to listen with avidity over my dinner to the proffered confidences of the worthy man who stands by with a napkin his talk is really very fine and he prides himself greatly on his cultivated tone to which he calls my attention he has very little good to say about the sienese nobility they are proprio dorigine egoista whatever that may beand there are many who cant write their names this may be calumny but i doubt whether the most blameless of them all could have spoken more delicately of a lady of peculiar personal appearance who had been dining near me shes too fat i grossly said on her leaving the room the waiter shook his head with a little sniff È troppo materiale this lady and her companion were the party whom thinking i might relish a little companyi had been dining alone for a weekhe gleefully announced to me as newly arrived americans they were americans i found who wore pinned to their heads in permanence the black lace veil or mantilla conveyed their beans to their mouth with a knife and spoke a strange raucous spanish they were in fine compatriots from montevideo  illustration the red palace siena  the genius of old siena however would make little of any stress of such distinctions one representative of a faroff social platitude being about as much in order as another as he stands before the great loggia of the casino di nobili the club of the best society the nobility which is very numerous and very rich is still says the apparently competent native i began by quoting perfectly feudal and uplifted and separate morally and intellectually behind the walls of its palaces the fourteenth century its thrilling to think hasnt ceased to hang on there is no bourgeoisie to speak of immediately after the aristocracy come the poor people who are very poor indeed my friends account of these matters made me wish more than ever as a lover of the preserved social specimen of type at almost any price that one werent a helpless victim of the historic sense reduced simply to staring at black stones and peeping up stately staircases and that when one had examined the streetface of the palace murray in hand one might walk up to the great drawing room make ones bow to the master and mistress the old abbe and the young count and invite them to favour one with a sketch of their social philosophy or a few firsthand family anecdotes  the dusky labyrinth of the streets we must in default of such initiations content ourselves with noting is interrupted by two great candid spaces the fanshaped piazza of which i just now said a word and the smaller square in which the cathedral erects its walls of manycoloured marble of course since paying the great piazza my compliments by moonlight i have strolled through it often at sunnier and shadier hours the market is held there and wherever italians buy and sell wherever they count and chafferas indeed you hear them do right and left at almost any moment as you take your way among themthe pulse of life beats fast it has been doing so on the spot just named i suppose for the last five hundred years and during that time the cost of eggs and earthen pots has been gradually but inexorably increasing the buyers nevertheless wrestle over their purchases as lustily as so many fourteenthcentury burghers suddenly waking up in horror to current prices you have but to walk aside however into the palazzo pubblico really to feel yourself a thrifty old medievalist the state affairs of the republic were formerly transacted here but it now gives shelter to modern lawcourts and other prosy business i was marched through a number of vaulted halls and chambers which in the intervals of the administrative sessions held in them are peopled only by the great mouldering archaic frescoesanything but inanimate these even in their present ruinthat cover the walls and ceiling the chief painters of the sienese school lent a hand in producing the works i name and you may complete there the connoisseurship in which possibly you will have embarked at the academy i say possibly to be very judicial my own observation having led me no great length i have rather than otherwise cherished the thought that the sienese school suffers ones eagerness peacefully to slumberbenignantly abstains in fact from whipping up a languid curiosity and a tepid faith a formidable rival to the florentine says some booki forget whichinto which i recently glanced not a bit of it thereupon boldly say i the florentines may rest on their laurels and the lounger on his lounge the early painters of the two groups have indeed much in common but the florentines had the good fortune to see their efforts gathered up and applied by a few preeminent spirits such as never came to the rescue of the groping sienese fra angelico and ghirlandaio said all their feebler confrères dreamt of and a great deal more beside but the inspiration of simone memmi and ambrogio lorenzetti and sano di pietro has a painful air of never efflorescing into a maximum sodoma and beccafumi are to my taste a rather abortive maximum but one should speak of them all gentlyand i do from my soul for their labour by their lights has wrought a precious heritage of stillliving colour and rich figurepeopled shadow for the echoing chambers of their old civic fortress the faded frescoes cover the walls like quaintlystoried tapestries in one way or another they cast their spell if one owes a large debt of pleasure to pictorial art one comes to think tenderly and easily of its whole evolution as of the conscious experience of a single mysterious striving spirit and one shrinks from saying rude things about any particular phase of it just as one would from referring without precautions to some error or lapse in the life of a person one esteemed you dont care to remind a grizzled veteran of his defeats and why should we linger in siena to talk about beccafumi i by no means go so far as to say with an amateur with whom i have just been discussing the matter that sodoma is a precious poor painter and beccafumi no painter at all but opportunity being limited i am willing to let the remark about beccafumi pass for true with regard to sodoma i remember seeing four years ago in the choir of the cathedral of pisa a certain small dusky specimen of the painteran abraham and isaac if i am not mistakenwhich was charged with a gloomy grace one rarely meets him in general collections and i had never done so till the other day he was not prolific apparently he had however his own elegance and his rarity is a part of it  here in siena are a couple of dozen scattered frescoes and three or four canvases his masterpiece among others an harmonious descent from the cross i wouldnt give a fig for the equilibrium of the figures or the ladders but while it lasts the scene is all intensely solemn and graceful and sweettoo sweet for so bitter a subject sodomas women are strangely sweet an imaginative sense of morbid appealing attitudeas notably in the sentimental the pathetic but the none the less pleasant swooning of st catherine the great sienese heroine at san domenicoseems to me the authors finest accomplishment his frescoes have all the same almost appealing evasion of difficulty and a kind of mild melancholy which i am inclined to think the sincerest part of them for it strikes me as practically the artists depressed suspicion of his own want of force once he determined however that if he couldnt be strong he would make capital of his weakness and painted the christ bound to the column of the academy here he got much nearer and i have no doubt mixed his colours with his tears but the result cant be better described than by saying that it is pictorially the first of the modern christs unfortunately it hasnt been the last  illustration san dominico siena  the main strength of sienese art went possibly into the erection of the cathedral and yet even here the strength is not of the greatest strain if however there are more interesting temples in italy there are few more richly and variously scenic and splendid the comparative meagreness of the architectural idea being overlaid by a marvellous wealth of ingenious detail opposite the churchwith the dull old archbishops palace on one side and a dismantled residence of the late grand duke of tuscany on the otheris an ancient hospital with a big stone bench running all along its front here i have sat a while every morning for a week like a philosophic convalescent watching the florid façade of the cathedral glitter against the deep blue sky it has been lavishly restored of late years and the fresh white marble of the densely clustered pinnacles and statues and beasts and flowers flashes in the sunshine like a mosaic of jewels there is more of this goldsmiths work in stone than i can remember or describe it is piled up over three great doors with immense margins of exquisite decorative sculpturestill in the ancient creamcoloured marbleand beneath three sharp pediments embossed with images relieved against red marble and tipped with golden mosaics it is in the highest degree fantastic and luxuriantit is on the whole very lovely as a triumph of the manyhued it prepares you for the interior where the same parti coloured splendour is endlessly at playa confident complication of harmonies and contrasts and of the minor structural refinements and braveries the internal surface is mainly wrought in alternate courses of black and white marble but as the latter has been dimmed by the centuries to a fine mild brown the place is all a concert of relieved and dispersed glooms save for pinturicchios brilliant frescoes in the sacristy there are no pictures to speak of but the pavement is covered with many elaborate designs in black and white mosaic after cartoons by beccafumi the patient skill of these compositions makes them a rare piece of decoration yet even here the friend whom i lately quoted rejects this overripe fruit of the sienese school the designs are nonsensical he declares and all his admiration is for the cunning artisans who have imitated the hatchings and shadings and hairstrokes of the pencil by the finest curves of inserted black stone but the true romance of handiwork at siena is to be seen in the wondrous stalls of the choir under the coloured light of the great wheelwindow woodcarving has ever been a cherished craft of the place and the best masters of the art during the fifteenth century lavished themselves on this prodigious task it is the frostwork on ones windowpanes interpreted in polished oak it would be hard to find doubtless a more moving illustration of the peculiar patience the sacred candour of the great time into such artistry as this the author seems to put more of his personal substance than into any other he has to wrestle not only with his subject but with his material he is richly fortunate when his subject is charming when his devices inventions and fantasies spring lightly to his hand for in the material itself after age and use have ripened and polished and darkened it to the richness of ebony and to a greater warmth there is something surpassingly delectable and venerable wander behind the altar at siena when the chanting is over and the incense has faded and look well at the stalls of the barili  1873   ii   i leave the impression noted in the foregoing pages to tell its own small story but have it on my conscience to wonder in this connection quite candidly and publicly and by way of due penance at the scantness of such firstfruits of my sensibility i was to see siena repeatedly in the years to follow i was to know her better and i would say that i was to do her an ampler justice didnt that remark seem to reflect a little on my earlier poor judgment this judgment strikes me today as having fallen shorttrue as it may be that i find ever a value or at least an interest even in the moods and humours and lapses of any brooding musing or fantasticating observer to whom the finer sense of things is on the whole not closed if he has on a given occasion nodded or stumbled or strayed this fact by itself speaks to me of himspeaks to me that is of his faculty and his idiosyncrasies and i care nothing for the application of his faculty unless it be first of all in itself interesting which may serve as my reply to any objection here breaking outon the ground that if a spectators languors are evidence of a sort about that personage they are scarce evident about the case before him at least if the case be important i let my perhaps rather weak expression of the sense of siena stand at any rate for the sake of what i myself read into it but i should like to amplify it by other memories and would do so eagerly if i might here enjoy the space the difficulty for these rectifications is that if the early vision has failed of competence or of full felicity if initiation has thus been slow so with renewals and extensions so with the larger experience one hindrance is exchanged for another there is quite such a possibility as having lived into a relation too much to be able to make a statement of it  i remember on one occasion arriving very late of a summer night after an almost unbroken run from london and the note of that approachi was the only person alighting at the station below the great hill of the little fortress city under whose at once frowning and gaping gate i must have passed in the warm darkness and the absolute stillness very much after the felt fashion of a person of importance about to be enormously incarceratedgives me for preservation thus belated the pitch as i may call it at various times though always at one season of an almost systematised esthetic use of the place it wasnt to be denied that the immensely better accommodations instituted by the multiplying though alas more bustling years had to be recognised as supplying a basis comparatively prosaic if one would to that luxury no sooner have i written which words however than i find myself adding that one wouldnt that one doesntdoesnt that is consent now to regard the then new hotel pretty old indeed by this time as anything but an aid to a free play of perception the strong and rank old arme dinghilterra in the darker street has passed away but its ancient rival the aquila nera put forth claims to modernisation and the grand hotel the still fresher flower of modernity near the gate by which you enter from the station takes on to my present remembrance a mellowness as of all sorts of comfort cleanliness and kindness the particular facts those of the visit i began here by alluding to and those of still others at all events inveterately made in june or early in july enter together in a fusion as of hot goldenbrown objects seen through the practicable crevices of shutters drawn upon high cool darkened rooms where the scheme of the scene involved longish days of quiet work with late afternoon emergence and contemplation waiting on the better or the worse conscience i thus associate the compact world of the admirable hilltop the world of a predominant goldenbrown with a general invocation of sensibility and fancy and think of myself as going forth into the lingering light of summer evenings all attuned to intensity of the idea of compositional beauty or in other words freely speaking to the question of colour to intensity of picture to communicate with siena in this charming way was thus i admit to have no great margin for the prosecution of inquiries but i am not sure that it wasnt little by little to feel the whole combination of elements better than by a more exemplary method and this from beginning to end of the scale  more of the elements indeed for memory hang about the days that were ushered in by that straight flight from the north than about any other seriesif partly doubtless but because of my having then stayed longest i specify it at all events for fond reminiscence as the year the only year at which i was present at the palio the earlier one the series of furious horseraces between elected representatives of different quarters of the town taking place toward the end of june as the second and still more characteristic exhibition of the same sort is appointed to the month of august a spectacle that i am far from speaking of as the finest flower of my old and perhaps even a little faded cluster of impressions but which smudges that special sojourn as with the big thumbmark of a slightly soiled and decidedly ensanguined hand for really after all the great loud gaudy romp or heated frolic simulating ferocity if not achieving it that is the annual pride of the town was not intrinsically to myview extraordinarily impressivein spite of its bristling with all due testimony to the passionate italian clutch of any pretext for costume and attitude and utterance for mumming and masquerading and raucously representing the vast cheap vividness rather somehow refines itself and the swarm and hubbub of the immense square melt to the uplifted sense of a very highplaced balcony of the overhanging chigi palace where everything was superseded but the intenser passage across the ages of the great renaissance tradition of architecture and the infinite sweetness of the waning golden day the palio indubitably was criardand the more so for quite monopolising at siena the note of crudity and much of it demanded doubtless of ones patience a due respect for the long local continuity of such things it drops into its humoured position however in any retrospective command of the many brave aspects of the prodigious place not that i am pretending here even for rectification to take these at all in turn i only go on a little with my rueful glance at the marked gaps left in my original report of sympathies entertained  i bow my head for instance to the mystery of my not having mentioned that the coolest and freshest flower of the day was ever that of ones constant renewal of a charmed homage to pinturicchio coolest and freshest and signally youngest and most matutinal as distinguished from merely primitive or crepuscular of painters in the library or sacristy of the cathedral did i always find time before work to spend halfanhour of immersion under that splendid roof in the clearest and tenderest the very cleanest and straightest as it masters our envious credulity of all storied frescoworlds this wondrous apartment a monument in itself to the ancient pride and power of the church and which contains an unsurpassed treasure of gloriously illuminated missals psalters and other vast parchment folios almost each of whose successive leaves gives the impression of rubies sapphires and emeralds set in gold and practically embedded in the page offers thus to view after a fashion splendidly sustained a pictorial record of the career of pope pius ii aeneas sylvius of the siena piccolomini who gave him for an immediate successor a second of their name most profanely literary of pontiffs and last of wouldbe crusaders whose adventures and achievements under pinturicchios brush smooth themselves out for us very much to the tune of the stories told by some fine old man of the world at the restful end of his life to the cluster of his grandchildren the end of aeneas sylvius was not restful he died at ancona in troublous times preaching war and attempting to make it against the then terrific turk but over no great worldly personal legend among those of men of arduous affairs arches a fairer lighter or more pacific memorial vault than the shining libreria of siena i seem to remember having it and its unfrequented enclosing precinct so often all to myself that i must indeed mostly have resorted to it for a prompt benediction on the day like no other strong solicitation among artistic appeals to which one may compare it up and down the whole wonderful country is the felt neighbouring presence of the overwrought cathedral in its little proud possessive town you may so often feel by the week at a time that it stands there really for your own personal enjoyment your romantic convenience your small wanton aesthetic use in such a light shines for me at all events under such an accumulation and complication of tone flushes and darkens and richly recedes for me across the years the treasurehouse of manycoloured marbles in the untrodden the drowsy empty sienese square one could positively do in the free exercise of any responsible fancy or luxurious taste what one would with it  but that proposition holds true after all for almost any mild pastime of the incurable student of loose meanings and stray relics and odd references and dim analogies in an italian hill city bronzed and seasoned by the ages i ought perhaps for justification of the right to talk to have plunged into the siena archives of which on one occasion a kindly custodian gave me in rather dusty and stuffy conditions as the incident vaguely comes back to me a glimpse that was like a moments stand at the mouth of a deep dark mine i didnt descend into the pit i did instead of this a much idler and easier thing i simply went every afternoon my stint of work over i like to recall for a musing stroll upon the lizzathe lizza which had its own unpretentious but quite insidious art of meeting the lover of old stories halfway the great and subtle thing if you are not a strenuous specialist in places of a heavily charged historic consciousness is to profit by the sense of that consciousnessor in other words to cultivate a relation with the oracleafter the fashion that suits yourself so that if the general aftertaste of experience experience at large the fine distilled essence of the matter seems to breathe in such a case from the very stones and to make a thick strong liquor of the very air you may thus gather as you pass what is most to your purpose which is more the indestructible mixture of lived things with its concentrated lingering odour than any interminable list of numbered chapters and verses chapters and verses literally scanned refuse coincidence mostly with the divisional proprieties of your own pile of manuscriptwhich is but another way of saying in short that if the lizza is a mere fortified promontory of the great sienese hill serving at once as a stronghold for the present military garrison and as a planted and benched and bandstanded walk and recreationground for the citizens so i could never toward close of day either have enough of it or yet feel the vaguest saunterings there to be vain they were vague with the qualification always of that finer massing as one wandered off of the bronzed and seasoned element the huge rock pedestal the bravery of walls and gates and towers and palaces and loudly asserted dominion and then of that pervaded or mildly infested air in which one feels the experience of the ages of which i just spoke to be exquisitely in solution and lastly of the wide strange sad beautiful horizon a rim of far mountains that always pictured for the leaner on old rubbed and smoothed parapets at the sunset hour a country not exactly blighted or deserted but that had had its life on an immense scale and had gone with all its memories and relics into rather austere in fact into almost grim and misanthropic retirement this was a manner and a mood at any rate in all the land that favoured in the late afternoons the divinest landscape blues and purplesnot to speak of its favouring still more my practical contention that the whole guarded headland in question with the immense ramparts of golden brown and red that dropped into vineyards and orchards and cornfields and all the rustic elegance of the tuscan podere was knitting for me a chain of unforgettable hours to the justice of which claim let these divagations testify  it wasnt however that one mightnt without disloyalty to that scheme of profit seek impressions further afieldthough indeed i may best say of such a matter as the long pilgrimage to the pictured convent of monte oliveto that it but played on the same fine chords as the overhanging the fargazing lizza what it came to was that one simply put to the friendly test as it were the mood and manner of the country this remembrance is precious but the demonstration of that sense as of a great heaving region stilled by some final shock and returning thoughtfully in fact tragically on itself couldnt have been more pointed the long drawn rural road i refer to stretching over hill and dale and to which i devoted the whole of the longest day of the yeari was in a small singlehorse conveyance of which i had already made appreciative use and with a driver as disposed as myself ever to sacrifice speed to contemplationis doubtless familiar now with the rush of the motorcar the thought of whose free dealings with the solitude of monte oliveto makes me a little ruefully reconsider i confess the spirit in which i have elsewhere in these pages on behalf of the lust the landscape lust of the eyes acknowledged our general increasing debt to that vehicle for that we met nothing whatever as i seem at this distance of time to recall while we gently trotted and trotted through the splendid summer hours and a dry desolation that yet somehow smiled and smiled was part of the charm and the intimacy of the whole impressionthe impression that culminated at last before the great cloistered square lonely bleak and stricken in the almost aching vision more frequent in the italy of today than anywhere in the world of the uncalculated waste of a myriad forms of piety forces of labour beautiful fruits of genius however one gaped above all things for the impression and what one mainly asked was that it should be strong of its kind that was the case i think i couldnt but feel at every moment of the couple of hours i spent in the vast cold empty shell out of which the benedictine brotherhood sheltered there for ages had lately been turned by the strong arm of a secular state there was but one good brother left a very lean and tough survivor a dusky elderly friendly abbate of an indescribable type and a perfect manner of whom i think i felt immediately thereafter that i should have liked to say much but as to whom i must have yielded to the fact that ingenious and vivid commemoration was even then in store for him literary portraiture had marked him for its own and in the short story of un saint one of the most finished of contemporary french nouvelles the art and the sympathy of monsieur paul bourget preserve his interesting image he figures in the beautiful tale the abbate of the desolate cloister and of those comparatively quiet years as a clean clear type of sainthood a circumstance this in itself to cause a fond analyst of other than latin race model and painter in this case having their latinism so strongly in common almost endlessly to meditate oh the unutterable differences in any scheme or estimate of physiognomic values in any range of sensibility to expressional association among observers of different of inevitably more or less opposed traditional and racial points of view one had heard convinced latinsor at least i hadspeak of situations of trust and intimacy in which they couldnt have endured near them a protestant or as who should say for instance an anglosaxon but i was to remember my own private attempt to measure such a change of sensibility as might have permitted the prolonged close approach of the dear dingy halfstarved very possibly all heroic and quite ideally urbane abbate the depth upon depth of things the cloud upon cloud of associations on one side and the other that would have had to change first  to which i may add nevertheless that since one ever supremely invoked intensity of impression and abundance of character i feasted my fill of it at monte oliveto and that for that matter this would have constituted my sole refreshment in the vast icy void of the blighted refectory if i hadnt bethought myself of bringing with me a scrap of food too scantly apportioned i recollectvery scantly indeed since my cocchiere was to share with meby my purveyor at siena our tragiceven if so tenderly tragicentertainer had nothing to give us but the immemorial cold of the enormous monastic interior in which we smilingly fasted would doubtless not have had for me without that such a wealth of reference i was to have liked the whole adventure so i must somehow have liked that by which remark i am recalled to the special treasure of the desecrated temple those extraordinarily strong and brave frescoes of luca signorelli and sodoma that adorn in admirable condition several stretches of cloister wall these creations in a manner took care of themselves aided by the blue of the sky above the cloister court they glowed they insistently lived i remember the frigid prowl through all the rest of the bareness including that of the big dishonoured church and that even of the abbates abysmally resigned testimony to his mere human and personal situation and then with such a force of contrast and effect of relief the great sheltered sunflares and colourpatches of scenic composition and design where a couple of hands centuries ago turned to dust had so wrought the defiant miracle of life and beauty that the effect is of a garden blooming among ruins discredited somehow since they all would the destroyers themselves the ancient piety the general spirit and intention but still bright and assured and sublimepractically enviably immortalthe other the still subtler the all aesthetic good faith  1909      the autumn in florence   florence too has its season not less than rome and i have been rejoicing for the past six weeks in the fact that this comparatively crowded parenthesis hasnt yet been opened coming here in the first days of october i found the summer still in almost unmenaced possession and ever since till within a day or two the weight of its hand has been sensible properly enough as the city of flowers florence mingles the elements most artfully in the springduring the divine crescendo of march and april the weeks when six months of steady shiver have still not shaken new york and boston free of the long polar reach but the very quality of the decline of the year as we at present here feel it suits peculiarly the mood in which an undiscourageable gatherer of the sense of things or taster at least of charm moves through these manymemoried streets and galleries and churches old things old places old people or at least old races ever strike us as giving out their secrets most freely in such moist grey melancholy days as have formed the complexion of the past fortnight with christmas arrives the opera the only opera worth speaking ofwhich indeed often means in florence the only opera worth talking through the gaiety the gossip the reminders in fine of the cosmopolite and wateringplace character to which the city of the medici long ago began to bend her antique temper meanwhile it is pleasant enough for the tasters of charm as i say and for the makers of invidious distinctions that the americans havent all arrived however many may be on their way and that the weather has a monotonous overcast softness in which apparently aimless contemplation grows less and less ashamed there is no crush along the cascine as on the sunny days of winter and the arno wandering away toward the mountains in the haze seems as shy of being looked at as a good picture in a bad light no light to my eyes nevertheless could be better than this which reaches us all strained and filtered and refined exquisitely coloured and even a bit conspicuously sophisticated through the heavy air of the past that hangs about the place for ever  i first knew florence early enough i am happy to say to have heard the change for the worse the taint of the modern order bitterly lamented by old haunters admirers loversthose qualified to present a picture of the conditions prevailing under the good old granddukes the two last of their line in especial that for its blest reflection of sweetness and mildness and cheapness and ease of every immediate boon in life to be enjoyed quite for nothing could but draw tears from belated listeners some of these survivors from the golden agejust the beauty of which indeed was in the gold of sorts that it poured into your lap and not in the least in its own importunity on that headhave needfully lingered on have seen the ancient walls pulled down and the compact and belted mass of which the piazza della signoria was the immemorial centre expand under the treatment of enterprising syndics into an ungirdled organism of the type as they viciously say of chicago one of those places of which as their grace of a circumference is nowhere the dignity of a centre can no longer be predicated florence loses itself today in dusty boulevards and smart beaux quartiers such as napoleon iii and baron haussmann were to set the fashion of to a too mediæval europewith the effect of some precious page of antique text swallowed up in a marginal commentary that smacks of the style of the newspaper so much for what has happened on this side of that line of demarcation which by an odd law makes us with our preference for what we are pleased to call the picturesque object to such occurrences even as occurrences the real truth is that objections are too vain and that he would be too rude a critic here just now who shouldnt be in the humour to take the thick with the thin and to try at least to read something of the old soul into the new forms  there is something to be said moreover for your liking a city once its a question of your actively circulating to pretend to comfort you more by its extent than by its limits in addition to which florence was anciently was in her palmy days peculiarly a daughter of change and movement and variety of shifting moods policies and régimesjust as the florentine character as we have it today is a character that takes all things easily for having seen so many come and go it saw the national capital a few years since arrive and sit down by the arno and took no further thought than sufficed for the day then it saw the odd visitor depart and whistled her cheerfully on her way to rome the new boulevards of the sindaco peruzzi come it may be said but they dont go which after all it isnt from the æsthetic point of view strictly necessary they should a part of the essential amiability of florence of her genius for making you take to your favour on easy terms everything that in any way belongs to her is that she has already flung an element of her grace over all their undried mortar and plaster such modern arrangements as the piazza d azeglio and the viale or avenue of the princess margaret please not a little i thinkfor what they areand do so even in a degree by some fine local privilege just because they are florentine the afternoon lights rest on them as if to thank them for not being worse and their vistas are liberal where they look toward the hills they carry you close to these admirable elevations which hang over florence on all sides and if in the foreground your sense is a trifle perplexed by the white pavements dotted here and there with a policeman or a nursemaid you have only to reach beyond and see fiesole turn to violet on its ample eminence from the effect of the opposite sunset  facing again then to florence proper you have local colour enough and to sparewhich you enjoy the more doubtless from standing off to get your light and your point of view the elder streets abutting on all this newness bore away into the heart of the city in narrow dusky perspectives that quite refine in certain places by an art of their own on the romantic appeal there are temporal and other accidents thanks to which as you pause to look down them and to penetrate the deepening shadows that accompany their retreat they resemble little corridors leading out from the past mystical like the ladder in jacobs dream so that when you see a single figure advance and draw nearer you are half afraid to wait till it arrivesit must be too much of the nature of a ghost a messenger from an underworld however this may be a place paved with such great mosaics of slabs and lined with palaces of so massive a tradition structures which in their large dependence on pure proportion for interest and beauty reproduce more than other modern styles the simple nobleness of greek architecture must ever have placed dignity first in the scale of invoked effect and laid up no great treasure of that ragged picturesquenessthe picturesqueness of large povertyon which we feast our idle eyes at rome and naples except in the unfinished fronts of the churches which however unfortunately are mere ugly blankness one finds less of the poetry of ancient overuse or in other words less romantic southern shabbiness than in most italian cities at two or three points none the less this sinister grace exists in perfectionjust such perfection as so often proves that what is literally hideous may be constructively delightful and what is intrinsically tragic play on the finest chords of appreciation on the north side of the arno between ponte vecchio and ponte santa trinita is a row of immemorial houses that back on the river in whose yellow flood they bathe their sore old feet anything more battered and befouled more cracked and disjointed dirtier drearier poorer it would be impossible to conceive they look as if fifty years ago the liquid mud had risen over their chimneys and then subsided again and left them coated for ever with its unsightly slime and yet forsooth because the river is yellow and the light is yellow and here and there elsewhere some mellow mouldering surface some hint of colour some accident of atmosphere takes up the foolish tale and repeats the notebecause in short it is florence it is italy and the fond appraiser the infatuated alien may have had in his eyes at birth and afterwards the micaceous sparkle of brown stone fronts no more interesting than so much sandpaper these miserable dwellings instead of suggesting mental invocations to an enterprising board of health simply create their own standard of felicity and shamelessly live in it lately during the misty autumn nights the moon has shone on them faintly and refined their shabbiness away into something ineffably strange and spectral the turbid stream sweeps along without a sound and the pale tenements hang above it like a vague miasmatic exhalation the dimmest backscene at the opera when the tenor is singing his sweetest seems hardly to belong to a world more detached from responsibility  illustration on the arno florence  what it is that infuses so rich an interest into the general charm is difficult to say in a few words yet as we wander hither and thither in quest of sacred canvas and immortal bronze and stone we still feel the genius of the place hang about two industrious english ladies the misses horner have lately published a couple of volumes of walks by the arnoside and their work is a long enumeration of great artistic deeds these things remain for the most part in sound preservation and as the weeks go by and you spend a constant portion of your days among them the sense of one of the happiest periods of human tasteto put it only at thatsettles upon your spirit it was not long it lasted in its splendour for less than a century but it has stored away in the palaces and churches of florence a heritage of beauty that these three enjoying centuries since havent yet exhausted this forms a clear intellectual atmosphere into which you may turn aside from the modern world and fill your lungs as with the breath of a forgotten creed the memorials of the past here address us moreover with a friendliness win us by we scarcely know what sociability what equal amenity that we scarce find matched in other great esthetically endowed communities and periods venice with her old palaces cracking under the weight of their treasures is in her influence insupportably sad athens with her maimed marbles and dishonoured memories transmutes the consciousness of sensitive observers i am told into a chronic heartache but in ones impression of old florence the abiding felicity the sense of saving sanity of something sound and human predominates offering you a medium still conceivable for life the reason of this is partly no doubt the sympathetic nature the temperate joy of florentine art in generalputting the sole dante greatest of literary artists aside partly the tenderness of time in its lapse which save in a few cases has been as sparing of injury as if it knew that when it should have dimmed and corroded these charming things it would have nothing so sweet again for its tooth to feed on if the beautiful ghirlandaios and lippis are fading this generation will never know it the large fra angelico in the academy is as clear and keen as if the good old monk stood there wiping his brushes the colours seem to sing as it were like newfledged birds in june nothing is more characteristic of early tuscan art than the highreliefs of luca della robbia yet there isnt one of them that except for the unique mixture of freshness with its wisdom of candour with its expertness mightnt have been modelled yesterday  but perhaps the best image of the absence of stale melancholy or wasted splendour of the positive presence of what i have called temperate joy in the florentine impression and genius is the belltower of giotto which rises beside the cathedral no beholder of it will have forgotten how straight and slender it stands there how strangely rich in the common street plated with coloured marble patterns and yet so far from simple or severe in design that we easily wonder how its author the painter of exclusively and portentously grave little pictures should have fashioned a building which in the way of elaborate elegance of the true play of taste leaves a jealous modern criticism nothing to miss nothing can be imagined at once more lightly and more pointedly fanciful it might have been handed over to the city as it stands by some oriental genie tired of too much detail yet for all that suggestion it seems of no particular timenot grey and hoary like a gothic steeple not cracked and despoiled like a greek temple its marbles shining so little less freshly than when they were laid together and the sunset lighting up its cornice with such a friendly radiance that you come at last to regard it simply as the graceful indestructible soul of the place made visible the cathedral externally for all its solemn hugeness strikes the same note of wouldbe reasoned elegance and cheer it has conventional grandeur of course but a grandeur so frank and ingenuous even in its partipris it has seen so much and outlived so much and served so many sad purposes and yet remains in aspect so full of the fine tuscan geniality the feeling for life one may almost say the feeling for amusement that inspired it its vast manycoloured marble walls become at any rate with this the friendliest note of all florence there is an unfailing charm in walking past them while they lift their great acres of geometrical mosaic higher in the air than you have time or other occasion to look you greet them from the deep street as you greet the side of a mountain when you move in the gorgenot twisting back your head to keep looking at the top but content with the minor accidents the nestling hollows and soft cloud shadows the general protection of the valley  florence is richer in pictures than we really know till we have begun to look for them in outlying corners then here and there one comes upon lurking values and hidden gems that it quite seems one might as a good new yorker quietly bag for the so aspiring museum of that city without their being missed the pitti palace is of course a collection of masterpieces they jostle each other in their splendour they perhaps even in their merciless multitude rather fatigue our admiration the uffizi is almost as fine a show and together with that long serpentine artery which crosses the arno and connects them making you ask yourself whichever way you take it what goal can be grand enough to crown such a journey they form the great central treasurechamber of the town but i have been neglecting them of late for love of the academy where there are fewer copyists and tourists above all fewer pictorial lions those whose roar is heard from afar and who strike us as expecting overmuch to have it their own way in the jungle the pictures at the academy are all rather doves the whole impression is less pompously tropical selection still leaves one too much to say but i noted here on my last occasion an enchanting botticelli so obscurely hung in one of the smaller rooms that i scarce knew whether most to enjoy or to resent its relegation placed in a mean black frame where you wouldnt have looked for a masterpiece it yet gave out to a good glass every characteristic of one representing as it does the walk of tobias with the angel there are really parts of it that an angel might have painted but i doubt whether it is observed by halfadozen persons a year that was my excuse for my wanting to know on the spot though doubtless all sophistically what dishonour could the transfer be artfully accomplished a strong american light and a brave gilded frame would comparatively speaking do it there and then it would shine with the intense authority that we claim for the fairest thingswould exhale its wondrous beauty as a sovereign example what it comes to is that this master is the most interesting of a great bandthe only florentine save leonardo and michael in whom the impulse was original and the invention rare his imagination is of things strange subtle and complicatedthings it at first strikes us that we moderns have reason to know and that it has taken us all the ages to learn so that we permit ourselves to wonder how a primitive could come by them we soon enough reflect however that we ourselves have come by them almost only through him exquisite spirit that he was and that when we enjoy or at least when we encounter in our william morrises in our rossettis and burnejoneses the note of the haunted or over charged consciousness we are but treated with other matters to repeated doses of diluted botticelli he practically set with his own hand almost all the copies to almost all our socalled pre raphaelites earlier and later near and remote  let us at the same time none the less never fail of response to the great florentine geniality at large fra angelico filippo lippi ghirlandaio were not subtly imaginative were not even riotously so but what other three were ever more gladly observant more vividly and richly true if there should some time be a weeding out of the worlds possessions the best works of the early florentines will certainly be counted among the flowers with the ripest performances of the venetiansby which i dont mean the overripewe can but take them for the most valuable things in the history of art heaven forbid we should be narrowed down to a cruel choice but if it came to a question of keeping or losing between halfadozen raphaels and halfadozen things it would be a joy to pick out at the academy i fear that for myself the memory of the transfiguration or indeed of the other roman relics of the painter wouldnt save the raphaels and yet this was so far from the opinion of a patient artist whom i saw the other day copying the finest of ghirlandaiosa beautiful adoration of the kings at the hospital of the innocenti here was another sample of the buried artwealth of florence it hangs in an obscure chapel far aloft behind an altar and though now and then a stray tourist wanders in and puzzles a while over the vaguelyglowing forms the picture is never really seen and enjoyed i found an aged frenchman of modest mien perched on a little platform beneath it behind a great hedge of altarcandlesticks with an admirable copy all completed the difficulties of his task had been wellnigh insuperable and his performance seemed to me a real feat of magic he could scarcely move or turn and could find room for his canvas but by rolling it together and painting a small piece at a time so that he never enjoyed a view of his ensemble the original is gorgeous with colour and bewildering with decorative detail but not a gleam of the painters crimson was wanting not a curl in his gold arabesques it seemed to me that if i had copied a ghirlandaio in such conditions i would at least maintain for my own credit that he was the first painter in the world very good of its kind said the weary old man with a shrug of reply for my raptures but oh how far short of raphael however that may be if the reader chances to observe this consummate copy in the so commendable museum devoted in paris to such works let him stop before it with a due reverence it is one of the patient things of art seeing it wrought there in its dusky nook under such scant convenience i found no bar in the painters foreignness to a thrilled sense that the old artlife of florence isnt yet extinct it still at least works spells and almost miracles  1873      florentine notes   i   yesterday that languid organism known as the florentine carnival put on a momentary semblance of vigour and decreed a general corso through the town the spectacle was not brilliant but it suggested some natural reflections i encountered the line of carriages in the square before santa croce of which they were making the circuit they rolled solemnly by with their inmates frowning forth at each other in apparent wrath at not finding each other more worth while there were no masks no costumes no decorations no throwing of flowers or sweetmeats it was as if each carriageful had privately and not very heroically resolved not to be at costs and was rather discomfited at finding that it was getting no better entertainment than it gave the middle of the piazza was filled with little tables with shouting mountebanks mostly disguised in battered bonnets and crinolines offering chances in raffles for plucked fowls and kerosene lamps i have never thought the huge marble statue of dante which overlooks the scene a work of the last refinement but as it stood there on its high pedestal chin in hand frowning down on all this cheap foolery it seemed to have a great moral intention the carriages followed a prescribed coursethrough via ghibellina via del proconsolo past the badia and the bargello beneath the great tessellated cliffs of the cathedral through via tornabuoni and out into ten minutes sunshine beside the arno much of all this is the gravest and stateliest part of florence a quarter of supreme dignity and there was an almost ludicrous incongruity in seeing pleasure leading her train through these dusky historic streets it was most uncomfortably cold and in the absence of masks many a fair nose was fantastically tipped with purple but as the carriages crept solemnly along they seemed to keep a funeral marchto follow an antique custom an exploded faith to its tomb the carnival is dead and these good people who had come abroad to make merry were funeral mutes and gravediggers last winter in rome it showed but a galvanised life yet compared with this humble exhibition it was operatic at rome indeed it was too operatic the knights on horseback there were a bevy of circusriders and im sure half the mad revellers repaired every night to the capitol for their twelve sous a day  i have just been reading over the letters of the president de brosses a hundred years ago in venice the carnival lasted six months and at rome for many weeks each year one was free under cover of a mask to perpetrate the most fantastic follies and cultivate the most remunerative vices its very well to read the presidents notes which have indeed a singular interest but they make us ask ourselves why we should expect the italians to persist in manners and practices which we ourselves if we had responsibilities in the matter should find intolerable the florentines at any rate spend no more money nor faith on the carnivalesque and yet this truth has a qualification for what struck me in the whole spectacle yesterday and prompted these observations was not at all the more or less of costume of the occupants of the carriages but the obstinate survival of the merrymaking instinct in the people at large there could be no better example of it than that so dim a shadow of entertainment should keep all florence standing and strolling densely packed for hours in the cold streets there was nothing to see that mightnt be seen on the cascine any fine day in the yearnothing but a name a tradition a pretext for sweet staring idleness the faculty of making much of common things and converting small occasions into great pleasures is to a son of communities strenuous as ours are strenuous the most salient characteristic of the socalled latin civilisations it charms him and vexes him according to his mood and for the most part it represents a moral gulf between his own temperamental and indeed spiritual sense of race and that of frenchmen and italians far wider than the watery leagues that a steamer may annihilate but i think his mood is wisest when he accepts the foreign easy surrender to all the senses as the sign of an unconscious philosophy of life instilled by the experience of centuriesthe philosophy of people who have lived long and much who have discovered no short cuts to happiness and no effective circumvention of effort and so have come to regard the average lot as a ponderous fact that absolutely calls for a certain amount of sitting on the lighter tray of the scales florence yesterday then took its holiday in a natural placid fashion that seemed to make its own temper an affair quite independent of the splendour of the compensation decreed on a higher line to the weariness of its legs that the corso was stupid or lively was the shame or the glory of the powers abovethe fates the gods the forestieri the towncouncilmen the rich or the stingy common florence on the narrow footways pressed against the houses obeyed a natural need in looking about complacently patiently gently and never pushing nor trampling nor swearing nor staggering this liberal margin for festivals in italy gives the masses a more than manoftheworld urbanity in taking their pleasure  meanwhile it occurs to me that by a remote new england fireside an unsophisticated young person of either sex is reading in an old volume of travels or an old romantic tale some account of these anniversaries and appointed revels as old catholic lands offer them to view across the page swims a vision of sculptured palacefronts draped in crimson and gold and shining in a southern sun of a motley train of maskers sweeping on in voluptuous confusion and pelting each other with nosegays and loveletters into the quiet room quenching the rhythm of the connecticut clock floats an uproar of delighted voices a medley of stirring foreign sounds an echo of farheard music of a strangely alien cadence but the dusk is falling and the unsophisticated young person closes the book wearily and wanders to the window the dusk is falling on the beaten snow down the road is a white wooden meetinghouse looking grey among the drifts the young person surveys the prospect a while and then wanders back and stares at the fire the carnival of venice of florence of rome colour and costume romance and rapture the young person gazes in the firelight at the flickering chiaroscuro of the future discerns at last the glowing phantasm of opportunity and determines with a wild heartbeat to go and see it alltwenty years hence   ii   a couple of days since driving to fiesole we came back by the castle of vincigliata the afternoon was lovely and though there is as yet february 10th no visible revival of vegetation the air was full of a vague vernal perfume and the warm colours of the hills and the yellow western sunlight flooding the plain seemed to contain the promise of natures return to grace its true that above the distant pale blue gorge of vallombrosa the mountainline was tipped with snow but the liberated soul of spring was nevertheless at large the view from fiesole seems vaster and richer with each visit the hollow in which florence lies and which from below seems deep and contracted opens out into an immense and generous valley and leads away the eye into a hundred gradations of distance the place itself showed amid its chequered fields and gardens with as many towers and spires as a chessboard half cleared the domes and towers were washed over with a faint blue mist the scattered columns of smoke interfused with the sinking sunlight hung over them like streamers and pennons of silver gauze and the arno twisting and curling and glittering here and there was a serpent cross striped with silver  vincigliata is a product of the millions the leisure and the eccentricity i suppose people say of an english gentlemanmr temple leader whose name should be commemorated you reach the castle from fiesole by a narrow road returning toward florence by a romantic twist through the hills and passing nothing on its way save thin plantations of cypress and cedar upward of twenty years ago i believe this gentleman took a fancy to the crumbling shell of a mediæval fortress on a breezy hilltop overlooking the val d arno and forthwith bought it and began to restore it i know nothing of what the original ruin may have cost but in the dusky courts and chambers of the present elaborate structure this impassioned archæologist must have buried a fortune he has however the compensation of feeling that he has erected a monument which if it is never to stand a feudal siege may encounter at least some critical overhauling it is a disinterested work of art and really a triumph of æsthetic culture the author has reproduced with minute accuracy a sturdy homefortress of the fourteenth century and has kept throughout such rigid terms with his model that the result is literally uninhabitable to degenerate moderns it is simply a massive facsimile an elegant museum of archaic images mainly but most amusingly counterfeit perched on a spur of the apennines the place is most politely shown there is a charming cloister painted with extremely clever quaint frescoes celebrating the deeds of the founders of the castlea cloister that is everything delightful a cloister should be except truly venerable and employable there is a beautiful castle court with the embattled tower climbing into the blue far above it and a spacious loggia with rugged medallions and mildhued luca della robbias fastened unevenly into the walls but the apartments are the great success and each of them as good a reconstruction as a tale of walter scott or to speak frankly a much better one they are all lowbeamed and vaulted stonepaved decorated in grave colours and lighted from narrow deeply recessed windows through small leadenringed plates of opaque glass  the details are infinitely ingenious and elaborately grim and the indoor atmosphere of mediaevalism most forcibly revived no compromising fact of domiciliary darkness and cold is spared us no producing condition of mediaeval manners not glanced at there are oaken benches round the room of about six inches in depth and gaunt fauteuils of wrought leather illustrating the suppressed transitions which as george eliot says unite all contrastsoffering a visible link between the modern conceptions of torture and of luxury there are fireplaces nowhere but in the kitchen where a couple of sentryboxes are inserted on either side of the great hooded chimneypiece into which people might creep and take their turn at being toasted and smoked one may doubt whether this dearth of the hearthstone could have raged on such a scale but its a happy stroke in the representation of an italian dwelling of any period it shows how the graceful fiction that italy is all meridional flourished for some time before being refuted by grumbling tourists and yet amid this cold comfort you feel the incongruous presence of a constant intuitive regard for beauty the shapely spring of the vaulted ceilings the richly figured walls coarse and hard in substance as they are the charming shapes of the great platters and flagons in the deep recesses of the quaintly carved black dressers the wandering hand of ornament as it were playing here and there for its own diversion in unlighted cornerssuch things redress to our fond credulity with all sorts of grace the balance of the picture  and yet somehow with what dim unillumined vision one fancies even such inmates as those conscious of finer needs than the mere supply of blows and beef and beer would meet passing their heavy eyes over such slender household beguilements these crepuscular chambers at vincigliata are a mystery and a challenge they seem the mere propounding of an answerless riddle you long as you wander through them turning up your coatcollar and wondering whether ghosts can catch bronchitis to answer it with some positive notion of what people so encaged and situated did how they looked and talked and carried themselves how they took their pains and pleasures how they counted off the hours deadly ennui seems to ooze out of the stones and hang in clouds in the brown corners no wonder men relished a fight and panted for a fray skullsmashers were sweet ears ringing with pain and ribs cracking in a tussle were soothing music compared with the cruel quietude of the dimwindowed castle when they came back they could only have slept a good deal and eased their dislocated bones on those meagre oaken ledges then they woke up and turned about to the table and ate their portion of roasted sheep they shouted at each other across the board and flung the wooden plates at the servingmen they jostled and hustled and hooted and bragged and then after gorging and boozing and easing their doublets they squared their elbows one by one on the greasy table and buried their scarred foreheads and dreamed of a good gallop after flying foes and the women they must have been strangely simplesimpler far than any moral archraeologist can show us in a learned restoration of course their simplicity had its graces and devices but one thinks with a sigh that as the poor things turned away with patient looks from the viewless windows to the same same looming figures on the dusky walls they hadnt even the consolation of knowing that just this attitude and movement set off by their peaked coifs their falling sleeves and heavilytwisted trains would sow the seed of yearning envyof sortson the part of later generations  there are moods in which one feels the impulse to enter a tacit protest against too gross an appetite for pure aesthetics in this starving and sinning world one turns half away musingly from certain beautiful useless things but the healthier state of mind surely is to lay no tax on any really intelligent manifestation of the curious and exquisite intelligence hangs together essentially all along the line it only needs time to make as we say its connections the massive pastiche of vincigliata has no superficial use but even if it were less complete less successful less brilliant i should feel a reflective kindness for it so disinterested and expensive a toy is its own justification it belongs to the heroics of dilettantism   iii   one grows to feel the collection of pictures at the pitti palace splendid rather than interesting after walking through it once or twice you catch the key in which it is pitchedyou know what you are likely not to find on closer examination none of the works of the uncompromising period nothing from the halfgroping geniuses of the early time those whose colouring was sometimes harsh and their outlines sometimes angular vague to me the principle on which the pictures were originally gathered and of the aesthetic creed of the princes who chiefly selected them a princely creed i should roughly call itthe creed of people who believed in things presenting a fine face to society who esteemed showy results rather than curious processes and would have hardly cared more to admit into their collection a work by one of the laborious precursors of the full efflorescence than to see a bucket and broom left standing in a state saloon the gallery contains in literal fact some eight or ten paintings of the early tuscan schoolnotably two admirable specimens of filippo lippi and one of the frequent circular pictures of the great botticellia madonna chilled with tragic prescience laying a pale cheek against that of a blighted infant such a melancholy mother as this of botticelli would have strangled her baby in its cradle to rescue it from the future but of botticelli there is much to say one of the filippo lippis is perhaps his masterpiecea madonna in a small rosegarden such a flowery close as mr william morris loves to haunt leaning over an infant who kicks his little human heels on the grass while halfadozen curlypated angels gather about him looking back over their shoulders with the candour of children in tableaux vivants and one of them drops an armful of gathered roses one by one upon the baby the delightful earthly innocence of these winged youngsters is quite inexpressible their heads are twisted about toward the spectator as if they were playing at leapfrog and were expecting a companion to come and take a jump never did young art never did subjective freshness attempt with greater success to represent those phases but these three fine works are hung over the tops of doors in a dark back roomthe bucket and broom are thrust behind a curtain it seems to me nevertheless that a fine filippo lippi is good enough company for an allori or a cigoli and that that too deeply sentient virgin of botticelli might happily balance the flowerlike irresponsibility of raphaels madonna of the chair  taking the pitti collection however simply for what it pretends to be it gives us the very flower of the sumptuous the courtly the grandducal it is chiefly official art as one may say but it presents the fine side of the typethe brilliancy the facility the amplitude the sovereignty of good taste i agree on the whole with a nameless companion and with what he lately remarked about his own humour on these matters that having been on his first acquaintance with pictures nothing if not critical and held the lesson incomplete and the opportunity slighted if he left a gallery without a headache he had come as he grew older to regard them more as the grandest of all pleasantries and less as the most strenuous of all lessons and to remind himself that after all it is the privilege of art to make us friendly to the human mind and not to make us suspicious of it we do in fact as we grow older unstring the critical bow a little and strike a truce with invidious comparisons we work off the juvenile impulse to heated partisanship and discover that one spontaneous producer isnt different enough from another to keep the allknowing fates from smiling over our loves and our aversions we perceive a certain human solidarity in all cultivated effort and are conscious of a growing accommodation of judgmentan easier disposition the fruit of experience to take the joke for what it is worth as it passes we have in short less of a quarrel with the masters we dont delight in and less of an impulse to pin all our faith on those in whom in more zealous days we fancied that we made our peculiar meanings the meanings no longer seem quite so peculiar since then we have arrived at a few in the depths of our own genius that are not sensibly less striking  and yet it must be added that all this depends vastly on ones moodas a travellers impressions do generally to a degree which those who give them to the world would do well more explicitly to declare we have our hours of expansion and those of contraction and yet while we follow the travellers trade we go about gazing and judging with unadjusted confidence we cant suspend judgment we must take our notes and the notes are florid or crabbed as the case may be a short time ago i spent a week in an ancient city on a hilltop in the humour for which i was not to blame which produces crabbed notes i knew it at the time but couldnt help it i went through all the motions of liberal appreciation i uncapped in all the churches and on the massive ramparts stared all the views fairly out of countenance but my imagination which i suppose at bottom had very good reasons of its own and knew perfectly what it was about refused to project into the dark old town and upon the yellow hills that sympathetic glow which forms half the substance of our genial impressions so it is that in museums and palaces we are alternate radicals and conservatives on some days we ask but to be somewhat sensibly affected on others ruskinhaunted to be spiritually steadied after a long absence from the pitti palace i went back there the other morning and transferred myself from chair to chair in the great goldenroofed saloonsthe chairs are all gilded and covered with faded silkin the humour to be diverted at any price i neednt mention the things that diverted me i yawn now when i think of some of them but an artist for instance to whom my kindlier judgment has made permanent concessions is that charming andrea del sarto when i first knew him in my cold youth i used to say without mincing that i didnt like him cet âge est sans pitié the fine sympathetic melancholy pleasing painter he has a dozen faults and if you insist pedantically on your rights the conclusive word you use about him will be the word weak but if you are a generous soul you will utter it lowlow as the mild grave tone of his own sought harmonies he is monotonous narrow incomplete he has but a dozen different figures and but two or three ways of distributing them he seems able to utter but half his thought and his canvases lack apparently some final return on the whole mattersome process which his impulse failed him before he could bestow and yet in spite of these limitations his genius is both itself of the great pattern and lighted by the air of a great period three gifts he had largely an instinctive unaffected unerring grace a large and rich and yet a sort of withdrawn and indifferent sobriety and best of all as well as rarest of all an indescribable property of relatedness as to the moral world whether he was aware of the connection or not or in what measure i cannot say but he gives so to speak the taste of it before his handsome vaguebrowed madonnas the mild robust young saints who kneel in his foregrounds and look round at you with a conscious anxiety which seems to say that though in the picture they are not of it but of your own sentient life of commingled love and weariness the stately apostles with comely heads and harmonious draperies who gaze up at the high seated virgin like early astronomers at a newly seen starthere comes to you the brush of the dark wing of an inward life a shadow falls for the moment and in it you feel the chill of moral suffering did the lippis suffer father or son did raphael suffer did titian did rubens suffer perish the thoughtit wouldnt be fair to us that they should have had everything and i note in our poor secondrate andrea an element of interest lacking to a number of stronger talents  interspersed with him at the pitti hang the stronger and the weaker in splendid abundance raphael is there strong in portraitureeasy various bountiful genius that he wasand strong here isnt the word but happy beyond the common dream in his beautiful madonna of the chair the general instinct of posterity seems to have been to treat this lovely picture as a semisacred an almost miraculous manifestation people stand in a worshipful silence before it as they would before a taper studded shrine if we suspend in imagination on the right of it the solid realistic unidealised portrait of leo the tenth which hangs in another room and transport to the left the fresco of the school of athens from the vatican and then reflect that these were three separate fancies of a single youthful amiable genius we recognise that such a producing consciousness must have been a treat my companion already quoted has a phrase that he doesnt care for raphael but confesses when pressed that he was a most remarkable young man titian has a dozen portraits of unequal interest i never particularly noticed till latelyit is very ill hungthat portentous image of the emperor charles the fifth he was a burlier more imposing personage than his usual legend figures and in his great puffed sleeves and gold chains and fullskirted overdress he seems to tell of a tread that might sometimes have been inconveniently resonant but the purpose to have his way and work his will is therethe great stomach for divine right the old monarchical temperament the great titian in portraiture however remains that formidable young man in black with the small compact head the delicate nose and the irascible blue eye who was he what was he ritratto virile is all the catalogue is able to call the picture virile  rather you vulgarly exclaim you may weave what romance you please about it but a romance your dream must be handsome clever defiant passionate dangerous it was not his own fault if he hadnt adventures and to spare he was a gentleman and a warrior and his adventures balanced between camp and court i imagine him the young orphan of a noble house about to come into mortgaged estates one wouldnt have cared to be his guardian bound to paternal admonitions once a month over his precocious transactions with the jews or his scandalous abduction from her convent of such and such a noble maiden  the pitti gallery contains none of titians goldentoned groups but it boasts a lovely composition by paul veronese the dealer in silver huesa baptism of christ w named it to me the other day as the picture he most enjoyed and surely painting seems here to have proposed to itself to discredit and annihilateand even on the occasion of such a subject everything but the loveliness of life the picture bedims and enfeebles its neighbours we ask ourselves whether painting as such can go further it is simply that here at last the art stands complete the early tuscans as well as leonardo as raphael as michael saw the great spectacle that surrounded them in beautiful sharpedged elements and parts the great venetians felt its indissoluble unity and recognised that form and colour and earth and air were equal members of every possible subject and beneath their magical touch the hard outlines melted together and the blank intervals bloomed with meaning in this beautiful paul veronese of the pitti everything is part of the charmthe atmosphere as well as the figures the look of radiant morning in the whitestreaked sky as well as the living human limbs the cloth of venetian purple about the loins of the christ as well as the noble humility of his attitude the relation to nature of the other italian schools differs from that of the venetian as courtshipeven ardent courtshipdiffers from marriage   iv   i went the other day to the secularised convent of san marco paid my franc at the profane little wicket which creaks away at the doorno less than six custodians apparently are needed to turn it as if it may have a recusant consciencepassed along the bright still cloister and paid my respects to fra angelicos crucifixion in that dusky chamber in the basement i looked long one can hardly do otherwise the fresco deals with the pathetic on the grand scale and after taking in its beauty you feel as little at liberty to go away abruptly as you would to leave church during the sermon you may be as little of a formal christian as fra angelico was much of one you yet feel admonished by spiritual decency to let so yearning a view of the christian story work its utmost will on you the three crosses rise high against a strange completely crimson sky which deepens mysteriously the tragic expression of the scene though i remain perforce vague as to whether this lurid background be a fine intended piece of symbolism or an effective accident of time in the first case the extravagance quite triumphs between the crosses under no great rigour of composition are scattered the most exemplary saintskneeling praying weeping pitying worshipping the swoon of the madonna is depicted at the left and this gives the holy presences in respect to the case the strangest historical or actual air everything is so real that you feel a vague impatience and almost ask yourself how it was that amid the army of his consecrated servants our lord was permitted to suffer on reflection you see that the painters design so far as coherent has been simply to offer an immense representation of pity and all with such concentrated truth that his colours here seem dissolved in tears that drop and drop however softly through all time of this single yearning consciousness the figures are admirably expressive no later painter learned to render with deeper force than fra angelico the one state of the spirit he could conceivea passionate pious tenderness immured in his quiet convent he apparently never received an intelligible impression of evil and his conception of human life was a perpetual sense of sacredly loving and being loved but how immured in his quiet convent away from the streets and the studios did he become that genuine finished perfectly professional painter no one is less of a mere mawkish amateur his range was broad from this really heroic fresco to the little trumpeting seraphs in their opaline robes enamelled as it were on the gold margins of his pictures  i sat out the sermon and departed i hope with the gentle preachers blessing i went into the smaller refectory near by to refresh my memory of the beautiful last supper of domenico ghirlandaio it would be putting things coarsely to say that i adjourned thus from a sernlon to a comedy though ghirlandaios theme as contrasted with the blessed angelicos was the dramatic spectacular side of human life how keenly he observed it and how richly he rendered it the world about him of colour and costume of handsome heads and pictorial groupings in his admirable school there is no painter one enjoyspace ruskinmore sociably and irresponsibly lippo lippi is simpler quainter more frankly expressive but we retain before him a remnant of the sympathetic discomfort provoked by the masters whose conceptions were still a trifle too large for their means the pictorial vision in their minds seems to stretch and strain their undeveloped skill almost to a sense of pain in ghirlandaio the skill and the imagination are equal and he gives us a delightful impression of enjoying his own resources of all the painters of his time he affects us least as positively not of ours he enjoyed a crimson mantle spreading and tumbling in curious folds and embroidered with needlework of gold just as he enjoyed a handsome wellrounded head with vigorous dusky locks profiled in courteous adoration he enjoyed in short the various reality of things and had the good fortune to live in an age when reality flowered into a thousand amusing gracesto speak only of those he was not especially addicted to giving spiritual hints and yet how hard and meagre they seem the professed and finished realists of our own day with the spiritual bonhomie or candour that makes half ghirlandaios richness left out the last supper at san marco is an excellent example of the natural reverence of an artist of that time with whom reverence was not as one may say a specialty the main idea with him has been the variety the material bravery and positively social charm of the scene which finds expression with irrepressible generosity in the accessories of the background instinctively he imagines an opulent gardenimagines it with a good faith which quite tides him over the reflection that christ and his disciples were poor men and unused to sit at meat in palaces great fullfruited orangetrees peep over the wall before which the table is spread strange birds fly through the air while a peacock perches on the edge of the partition and looks down on the sacred repast it is striking that without any at all intense religious purpose the figures in their varied naturalness have a dignity and sweetness of attitude that admits of numberless reverential constructions i should call all this the happy tact of a robust faith  on the staircase leading up to the little painted cells of the beato angelico however i suddenly faltered and paused somehow i had grown averse to the intenser zeal of the monk of fiesole i wanted no more of him that day i wanted no more macerated friars and speargashed sides ghirlandaios elegant way of telling his story had put me in the humour for something more largely intelligent more profanely pleasing i departed walked across the square and found it in the academy standing in a particular spot and looking up at a particular highhung picture it is difficult to speak adequately perhaps even intelligibly of sandro botticelli an accomplished criticmr pater in his studies on the history of the renaissancehas lately paid him the tribute of an exquisite a supreme curiosity he was rarity and distinction incarnate and of all the multitudinous masters of his group incomparably the most interesting the one who detains and perplexes and fascinates us most exquisitely fine his imaginationinfinitely audacious and adventurous his fancy alone among the painters of his time he strikes us as having invention the glow and thrill of expanding observation this was the feeling that sent his comrades to their easels but botticellis moved him to reactions and emotions of which they knew nothing caused his faculty to sport and wander and explore on its own account these impulses have fruits often so ingenious and so lovely that it would be easy to talk nonsense about them i hope it is not nonsense however to say that the picture to which i just alluded the coronation of the virgin with a group of lifesized saints below and a garland of miniature angels above is one of the supremely beautiful productions of the human mind it is hung so high that you need a good glass to see it to say nothing of the unprecedented delicacy of the work the lower half is of moderate interest but the dance of hand clasped angels round the heavenly couple above has a beauty newly exhaled from the deepest sources of inspiration their perfect little hands are locked with ineffable elegance their blowing robes are tossed into folds of which each line is a study their charming feet have the relief of the most delicate sculpture but as i have already noted of botticelli there is much too much to saybesides which mr pater has said all only add thus to his inimitable grace of design that the exquisite pictorial force driving him goes amaying not on wanton errands of its own but on those of some mystic superstition which trembles for ever in his heart  illustration the great eaves florence   v   the more i look at the old florentine domestic architecture the more i like itthat of the great examples at least and if i ever am able to build myself a lordly pleasurehouse i dont see how in conscience i can build it different from these they are sombre and frowning and look a trifle more as if they were meant to keep people out than to let them in but what equally important typeif there be an equally importantis more expressive of domiciliary dignity and security and yet attests them with a finer æesthetic economy they are impressively handsome and yet contrive to be so by the simplest means i dont say at the smallest pecuniary costthats another matter there is money buried in the thick walls and diffused through the echoing excess of space the merchant nobles of the fifteenth century had deep and full pockets i suppose though the present bearers of their names are glad to let out their palaces in suites of apartments which are occupied by the commercial aristocracy of another republic one is told of fine old mouldering chambers of which possession is to be enjoyed for a sum not worth mentioning i am afraid that behind these so gravely harmonious fronts there is a good deal of dusky discomfort and i speak now simply of the large serious faces themselves as you can see them from the street see them ranged cheek to cheek in the grey historic light of via dei bardi via maggio via degli albizzi the force of character the familiar severity and majesty depend on a few simple features on the great ironcaged windows of the roughhewn basement on the noble stretch of space between the summit of one high roundtopped window and the bottom of that above on the highhung sculptured shield at the angle of the house on the flat farprojecting roof and finally on the magnificent tallness of the whole building which so dwarfs our modern attempts at size the finest of these florentine palaces are i imagine the tallest habitations in europe that are frankly and amply habitationsnot mere shafts for machinery of the american grainelevator pattern some of the creations of m haussmann in paris may climb very nearly as high but there is all the difference in the world between the impressiveness of a building which takes breath as it were some six or seven times from storey to storey and of one that erects itself to an equal height in three longdrawn pulsations when a house is ten windows wide and the drawingroom floor is as high as a chapel it can afford but three floors the spaciousness of some of those ancient drawingrooms is that of a russian steppe the family circle gathered anywhere within speaking distance must resemble a group of pilgrims encamped in the desert on a little oasis of carpet madame gryzanowska living at the top of a house in that dusky tortuous old borgo pinti initiated me the other evening most good naturedly lamp in hand into the farspreading mysteries of her apartment such quarters seem a translation into space of the oldfashioned idea of leisure leisure and room have been passing out of our manners together but here and there being of stouter structure the latter lingers and survives  here and there indeed in this blessed italy reluctantly modern in spite alike of boasts and lamentations it seems to have been preserved for curiositys and fancys sake with a vague sweet odour of the embalmers spices about it i went the other morning to the corsini palace the proprietors obviously are great people one of the ornaments of rome is their great whitefaced palace in the dark trastevere and its voluminous gallery none the less delectable for the poorness of the pictures here they have a palace on the arno with another large handsome respectable and mainly uninteresting collection it contains indeed three or four fine examples of early florentines it was not especially for the pictures that i went however and certainly not for the pictures that i stayed i was under the same spell as the inveterate companion with whom i walked the other day through the beautiful private apartments of the pitti palace and who said i suppose i care for nature and i know there have been times when i have thought it the greatest pleasure in life to lie under a tree and gaze away at blue hills but just now i had rather lie on that faded seagreen satin sofa and gaze down through the open door at that retreating vista of gilded deserted haunted chambers in other words i prefer a good interior to a good landscape the impression has a greater intensitythe thing itself a more complex animation i like fine old rooms that have been occupied in a fine old way i like the musty upholstery the antiquated knickknacks the view out of the tall deepembrasured windows at garden cypresses rocking against a grey sky if you dont know why im afraid i cant tell you it seemed to me at the palazzo corsini that i did know why in places that have been lived in so long and so much and in such a fine old way as my friend saidthat is under social conditions so multifold and to a comparatively starved and democratic sense so curiousthe past seems to have left a sensible deposit an aroma an atmosphere this ghostly presence tells you no secrets but it prompts you to try and guess a few what has been done and said here through so many years what has been ventured or suffered what has been dreamed or despaired of guess the riddle if you can or if you think it worth your ingenuity the rooms at palazzo corsini suggest indeed and seem to recall but a monotony of peace and plenty one of them imaged such a noble perfection of a homescene that i dawdled there until the old custodian came shuffling back to see whether possibly i was trying to conceal a caravaggio about my person a great crimsondraped drawingroom of the amplest and yet most charming proportions walls hung with large dark pictures a great concave ceiling frescoed and moulded with dusky richness and halfadozen south windows looking out on the arno whose swift yellow tide sends up the light in a cheerful flicker i fear that in my appreciation of the particular effect so achieved i uttered a monstrous follysome momentary willingness to be maimed or crippled all my days if i might pass them in such a place in fact half the pleasure of inhabiting this spacious saloon would be that of using ones legs of strolling up and down past the windows one by one and making desultory journeys from station to station and corner to corner near by is a colossal ballroom domed and pilastered like a renaissance cathedral and superabundantly decorated with marble effigies all yellow and grey with the years   vi   in the carthusian monastery outside the roman gate mutilated and profaned though it is one may still snuff up a strong if stale redolence of old catholicism and old italy the road to it is ugly being encumbered with vulgar waggons and fringed with tenements suggestive of an irishamerican suburb your interest begins as you come in sight of the convent perched on its little mountain and lifting against the sky around the belltower of its gorgeous chapel a coronet of clustered cells you make your way into the lower gate through a clamouring press of deformed beggars who thrust at you their stumps of limbs and you climb the steep hillside through a shabby plantation which it is proper to fancy was better tended in the monkish time the monks are not totally abolished the government having the grace to await the natural extinction of the halfdozen old brothers who remain and who shuffle doggedly about the cloisters looking with their white robes and their pale blank old faces quite anticipatory ghosts of their future selves a prosaic profane old man in a coat and trousers serves you however as custodian the melancholy friars have not even the privilege of doing you the honours of their dishonour one must imagine the pathetic effect of their former silent pointings to this and that conventual treasure under stress of the feeling that such pointings were narrowly numbered the convent is vast and irregularit bristles with those picturemaking arts and accidents which one notes as one lingers and passes but which in italy the overburdened memory learns to resolve into broadly general images i rather deplore its position at the gates of a bustling cityit ought rather to be lodged in some lonely fold of the apennines and yet to look out from the shady porch of one of the quiet cells upon the teeming vale of the arno and the clustered towers of florence must have deepened the sense of monastic quietude  the chapel or rather the church which is of great proportions and designed by andrea orcagna the primitive painter refines upon the consecrated type or even quite glorifies it the massive cincture of black sculptured stalls the dusky gothic roof the highhung deeptoned pictures and the superb pavement of verd antique and dark red marble polished into glassy lights must throw the whiterobed figures of the gathered friars into the highest romantic relief all this luxury of worship has nowhere such value as in the chapels of monasteries where we find it contrasted with the otherwise so ascetic economy of the worshippers the paintings and gildings of their church the gembright marbles and fantastic carvings are really but the monastic tribute to sensuous delightan imperious need for which the fond imagination of rome has officiously opened the door one smiles when one thinks how largely a fine starved sense for the forbidden things of earth if it makes the most of its opportunities may gratify this need under cover of devotion nothing is too base too hard too sordid for real humility but nothing too elegant too amiable too caressing caressed caressable for the exaltation of faith the meaner the convent cell the richer the convent chapel out of poverty and solitude inanition and cold your honest friar may rise at his will into a mahomets paradise of luxurious analogies  there are further various dusky subterranean oratories where a number of bad pictures contend faintly with the friendly gloom two or three of these funereal vaults however deserve mention in one of them side by side sculptured by donatello in low relief lie the white marble effigies of the three members of the accaiuoli family who founded the convent in the thirteenth century in another on his back on the pavement rests a grim old bishop of the same stout race by the same honest craftsman terribly grim he is and scowling as if in his stony sleep he still dreamed of his hates and his hard ambitions last and best in another low chapel with the trodden pavement for its bed shines dimly a grand image of a later bishopleonardo buonafede who dying in 1545 owes his monument to francesco di san gallo i have seen little from this artists hand but it was clearly of the cunningest his model here was a very sturdy old prelate though i should say a very genial old man the sculptor has respected his monumental ugliness but has suffused it with a singular homely charma look of confessed physical comfort in the privilege of paradise all these figures have an inimitable reality and their lifelike marble seems such an incorruptible incarnation of the genius of the place that you begin to think of it as even more reckless than cruel on the part of the present public powers to have begun to pull the establishment down morally speaking about their ears they are lying quiet yet a while but when the last old friar dies and the convent formally lapses wont they rise on their stiff old legs and hobble out to the gates and thunder forth anathemas before which even a future and more enterprising régime may be disposed to pause  out of the great central cloister open the snug little detached dwellings of the absent fathers when i said just now that the certosa in val dema gives you a glimpse of old italy i was thinking of this great pillared quadrangle lying half in sun and half in shade of its tangled gardengrowth in the centre surrounding the ancient customary well and of the intense blue sky bending above it to say nothing of the indispensable old whiterobed monk who pokes about among the lettuce and parsley we have seen such places before we have visited them in that divinatory glance which strays away into space for a moment over the top of a suggestive book i dont quite know whether its more or less as ones fancy would have it that the monkish cells are no cells at all but very tidy little appartements complets consisting of a couple of chambers a sittingroom and a spacious loggia projecting out into space from the cliff like wall of the monastery and sweeping from pole to pole the loveliest view in the world its poor work however taking notes on views and i will let this one pass the little chambers are terribly cold and musty now their odour and atmosphere are such as one used as a child to imagine those of the schoolroom during saturday and sunday   vii   in the roman streets wherever you turn the facade of a church in more or less degenerate flamboyance is the principal feature of the scene and if in the absence of purer motives you are weary of aesthetic trudging over the corrugated surface of the seven hills a system of pavement in which small cobblestones anomalously endowed with angles and edges are alone employed you may turn aside at your pleasure and take a reviving sniff at the pungency of incense in florence one soon observes the churches are relatively few and the dusky housefronts more rarely interrupted by specimens of that extraordinary architecture which in rome passes for sacred in florence in other words ecclesiasticism is less cheap a commodity and not dispensed in the same abundance at the streetcorners heaven forbid at the same time that i should undervalue the roman churches which are for the most part treasurehouses of history of curiosity of promiscuous and associational interest it is a fact nevertheless that after st peters i know but one really beautiful church by the tiber the enchanting basilica of st mary major many have structural character some a great allure but as a rule they all lack the dignity of the best of the florentine temples here the list being immeasurably shorter and the seed less scattered the principal churches are all beautiful and yet i went into the annunziata the other day and sat there for halfanhour because forsooth the gildings and the marbles and the frescoed dome and the great rococo shrine near the door with its little black jewelled fetish reminded me so poignantly of rome such is the city properly styled eternal since it is eternal at least as regards the consciousness of the individual one loves it in its sophisticationsthough for that matter isnt it all rich and precious sophistication better than other places in their purity  coming out of the annunziata you look past the bronze statue of the grand duke ferdinand i whom mr brownings heroine used to watch forin the poem of the statue and the bustfrom the red palace near by and down a street vista of enchanting picturesqueness the street is narrow and dusky and filled with misty shadows and at its opposite end rises the vast bright coloured side of the cathedral it stands up in very much the same mountainous fashion as the farshining mass of the bigger prodigy at milan of which your first glimpse as you leave your hotel is generally through another such dark avenue only that if we talk of mountains the white walls of milan must be likened to snow and ice from their base while those of the duomo of florence may be the image of some mighty hillside enamelled with blooming flowers the big bleak interior here has a naked majesty which though it may fail of its effect at first becomes after a while extraordinarily touching originally disconcerting it soon inspired me with a passion externally at any rate it is one of the loveliest works of mans hands and an overwhelming proof into the bargain that when elegance belittles grandeur you have simply had a bungling artist  santa croce within not only triumphs here but would triumph anywhere a trifle naked if you like said my irrepressible companion but thats what i call architecture just as i dont call bronze or marble clothes save under urgent stress of portraiture statuary and indeed we are far enough away from the clustering odds and ends borrowed from every art and every province without which the ritually builded thing doesnt trust its spell to work in rome the vastness the lightness the open spring of the arches at santa croce the beautiful shape of the high and narrow choir the impression made as of mass without weight and the gravity yet reigning without gloomthese are my frequent delight and the interest grows with acquaintance the place is the great florentine valhalla the final home or memorial harbour of the native illustrious dead but that consideration of it would take me far it must be confessed moreover that between his coarselyimagined statue out in front and his horrible monument in one of the aisles the author of the divine comedy for instance is just hereabouts rather an extravagant figure ungrateful florence declaims byron ungrateful indeedwould she were more so the susceptible spirit of the great exile may be still aware enough to exclaim in common that is with most of the other immortals sacrificed on so very large a scale to current florentine plastic facility in explanation of which remark however i must confine myself to noting that as almost all the old monuments at santa croce are small comparatively small and interesting and exquisite so the modern well nigh without exception are disproportionately vast and pompous or in other words distressingly vague and vain the aptitude of hand the compositional assurance with which such things are nevertheless turned out constitutes an anomaly replete with suggestion for an observer of the present state of the arts on the soil and in the air that once befriended them taking them all together as even the soil and the air of greece scarce availed to do but on this head i repeat there would be too much to say and i find myself checked by the same warning at the threshold of the church in florence really interesting beyond santa croce beyond all others such of course easily is santa maria novella where the chapels are lined and plated with wonderful figured and peopled frescowork even as most of those in rome with precious inanimate substances these overscored retreats of devotion as dusky some of them as eremitic caves swarming with importunate visions have kept me divided all winter between the love of ghirlandaio and the fear of those seeds of catarrh to which their mortal chill seems propitious till far on into the spring so i pause here just on the praise of that delightful painteras to the spirit of whose work the reflections i have already made are but confirmed by these examples in the choir at santa maria novella where the incense swings and the great chants resound between the gorgeous coloured window and the florid grand altar he still goes in with all his might for the wicked the amusing world the world of faces and forms and characters of every sort of curious human and rare material thing  illustration boboli garden florence   viii   i had always felt the boboli gardens charming enough for me to haunt them and yet such is the interest of florence in every quarter that it took another corso of the same cheap pattern as the last to cause me yesterday to flee the crowded streets passing under that archway of the pitti palace which might almost be the gate of an etruscan city so that i might spend the afternoon among the mouldy statues that compose with their screens of cypress looking down at our clustered towers and our background of pale blue hills vaguely freckled with white villas these pleasuregrounds of the austere pitti pile with its inconsequent charm of being so roughhewn and yet somehow so elegantly balanced plead with a voice all their own the general cause of the ample enclosed planted cultivated private preservepreserve of tranquillity and beauty and immunityin the heart of a city a cause i allow for that matter easy to plead anywhere once the pretext is found the large quiet distributed towngarden with the vague hum of big grudging boundaries all about it but with everything worse excluded being of course the most insolentlypleasant thing in the world in addition to which when the garden is in the italian manner with flowers rather remarkably omitted as too flimsy and easy and cheap and without lawns that are too smart paths that are too often swept and shrubs that are too closely trimmed though with a fanciful formalism giving style to its shabbiness and here and there a dusky ilexwalk and here and there a driedup fountain and everywhere a piece of mildewed sculpture staring at you from a green alcove and just in the right place above all a grassy amphitheatre curtained behind with black cypresses and sloping downward in mossy marble stepswhen i say the place possesses these attractions and you lounge there of a soft sunday afternoon the racier spectacle of the streets having made your fellowloungers few and left you to the deep stillness and the shady vistas that lead you wonder where left you to the insidious irresistible mixture of nature and art nothing too much of either only a supreme happy resultant a divine tertium quid under these conditions it need scarce be said the revelation invoked descends upon you  the boboli gardens are not largeyou wonder how compact little florence finds room for them within her walls but they are scattered to their extreme their allromantic advantage and felicity over a group of steep undulations between the rugged and terraced palace and a stillsurviving stretch of city wall where the unevenness of the ground much adds to their apparent size you may cultivate in them the fancy of their solemn and haunted character of something faint and dim and even if you like tragic in their prescribed their functional smile as if they borrowed from the huge monument that overhangs them certain of its ponderous memories and regrets this course is open to you i mention but it isnt enjoined and will doubtless indeed not come up for you at all if it isnt your habit cherished beyond any other to spin your impressions to the last tenuity of fineness now that i bethink myself i must always have happened to wander here on grey and melancholy days it remains none the less true that the place contains thank goodnessor at least thank the grave the infinitelydistinguished traditional taste of florenceno cheerful trivial object neither parterres nor pagodas nor peacocks nor swans they have their famous amphitheatre already referred to with its degrees or stone benches of a thoroughly aged and mottled complexion and its circular wall of evergreens behind in which small cracked images and vases things that according to association and with the law of the same quite indefinable may make as much on one occasion for exquisite dignity as they may make on another for to express it kindly nothing at all something was once done in this charmed and forsaken circledone or meant to be done what was it dumb statues who saw it with your blank eyes opposite stands the huge flatroofed palace putting forward two great rectangular arms and looking with its closed windows and its foundations of almost unreduced rock like some ghost of a sample of a ruder babylon in the wide courtlike space between the wings is a fine old white marble fountain that never plays its dusty idleness completes the general air of abandonment chancing on such a cluster of objects in italyglancing at them in a certain light and a certain moodi get perhaps on too easy terms you may think a sense of history that takes away my breath generations of medici have stood at these closed windows embroidered and brocaded according to their period and held fetes champetres and floral games on the greensward beneath the mouldering hemicycle and the medici were great people but what remains of it all now is a mere tone in the air a faint sigh in the breeze a vague expression in things a passiveor call it rather perhaps to be fair a shyly pathetically responsiveaccessibility to the yearning guess call it much or call it little the ineffaceability of this deep stain of experience it is the interest of old places and the bribe to the brooding analyst time has devoured the doers and their doings but there still hangs about some effect of their passage we can layout parks on virgin soil and cause them to bristle with the most expensive importations but we unfortunately cant scatter abroad again this seed of the eventual human soul of a placethat comes but in its time and takes too long to grow there is nothing like it when it has come      tuscan cities   the cities i refer to are leghorn pisa lucca and pistoia among which i have been spending the last few days the most striking fact as to leghorn it must be conceded at the outset is that being in tuscany it should be so scantily tuscan the traveller curious in local colour must content himself with the deep blue expanse of the mediterranean the streets away from the docks are modern genteel and rectangular liverpool might acknowledge them if it werent for their cleancoloured sun bleached stucco they are the offspring of the new industry which is death to the old idleness of interesting architecture fruit of the old idleness or at least of the old leisure leghorn is singularly destitute it has neither a church worth ones attention nor a municipal palace nor a museum and it may claim the distinction unique in italy of being the city of no pictures in a shabby corner near the docks stands a statue of one of the elder grand dukes of tuscany appealing to posterity on grounds now vaguechiefly that of having placed certain moors under tribute four colossal negroes in very bad bronze are chained to the base of the monument which forms with their assistance a sufficiently fantastic group but to patronise the arts is not the line of the livornese and for want of the slender annuity which would keep its precinct sacred this curious memorial is buried in dockyard rubbish i must add that on the other hand there is a very wellconditioned and in attitude and gesture extremely natural and familiar statue of cavour in one of the city squares and in another a couple of effigies of recent grand dukes represented that is dressed or rather undressed in the character of heroes of plutarch leghorn is a city of magnificent spaces and it was so long a journey from the sidewalk to the pedestal of these images that i never took the time to go and read the inscriptions and in truth vaguely i bore the originals a grudge and wished to know as little about them as possible for it seemed to me that as patres patrae in their degree they might have decreed that the great blank ochrefaced piazza should be a trifle less ugly there is a distinct amenity however in any experience of italy almost anywhere and i shall probably in the future not be above sparing a light regret to several of the hours of which the one i speak of was composed i shall remember a large cool bourgeois villa in the garden of a noiseless suburba middleaged villa franco i owe it as a genial pleasant pension the tribute of recognition roomy and stony as an italian villa should be i shall remember that as i sat in the garden and looking up from my book saw through a gap in the shrubbery the red house tiles against the deep blue sky and the grey underside of the ilexleaves turned up by the mediterranean breeze it was all still quite tuscany if tuscany in the minor key  if you should naturally desire in such conditions a higher intensity you have but to proceed by a very short journey to pisawhere for that matter you will seem to yourself to have hung about a good deal already and from an early age few of us can have had a childhood so unblessed by contact with the arts as that one of its occasional diversions shant have been a puzzled scrutiny of some alabaster model of the leaning tower under a glass cover in a backparlour pisa and its monuments have in other words been industriously vulgarised but it is astonishing how well they have survived the process the charm of the place is in fact of a high order and but partially foreshadowed by the famous crookedness of its campanile i felt it irresistibly and yet almost inexpressibly the other afternoon as i made my way to the classic corner of the city through the warm drowsy air which nervous people come to inhale as a sedative i was with an invalid companion who had had no sleep to speak of for a fortnight ah stop the carriage she sighed or yawned as i could feel deliciously in the shadow of this old slumbering palazzo and let me sit here and close my eyes and taste for an hour of oblivion once strolling over the grass however out of which the quartette of marble monuments rises we awaked responsively enough to the present hour most people remember the happy remark of tasteful oldfashioned forsyth who touched a hundred other points in his italy scarce less happily as to the fact that the four famous objects are fortunate alike in their society and their solitude it must be admitted that they are more fortunate in their society than we felt ourselves to be in ours for the scene presented the animated appearance for which on any fine spring day all the choicest haunts of ancient quietude in italy are becoming yearly more remarkable there were clamorous beggars at all the sculptured portals and bait for beggars in abundance trailing in and out of them under convoy of loquacious ciceroni i forget just how i apportioned the responsibility of intrusion for it was not long before fellow tourists and fellowcountrymen became a vague deadened muffled presence that of the dentists last words when he is giving you ether they suffered mystic disintegration in the dense bright tranquil air so charged with its own messages the cathedral and its companions are fortunate indeed in everythingfortunate in the spacious angle of the grey old citywall which folds about them in their sculptured elegance like a strong protecting arm fortunate in the broad greensward which stretches from the marble base of cathedral and cemetery to the rugged foot of the rampart fortunate in the little vagabonds who dot the grass plucking daisies and exchanging italian cries fortunate in the palegold tone to which time and the soft seadamp have mellowed and darkened their marble plates fortunate above all in an indescribable grace of grouping half hazard half design which insures them in ones memory of things admired very much the same isolated corner that they occupy in the charming city  of the smaller cathedrals of italy i know none i prefer to that of pisa none that on a moderate scale produces more the impression of a great church it has without so modest a measurability represents so clean and compact a mass that you are startled when you cross the threshold at the apparent space it encloses an architect of genius for all that he works with colossal blocks and cumbrous pillars is certainly the most cunning of conjurors the front of the duomo is a small pyramidal screen covered with delicate carvings and chasings distributed over a series of short columns upholding narrow arches it might be a sought imitation of goldsmiths work in stone and the area covered is apparently so small that extreme fineness has been prescribed how it is therefore that on the inner side of this façade the wall should appear to rise to a splendid height and to support one end of a ceiling as remote in its gilded grandeur one could almost fancy as that of st peters how it is that the nave should stretch away in such solemn vastness the shallow transepts emphasise the grand impression and the apse of the choir hollow itself out like a dusky cavern fretted with golden stalactites is all matter for exposition by a keener architectural analyst than i to sit somewhere against a pillar where the vista is large and the incidents cluster richly and vaguely revolve these mysteries without answering them is the best of ones usual enjoyment of a great church it takes no deep sounding to conclude indeed that a gigantic byzantine christ in mosaic on the concave roof of the choir contributes largely to the particular impression here as of very old and choice and original and individual things it has even more of stiff solemnity than is common to works of its school and prompts to more wonder than ever on the nature of the human mind at a time when such unlovely shapes could satisfy its conception of holiness truly pathetic is the fate of these huge mosaic idols thanks to the change that has overtaken our manner of acceptance of them strong the contrast between the original sublimity of their pretensions and the way in which they flatter that free sense of the grotesque which the modern imagination has smuggled even into the appreciation of religious forms they were meant to yield scarcely to the deity itself in grandeur but the only part they play now is to stare helplessly at our critical our aesthetic patronage of them the spiritual refinement marking the hither end of a progress had nt however to wait for us to signalise it it found expression three centuries ago in the beautiful specimen of the painter sodoma on the wall of the choir this latter a small sacrifice of isaac is one of the best examples of its exquisite author and perhaps as chance has it the most perfect opposition that could be found in the way of the range of taste to the effect of the great mosaic there are many painters more powerful than sodomapainters who like the author of the mosaic attempted and compassed grandeur but none has a more persuasive grace none more than he was to sift and chasten a conception till it should affect one with the sweetness of a perfectly distilled perfume  of the patient successive efforts of painting to arrive at the supreme refinement of such a work as the sodoma the campo santo hard by offers a most interesting memorial it presents a long blank marble wall to the relative profaneness of the cathedral close but within it is a perfect treasurehouse of art this quadrangular defence surrounds an open court where weeds and wild roses are tangled together and a sunny stillness seems to rest consentingly as if nature had been won to consciousness of the precious relics committed to her something in the quality of the place recalls the collegiate cloisters of oxford but it must be added that this is the handsomest compliment to that seat of learning the open arches of the quadrangles of magdalen and christ church are not of mellow carrara marble nor do they offer to sight columns slim and elegant that seem to frame the unglazed windows of a cathedral to be buried in the campo santo of pisa i may however further qualify you need only be or to have more or less anciently been illustrious and there is a liberal allowance both as to the character and degree of your fame the most obtrusive object in one of the long vistas is a most complicated monument to madame catalani the singer recently erected by her possibly tooappreciative heirs the wide pavement is a mosaic of sepulchral slabs and the walls below the base of the paling frescoes are incrusted with inscriptions and encumbered with urns and antique sarcophagi the place is at once a cemetery and a museum and its especial charm is its strange mixture of the active and the passive of art and rest of life and death originally its walls were one vast continuity of closely pressed frescoes but now the great capricious scars and stains have come to outnumber the pictures and the cemetery has grown to be a burialplace of pulverised masterpieces as well as of finished lives the fragments of painting that remain are fortunately the best for one is safe in believing that a host of undimmed neighbours would distract but little from the two great works of orcagna most people know the triumph of death and the last judgment from descriptions and engravings but to measure the possible good faith of imitative art one must stand there and see the painters howling potentates dragged into hell in all the vividness of his bright hard colouring see his feudal courtiers on their palfreys hold their noses at what they are so fast coming to see his great christ in judgment refuse forgiveness with a gesture commanding enough really inhuman enough to make virtue merciless for ever the charge that michael angelo borrowed his cursing saviour from this great figure of orcagna is more valid than most accusations of plagiarism but of the two figures one at least could be spared for direct triumphant expressiveness these two superb frescoes have probably never been surpassed the painter aims at no very delicate meanings but he drives certain gross ones home so effectively that for a parallel to his process one must look to the art of the actor the emphasising pointmaking mime some of his female figures are superbthey represent creatures of a formidable temperament  there are charming women however on the other side of the cloisterin the beautiful frescoes of benozzo gozzoli if orcagnas work was appointed to survive the ravage of time it is a happy chance that it should be balanced by a group of performances of such a different temper the contrast is the more striking that in subject the inspiration of both painters is strictly even though superficially theological but benozzo cares in his theology for nothing but the story the scene and the dramathe chance to pile up palaces and spires in his backgrounds against pale blue skies crossbarred with pearly fleecy clouds and to scatter sculptured arches and shady trellises over the front with every incident of human life going forward lightly and gracefully beneath them lightness and grace are the painters great qualities marking the hithermost limit of unconscious elegance after which style and science and the wisdom of the serpent set in his charm is natural fineness a little more and we should have refinementwhich is a very different thing like all les délicats of this world as m renan calls them benozzo has suffered greatly the space on the walls he originally covered with his old testament stories is immense but his exquisite handiwork has peeled off by the acre as one may almost say and the latter compartments of the series are swallowed up in huge white scars out of which a helpless head or hand peeps forth like those of creatures sinking into a quicksand as for pisa at large although it is not exactly what one would call a mouldering cityfor it has a certain wellaired cleanness and brightness even in its supreme tranquillityit affects the imagination very much in the same way as the campo santo and in truth a city so ancient and deeply historic as pisa is at every step but the burialground of a larger life than its present one the wide empty streets the goodly tuscan palaceswhich look as if about all of them there were a genteel private understanding independent of placards that they are to be let extremely cheapthe delicious relaxing air the full flowing yellow river the lounging pisani smelling metaphorically their poppyflowers seemed to me all so many admonitions to resignation and oblivion and this is what i mean by saying that the charm of pisa apart from its cluster of monuments is a charm of a high order the architecture has but a modest dignity the lions are few there are no fixed points for stopping and gaping and yet the impression is profound the charm is a moral charm if i were ever to be incurably disappointed in life if i had lost my health my money or my friends if i were resigned forevermore to pitching my expectations in a minor key i should go and invoke the pisan peace its quietude would seem something more than a stillness a hush pisa may be a dull place to live in but its an ideal place to wait for death  nothing could be more charming than the country between pisa and luccaunless possibly the country between lucca and pistoia if pisa is dead tuscany lucca is tuscany still living and enjoying desiring and intending the town is a charming mixture of antique character and modern inconsequence and not only the town but the countrythe blooming romantic country which you admire from the famous promenade on the citywall the wall is of superbly solid and intensely toned brickwork and of extraordinary breadth and its summit planted with goodly trees and swelling here and there into bastions and outworks and little open gardens surrounds the city with a circular loungingplace of a splendid dignity this wellkept shady ivygrown rampart reminded me of certain mossy corners of england but it looks away to a prospect of more than english lovelinessa broad green plain where the summer yields a double crop of grain and a circle of bright blue mountains speckled with highhung convents and profiled castles and nestling villas and traversed by valleys of a deeper and duskier blue in one of the deepest and shadiest of these recesses one of the most sympathetic of small wateringplaces is hidden away yet a while longer from easy invasionthe baths to which lucca has lent its name lucca is preeminently a city of churches ecclesiastical architecture being indeed the only one of the arts to which it seems to have given attention there are curious bits of domestic architecture but no great palaces and no importunate frequency of pictures the cathedral however sums up the merits of its companions and is a singularly noble and interesting church its peculiar boast is a wonderful inlaid front on which horses and hounds and hunted beasts are lavishly figured in black marble over a white ground what i chiefly appreciated in the grey solemnity of the nave and transepts was the superb effect of certain secondstorey gothic archesthose which rest on the pavement being lombard these arches are delicate and slender like those of the cloister at pisa and they play their part in the dusky upper air with real sublimity  at pistoia there is of course a cathedral and there is nothing unexpected in its being externally at least highly impressive in its having a grand campanile at its door a gaudy baptistery in alternate layers of black and white marble across the way and a stately civic palace on either side but even had i the space to do otherwise i should prefer to speak less of the particular objects of interest in the place than of the pleasure i found it to lounge away in the empty streets the quiet hours of a warm afternoon to say where i lingered longest would be to tell of a little square before the hospital out of which you look up at the beautiful frieze in coloured earthernware by the brothers della robbia which runs across the front of the building it represents the seven orthodox offices of charity and with its brilliant blues and yellows and its tender expressiveness brightens up amazingly to the sense and soul this little grey comer of the mediaeval city pi stoia is still mediaeval how grassgrown it seemed how drowsy how full of idle vistas and melancholy nooks if nothing was supremely wonderful everything was delicious  illustration the hospital pistoia  1874      other tuscan cities   i   i had scanted charming pisa even as i had scanted great siena in my original small report of it my scarce more than stammering notes of years before but even if there had been meagreness of mere gaping visionwhich there in fact hadnt beenas well as insufficieny of public tribute the indignity would soon have ceased to weigh on my conscience for to this affection i was to return again still oftener than to the strong call of siena my eventual frequentations of pisa all merely impressionistic and amateurish as they might beand i pretended up and down the length of the land to none otherleave me at the hither end of time with little more than a confused consciousness of exquisite quality on the part of the small sweet scrap of a place of ancient glory a consciousness so pleadingly content to be general and vague that i shrink from pulling it to pieces the republic of pisa fought with the republic of florence through the ages so ferociously and all but invincibly that what is so pale and languid in her today may well be the aspect of any civil or still more military creature bled and bled and bled at the critical time of its life she has verily a just languor and is touchingly anæmic the past history or at any rate the present perfect acceptedness of which condition hangs about her with the last grace of weakness making her state in this particular the very secret of her irresistible appeal i was to find the appeal again and again one of the sweetest tenderest even if not one of the fullest and richest impressions possible and if i went back whenever i could it was very much as one doesnt indecently neglect a gentle invalid friend the couch of the invalid friend beautifully appealingly resigned has been wheeled say for the case into the warm still garden and your visit but consists of your sitting beside it with kind discreet testifying silences such is the figurative form under which the once rugged enemy of florence stretched at her length by the rarely troubled arno today presents herself and i find my analogy complete even to my sense of the mere mild séance the inevitably tacit communion or rather blank interchange between motionless cripple and hardly more incurable admirer  the terms of my enjoyment of pisa scarce departed from that idealslow contemplative perambulations rather late in the day and after work done mostly in the particular decent innroom that was repeatedly my portion where the sunny flicker of the river played up from below to the very ceiling which by the same sign anciently and curiously raftered and hanging over my table at a great height had been colourpencilled into ornament as fine for all practical purposes as the page of a missal i add to this for remembrance an inveteracy of evening idleness and of reiterated ices in front of one of the quiet cafésquiet as everything at pisa is quiet or will certainly but in these latest days have ceased to be one in especial so beautifully so mysteriously void of bustle that almost always the neighbouring presence and admirable chatter of some group of the local university students would fall upon my ear by the halfhour at a time not less as a privilege frankly than as a clearcut image of the young italian mind and life by which i lost nothing i use such terms as admirable and privilege in this last most casual of connectionswhich was moreover no connection at all but what my attention made itsimply as an acknowledgment of the interest that might play there through some inevitable thoughts these were for that matter intensely in keeping with the ancient scene and air they dealt with the exquisite difference between that tone and type of ingenuous adolescence in the mere relation of charmed auditionand other forms of juvenility of whose mental and material accent one had elsewhere met the assault civilised charmingly civilised were my loquacious neighboursas how had nt they to be one asked ones self through the use of a medium of speech that is in itself a sovereign saturation there was the beautiful congruity of the happilycaught impression the fact of my young mens general tuscanism of tongue which related them so on the spot to the whole historic consensus of things it wasnt dialectas it of course easily might have been elsewhere at milan at turin at bologna at naples it was the clear italian in which all the rest of the surrounding story was told all the rest of the result of time recorded and it made them delightful prattling unconscious men of the particular little constituted and bequeathed world which everything else that was charged with old meanings and old beauty referred toall the more that their talk was never by any chance of romping games or deeds of violence but kept flowering charmingly and incredibly into eager ideas and literary opinions and philosophic discussions and upon my honour vital questions  they have taken me too far for so light a reminiscence but i claim for the loose web of my impressions at no point a heavier texture which comes back to what i was a moment ago saying that just in proportion as you feel the morbid charm of pisa you press on it gently and this somehow even under stress of whatever respectful attention i found this last impulse at all events so far as i was concerned quite contentedly spend itself in a renewed sense of the simple large pacified felicity of such an afternoon aspect as that of the lung arno taken up or down its course whether to within sight of small santa maria della spina the tiny the delicate the exquisite gothic chapel perched where the quay drops straight or in the other direction toward the melting perspective of the narrow local pleasureground the rather thin and careless bosky grace of which recedes beside the stream whose very turbidity pleases to a middle distance of hot and tangled and exuberant rural industry and a proper blue horizon of carrara mountains the pisan lung arno is shorter and less featured and framed than the florentine but it has the fine accent of a marked curve and is quite as bravely tuscan witness the type of riverfronting palace which in halfadozen massive specimens the last word of the anciently handsome are of the essence of the physiognomy of the place in the glow of which retrospective admission i ask myself how i came under my first flush reflected in other pages to fail of justice to so much proud domestic architecturein the very teeth moreover of the fact that i was for ever paying my compliments in a wistful wondering way to the fine palazzo lanfranchi occupied in 1822 by the migratory byron and whither leigh hunt as commemorated in the latters autobiography came out to join him in an odd journalistic scheme  of course however i need scarcely add the centre of my daily revolutionquite thereby on the circumferencewas the great company of four in their sequestered corner objects of regularly recurrent pious pilgrimage if for no other purpose than to see whether each would each time again so inimitably carry itself as one of a group of wonderfullyworked old ivories their charm of relation to each other and to everything else that concerns them that of the quartette of monuments is more or less inexpressible all round but not the least of it ever is in their beautiful secret for taking at different hours and seasons in different states of the light the sky the wind the weatherin different states even it used verily to seem to me of an admirers imagination or temper or nervesdifferent complexional appearances different shades and pallors different glows and chills i have seen them look almost viciously black and i have seen them as clear and fair as pale gold and these things for the most part off on the large grassy carpet spread for them and with the elbow of the old citywall not elsewhere erect respectfully but protectingly crooked about to the tune of a usual unanimity save perhaps in the case of the leaning towerso abnormal a member of any respectable family this structure at best that i always somehow fancied its three companions the cathedral the baptistery and the campo santo capable of quiet common understandings for the major or the minor effect into which their odd fellow no hint thrown out to him was left to enter as he might if one haunted the place one ended by yielding to the conceit that beautifully though the others of the group may be said to behave about him one sometimes caught them in the act of tacitly combining to ignore himas if he had after so long begun to give on their nerves or is that absurdity but my shamefaced form of admission that for all the wonder of him he finally gave on mine franklyi would put it at such momentshe becomes at last an optical bore or betise  illustration the loggia lucca   ii   to lucca i was not to return ofteni was to return only once when that compact and admirable little city the very model of a small pays de cocagne overflowing with everything that makes for ease for plenty for beauty for interest and good example renewed for me in the highest degree its genial and robust appearance the perfection of this renewal must indeed have been at bottom the ground of my rather hanging back from possible excess of acquaintancewith the instinct that so right and rich and rounded a little impression had better be left than endangered i remember positively saying to myself the second time that no brownandgold tuscan city even could be as happy as lucca lookedsave always exactly lucca so that on the chance of any shade of human illusion in the case i wouldnt as a brooding analyst go within fifty miles of it again just so i fear i must confess it was this mere face value of the place that when i went back formed my sufficiency i spent all my scant timeor the greater part for i took a day to drive over to the bagnijust gaping at its visible attitude this may be described as that of simply sitting there through the centuries at the receipt of perfect felicity on its splendid solid seat of russet masonry that isfor its great republican ramparts of long ago still lock it tightwith its wide gardenland its ancient appanage or hereditary domain teeming and blooming with everything that is good and pleasant for man all about and with a ring of graceful and noble yet comparatively unbeneficed uplands and mountains watching it for very envy across the plain as a circle of bigger boys in the playground may watch a privileged or pampered smaller one munch a particularly fine apple half smothered thus in oil and wine and corn and all the fruits of the earth lucca seems fairly to laugh for goodhumour and its as if one cant say more for her than that thanks to her putting forward for you a temperament somehow still richer than her heritage you forgive her at every turn her fortune she smiles up at you her greeting as you dip into her wide lap out of which you may select almost any rare morsel whatever looking back at my own choice indeed i see it must have suffered a certain embarrassmentthat of the sense of too many things for i scarce remember choosing at all any more than i recall having had to go hungry i turned into all the churchestaking care however to pause before one of them though before which i now irrecoverably forget for verification of ruskins so characteristically magnified rapture over the high and rather narrow and obscure huntingfrieze on its frontand in the cathedral paid my respects at every turn to the greatest of lucchesi matteo civitale wisest sanest homeliest kindest of quattrocento sculptors to whose works the duomo serves almost as a museum but my nearest approach to anything so invidious as a discrimination or a preference under the spell of so felt an equilibrium must have been the act of engaging a carriage for the baths  that inconsequence once perpetrated let me add the impression was as right as any otherthe impression of the drive through the huge general tangled and fruited podere of the countryside that of the pair of jogging hours that bring the visitor to where the wideish gate of the valley of the serchio opens the question after this became quite other the narrowing though always more or less smiling gorge that draws you on and on is a different a distinct proposition altogether with its own individual grace of appeal and association it is the association exactly that would even now on this page beckon me forward or perhaps i should rather say backwardwerent more than a glance at it out of the questionto a view of that easier and not so inordinately remote past when people spent the summer in these perhaps slightly stuffy shades i speak of that age i think of it at least as easier than ours in spite of the fact that even as i made my pilgrimage the mark of modern change the railway in construction had begun to be distinct though the automobile was still pretty far in the future the relations and proportions of everything are of course now alteredi indeed i confess wince at the vision of the cloud of motordust that must in the fine season hang over the whole connection that represents greater promptness of approach to the bosky depths of ponteaserraglio and the bagni caldi but it throws back the other time that of the old jogging relation of the tuscan grandducal season and the small cosmopolite sociability into quite arcadian air and the comparatively primitive scale the easier italy of our infatuated precursors there wears its glamour of facility not through any question of the development of communications but through the very absence of the dream of that boon thanks to which every one among the infatuated lived on terms of so much closer intercourse with the general object of their passion after we had crossed the serchio that beautiful day we passed into the charming the amiably tortuous the thickly umbrageous valley of the lima and then it was that i seemed fairly to remount the stream of time figuring to myself wistfully at the small scattered centres of entertainment modest inns pensions and other places of convenience clustered where the friendly torrent is bridged or the forested slopes adjust themselveswhat the summer days and the summer rambles and the summer dreams must have been in the blest place when people by which i mean the contingent of beguiled barbarians didnt know better as we say than to content themselves with such a mild substitute such a soft sweet and essentially elegant apology for adventure one wanted not simply to hang about a little but really to live back as surely one might have done by staying on into the so romantically strong if mechanically weak italy of the associations of ones youth it was a pang to have to revert to the present even in the form of luccawhich says everything   iii   if undeveloped communications were to become enough for me at those retrospective moments i might have felt myself supplied to my taste let me go on to say at the hour of my making with great resolution an attempt on highseated and quite grandly outoftheway volterra a reminiscence associated with quite a different year and i should perhaps sooner have bethought myself with my fond experience of pisainasmuch as it was during a pause under that bland and motionless wing that i seem to have had to organise in the darkness of a summer dawn my approach to the old etruscan stronghold the railway then existed but i rose in the dim small hours to take my train moreover so far as that might too much savour of an incongruous facility the fault was in due course quite adequately repaired by an apparent repudiation of any awareness of such false notes on the part of the town i may not invite the reader to penetrate with me by so much as a step the boundless backward reach of history to which the more massive of the etruscan gates of volterra the porta all arco forms the solidest of thresholds since i perforce take no step myself and am even exceptionally condemned here to impressionism unashamed my errand was to spend a sunday with an italian friend a native in fact of the place master of a house there in which he offered me hospitality who also arriving from florence the night before had obligingly come on with me from pisa and whose consciousness of a due urbanity already rather overstrained and still well before noon by the accumulation of our matutinal vicissitudes and other grounds for patience met all ruefully at the station the supreme shock of an apparently great desolate world of volcanic hills of blank though engineered undulations as the emergence of a road testified unmitigated by the smallest sign of a wheeled vehicle the station in other words looked out at that time and i daresay the case hasnt strikingly altered on a mere bare huge hillcountry by some remote mighty shoulder of which the goal of our pilgrimage so questionably served by the railway was hidden from view served as well by a belated omnibus a fourin hand of lame and lamentable quality the place i hasten to add eventually put forth some show of being after a complete practical recognition of which let me at once further mention all the other the positive and sublime connections of volterra established themselves for me without my lifting a finger  the small shrunken but still lordly prehistoric city is perched when once you have rather painfully zigzagged to within sight of it very much as an eagles eyrie oversweeping the land and the sea and to that type of position the ideal of the airy peak of vantage with all accessories and minor features a drop a slide and a giddiness its individual items and elements strike you at first as instinctively conforming this impression was doubtless after a little modified for me there were levels there were small stony practicable streets there were walks and strolls outside the gates and roundabout the cyclopean wall to the far end of downwardtending protrusions and promontories natural buttresses and pleasant terrene headlands friendly suburban spots one would call them if the word had less detestable references where games of bowls and overtrellised winetables could put in their note in spite of which however my friends little house of hospitality clean and charming and oh so immemorially tuscan was as perpendicular and ladderlike as so compact a residence could be it kept up for me beautifullyas regards posture and air though humanly and socially it rather cooed like a dovecotethe illusion of the vertiginously balanced eagles nest the air in truth all the rest of that splendid day must have been the key to the promptlyproduced intensity of ones relation to every aspect of the charming episode the light cool keen air of those delightful high places in italy that tonically correct the ardours of july and which at our actual altitude could but affect me as the very breath of the grand local legend i might have had the little house our particular eagles nest for the summer and even on such touching terms and i well remember the force of the temptation to take it if only other complications had permitted to spend the series of weeks with that admirable interesting freshness in my lungs interesting i especially note as the strong appropriate medium in which a continuity with the irrecoverable but still effective past had been so robustly preserved i couldnt yield alas to the conceived felicity which had halfadozen appealing aspects i could only while thus feeling how the atmospheric medium itself made for a positively initiative exhilaration enjoy my illusion till the morrow the exhilaration therefore supplies to memory the whole light in which for the too brief time i went about seeing volterra so that my glance at the seated splendour reduces itself as i have said to the merest impressionism nothing more was to be looked for on the stretched surface of consciousness from one breezy wash of the brush i find there the clean strong image simplified to the three or four unforgettable particulars of the vast rake of the view with the maremma of evil fame more or less immediately below but with those islands of the sea corsica and elba the names of which are sharply associational beyond any others dressing the far horizon in the grand manner and the ligurian coastline melting northward into beauty and history galore with colossal uncemented blocks of etruscan gates and walls plunging youand by their very interestinto a sweet surrender of any privilege of appreciation more crushing than your general synthetic stare and with the rich and perfectly arranged museum an unsurpassed exhibition of monumental treasure from etruscan tombs funereal urns mainly reliquaries of an infinite power to move and charm us still contributing to this same so designed but somehow at the same time so inspired collapse of the historic imagination under too heavy a pressure or abeyance of private judgment in too unequal a relation   iv   i remember recovering private judgment indeed in the course of two or three days following the excursion i have just noted which must have shaped themselves in some sort of consonance with the idea that as we were hereabouts in the very middle of dim etruria a common selfrespect prescribed our somehow profiting by the fact this kindled in us the spirit of exploration but with results of which i here attempt to record so utterly does the whole impression swoon away for present memory into vagueness confusion and intolerable heat our selfrespect was of the common order but the blaze of the july sun was even for tuscany of the uncommon so that the project of a trudging quest for etruscan tombs in shadeless wastes yielded to its own temerity there comes back to me nevertheless at the same time from the mild misadventure and quite as through this positive humility of failure the sense of a supremely intimate revelation of italy in undress so to speak the state it seemed in which one would most fondly most ideally enjoy her italy no longer in winter starch and sobriety with winter manners and winter prices and winter excuses all addressed to the forestieri and the philistines but lolling at her length with her graces all relaxed and thereby only the more natural the brilliant performer in short en famille the curtain down and her salary stopped for the seasonthanks to which she is by so much more the easy genius and the good creature as she is by so much less the advertised prima donna she received us nowhere more sympathetically that is with less ceremony or self consciousness i seem to recall than at montepulciano for instancewhere it was indeed that the recovery of private judgment i just referred to couldnt help taking place what we were doing or what we expected to do at montepulciano i keep no other trace of than is bound up in a present quite tender consciousness that i wouldnt for the world not have been there i think my reason must have been largely just in the beauty of the name for could any beauty be greater reinforced no doubt by the fame of the local vintage and the sense of how we should quaff it on the spot perhaps we quaffed it too constantly since the romantic picture reduces itself for me but to two definite appearances that of the more priggish discrimination so far reasserting itself as to advise me that montepulciano was dirty even remarkably dirty and that of her being not much else besides but perched and brown and queer and crooked and noble withal which is what almost any tuscan city more easily than not acquits herself of all the while she may on such occasions figure when one looks off from her to the end of dark street vistas or catches glimpses through high arcades some big battered blistered overladen overmasted ship swimming in a violet sea  if i have lost the sense of what we were doing that could at all suffer commemoration at montepulciano so i sit helpless before the memory of small stewing torrita which we must somehow have expected to yield under our confidence a view of shy charms but which did nt yield to my recollection even anything that could fairly be called a breakfast or a dinner there may have been in the neighbourhood a rumour of etruscan tombs the neighbourhood however was vast and that possibility not to be verified in the conditions save after due refreshment then it was doubtless that the question of refreshment so beckoned us by a direct appeal straight across country from perugia that casting consistency if not to the winds since alas there were none but to the lifeless air we made the sweltering best of our way and it took for the distance a terrible time to the grand hotel of that city this course shines for me in the retrospect with a light even more shameless than that in which my rueful conscience then saw it since we thus exchanged again at a stroke the tousled bonne fille of our vacational tuscany for the formal and figgedout presence of italy on her good behaviour we had never seen her conform more to all the proprieties we felt than under this aspect of lavish hospitality to that now apparently quite inveterate swarm of pampered forestieri english and americans in especial who having had roman palaces and villas deliciously to linger in break the northward journey when once they decide to take it in the umbrian paradise they were goodness knows within their rights and we profited as anyone may easily and cannily profit at that time by the sophistications paraded for them only i feel as i pleasantly recover it all that though we had arrived perhaps at the most poetical of wateringplaces we had lost our finer clue the difference from other days was immense all the span of evolution from the ancient malodorous inn which somehow did nt matter to that new type of polyglot caravanserai which everywhere insists on matteringmattering even in places where other interests abound so much more than anything else that clue the finer as i say i would fain at any rate today pick up for its close attachment to another tuscan city or twofor a felt pull from strange little san gimignano delle belle torre in especial by which i mean from the memory of a summer sunday spent there during a stay at siena but i have already superabounded for mere love of my general present rubricthe real thickness of experience having a good deal evaporated so that the tiny town of the many towers hangs before me not to say rather far behind me after the manner of an object directly meeting the wrong or diminishing lens of ones telescope  it did everything on the occasion of that pilgrimage that it was expected to do presenting itself more or less in the guise of some rare silvery shell washed up by the sea of time cracked and battered and dishonoured with its mutilated marks of adjustment to the extinct type of creature it once harboured figuring against the sky as maimed gesticulating arms flourished in protest against fate if the centuries however had pretty well cleaned out vulgarly speaking this amazing little fortresstown it wasnt that a mere aching void was bequeathed us i recognise as i consult a somewhat faded impression the whole scene and occasion come back to me as the exhibition on the contrary of a stage rather crowded and agitated of no small quantity of sound and fury of concussions discussions vociferations hurryings to and fro that could scarce have reached a higher pitch in the old days of the siege and the sortie san gimignano affected me to a certainty as not dead i mean but as inspired with that strange and slightly sinister new life that is now in case after case up and down the peninsula and even in presence of the dryest and most scattered bones producing the miracle of resurrection the effect is oftenand i find it strikingly involved in this particular reminiscencethat of the buried hero himself positively waking up to show you his bones for a fee and almost capering about in his appeal to your attention what has become of the soul of san gimignano who shall saybut of a genial modern sunday it is as if the heroic skeleton risen from the dust were in high activity officious for your entertainment and your detention clattering and changing plates at the informal friendly inn personally conducting you to a sight of the admirable santa fina of ghirlandaio as i believe is supposed in a dim chapel of the collegiata church the poor young saint on her low bed in a state of ecstatic vision the angelic apparition is given acconpanied by a few figures and accessories of the most beautiful and touching truth this image is what has most vividly remained with me of the day i thus so ineffectually recover the precious illset gem or domestic treasure of santa fina and then the wonderful drive at eventide back to siena the progress through the darkening land that was like a dense fragrant garden all fireflies and warm emanations and dimlyseen motionless festoons extravagant vines and elegant branches intertwisted for miles with couples and companies of young countryfolk almost as fondly united and raising their voices to the night as if superfluously to sing out at you that they were happy and above all were tuscan on reflection and to be just i connect the slightly incongruous loudness that hung about me under the beautiful towers with the really too coarse competition for my favour among the young vetturini who lay in wait for my approach and with an eye to my subsequent departure on my quitting at some unremembered spot the morning train from siena from which point there was then still a drive that onset was of a fine mediaeval violence but the subsiding echoes of it alone must have afterwards borne me company mingled at the worst with certain reverberations of the animated rather than concentrated presence of sundry young sketchers and copyists of my own nationality which element in the picture conveyed beyond anything else how thoroughly it was all to sit again henceforth in the eye of day my final vision perhaps was of a sacred reliquary not so much rudely as familiarly and humorously torn open the note had with all its references its own interest but i never went again  illustration towers of san gimignano      ravenna   i write these lines on a cold swiss mountaintop shut in by an intense white mist from any glimpse of the underworld of lovely italy but as i jotted down the other day in the ancient capital of honorius and theodoric the few notes of which they are composed i let the original date stand for local colours sake its mere look as i transcribe it emits a grateful glow in the midst of the alpine rawness and gives a depressed imagination something tangible to grasp while awaiting the return of fine weather for ravenna was glowing less than a week since as i edged along the narrow strip of shadow binding one side of the empty white streets after a long chill spring the summer this year descended upon italy with a sudden jump and an ominous hot breath i stole away from florence in the night and even on top of the apennines under the dull starlight and in the rushing train one could but sit and pant perspiringly  at bologna i found a festa or rather two festas a civil and a religious going on in mutual mistrust and disparagement the civil that of the statuto was the one fully national italian holiday as by law establishedthe day that signalises everywhere over the land at once its achieved and hardwon unification the religious was a jubilee of certain local churches the latter is observed by the bolognese parishes in couples and comes round for each couple but once in ten yearsan arrangement by which the faithful at large insure themselves a liberal recurrence of expensive processions it was nt my business to distinguish the sheep from the goats the pious from the profane the prayers from the scoffers it was enough that melting together under the scorching sun they filled the admirably solid city with a flood of spectacular life the combination at one point was really dramatic while a long procession of priests and young virgins in white veils bearing tapers marshalled itself in one of the streets a review of the kings troops went forward outside the town on its return a large detachment of cavalry passed across the space where the incense was burning the pictured banners swaying and the litany being droned and checked the advance of the little ecclesiastical troop the long vista of the street between the porticoes was festooned with garlands and scarlet and tinsel the robes and crosses and canopies of the priests the clouds of perfumed smoke and the white veils of the maidens were resolved by the hot bright air into a gorgeous medley of colour across which the mounted soldiers rattled and flashed as if it had been a conquering army trampling on an embassy of propitiation it was to tell the truth the first time an italian festa had really exhibited to my eyes the genial glow and the romantic particulars promised by song and story and i confess that those eyes found more pleasure in it than they were to find an hour later in the picturesque on canvas as one observes it in the pinacoteca i found myself scowling most unmercifully at guido and domenichino  for ravenna however i had nothing but smilesgrave reflective philosophic smiles i hasten to add such as accord with the historic dignity not to say the mortal sunny sadness of the place i arrived there in the evening before even at drowsy ravenna the festa of the statuto had altogether put itself to bed i immediately strolled forth from the inn and found it sitting up a while longer on the piazza chiefly at the cafe door listening to the band of the garrison by the light of a dozen or so of feeble tapers fastened along the front of the palace of the government before long however it had dispersed and departed and i was left alone with the grey illumination and with an affable citizen whose testimony as to the manners and customs of ravenna i had aspired to obtain i had borrowing confidence from prompt observation suggested deferentially that it was nt the liveliest place in the world and my friend admitted that it was in fact not a seat of ardent life but had i seen the corso without seeing the corso one did nt exhaust the possibilities the corso of ravenna of a hot summer night had an air of surprising seclusion and repose here and there in an upper closed window glimmered a light my companions footsteps and my own were the only sounds not a creature was within sight the suffocating air helped me to believe for a moment that i walked in the italy of boccaccio handinhand with the plague through a city which had lost half its population by pestilence and the other half by flight i turned back into my inn profoundly satisfied this at last was the oldworld dulness of a prime distillation this at last was antiquity history repose  the impression was largely confirmed and enriched on the following day but it was obliged at an early stage of my visit to give precedence to anotherthe lively perception namely of the thinness of my saturation with gibbon and the other sources of legend at ravenna the waiter at the café and the coachman who drives you to the pineforest allude to galla placidia and justinian as to any attractive topic of the hour wherever you turn you encounter some fond appeal to your historic presence of mind for myself i could only attune my spirit vaguely to so ponderous a challenge could only feel i was breathing an air of prodigious records and relics i conned my guidebook and looked up at the great mosaics and then fumbled at poor murray again for some intenser light on the court of justinian but i can imagine that to a visitor more intimate with the originals of the various great almondeyed mosaic portraits in the vaults of the churches these extremely curious works of art may have a really formidable interest i found in the place at large by daylight the look of a vast straggling depopulated village the streets with hardly an exception are grassgrown and though i walked about all day i failed to encounter a single wheeled vehicle i remember no shop but the little establishment of an urbane photographer whose views of the pineta the great legendary pineforest just without the town gave me an irresistible desire to seek that refuge there was no architecture to speak of and though there are a great many large domiciles with aristocratic names they stand cracking and baking in the sun in no very comfortable fashion the houses have for the most part an all but rustic rudeness they are low and featureless and shabby as well as interspersed with high garden walls over which the long arms of tangled vines hang motionless into the stagnant streets here and there in all this dreariness in some particularly silent and grassy corner rises an old brick church with a front more or less spoiled by cheap modernisation and a strange cylindrical campanile pierced with small arched windows and extremely suggestive of the fifth century these churches constitute the palpable interest of ravenna and their own principal interest after thirteen centuries of wellintentioned spoliation resides in their unequalled collection of early christian mosaics it is an interest simple as who should say almost to harshness and leads ones attention along a straight and narrow way there are older churches in rome and churches which looked at as museums are more variously and richly informing but in rome you stumble at every step on some curious pagan memorial often beautiful enough to make your thoughts wander far from the strange stiff primitive christian forms  ravenna on the other hand began with the church and all her monuments and relics are harmoniously rigid by the middle of the first century she possessed an exemplary saint apollinaris a disciple of peter to whom her two finest places of worship are dedicated it was to one of these jocosely entitled the new that i first directed my steps i lingered outside a while and looked at the great red barrelshaped belltowers so rusty so crumbling so archaic and yet so resolute to ring in another century or two and then went in to the coolness the shining marble columns the queer old sculptured slabs and sarcophagi and the long mosaics that scintillated under the roof along the wall of the nave san apollinare nuovo like most of its companions is a magazine of early christian odds and ends fragments of yellow marble incrusted with quaint sculptured emblems of primitive dogma great rough troughs containing the bones of old bishops episcopal chairs with the marble worn narrow by centuries of pressure from the solid episcopal person slabs from the fronts of old pulpits covered with carven hierogylphics of an almost egyptian abstrusenesslambs and stags and fishes and beasts of theological affinities even less apparent upon all these strange things the strange figures in the great mosaic panorama look down with coloured cheeks and staring eyes lifelike enough to speak to you and answer your wonderment and tell you in bad latin of the decadence that it was in such and such a fashion they believed and worshipped first on each side near the door are houses and ships and various old landmarks of ravenna then begins a long procession on one side of twentytwo whiterobed virgins and three obsequious magi terminating in a throne bearing the madonna and child surrounded by four angels on the other side of an equal number of male saints twentyfive that is holding crowns in their hands and leading to a saviour enthroned between angels of singular expressiveness what it is these long slim seraphs express i cannot quite say but they have an odd knowing sidelong look out of the narrow ovals of their eyes which though not without sweetness would certainly make me murmur a defensive prayer or so were i to find myself alone in the church towards dusk all this work is of the latter part of the sixth century and brilliantly preserved the gold backgrounds twinkle as if they had been inserted yesterday and here and there a figure is executed almost too much in the modern manner to be interesting for the charm of mosaic work is to my sense confined altogether to the infancy of the art the great christ in the series of which i speak is quite an elaborate picture and yet he retains enough of the orthodox stiffness to make him impressive in the simpler elder sense he is clad in a purple robe even as an emperor his hair and beard are artfully curled his eyebrows arched his complexion brilliant his whole aspect such a one as the popular mind may have attributed to honorius or valentinian it is all very byzantine and yet i found in it much of that interest which is inseparable to a facile imagination from all early representations of our lord practically they are no more authentic than the more or less plausible inventions of ary scheffer and holman hunt in spite of which they borrow a certain value factitious perhaps but irresistible from the mere fact that they are twelve or thirteen centuries less distant from the original it is something that this was the way the people in the sixth century imagined jesus to have looked the image has suffered by so many the fewer accretions the great purplerobed monarch on the wall of ravenna is at least a very potent and positive christ and the only objection i have to make to him is that though in this character he must have had a full apportionment of divine foreknowledge he betrays no apprehension of dr channing and m renan if ones preference lies for distinctness sake between the old plainness and the modern fantasy one must admit that the plainness has here a very grand outline  illustration sant apollinar nuovo ravenna  i spent the rest of the morning in charmed transition between the hot yellow streets and the cool grey interiors of the churches the greyness everywhere was lighted up by the scintillation on vault and entablature of mosaics more or less archaic but always brilliant and elaborate and everywhere too by the same deep amaze of the fact that while centuries had worn themselves away and empires risen and fallen these little cubes of coloured glass had stuck in their allotted places and kept their freshness i have no space for a list of the various shrines so distinguished and to tell the truth my memory of them has already become a very generalised and undiscriminated record the total aspect of the place its sepulchral stillness its absorbing perfume of evanescence and decay and mortality confounds the distinctions and blurs the details the cathedral which is vast and high has been excessively modernised and was being still more so by a lavish application of tinsel and cotton velvet in preparation for the centenary feast of st apollinaris which befalls next month things on this occasion are to be done handsomely and a fair ravennese informed me that a single family had contributed three thousand francs towards a months vesper music it seemed to me hereupon that i should like in the august twilight to wander into the quiet nave of san apollinare and look up at the great mosaics through the resonance of some fine chanting i remember distinctly enough however the tall basilica of san vitale of octagonal shape like an exchange or customhousemodelled i believe upon st sophia at constantinople it has a great span of height and a great solemnity as well as a choir densely pictured over on arch and apse with mosaics of the time of justinian these are regular pictures full of movement gesture and perspective and just enough sobered in hue by time to bring home their remoteness in the middle of the church under the great dome sat an artist whom i envied making at an effective angle a study of the choir and its broken lights its decorated altar and its incrusted twinkling walls the picture when finished will hang i suppose on the library wall of some person of taste but even if it is much better than is probablei did nt look at itall his taste wont tell the owner unless he has been there in just what a soundless mouldering outoftheway corner of old italy it was painted an even better place for an artist fond of dusky architectural nooks except that here the dusk is excessive and he would hardly be able to tell his green from his red is the extraordinary little church of the santi nazaro e celso otherwise known as the mausoleum of galla placidia this is perhaps on the whole the spot in ravenna where the impression is of most sovereign authority and most thrilling force it consists of a narrow lowbrowed cave shaped like a latin cross every inch of which except the floor is covered with dense symbolic mosaics before you and on each side through the thick brown light loom three enormous barbaric sarcophagi containing the remains of potentates of the lower empire it is as if history had burrowed under ground to escape from research and you had fairly run it to earth on the right lie the ashes of the emperor honorius and in the middle those of his sister galla placidia a lady who i believe had great adventures on the other side rest the bones of constantius iii the place might be a small natural grotto lined with glimmering mineral substances and there is something quite tremendous in being shut up so closely with these three imperial ghosts the shadow of the great roman name broods upon the huge sepulchres and abides for ever within the narrow walls  but still other memories hang about than those of primitive bishops and degenerate emperors byron lived here and dante died here and the tomb of the one poet and the dwelling of the other are among the advertised appeals the grave of dante it must be said is anything but dantesque and the whole precinct is disposed with that odd vulgarity of taste which distinguishes most modern italian tributes to greatness the author of the divine comedy commemorated in stucco even in a slumbering corner of ravenna is not sympathetic fortunately of all poets he least needs a monument as he was preeminently an architect in diction and built himself his temple of fame in verses more solid than cyclopean blocks if dantes tomb is not dantesque so neither is byrons house byronic being a homely shabby twostoried dwelling directly on the street with as little as possible of isolation and mystery in byrons time it was an inn and it is rather a curious reflection that cain and the vision of judgment should have been written at an hotel the fact supplies a commanding precedent for selfabstraction to tourists at once sentimental and literary i must declare indeed that my acquaintance with ravenna considerably increased my esteem for byron and helped to renew my faith in the sincerity of his inspiration a man so much de son temps as the author of the abovenamed and other pieces can have spent two long years in this stagnant city only by the help of taking a great deal of disinterested pleasure in his own genius he had indeed a notable pastimethe various churches are adorned with monuments of ancestral guicciolisbut it is none the less obvious that ravenna fifty years ago would have been an intolerably dull residence to a foreigner of distinction unequipped with intellectual resources the hour one spends with byrons memory then is almost compassionate after all one says to ones self as one turns away from the grandiloquent little slab in front of his house and looks down the deadly provincial vista of the empty sunny street the author of so many superb stanzas asked less from the world than he gave it one of his diversions was to ride in the pineta which beginning a couple of miles from the city extends some twentyfive miles along the sands of the adriatic i drove out to it for byrons sake and dantes and boccaccios all of whom have interwoven it with their fictions and for that of a possible whiff of coolness from the sea between the city and the forest in the midst of malarious rice swamps stands the finest of the ravennese churches the stately temple of san apollinare in classe the emperor augustus constructed hereabouts a harbour for fleets which the ages have choked up and which survives only in the title of this ancient church its extreme loneliness makes it doubly impressive they opened the great doors for me and let a shaft of heated air go wander up the beautiful nave between the twentyfour lustrous pearly columns of cipollino marble and mount the wide staircase of the choir and spend itself beneath the mosaics of the vault i passed a memorable halfhour sitting in this wave of tempered light looking down the cool grey avenue of the nave out of the open door at the vivid green swamps and listening to the melancholy stillness i rambled for an hour in the wood of associations between the tall smooth silvery stems of the pines and beside a creek which led me to the outer edge of the wood and a view of white sails gleaming and gliding behind the sandhills it was infinitely it was nobly quaint but as the trees stand at wide intervals and bear far aloft in the blue air but a little parasol of foliage i suppose that of a glaring summer day the forest itself was only the more characteristic of its clime and country for being perfectly shadeless  illustration ravenna pineta  1873      the saints afternoon and others   before and above all was the sense that with the narrow limits of past adventure i had never yet had such an impression of what the summer could be in the south or the south in the summer but i promptly found it for the occasion a good fortune that my terms of comparison were restricted it was really something at a time when the stride of the traveller had become as long as it was easy when the sevenleague boots positively hung for frequent use in the closet of the most sedentary to have kept ones self so innocent of strange horizons that the bay of naples in june might still seem quite final that picture struck mea particular corner of it at least and for many reasonsas the last word and it is this last word that comes back to me after a short interval in a green grey northern nook and offers me again its warm bright golden meaning before it also inevitably catches the chill too precious surely for us not to suffer it to help us as it may is the faculty of putting together again in an order the sharp minutes and hours that the wave of time has been as ready to pass over as the salt sea to wipe out the letters and words your stick has traced in the sand let me at any rate recover a sufficient number of such signs to make a sort of sense   i   far aloft on the great rock was pitched as the first note and indeed the highest of the wondrous concert the amazing creation of the friend who had offered me hospitality and whom more almost than i had ever envied anyone anything i envied the privilege of being able to reward a heated artless pilgrim with a revelation of effects so incalculable there was none but the loosest prefigurement as the creaking and puffing little boat which had conveyed me only from sorrento drew closer beneath the prodigious islandbeautiful horrible and hauntedthat does most of all the happy elements and accidents towards making the bay of naples for the study of composition a lesson in the grand style there was only above and below through the blue of the air and sea a great confused shining of hot cliffs and crags and buttresses a loss from nearness of the splendid couchant outline and the more comprehensive mass and an opportunityoh not lost i assure youto sit and meditate even moralise on the empty deck while a happy brotherhood of american and german tourists including of course many sisters scrambled down into little waiting rocking tubs and after a few strokes popped systematically into the small orifice of the blue grotto there was an appreciable moment when they were all lost to view in that receptacle the daily psychological moment during which it must so often befall the recalcitrant observer on the deserted deck to find himself aware of how delightful it might be if none of them should come out again the charm the fascination of the idea is not a littlethough also not whollyin the fact that as the wave rises over the aperture there is the most encouraging appearance that they perfectly may not there it is there is no more of them it is a case to which nature has by the neatest stroke and with the best taste in the world just quietly attended  beautiful horrible haunted that is the essence of what about itself capri says to youdip again into your tacitus and see why and yet while you roast a little under the awning and in the vaster shadow it is not because the trail of tiberius is ineffaceable that you are most uneasy the trail of germanicus in italy today ramifies further and bites perhaps even deeper a proof of which is precisely that his eclipse in the blue grotto is inexorably brief that here he is popping out again bobbing enthusiastically back and scrambling triumphantly back the spirit in truth of his effective appropriation of capri has a broadfaced candour against which there is no standing up supremely expressive as it is of the wellknown love that kills of germanicuss fatal susceptibility if i were to let myself however incline to that aspect of the serious case of capri i should embark on strange depths the straightness and simplicity the classic synthetic directness of the german passion for italy make this passion probably the sentiment in the world that is in the act of supplying enjoyment in the largest sweetest mouthfuls and there is something unsurpassably marked in the way that on this irresistible shore it has seated itself to ruminate and digest it keeps the record in its own loud accents it breaks out in the folds of the hills and on the crests of the crags into every manner of symptom and warning huge advertisements and portents stare across the bay the acclivities bristle with breweries and restorations and with great ugly gothic names i hasten of course to add that some such general consciousness as this may well oppress under any sky at the centurys end the brooding tourist who makes himself a prey by staying anywhere when the gong sounds behind it is behind in the track and the reaction that he least makes out the end of it all perceives that to visit anyones country for anyones sake is more and more to find some one quite other in possession no one least of all the brooder himself is in his own   ii   i certainly at any rate felt the force of this truth when on scaling the general rock with the eye of apprehension i made out at a point much nearer its summit than its base the gleam of a dizzilyperched white seagazing front which i knew for my particular landmark and which promised so much that it would have been welcome to keep even no more than half let me instantly say that it kept still more than it promised and by no means least in the way of leaving far below it the worst of the outbreak of restorations and breweries there is a road at present to the upper village with which till recently communication was all by rude steps cut in the rock and diminutive donkeys scrambling on the flints one of those fine flights of construction which the great roadmaking latin races take wherever they prevail without advertisement or bombast and even while i followed along the face of the cliff its climbing consolidated ledge i asked myself how i could think so well of it without consistently thinking better still of the temples of beer so obviously destined to enrich its terminus the perfect answer to that was of course that the brooding tourist is never bound to be consistent what happier law for him than this very one precisely when on at last alighting high up in the blue air to stare and gasp and almost disbelieve he embraced little by little the beautiful truth particularly on this occasion reserved for himself and took in the stupendous picture for here above all had the thought and the hand come from far away even from ultima thule and yet were in possession triumphant and acclaimed well all one could say was that the way they had felt their opportunity the divine conditions of the place spoke of the advantage of some such intellectual perspective as a remote original standpoint alone perhaps can give if what had finally with infinite patience passion labour taste got itself done there was like some supreme reward of an old dream of italy something perfect after long delays was it not verily in ultima thule that the vow would have been piously enough made and the germ tenderly enough nursed for a certain art of asking of italy all she can give you must doubtless either be a rare raffine or a rare genius a sophisticated norseman or just a gabriele d annunzio  all she can give appeared to me assuredly for that day and the following gathered up and enrolled there in the wondrous cluster and dispersal of chambers corners courts galleries arbours arcades long white ambulatories and vertiginous points of view the greatest charm of all perhaps was that thanks to the particular conditions she seemed to abound to overflow in directions in which i had never yet enjoyed the chance to find her so free the indispensable thing was therefore in observation in reflection to press the opportunity hard to recognise that as the abundance was splendid so by the same stroke it was immensely suggestive it dropped into ones lap naturally at the end of an hour or two the little white flower of its formula the brooding tourist in other words could only continue to brood till he had made out in a measure as i may say what was so wonderfully the matter with him he was simply then in the presence more than ever yet of the possible poetry of the personal and social life of the south and the fun would depend muchas occasions are fleetingon his arriving in time in the interest of that imagination which is his only field of sport at adequate new notations of it the sense of all this his obscure and special fun in the general bravery mixed on the morrow with the long human hum of the bright hot day and filled up the golden cup with questions and answers the feast of st antony the patron of the upper town was the one thing in the air and of the private beauty of the place there on the narrow shelf in the shining shaded loggias and above the blue gulfs all comers were to be made free   iii   the churchfeast of its saint is of course for anacapri as for any selfrespecting italian town the great day of the year and the smaller the small country in native parlance as well as the simpler accordingly the life the less the chance for leakage on other pretexts of the stored wine of loyalty this pure fluid it was easy to feel overnight had not sensibly lowered its level so that nothing indeed when the hour came could well exceed the outpouring all up and down the sorrentine promontory the early summer happens to be the time of the saints and i had just been witness there of a week on every day of which one might have travelled through kickedup clouds and other demonstrations to a different hot holiday there had been no bland evening that somewhere or other in the hills or by the sea the white dust and the red glow didnt rise to the dim stars dust perspiration illumination conversationthese were the regular elements theyre very civilised a friend who knows them as well as they can be known had said to me of the people in general plenty of fireworks and plenty of talk thats all they ever want that they were civilisedon the side on which they were most to showwas therefore to be the word of the whole business and nothing could have in fact had more interest than the meaning that for the thirtysix hours i read into it  seen from below and diminished by distance anacapri makes scarce a sign and the road that leads to it is not traceable over the rock but it sits at its ease on its high wide table of which it coversand with picturesque southern culture as wellas much as it finds convenient as much of it as possible was squeezed all the morning for st antony into the piazzetta before the church and as much more into that edifice as the robust odour mainly prevailing there allowed room for it was the odour that was in prime occupation and one could only wonder how so many men women and children could cram themselves into so much smell it was surely the smell thick and resisting that was least successfully to be elbowed meanwhile the good saint before he could move into the air had among the tapers and the tinsel the operamusic and the pulpit poundings bravely to snuff it up the shade outside was hot and the sun was hot but we waited as densely for him to come out or rather to come on as the pit at the opera waits for the great tenor there were people from below and people from the mainland and people from pomerania and a brass band from naples there were other figures at the end of longer stringsstrings that some of them indeed had pretty well given way and were now but little snippets trailing in the dust oh the queer sense of the good old capri of artistic legend of which the name itself was in the more benighted yearsyears of the contadina and the pifferaroa bright evocation oh the echo on the spot of each romantic tale oh the loafing painters so bad and so happy the conscious models the vague personalities the beautiful capri girl was of course not missed though not perhaps so beautiful as in her ancient glamour which none the less didnt at all exclude the probable presencewith his legendary light quite undimmedof the english lord in disguise who will at no distant date marry her the whole thing was there one held it in ones hand  the saint comes out at last borne aloft in long procession and under a high canopy a rejoicing staring smiling saint openly delighted with the one happy hour in the year on which he may take his own walk frocked and tonsured but not at all macerated he holds in his hand a small wax puppet of an infant jesus and shows him to all their friends to whom he nods and bows to whom in the dazzle of the sun he literally seems to grin and wink while his litter sways and his banners flap and every one gaily greets him the ribbons and draperies flutter and the white veils of the marching maidens the music blares and the guns go off and the chants resound and it is all as holy and merry and noisy as possible the processiondown to the delightful little tinselled and barebodied babies miniature st antonys irrespective of sex led or carried by proud papas or brown grandsiresincludes so much of the population that you marvel there is such a muster to look onlike the charades given in a family in which every one wants to act but it is all indeed in a manner one house the little highniched island community and nobody therefore even in the presence of the head of it puts on an air of solemnity singular and suggestive before everything else is the absence of any approach to our notion of the posture of respect and this among people whose manners in general struck one as so good and in particular as so cultivated the office of the saintof which the festa is but the annual reaffirmationinvolves not the faintest attribute of remoteness or mystery  while with my friend i waited for him we went for coolness into the second church of the place a considerable and bedizened structure with the rare curiosity of a wondrous pictured pavement of majolica the garden of eden done in large coloured tiles or squares with every beast bird and river and a brave diminuendo in especial from portal to altar of perspective so that the animals and objects of the foreground are big and those of the successive distances differ with much propriety here in the sacred shade the old women were knitting gossipping yawning shuffling about here the children were romping and larking here in a manner were the open parlour the nursery the kindergarten and the conversazione of the poor this is everywhere the case by the southern sea i remember near sorrento a wayside chapel that seemed the scene of every function of domestic life including cookery and others the odd thing is that it all appears to interfere so little with that special civilised notethe note of mannerswhich is so constantly touched it is barbarous to expectorate in the temple of your faith but that doubtless is an extreme case is civilisation really measured by the number of things people do respect there would seem to be much evidence against it the oldest societies the societies with most traditions are naturally not the least ironic the least blasees and the african tribes who take so many things into account that they fear to quit their huts at night are not the fine flower   iv   where on the other hand it was impossible not to feel to the full all the charming riguardito use their own good wordin which our friends could abound was that afternoon in the extraordinary temple of art and hospitality that had been benignantly opened to me hither from three oclock to seven all the world from the small in particular to the smaller and the smallest might freely flock and here from the first hour to the last the huge strawbellied flasks of purple wine were tilted for all the thirsty they were many the thirsty they were three hundred they were unending but the draughts they drank were neither countable nor counted this boon was dispensed in a long pillared portico where everything was white and light save the blue of the great bay as it played up from far below or as you took it in between shining columns with your elbows on the parapet sorrento and vesuvius were over against you naples furthest off melted in the middle of the picture into shimmering vagueness and innocence and the long arm of posilippo and the presence of the other islands procida the stricken ischia made themselves felt to the left the grand air of it all was in ones very nostrils and seemed to come from sources too numerous and too complex to name it was antiquity in solution with every brown mild figure every note of the old speech every tilt of the great flask every shadow cast by every classic fragment adding its touch to the impression what was the secret of the surprising amenityto the essence of which one got no nearer than simply by feeling afresh the old story of the deep interfusion of the present with the past you had felt that often before and all that could at the most help you now was that more than ever yet the present appeared to become again really classic to sigh with strange elusive sounds of virgil and theocritus heaven only knows how little they would in truth have had to say to it but we yield to these visions as we must and when the imagination fairly turns in its pain almost any soft name is good enough to soothe it  it threw such difficulties but a step back to say that the secret of the amenity was style for what in the world was the secret of style which you might have followed up and down the abysmal old italy for so many a year only to be still vainly calling for it everything at any rate that happy afternoon in that place of poetry was bathed and blessed with it the castle of barbarossa had been on the height behind the villa of black tiberius had overhung the immensity from the right the white arcades and the cool chambers offered to every step some sweet old piece of the past some rounded porphyry pillar supporting a bust some shaft of pale alabaster upholding a trellis some mutilated marble image some bronze that had roughly resisted our host if we came to that had the secret but he could only express it in grand practical ways one of them was precisely this wonderful afternoon tea in which tea onlythat good as it is has never the note of stylewas not to be found the beauty and the poetry at all events were clear enough and the extraordinary uplifted distinction but where in all this it may be asked was the element of horror that i have spoken of as sensiblewhat obsession that was not charming could find a place in that splendid light out of which the long summer squeezes every secret and shadow im afraid im driven to plead that these evils were exactly in ones imagination a predestined victim always of the cruel the fatal historic sense to make so much distinction how much history had been neededso that the whole air still throbbed and ached with it as with an accumulation of ghosts to whom the very climate was pitiless condemning them to blanch for ever in the general glare and grandeur offering them no dusky northern nook no place at the friendly fireside no shelter of legend or song   v   my friend had among many original relics in one of his white galleriesand how he understood the effect and the value of whitenesstwo or three reproductions of the finest bronzes of the naples museum the work of a small band of brothers whom he had found himself justified in trusting to deal with their problem honourably and to bring forth something as different as possible from the usual compromise of commerce they had brought forth in especial for him a copy of the young resting slightlypanting mercury which it was a pure delight to live with and they had come over from naples on st antonys eve as they had done the year before to report themselves to their patron to keep up good relations to drink capri wine and to join in the tarantella they arrived late while we were at supper they received their welcome and their billet and i am not sure it was not the conversation and the beautiful manners of these obscure young men that most fixed in my mind for the time the sense of the side of life that all around was to come out strongest it would be artless no doubt to represent them as high types of innocence or even of energyat the same time that weighing them against some ruder folk of our own race we might perhaps have made bold to place their share even of these qualities in the scale it was an impression indeed never infrequent in italy of which i might in these days first have felt the force during a stay just earlier with a friend at sorrentoa friend who had goodnaturedly had in on his wondrous terrace after dinner for the pleasure of the gaping alien the usual local quartette violins guitar and flute the musical barber the musical tailor sadler joiner humblest sons of the people and exponents of neapolitan song neapolitan song as we know has been blown well about the world and it is late in the day to arrive with a ravished ear for it that however was scarcely at all for me the question the question on the sorrento terrace so high up in the cool capri night was of the present outlook in the world for the races with whom it has been a tradition in intercourse positively to please  the personal civilisation for intercourse of the musical barber and tailor of the pleasant young craftsmen of my other friends company was something that could be trusted to make the brooding tourist brood afreshto say more to him in fact all the rest of the second occasion than everything else put together the happy address the charming expression the indistinctive discretion the complete eclipse in short of vulgarity and brutalitythese things easily became among these people the supremely suggestive note begetting a hundred hopes and fears as to the place that with the present general turn of affairs about the globe is being kept for them they are perhaps what the races politically feeble have still most to contribute but what appears to be the happy prospect for the races politically feeble and so the afternoon waned among the mellow marbles and the pleasant folkthe purple wine flowed the golden light faded song and dance grew free and circulation slightly embarrassed but the great impression remained and finally was exquisite it was all purple wine all art and song and nobody a grain the worse it was fireworks and conversation the former in the piazzetta were to come later it was civilisation and amenity i took in the greater picture but i lost nothing else and i talked with the contadini about antique sculpture no nobody was a grain the worse and i had plenty to think of so it was i was quickened to remember that we others we of my own country as a race politically not weak had by what i had somewhere just heardopened three hundred saloons at manila   vi   the other afternoons i here pass on toand i may include in them for that matter various mornings scarce less charmingly sacred to memorywere occasions of another and a later year a brief but all felicitous impression of naples itself and of the approach to it from rome as well as of the return to rome by a different wonderful way which i feel i shall be wise never to attempt to improve on let me muster assurance to confess that this comparatively recent and superlatively rich reminiscence gives me for its first train of ineffable images those of a motorrun that beginning betimes of a splendid june day and seeing me with my genial companions blissfully out of porta san paolo hung over us thus its benediction till the splendour had faded in the lamplit rest of the chiaja well go by the mountains my friend of the chariot of fire had said and well come back after three days by the sea which handsome promise flowered into such flawless performance that i could but feel it to have closed and rounded for me beyond any further rehandling the longdrawn rather indeed than thickstudded chaplet of my visitations of naplesfrom the first seasoned with the highest sensibility of youth forty years ago to this last the other day i find myself noting with interestand just to be able to emphasise it is what inspires me with these remarks that in spite of the milder and smoother and perhaps pictorially speaking considerably emptier neapolitan face of things things in general of our later time i recognised in my final impression a grateful a beguiling serenity the place is at the best wild and weird and sinister and yet seemed on this occasion to be seated more at her ease in her immense natural dignity my disposition to feel that i hasten to add was doubtless my own secret my three beautiful days at any rate filled themselves with the splendid harmony several of the minor notes of which ask for a place such as it may be just here  wondrously it was a clean and cool and as who should say quiet and amply interspaced naplesin tune with itself no harsh jangle of forestieri vulgarising the concert i seemed in fact under the blaze of summer the only strangerthough the blaze of summer itself was for that matter everywhere but a higher pitch of light and colour and tradition and a lower pitch of everything else even it struck me of sound and fury the appeal in short was genial and faring out to pompeii of a sunday afternoon i enjoyed there for the only time i can recall the sweet chance of a late hour or two the hour of the lengthening shadows absolutely alone the impression remains ineffaceableit was to supersede halfadozen other mixed memories the sense that had remained with me from far back of a pilgrimage always here beset with traps and shocks and vulgar importunities achieved under fatal discouragements even pompeii in fine haunt of all the cockneys of creation burned itself in the warm still eventide as clear as glass or as the glow of a pale topaz and the particular cockney who roamed without a plan and at his ease but with his feet on roman slabs his hands on roman stones his eyes on the roman void his consciousness really at last of some good to him could open himself as never before to the fond luxurious fallacy of a close communion a direct revelation with which there were other moments for him not less the fruit of the slow unfolding of time the clearest of these again being those enjoyed on the terrace of a small islandvillathe island a rock and the villa a wondrous little rockgarden unless a better term would be perhaps rock salon just off the extreme point of posilippo and where thanks to a friendliest hospitality he was to hang ecstatic through another sublime afternoon on the wave of a magical wand here as happened were charming wise original people even down to delightful amphibious american children enamelled by the sun of the bay as for figures of miniature tritons and nereids on a renaissance plaque and above all on the part of the general prospect a demonstration of the grand style of composition and effect that one was never to wish to see bettered the way in which the italian scene on such occasions as this seems to purify itself to the transcendent and perfect idea aloneidea of beauty of dignity of comprehensive grace with all accidents merged all defects disowned all experience outlived and to gather itself up into the mere mute eloquence of what has just incalculably been remains for ever the secret and the lesson of the subtlest daughter of history all one could do at the heart of the overarching crystal and in presence of the relegated city the fartrailing mount the grand sorrentine headland the islands incomparably stationed and related was to wonder what may well become of the so many other elements of any poor human and social complexus what might become of any successfully working or only struggling and floundering civilisation at all when high natural elegance proceeds to take such exclusive charge and recklessly assume as it were all the responsibilities   vii   this indeed had been quite the thing i was asking myself all the wondrous way down from rome and was to ask myself afresh on the return largely within sight of the sea as our earlier course had kept to the ineffably romantic inland valleys the great decorated blue vistas in which the breasts of the mountains shine vaguely with strange highlying city and castle and church and convent even as shoulders of no diviner line might be hung about with dim old jewels it was odd at the end of time long after those initiations of comparative youth that had then struck one as extending the very field itself of felt charm as exhausting the possibilities of fond surrender it was odd to have positively a new basis of enjoyment a new gate of triumphant passage thrust into ones consciousness and opening to ones use just as i confess i have to brace myself a little to call by such fine names our latest our ugliest and most monstrous aid to motion it is true of the monster as we have known him up to now that one can neither quite praise him nor quite blame him without a blushhe reflects so the nature of the company hes condemned to keep his splendid easy power addressed to noble aims makes him assuredly on occasion a purely beneficent creature i parenthesise at any rate that i know him in no other lightcounting out of course the acquaintance that consists of a dismayed arrest in the road with back flattened against wall or hedge for the dusty smoky stenchy shock of his passage to no end is his easy power more blest than to that of ministering to the ramifications as it were of curiosity or to that in other words of achieving for us among the kingdoms of the earth the grander and more genial the comprehensive and complete introduction much as was ever to be said for our old forms of pilgrimageand i am convinced that they are far from wholly supersededthey left they had to leave dreadful gaps in our yearning dreadful lapses in our knowledge dreadful failures in our energy there were always things off and beyond goals of delight and dreams of desire that dropped as a matter of course into the unattainable and over to which our wonder working agent now flings the firm straight bridge curiosity has lost under this amazing extension its salutary renouncements perhaps contemplation has become one with action and satisfaction one with desirespeaking always in the spirit of the inordinate lover of an enlightened use of our eyes that may represent for all i know an insolence of advantage on which there will be eventual heavy charges as yet obscure and incalculable to pay and i glance at the possibility only to avoid all thought of the lesson of the long run and to insist that i utter this dithyramb but in the immediate flush and fever of the short for such a beat of time as our fine courteous and contemplative advance upon naples and for such another as our retreat northward under the same fine law of observation and homage the bribed consciousness could only decline to question its security the sword of damocles suspended over that presumption the skeleton at the banquet of extravagant ease would have been that even at our actual inordinate rateleaving quite apart improvements to comesuch savings of trouble begin to use up the world some hard grain of difficulty being always a necessary part of the composition of pleasure the hard grain in our old comparatively pedestrian mixture before this business of our learning not so much even to fly which might indeed involve trouble as to be mechanically and prodigiously flown quite another matter was the element of uncertainty effort and patience the handful of silver nails which i admit drove many an impression home the seated motorist misses the silver nails i fully acknowledge save in so far as his aesthetic let alone his moral conscience may supply him with some artful subjective substitute in which case the thing becomes a precious secret of his own  however i wander wildby which i mean i look too far ahead my intention having been only to let my sense of the merciless june beauty of naples bay at the sunset hour and on the island terrace associate itself with the whole inexpressible taste of our two motordays feast of scenery that queer question of the exquisite grand manner as the most emphasised all of thingsof what it may seated so predominant in nature insidiously through the centuries let generations and populations in for hadnt in the least waited for the special emphasis i speak of to hang about me i must have found myself more or less consciously entertaining it by the waysince how couldnt it be of the very essence of the truth constantly and intensely before us that italy is really so much the most beautiful country in the world taking all things together that others must stand off and be hushed while she speaks seen thus in great comprehensive iridescent stretches it is the incomparable wrought fusion fusion of human history and mortal passion with the elements of earth and air of colour composition and form that constitutes her appeal and gives it the supreme heroic grace the chariot of fire favours fusion rather than promotes analysis and leaves much of that first june picture for me doubtless a great accepted blur of violet and silver the various hours and successive aspects the different strong passages of our reverse process on the other hand still figure for me even as some series of sublime landscapefrescoes if the great claude say had ever used that mediumin the immense gallery of a palace the homeward run by capua terracina gaeta and its storied headland fortress across the deep strong indescribable pontine marshes whitecattled strangely pastoral sleeping in the afternoon glow yet stirred by the near seabreath thick somehow to the imagination as some fullbodied sweetness of syrup is thick to the palate the atmosphere of that regionthick with the sense of history and the very taste of time as if the haunt and home which indeed it is of some great fair bovine aristocracy attended and guarded by halberdiers in the form of the mounted and longlanced herdsmen admirably congruous with the whole picture at every point and never more so than in their manner of gaily taking up as with bellvoices of golden bronze the offered wayside greeting  illustration terracina  there had been this morning among the impressions of our first hour an unforgettable specimen of that general typethe image of one of those human figures on which our perception of the romantic so often pounces in italy as on the genius of the scene personified with this advantage that as the scene there has at its best an unsurpassable distinction so the physiognomic representative standing for it all and with an animation a complexion an expression a fineness and fulness of humanity that appear to have gathered it in and to sum it up becomes beautiful by the same simple process very much that makes the heir to a great capitalist rich our early start our roundabout descent from posilippo by shining baire for avoidance of the city had been an hour of enchantment beyond any notation i can here recover all lustre and azure yet all composition and classicism the prospect developed and spread till after extraordinary upper reaches pf radiance and horizons of pearl we came at the turn of a descent upon a stalwart young gamekeeper or perhaps substantial young farmer who wellappointed and blooming had unslung his gun and resting on it beside a hedge just lived for us in the rare felicity of his whole look during that moment and while in recognition or almost as we felt in homage we instinctively checked our speed he pointed as it were the lesson giving the supreme right accent or final exquisite turn to the immense magnificent phrase which from those moments on and on and on resembled doubtless nothing so much as a page written by a consummate verbal economist and master of style in the noblest of all tongues our splendid human plant by the wayside had flowered thus into styleand there wasnt to be all day a lapse of eloquence a wasted word or a cadence missed  these things are personal memories however with the logic of certain insistences of that sort often difficult to seize why should i have kept so sacredly uneffaced for instance our small afternoon wait at teatime or as we made it coffeetime in the little brown piazzetta of velletri just short of the final push on through the flushed castelli romani and the drop and home stretch across the darkening campagna we had been dropped into the very lap of the ancient civic family after the inveterate fashion of ones sense of such stations in small italian towns there was a narrow raised terrace with steps in front of the best of the two or three local cafes and in the soft enclosed the warm waning light of june various benign contemplative worthies sat at disburdened tables and while they smoked long black weeds enjoyed us under those probable workings of subtlety with which we invest so many quite unimaginably blank i dare say italian simplicities the charm was as always in italy in the tone and the air and the happy hazard of things which made any positive pretension or claimed importance a comparatively trifling question we slid in the steep little place more or less down hill we wished stomachically we had rather addressed ourselves to a teabasket we suffered importunity from unchidden infants who swarmed about our chairs and romped about our feet we stayed no long time and went to see nothing yet we communicated to intensity we lay at our ease in the bosom of the past we practised intimacy in short an intimacy so much greater than the mere accidental and ostensible the difficulty for the right and grateful expression of which makes the old the familiar tax on the luxury of loving italy  19001909
