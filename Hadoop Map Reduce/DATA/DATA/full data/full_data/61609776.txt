61609776	the swoop  or  how clarence saved england  a tale of the great invasion      by p g wodehouse  1909      preface  it may be thought by some that in the pages which follow i have painted in too lurid colours the horrors of a foreign invasion of england realism in art it may be argued can be carried too far i prefer to think that the majority of my readers will acquit me of a desire to be unduly sensational it is necessary that england should be roused to a sense of her peril and only by setting down without flinching the probable results of an invasion can this be done this story i may mention has been written and published purely from a feeling of patriotism and duty mr alston rivers sensitive soul will be jarred to its foundations if it is a financial success so will mine but in a time of national danger we feel that the risk must be taken after all at the worst it is a small sacrifice to make for our country  p g wodehouse  the bombproof shelter london w      part one     chapter 1  an english boys home   august the first 19  clarence chugwater looked around him with a frown and gritted his teeth  englandmy england he moaned  clarence was a sturdy lad of some fourteen summers he was neatly but not gaudily dressed in a flatbrimmed hat a coloured handkerchief a flannel shirt a bunch of ribbons a haversack football shorts brown boots a whistle and a hockeystick he was in fact one of general badenpowells boy scouts  scan him closely do not dismiss him with a passing glance for you are looking at the boy of destiny at clarence macandrew chugwater who saved england  today those features are familiar to all everyone has seen the chugwater column in aldwych the equestrian statue in chugwater road formerly piccadilly and the picturepostcards in the stationers windows that bulging forehead distended with useful information that massive chin those eyes gleaming behind their spectacles that tout ensemble that je ne sais quoi  in a word clarence  he could do everything that the boy scout must learn to do he could low like a bull he could gurgle like a woodpigeon he could imitate the cry of the turnip in order to deceive rabbits he could smile and whistle simultaneously in accordance with rule 8 and only those who have tried this know how difficult it is he could spoor fell trees tell the character from the bootsole and fling the squaler he did all these things well but what he was really best at was flinging the squaler                                       clarence on this sultry august afternoon was tensely occupied tracking the family cat across the diningroom carpet by its footprints glancing up for a moment he caught sight of the other members of the family  england my england he moaned  it was indeed a sight to extract tears of blood from any boy scout the table had been moved back against the wall and in the cleared space mr chugwater whose duty it was to have set an example to his children was playing diabolo beside him engrossed in cupandball was his wife reggie chugwater the eldest son the heir the hope of the house was reading the cricket news in an early edition of the evening paper horace his brother was playing popintaw with his sister grace and graces fiance ralph peabody alice the other miss chugwater was mending a badminton racquet  not a single member of that family was practising with the rifle or drilling or learning to make bandages  clarence groaned  if you cant play without snorting like that my boy said mr chugwater a little irritably you must find some other game you made me jump just as i was going to beat my record  talking of records said reggie frys on his way to his eighth successive century if he goes on like this lancashire will win the championship  i thought he was playing for somerset said horace  that was a fortnight ago you ought to keep up to date in an important subject like cricket  once more clarence snorted bitterly  im sure you ought not to be down on the floor clarence said mr chugwater anxiously it is so draughty and you have evidently got a nasty cold must you lie on the floor  i am spooring said clarence with simple dignity  but im sure you can spoor better sitting on a chair with a nice book  i think the kids sickening for something put in horace critically hes deuced roopy whats up clarry  i was thinking said clarence of my countryof england  whats the matter with england  shes all right murmured ralph peabody  my fallen country sighed clarence a not unmanly tear bedewing the glasses of his spectacles my fallen stricken country  that kid said reggie laying down his paper is talking right through his hat my dear old son are you aware that england has never been so strong all round as she is now do you ever read the papers dont you know that weve got the ashes and the golf championship and the wibbleywob championship and the spiropole spillikins pufffeather and animal grab championships has it come to your notice that our croquet pair beat america last thursday by eight hoops did you happen to hear that we won the hopskipandjump at the last olympic games youve been out in the woods old sport  clarences heart was too full for words he rose in silence and quitted the room  got the pip or something said reggie rum kid i say hirsts bowling well five for twentythree so far  clarence wandered moodily out of the house the chugwaters lived in a desirable villa residence which mr chugwater had built in essex it was a typical englishmans home its name was nasturtium villa  as clarence walked down the road the excited voice of a newspaperboy came to him presently the boy turned the corner shouting kerlapse of surrey sensational bowling at the oval  he stopped on seeing clarence  paper general  clarence shook his head then he uttered a startled exclamation for his eye had fallen on the poster  it ran as follows      surrey     doing     badly     german army lands in england     chapter 2  the invaders   clarence flung the boy a halfpenny tore a paper from his grasp and scanned it eagerly there was nothing to interest him in the body of the journal but he found what he was looking for in the stoppress space stop press news said the paper fry not out 104 surrey 147 for 8 a german army landed in essex this afternoon loamshire handicap spring chicken 1 salome 2 yipiaddy 3 seven ran  essex then at any moment the foe might be at their doors more inside their doors with a passionate cry clarence tore back to the house  he entered the diningroom with the speed of a highlytrained marathon winner just in time once more to prevent mr chugwater lowering his record  the germans shouted clarence we are invaded  this time mr chugwater was really annoyed  if i have told you once about your detestable habit of shouting in the house clarence i have told you a hundred times if you cannot be a boy scout quietly you must stop being one altogether i had got up to six that time  but father  silence you will go to bed this minute and i shall consider the question whether you are to have any supper it will depend largely on your behaviour between now and then go  but father  clarence dropped the paper shaken with emotion mr chugwaters sternness deepened visibly  clarence must i speak again  he stooped and removed his right slipper  clarence withdrew  reggie picked up the paper  that kid he announced judicially is off his nut hullo i told you so fry not out 104 good old charles  i say exclaimed horace who sat nearest the window there are two rummylooking chaps coming to the front door wearing a sort of fancy dress  it must be the germans said reggie the paper says they landed here this afternoon i expect  a thunderous knock rang through the house the family looked at one another voices were heard in the hall and next moment the door opened and the servant announced mr prinsotto and mr aydycong  or rather said the first of the two newcomers a tall bearded soldierly man in perfect english prince otto of saxepfennig and captain the graf von poppenheim his aidedecamp  just sojust so said mr chugwater affably sit down wont you  the visitors seated themselves there was an awkward silence  warm day said mr chugwater  very said the prince a little constrainedly  perhaps a cup of tea have you come far  wellerpretty far that is to say a certain distance in fact from germany  i spent my summer holiday last year at dresden capital place  just so the fact is mrer  chugwater by the waymy wife mrs chugwater  the prince bowed so did his aidedecamp  the fact is mr jugwater resumed the prince we are not here on a holiday  quite so quite so business before pleasure  the prince pulled at his moustache so did his aidedecamp who seemed to be a man of but little initiative and conversational resource  we are invaders  not at all not at all protested mr chugwater  i must warn you that you will resist at your peril you wear no uniform  wouldnt dream of such a thing except at the lodge of course  you will be sorely tempted no doubt do not think that i do not appreciate your feelings this is an englishmans home  mr chugwater tapped him confidentially on the knee  and an uncommonly snug little place too he said now if you will forgive me for talking business you i gather propose making some stay in this country  the prince laughed shortly so did his aidedecamp exactly continued mr chugwater exactly then you will want some piedaterre if you follow me i shall be delighted to let you this house on remarkably easy terms for as long as you please just come along into my study for a moment we can talk it over quietly there you see dealing direct with me you would escape the middlemans charges and  gently but firmly he edged the prince out of the room and down the passage  the aidedecamp continued to sit staring woodenly at the carpet reggie closed quietly in on him  excuse me he said talking shop and all that but im an agent for the come one come all accident and life assurance office you have heard of it probably we can offer you really exceptional terms you must not miss a chance of this sort now heres a prospectus  horace sidled forward  i dont know if you happen to be a cyclist captainergraf but if youd like a practically new motorbike only been used since last november i can let you  there was a swish of skirts as grace and alice advanced on the visitor  im sure said grace winningly that youre fond of the theatre captain poppenheim we are getting up a performance of ici on parle francais in aid of the fund for supplying square meals to oldage pensioners such a deserving object you know now how many tickets will you take  you can sell them to your friends you know added mrs chugwater  the aidedecamp gulped convulsively                                       ten minutes later two penniless men groped their way dazed to the garden gate  at last said prince otto brokenly for it was he at last i begin to realise the horrors of an invasionfor the invaders  and together the two men staggered on     chapter 3  englands peril   when the papers arrived next morning it was seen that the situation was even worse than had at first been suspected not only had the germans effected a landing in essex but in addition no fewer than eight other hostile armies had by some remarkable coincidence hit on that identical moment for launching their longprepared blow  england was not merely beneath the heel of the invader it was beneath the heels of nine invaders  there was barely standingroom  full details were given in the press it seemed that while germany was landing in essex a strong force of russians under the grand duke vodkakoff had occupied yarmouth simultaneously the mad mullah had captured portsmouth while the swiss navy had bombarded lyme regis and landed troops immediately to westward of the bathingmachines at precisely the same moment china at last awakened had swooped down upon that picturesque little welsh wateringplace lllgxtplll and despite desperate resistance on the part of an excursion of evanses and joneses from cardiff had obtained a secure foothold while these things were happening in wales the army of monaco had descended on auchtermuchty on the firth of clyde within two minutes of this disaster by greenwich time a boisterous band of young turks had seized scarborough and at brighton and margate respectively small but determined armies the one of moroccan brigands under raisuli the other of darkskinned warriors from the distant isle of bollygolla had made good their footing  this was a very serious state of things  correspondents of the daily mail at the various points of attack had wired such particulars as they were able the preliminary parley at lllgxtplll between prince ping pong pang the chinese general and llewellyn evans the leader of the cardiff excursionists seems to have been impressive to a degree the former had spoken throughout in pure chinese the latter replying in rich welsh and the general effect wired the correspondent was almost painfully exhilarating  so sudden had been the attacks that in very few instances was there any real resistance the nearest approach to it appears to have been seen at margate  at the time of the arrival of the black warriors which like the other onslaughts took place between one and two oclock on the afternoon of august bank holiday the sands were covered with happy revellers when the war canoes approached the beach the excursionists seem to have mistaken their occupants at first for a troupe of nigger minstrels on an unusually magnificent scale and it was freely noised abroad in the crowd that they were being presented by charles frohmann who was endeavouring to revive the ancient glories of the christy minstrels too soon however it was perceived that these were no harmless moore and burgesses suspicion was aroused by the absence of banjoes and tambourines and when the foremost of the negroes dexterously scalped a small boy suspicion became certainty  in this crisis the trippers of margate behaved well the mounted infantry on donkeys headed by uncle bones did much execution the ladies tormentor brigade harassed the enemys flank and a hastilyformed band of sharpshooters armed with threeshiesapenny balls and milky cocos undoubtedly troubled the advance guard considerably but superior force told after half an hours fighting the excursionists fled leaving the beach to the foe  at auchtermuchty and portsmouth no obstacle apparently was offered to the invaders at brighton the enemy were permitted to land unharmed scarborough taken utterly aback by the boyish vigour of the young turks was an easy prey and at yarmouth though the grand duke received a nasty slap in the face from a dexterouslythrown bloater the resistance appears to have been equally futile  by teatime on august the first nine stronglyequipped forces were firmly established on british soil     chapter 4  what england thought of it   such a state of affairs disturbing enough in itself was rendered still more disquieting by the fact that except for the boy scouts englands military strength at this time was practically nil  the abolition of the regular army had been the first step several causes had contributed to this in the first place the socialists had condemned the army system as unsocial privates they pointed out were forbidden to hobnob with colonels though the difference in their positions was due to a mere accident of birth they demanded that every man in the army should be a general comrade quelch in an eloquent speech at newington butts had pointed amidst enthusiasm to the republics of south america where the system worked admirably  scotland too disapproved of the army because it was professional mr smith wrote several trenchant letters to mr c j b marriott on the subject  so the army was abolished and the land defence of the country entrusted entirely to the territorials the legion of frontiersmen and the boy scouts  but first the territorials dropped out the strain of being referred to on the musichall stage as teddyboys was too much for them  then the frontiersmen were disbanded they had promised well at the start but they had never been themselves since la milo had been attacked by the manchester watch committee it had taken all the heart out of them  so that in the end englands defenders were narrowed down to the boy scouts of whom clarence chugwater was the pride and a large civilian population prepared at any moment to turn out for their countrys sake and wave flags a certain section of these too could sing patriotic songs                                       it was inevitable in the height of the silly season that such a topic as the simultaneous invasion of great britain by nine foreign powers should be seized upon by the press countless letters poured into the offices of the london daily papers every morning space forbids more than the gist of a few of these  miss charlesworth wrotein this crisis i see no alternative i shall disappear  mr horatio bottomley in john bull said that there was some very dirty and underhand work going on and that the secret history of the invasion would be published shortly he himself however preferred any invader even the king of bollygolla to some kcs he could name though he was fond of dear old muir he wanted to know why inspector drew had retired  the daily express in a thoughtful leader said that free trade evidently meant invaders for all  mr herbert gladstone writing to the times pointed out that he had let so many undesirable aliens into the country that he did not see that a few more made much difference  mr george r sims made eighteen puns on the names of the invading generals in the course of one number of mustard and cress  mr h g pelissier urged the public to look on the bright side there was a sun still shining in the sky besides who knew that some foreign marksman might not pot the censor  mr robert fitzsimmons offered to take on any of the invading generals or all of them and if he didnt beat them it would only be because the referee had a wife and seven small children and had asked him as a personal favour to let himself be knocked out he had lost several fights that way  the directors of the crystal palace wrote a circular letter to the shareholders pointing out that there was a good time coming with this addition to the public the palace stood a sporting chance of once more finding itself full  judge willis asked what is an invasion  signor scotti cabled anxiously from america prepaid stands scotland where it did  mr lewis waller wrote heroically how many of them are there i am usually good for about half a dozen are they assassins i can tackle any number of assassins  mr seymour hicks said he hoped they would not hurt george edwardes  mr george edwardes said that if they injured seymour hicks in any way he would never smile again  a writer in answers pointed out that if all the invaders in the country were piled in a heap they would reach some of the way to the moon  farseeing men took a gloomy view of the situation they laid stress on the fact that this counterattraction was bound to hit firstclass cricket hard for some years gates had shown a tendency to fall off owing to the growing popularity of golf tennis and other games the desire to see the invaders as they marched through the country must draw away thousands who otherwise would have paid their sixpences at the turnstiles it was suggested that representations should be made to the invading generals with a view to inducing them to make a small charge to sightseers  in sporting circles the chief interest centered on the race to london the papers showed the positions of the various armies each morning in their runners and betting columns six to four on the germans was freely offered but found no takers  considerable interest was displayed in the probable behaviour of the nine armies when they met the situation was a curious outcome of the modern custom of striking a deadly blow before actually declaring war until the moment when the enemy were at her doors england had imagined that she was on terms of the most satisfactory friendship with her neighbours the foe had taken full advantage of this and also of the fact that owing to a fit of absentmindedness on the part of the government england had no ships afloat which were not entirely obsolete interviewed on the subject by representatives of the daily papers the government handsomely admitted that it was perhaps in some ways a silly thing to have done but they urged you could not think of everything besides they were on the point of laying down a dreadnought which would be ready in a very few years meanwhile the best thing the public could do was to sleep quietly in their beds it was fishers tip and fisher was a smart man  and all the while the invaders marathon continued  who would be the first to reach london     chapter 5  the germans reach london   the germans had got off smartly from the mark and were fully justifying the long odds laid upon them that masterstrategist prince otto of saxepfennig realising that if he wished to reach the metropolis quickly he must not go by train had resolved almost at once to walk though hampered considerably by crowds of rustics who gathered gaping at every point in the line of march he had made good progress the german troops had strict orders to reply to no questions with the result that little time was lost in idle chatter and in a couple of days it was seen that the army of the fatherland was bound barring accidents to win comfortably  the progress of the other forces was slower the chinese especially had undergone great privations having lost their way near llanfairpwlgwnngogogoch and having been unable to understand the voluble directions given to them by the various shepherds they encountered it was not for nearly a week that they contrived to reach chester where catching a cheap excursion they arrived in the metropolis hungry and footsore four days after the last of their rivals had taken up their station  the german advance halted on the wooded heights of tottenham here a camp was pitched and trenches dug  the march had shown how terrible invasion must of necessity be with no wish to be ruthless the troops of prince otto had done grievous damage cricketpitches had been trampled down and in many cases even golfgreens dented by the iron heel of the invader who rarely if ever replaced the divot everywhere they had left ruin and misery in their train  with the other armies it was the same story through carefullypreserved woods they had marched frightening the birds and driving keepers into fits of nervous prostration fishing owing to their tramping carelessly through the streams was at a standstill croquet had been given up in despair  near epping the russians shot a fox                                       the situation which faced prince otto was a delicate one all his early training and education had implanted in him the fixed idea that if he ever invaded england he would do it either alone or with the sympathetic cooperation of allies he had never faced the problem of what he should do if there were rivals in the field competition is wholesome but only within bounds he could not very well ask the other nations to withdraw nor did he feel inclined to withdraw himself  it all comes of this dashed swoop of the vulture business he grumbled as he paced before his tent ever and anon pausing to sweep the city below him with his glasses i should like to find the fellow who started the idea making me look a fool still its just as bad for the others thank goodness well poppenheim  captain von poppenheim approached and saluted  please sir the men say may they bombard london  bombard london  yes sir its always done  prince otto pulled thoughtfully at his moustache  bombard london it seemsand yetah well they have few pleasures  he stood awhile in meditation so did captain von poppenheim he kicked a pebble so did captain von poppenheimonly a smaller pebble discipline is very strict in the german army  poppenheim  sir  any signs of ourercompetitors  yes sir the russians are coming up on the left flank sir theyll be here in a few hours raisuli has been arrested at purley for stealing chickens the army of bollygolla is about ten miles out no news of the field yet sir  the prince brooded then he spoke unbosoming himself more freely than was his wont in conversation with his staff  between you and me pop he cried impulsively im dashed sorry we ever started this dashed silly invading business we thought ourselves dashed smart working in the dark and giving no sign till the great pounce and all that sort of dashed nonsense seems to me weve simply dashed well landed ourselves in the dashed soup  captain von poppenheim saluted in sympathetic silence he and the prince had been old chums at college a lifelong friendship existed between them he would have liked to have expressed adhesion verbally to his superior officers remarks the words i dont think trembled on his tongue but the iron discipline of the german army gagged him he saluted again and clicked his heels  the prince recovered himself with a strong effort  you say the russians will be here shortly he said  in a few hours sir  and the men really wish to bombard london  it would be a treat to them sir  well well i suppose if we dont do it somebody else will and we got here first  yes sir  then  an orderly hurried up and saluted  telegram sir  absently the prince opened it then his eyes lit up  gotterdammerung he said i never thought of that smash up london and provide work for unemployed mending itgrayson he read poppenheim  sir  let the bombardment commence  yes sir  and let it continue till the russians arrive then it must stop or there will be complications  captain von poppenheim saluted and withdrew     chapter 6  the bombardment of london   thus was london bombarded fortunately it was august and there was nobody in town  otherwise there might have been loss of life     chapter 7  a conference of the powers   the russians led by general vodkakoff arrived at hampstead half an hour after the bombardment had ceased and the rest of the invaders including raisuli who had got off on an alibi dropped in at intervals during the week by the evening of saturday the sixth of august even the chinese had limped to the metropolis and the question now was what was going to happen england displayed a polite indifference to the problem we are essentially a nation of sightseers to us the excitement of staring at the invaders was enough into the complex international problems to which the situation gave rise it did not occur to us to examine when you consider that a crowd of five hundred londoners will assemble in the space of two minutes abandoning entirely all its other business to watch a cabhorse that has fallen in the street it is not surprising that the spectacle of nine separate and distinct armies in the metropolis left no room in the british mind for other reflections  the attraction was beginning to draw people back to london now they found that the german shells had had one excellent result they had demolished nearly all the london statues and what might have conceivably seemed a drawback the fact that they had blown great holes in the woodpaving passed unnoticed amidst the more extensive operations of the london county council  taking it for all in all the german gunners had simply been beautifying london the albert hall struck by a merciful shell had come down with a run and was now a heap of picturesque ruins whitefields tabernacle was a charred mass and the burning of the royal academy proved a great comfort to all at a mass meeting in trafalgar square a hearty vote of thanks was passed with acclamation to prince otto  but if londoners rejoiced the invaders were very far from doing so the complicated state of foreign politics made it imperative that there should be no friction between the powers yet here a great number of them were in perhaps as embarrassing a position as ever diplomatists were called upon to unravel when nine dogs are assembled round one bone it is rarely on the bone alone that teethmarks are found at the close of the proceedings  prince otto of saxepfennig set himself resolutely to grapple with the problem his chance of grappling successfully with it was not improved by the stream of telegrams which arrived daily from his imperial master demanding to know whether he had yet subjugated the country and if not why not he had replied guardedly stating the difficulties which lay in his way and had received the following at once mailed fist display on get or out getwilhelm  it was then that the distracted prince saw that steps must be taken at once  carefullyworded letters were despatched by district messenger boys to the other generals towards nightfall the replies began to come in and having read them the prince saw that this business could never be settled without a personal interview many of the replies were absolutely incoherent  raisuli apologising for delay on the ground that he had been away in the isle of dogs cracking a crib wrote suggesting that the germans and moroccans should combine with a view to playing the confidence trick on the swiss general who seemed a simple sort of chap reminds me of dear old maclean wrote raisuli there is money in this will you come in wire in the morning  the general of the monaco forces thought the best way would be to settle the thing by means of a game of chance of the oddmanout class he knew a splendid game called slippery sam he could teach them the rules in half a minute  the reply of prince ping pong pang of china was probably brilliant and scholarly but it was expressed in chinese characters of the ming period which prince otto did not understand and even if he had it would have done him no good for he tried to read it from the top downwards instead of from the bottom up  the young turks as might have been expected wrote in their customary flippant cheeky style they were full of mischief as usual the body of the letter scrawled in a round schoolboy hand dealt principally with the details of the boobytrap which the general had successfully laid for his head of staff he was frightfully shirty concluded the note jubilantly  from the bollygolla camp the messengerboy returned without a scalp and with a verbal message to the effect that the king could neither read nor write  grand duke vodkakoff from the russian lines replied in his smooth cynical russian wayyou appear anxious my dear prince to scratch the other entrants may i beg you to remember what happens when you scratch a russian  as for the mad mullahs reply it was simply pure delirium the journey from somaliland and his meeting with his friend mr dillon appeared to have had the worse effects on his sanity he opened with the statement that he was a teapot and that was the only really coherent remark he made  prince otto placed a hand wearily on his throbbing brow  we must have a conference he said it is the only way  next day eight invitations to dinner went out from the german camp                                       it would be idle to say that the dinner as a dinner was a complete success halfway through the swiss general missed his diamond solitaire and cold glances were cast at raisuli who sat on his immediate left then the king of bollygollas tablemanners were frankly inelegant when he wanted a thing he grabbed for it and he seemed to want nearly everything nor was the behaviour of the leader of the young turks all that could be desired there had been some talk of only allowing him to come down to dessert but he had squashed in as he briefly put it and it would be paltering with the truth to say that he had not had far more champagne than was good for him also the general of monaco had brought a pack of cards with him and was spoiling the harmony by trying to induce prince ping pong pang to find the lady and the brainless laugh of the mad mullah was very trying  altogether prince otto was glad when the cloth was removed and the waiters left the company to smoke and talk business  anyone who has had anything to do with the higher diplomacy is aware that diplomatic language stands in a class by itself it is a language specially designed to deceive the chance listener  thus when prince otto turning to grand duke vodkakoff said quietly i hear the crops are coming on nicely down kent way the habitual frequenter of diplomatic circles would have understood as did the grand duke that what he really meant was now about this business what do you propose to do  the company with the exception of the representative of the young turks who was drinking creme de menthe out of a tumbler the mullah and the king of bollygolla bent forward deeply interested to catch the russians reply much would depend on this  vodkakoff carelessly flicked the ash off his cigarette  so i hear he said slowly but in shropshire they tell me they are having trouble with the mangelwurzels  the prince frowned at this typical piece of shifty russian diplomacy  how is your highness getting on with your highnesss rollerskating he enquired guardedly  the russian smiled a subtle smile  poorly he said poorly the last time i tried the outside edge i thought somebody had thrown the building at me  prince otto flushed he was a plain blunt man and he hated this beating about the bush  why does a chicken cross the road he demanded almost angrily  the russian raised his eyebrows and smiled but made no reply the prince resolved to give him no chance of wriggling away from the point pressed him hotly  think of a number he cried double it add ten take away the number you first thought of divide it by three and what is the result  there was an awed silence surely the russian expert at evasion as he was could not parry so direct a challenge as this  he threw away his cigarette and lit a cigar  i understand he said with a tinkle of defiance in his voice that the suffragettes as a last resource propose to capture mr asquith and sing the suffragette anthem to him  a startled gasp ran round the table  because the higher he flies the fewer asked prince otto with sinister calm  because the higher he flies the fewer said the russian smoothly but with the smoothness of a treacherous sea  there was another gasp the situation was becoming alarmingly tense  you are plainspoken your highness said prince otto slowly  at this moment the tension was relieved by the young turk falling off his chair with a crash on to the floor everyone jumped up startled raisuli took advantage of the confusion to pocket a silver ashtray  the interruption had a good effect frowns relaxed the wranglers began to see that they had allowed their feelings to run away with them it was with a conciliatory smile that prince otto filling the grand dukes glass observed  trumper is perhaps the prettier bat but i confess i admire frys robust driving  the russian was won over he extended his hand  two down and three to play and the red near the top corner pocket he said with that halforiental charm which he knew so well how to exhibit on occasion  the two shook hands warmly  and so it was settled the russian having as we have seen waived his claim to bombard london in his turn there was no obstacle to a peaceful settlement it was obvious that the superior forces of the germans and russians gave them if they did but combine the key to the situation the decision they arrived at was as set forth above as follows after the fashion of the moment the russian and german generals decided to draw the colour line that meant that the troops of china somaliland bollygolla as well as raisuli and the young turks were ruled out they would be given a week in which to leave the country resistance would be useless the combined forces of the germans russians swiss and monacoans were overwhelming especially as the chinese had not recovered from their wanderings in wales and were far too footsore still to think of serious fighting  when they had left the remaining four powers would continue the invasion jointly                                           prince otto of saxepfennig went to bed that night comfortably conscious of a good work well done he saw his way now clear before him  but he had made one miscalculation he had not reckoned with clarence chugwater      part two     chapter 1  in the boy scouts camp   night  night in aldwych  in the centre of that vast tract of unreclaimed prairie known to londoners as the aldwych site there shone feebly seeming almost to emphasise the darkness and desolation of the scene a single light  it was the campfire of the boy scouts  the night was raw and windy a fine rain had been falling for some hours the date of september the first for just a month england had been in the grip of the invaders the coloured section of the hostile force had either reached its home by now or was well on its way the public had seen it go with a certain regret not since the visit of the shah had such an attractive topic of conversation been afforded them several comic journalists had built up a reputation and a large price per thousand words on the king of bollygolla alone theatres had benefited by the index of a large new unsophisticated public a piece at the waldorf theatre had run for a whole fortnight and the merry widow had taken on a new lease of life selfridges abandoning its policy of caution had advertised to the extent of a quarter of a column in two weekly papers  now the young turks were back at school in constantinople shuffling their feet and throwing ink pellets at one another raisuli home again in the old mountains was working up the kidnapping business which had fallen off sadly in his absence under the charge of an incompetent locum tenens and the chinese the bollygollans and the troops of the mad mullah were enduring the miseries of seasickness out in midocean  the swiss army had also gone home in order to be in time for the winter hotel season there only remained the germans the russians and the troops of monaco                                           in the camp of the boy scouts a vast activity prevailed  few of londons millions realise how tremendous and farreaching an association the boy scouts are it will be news to the man in the street to learn that with the possible exception of the black hand the scouts are perhaps the most carefullyorganised secret society in the world  their ramifications extend through the length and breadth of england the boys you see parading the streets with hockeysticks are but a small section the aristocrats of the society every boy in england and many a man is in the pay of the association their funds are practically unlimited by the oath of initiation which he takes on joining every boy is compelled to pay into the common coffers a percentage of his pocketmoney or his salary when you drop his weekly three and sixpence into the hand of your officeboy on saturday possibly you fancy he takes it home to mother he doesnt he spend twoandsix on woodbines the other shilling goes into the treasury of the boy scouts when you visit your nephew at eton and tip him five pounds or whatever it is does he spend it at the sockshop apparently yes in reality a quarter reaches the common fund  take another case to show the boy scouts power you are a city merchant and arriving at the office one morning in a bad temper you proceed to cure yourself by taking it out of the officeboy he says nothing apparently does nothing but that evening as you are going home in the tube a burly workingman treads heavily on your gouty foot in ladbroke grove a passing hansom splashes you with mud reaching home you find that the cat has been at the cold chicken and the butler has given notice you do not connect these things but they are all alike the results of your unjust behaviour to your officeboy in the morning or meeting a ragged little matchseller you pat his head and give him sixpence next day an anonymous present of champagne arrives at your address  terrible in their wrath the boy scouts never forget kindness                                       the whistle of a striped iguanodon sounded softly in the darkness the sentry who was pacing to and fro before the campfire halted and peered into the night as he peered he uttered the plaintive note of a zebra calling to its mate  a voice from the darkness said een gonyamagonyama  invooboo replied the sentry argumentatively yah bo yah bo invooboo  an indistinct figure moved forward  who goes there  a friend  advance friend and give the countersign  remember mafeking and death to injuns  pass friend alls well  the figure walked on into the firelight the sentry started then saluted and stood to attention on his face was a worshipping look of admiration and awe such as some young soldier of the grande armee might have worn on seeing napoleon for the newcomer was clarence chugwater  your name said clarence eyeing the sturdy young warrior  private william buggins sir  you watch well private buggins england has need of such as you  he pinched the young scouts ear tolerantly the sentry flushed with pleasure  my orders have been carried out said clarence  yes sir the patrols are all here  enumerate them  the chinchilla kittens the bongos the zebras the iguanodons the welsh rabbits the snapping turtles and a halfpatrol of the 33rd london gazekas sir  clarence nodded  tis well he said what are they doing  some of them are acting a scouts play sir some are doing cone exercises one or two are practising deep breathing and the rest are dancing an old english morris dance  clarence nodded  they could not be better employed inform them that i have arrived and would address them  the sentry saluted  standing in an attitude of deep thought with his feet apart his hands clasped behind him and his chin sunk upon his breast clarence made a singularly impressive picture he had left his essex home three weeks before on the expiration of his ten days holiday to return to his post of junior subreporter on the staff of a leading london evening paper it was really only at night now that he got any time to himself during the day his time was his papers and he was compelled to spend the weary hours reading off results of races and other sporting items on the tapemachine it was only at 6 pm that he could begin to devote himself to the service of his country  the scouts had assembled now and were standing keen and alert ready to do clarences bidding  clarence returned their salute moodily  scoutmaster wagstaff he said  the scoutmaster the leader of the troop formed by the various patrols stepped forward  let the wardance commence  clarence watched the evolutions absently his heart was illattuned to dances but the thing had to be done so it was as well to get it over when the last movement had been completed he raised his hand  men he said in his clear penetrating alto although you have not the same facilities as myself for hearing the latest news you are all by this time doubtless aware that this england of ours lies neath the proud foot of a conqueror it is for us to save her cheers and a voice invooboo i would call on you here and now to seize your hockeysticks and rush upon the invader were it not alas that such an action would merely result in your destruction at present the invader is too strong we must wait and something tells me that we shall not have to wait long applause jealousy is beginning to spring up between the russians and the germans it will be our task to aggravate this feeling with our perfect organisation this should be easy sooner or later this smouldering jealousy is going to burst into flame any day now he proceeded warming as he spoke there may be the dickens of a dustup between these johnnies and then weve got em where the hairs short see what i mean you chaps its like this any moment they may start scrapping and chaw each other up and then well simply sail in and knock whats left endways  a shout of applause went up from the assembled scouts  what i am anxious to impress upon you men concluded clarence in more measured tones is that our hour approaches england looks to us and it is for us to see that she does not look in vain sedulously feeding the growing flame of animosity between the component parts of the invading horde we may contrive to bring about that actual disruption till that day see to it that you prepare yourselves for war men i have finished  what the chief scout means said scoutmaster wagstaff is no rotting about and all that sort of rot jolly well keep yourselves fit and then when the time comes well give these russian and german blighters about the biggest hiding theyve ever heard of follow the idea very well then mind you dont go mucking the show up  een gonyamagonyama shouted the new thoroughly roused troops invooboo yah bo yah bo invooboo  the voice of young englandof young england alert and at its post     chapter 2  an important engagement   historians when they come to deal with the opening years of the twentieth century will probably call this the musichall age at the time of the great invasion the musichalls dominated england every town and every suburb had its hall most of them more than one the public appetite for sightseeing had to be satisfied somehow and the musichall provided the easiest way of doing it the halls formed a common place on which the celebrity and the ordinary man could meet if an impulsive gentleman slew his grandmother with a coalhammer only a small portion of the public could gaze upon his pleasing features at the old bailey to enable the rest to enjoy the intellectual treat it was necessary to engage him at enormous expense to appear at a musichall there if he happened to be acquitted he would come on the stage preceded by an asthmatic introducer and beam affably at the public for ten minutes speaking at intervals in a totally inaudible voice and then retire to be followed by some enterprising lady who had endeavoured unsuccessfully to solve the problem of living at the rate of ten thousand a year on an income of nothing or who had performed some other similarly brainy feat  it was not till the middle of september that anyone conceived what one would have thought the obvious idea of offering musichall engagements to the invading generals  the first man to think of it was solly quhayne the rising young agent solly was the son of abraham cohen an eminent agent of the victorian era his brothers abe kern benjamin colquhoun jack coyne and barney cowan had gravitated to the city but solly had carried on the old business and was making a big name for himself it was solly who had met blinky bill mullins the prominent sandbagger as he emerged from his twenty years retirement at dartmoor and booked him solid for a thirtysix months lecturing tour on the mcginnis circuit it was to him too that joe brown who could eat eight pounds of raw meat in seven and a quarter minutes owed his first chance of displaying his gifts to the wider public of the vaudeville stage  the idea of securing the services of the invading generals came to him in a flash  selp me he cried i believe theyd go big put em on where you like  solly was a man of action within a minute he was talking to the managing director of the mammoth syndicate halls on the telephone in five minutes the managing director had agreed to pay prince otto of saxepfennig five hundred pounds a week if he could be prevailed upon to appear in ten minutes the grand duke vodkakoff had been engaged subject to his approval at a weekly four hundred and fifty by the stonerafferty circuit and in a quarter of an hour solly quhayne having pushed his way through a mixed crowd of tricky serios and versatile comedians and patterers who had been waiting to see him for the last hour and a half was bowling off in a taximetercab to the russian lines at hampstead  general vodkakoff received his visitor civilly but at first without enthusiasm there were it seemed objections to his becoming an artiste would he have to wear a properly bald head and sing songs about wanting people to see his girl he didnt think he could he had only sung once in his life and that was twenty years ago at a bumpsupper at moscow university and even then he confided to mr quhayne it had taken a decanter and ahalf of neat vodka to bring him up to the scratch  the agent ridiculed the idea  why your grand grace he cried there wont be anything of that sort you aint going to be starred as a comic youre a refined lecturer and society monologue artist how i invaded england with lights down and the cinematograph going we can easily fake the pictures  the grand duke made another objection  i understand he said it is etiquette for musichall artists in their spare time to eaterfried fish with their fingers must i do that i doubt if i could manage it  mr quhayne once more became the human semaphore  selp me of course you neednt all the leading pros eat it with a spoon bless you you can be the refined gentleman on the halls same as anywhere else come now your grand grace is it a deal four hundred and fifty chinking ogoblins a week for one hall a night and pressagented at eight hundred and seventyfive selp me lauder doesnt get it not in england  the grand duke reflected the invasion has proved more expensive than he had foreseen the english are proverbially a nation of shopkeepers and they had put up their prices in all the shops for his special benefit and he was expected to do such a lot of tipping four hundred and fifty a week would come in uncommonly useful  where do i sign he asked extending his hand for the agreement                                           five minutes later mr quhayne was urging his taxidriver to exceed the speedlimit in the direction of tottenham     chapter 3  a birdseye view of the situation   clarence read the news of the two engagements on the tape at the office of his paper but the first intimation the general public had of it was through the medium of headlines      musichall sensation     invading generals gigantic salaries     rumoured resentment of vaf     what will waterrats do     interview with mr harry lauder  clarence chuckled grimly as the tape clicked out the news the end had begun to sow jealousy between the rival generals would have been easy to sow it between two rival musichall artistes would be among the worlds softest jobs  among the general public of course the announcement created a profound sensation nothing else was talked about in train and omnibus the papers had leaders on the subject at first the popular impression was that the generals were going to do a comedy duo act of the whowasitiseenyoucomingdownthestreetwith type and there was disappointment when it was found that the engagements were for different halls rumours sprang up it was said that the grand duke had for years been an enthusiastic amateur swordswallower and had indeed come to england mainly for the purpose of getting bookings that the prince had a secure reputation in potsdam as a singer of songs in the george robey style that both were expert trickcyclists  then the truth came out neither had any specialities they would simply appear and deliver lectures  the feeling in the musichall world was strong the variety artists federation debated the advisability of another strike the water rats meeting in mystic secrecy in a maiden lane publichouse passed fifteen resolutions in an hour and a quarter sir harry lauder interviewed by the era gave it as his opinion that both the grand duke and the prince were gowks who would do well to haud their blether he himself proposed to go straight to america where genuine artists were cheered in the streets and entertained at haggis dinners and not forced to compete with amateur sumphs and gonuphs from other countries  clarence brooding over the situation like a providence was glad to see that already the new move had weakened the invaders power the day after the announcement in the press of the approaching debut of the other generals the leader of the army of monaco had hurried to the agents to secure an engagement for himself he held out the special inducement of cardtricks at which he was highly skilled the agents had received him coldly brown and day had asked him to call again foster had sent out a message regretting that he was too busy to see him at de freeces he had been kept waiting in the anteroom for two hours in the midst of a bevy of sparkling comediennes of pronounced peroxidity and bluechinned men in dusty bowlerhats who told each other how they had gone with a bang at oakham and john ogroats and had then gone away in despair  on the following day deeply offended he had withdrawn his troops from the country  the strength of the invaders was melting away little by little  how long murmured clarence chugwater as he worked at the tapemachine how long     chapter 4  clarence hears important news   it was clarences custom to leave the office of his newspaper at one oclock each day and lunch at a neighbouring aerated bread shop he did this on the day following the first appearance of the two generals at their respective halls he had brought an early edition of the paper with him and in the intervals of dealing with his glass of milk and scone and butter he read the report of the performances  both it seemed had met with flattering receptions though they had appeared nervous the russian general especially whose style said the critic was somewhat reminiscent of mr t e dunville had made himself a great favourite with the gallery the report concluded by calling attention once more to the fact that the salaries paid to the twoeight hundred and seventyfive pounds a week eachestablished a record in musichall history on this side of the atlantic  clarence had just finished this when there came to his ear the faint note of a tarantula singing to its young  he looked up opposite him at the next table was seated a youth of fifteen of a slightly grubby aspect he was eyeing clarence closely  clarence took off his spectacles polished them and replaced them on his nose as he did so the thin gruffle of the tarantula sounded once more without changing his expression clarence cautiously uttered the deep snarl of a sandeel surprised while bathing  it was sufficient the other rose to his feet holding his right hand on a line with his shoulder palm to the front thumb resting on the nail of the little finger and the other three fingers upright  clarence seized his hat by the brim at the back and moved it swiftly twice up and down  the other hesitating no longer came over to his table  pippip he said in an undertone  toodleoo and god save the king whispered clarence  the mystic ceremony which always takes place when two boy scouts meet in public was complete  private biggs of the eighteenth tarantulas sir said the boy respectfully for he had recognised clarence  clarence inclined his head  you may sit private biggs he said graciously you have news to impart  news sir that may be of vital importance  say on  private biggs who had brought his sparkling limado and a bathbun with him from the other table took a sip of the former and embarked upon his narrative  i am employed sir he said as a sort of junior clerk and officeboy by mr solly quhayne the musichall agent  clarence tapped his brow thoughtfully then his face cleared  i remember it was he who secured the engagements of the generals  the same sir  proceed  the other resumed his story  it is my duty to sit in a sort of rabbithutch in the outer office take the callers names and especially to see that they dont get through to mr quhayne till he wishes to receive them that is the most exacting part of my days work you wouldnt believe how full of the purest swank some of these pros are tell you theyve got an appointment as soon as look at you artful beggars  clarence nodded sympathetically  this morning an acrobat and society contortionist made such a fuss that in the end i had to take his card in to the private office mr quhayne was there talking to a gentleman whom i recognised as his brother mr colquhoun they were engrossed in their conversation and did not notice me for a moment with no wish to play the eavesdropper i could not help but overhear they were talking about the generals yes i know theyre pressagented at eight seventyfive dear boy i heard mr quhayne say but between you and me and the doorknob that isnt what theyre getting the german fellers drawing five hundred of the best but i could only get fourfifty for the russian cant say why i should have thought if anything hed be the bigger draw bit of a comic in his way and then he saw me there was some slight unpleasantness in fact ive got the sack after it was over i came away to try and find you it seemed to me that the information might be of importance  clarences eyes gleamed  you have done splendidly privateno corporal biggs do not regret your lost position the society shall find you work this news you have brought is of the utmostthe most vital importance dash it he cried unbending in his enthusiasm weve got em on the hop if they arent biting pieces out of each other in the next day or two im jolly well mistaken  he rose then sat down again  corporalno dash it sergeant biggsyou must have something with me this is an occasion the news you have brought me may mean the salvation of england what would you like  the other saluted joyfully  i think ill have another sparkling limado thanks awfully he said  the beverage arrived they raised their glasses  to england said clarence simply  to england echoed his subordinate                                       clarence left the shop with swift strides and hurried deep in thought to the offices of the encore in wellington street  yus said the officeboy interrogatively  clarence gave the scouts siquand the password the boys demeanour changed instantly he saluted with the utmost respect  i wish to see the editor said clarence  a short speech but one that meant salvation for the motherland     chapter 5  seeds of discord   the days following clarences visit to the offices of the encore were marked by a growing feeling of unrest alike among invaded and invaders the first novelty and excitement of the foreign occupation of the country was beginning to wear off and in its place the sturdy independence so typical of the british character was reasserting itself deep down in his heart the genuine englishman has a rugged distaste for seeing his country invaded by a foreign army people were asking themselves by what right these aliens had overrun british soil an evergrowing feeling of annoyance had begun to lay hold of the nation  it is probable that the departure of sir harry lauder first brought home to england what this invasion might mean the great comedian in his manifesto in the times had not minced his words plainly and crisply he had stated that he was leaving the country because the musichall stage was given over to alien gowks he was sorry for england he liked england but now all he could say was god bless you england shuddered remembering that last time he had said god bless you till i come back  ominous mutterings began to make themselves heard  other causes contributed to swell the discontent a regiment of russians out routemarching had walked across the bowlingscreen at kennington oval during the surrey v lancashire match causing hayward to be bowled for a ducksegg a band of german sappers had dug a trench right across the turf at queens club  the mutterings increased  nor were the invaders satisfied and happy the late english summer had set in with all its usual severity and the cossacks reared in the kindlier climate of siberia were feeling it terribly colds were the rule rather than the exception in the russian lines the coughing of the germans at tottenham could be heard in oxford street  the attitude of the british public too was getting on their nerves they had been prepared for fierce resistance they had pictured the invasion as a series of brisk battlespainful perhaps but exciting they had anticipated that when they had conquered the country they might meet with the glare of hatred as they patrolled the streets the supercilious stare unnerved them there is nothing so terrible to the highlystrung foreigner as the cold contemptuous patronising gaze of the englishman it gave the invaders a perpetual feeling of doing the wrong thing they felt like men who had been found travelling in a firstclass carriage with a thirdclass ticket they became conscious of the size of their hands and feet as they marched through the metropolis they felt their ears growing hot and red beneath the chilly stare of the populace they experienced all the sensations of a man who has come to a strange dinnerparty in a tweed suit when everybody else has dressed they felt warm and prickly  it was dull for them too london is never at its best in early september even for the habitue there was nothing to do most of the theatres were shut the streets were damp and dirty it was all very well for the generals appearing every night in the glare and glitter of the footlights but for the rank and file the occupation of london spelt pure boredom  london was in fact a human powdermagazine and it was clarence chugwater who with a firm hand applied the match that was to set it in a blaze     chapter 6  the bombshell   clarence had called at the offices of the encore on a friday the papers publishing day is thursday the encore is the times of the musichall world it casts its curses here bestows its benedictions sparely there the encore criticising the latest action of the variety artists federation is the nearest modern approach to jove hurling the thunderbolt its motto is cry havoc and let loose the performing dogs of war  it so happened that on the thursday following his momentous visit to wellington street there was need of someone on the staff of clarences evening paper to go and obtain an interview from the russian general mr hubert wales had just published a novel so fruity in theme and treatment that it had been publicly denounced from the pulpit by no less a person than the rev canon edgar sheppard dd subdean of his majestys chapels royal deputy clerk of the closet and subalmoner to the king a morning paper had started the question should there be a censor of fiction and in accordance with custom editors were collecting the views of celebrities preferably of those whose opinion on the subject was absolutely valueless  all the other reporters being away on their duties the editor was at a loss  isnt there anybody else he demanded  the chief subeditor pondered  there is young blooming chugwater he said  it was thus that englands deliverer was habitually spoken of in the office  then send him said the editor                                       grand duke vodkakoffs turn at the magnum palace of varieties started every evening at ten sharp he topped the bill clarence having been detained by a review of the scouts did not reach the hall till five minutes to the hour he got to the dressingroom as the general was going on to the stage  the grand duke dressed in the large room with the other male turns there were no private dressingrooms at the magnum clarence sat down on a baskettrunk belonging to the premier troupe of bounding zouaves of the desert and waited the four athletic young gentlemen who composed the troupe were dressing after their turn they took no notice of clarence  presently one zouave spoke  bit off tonight bill cold house  not arf replied his colleague gave me the shivers  wonder how his nibsll go  evidently he referred to the grand duke  oh es all right they eat his sort of swank seems to me the professions going to the dogs what with these bloomin amytoors an all got the airbrush arry  harry a tall silent zouave handed over the hairbrush  bill continued  id like to see him go on of a monday night at the old mogul theyd soon show him it gives me the fair ump it does these toffs coming in and taking the bread out of our mouths why cant he give us chaps a chance fair makes me rasp him and his bloomin eight hundred and seventyfive o goblins a week  not so much of your eight hundred and seventyfive young feller me lad said the zouave who had spoken first aint you seen the rag this week  naow whats in it how does our advert look  ow thats all right never mind that you look at what the encore would like to know thats whatll touch his nibs up  he produced a copy of the paper from the pocket of his greatcoat which hung from the door and passed it to his bounding brother  read it out old sort he said  the other took it to the light and began to read slowly and cautiously as one who is no expert at the art  what the encore would like to knowwhether prince otto of saxepfennig didnt go particularly big at the lobelia last week and whether his success hasnt compelled agent quhayne to purchase a largersized hat and whether it isnt a fact that though they are pressagented at the same figure prince otto is getting fifty a week more than grand duke vodkakoff and if it is not so why a little bird has assured us that the prince is being paid five hundred a week and the grand duke only four hundred and fifty and in any case whether the prince isnt worth fifty a week more than his russian friend lumme  an awed silence fell upon the group to clarence who had dictated the matter though the style was the editors the paragraph did not come as a surprise his only feeling was one of relief that the editor had served up his material so well he felt that he had been justified in leaving the more delicate literary work to that masterhand  thatll be one in the eye said the zouave harry ere ill stick it up opposite of him when he comes back to dress got a pin and a pencil some of you  he marked the quarter column heavily and pinned it up beside the lookingglass then he turned to his companions  ow about not waiting chaps he suggested i shouldnt arf wonder from the look of him if he wasnt the aughty kind of a feller whod cleave you to the bazooka for tuppence with his bloomin falchion im goin to urry through with my dressing and wait till tomorrow night to see how he looks no risks for willie  the suggestion seemed thoughtful and good the bounding zouaves with one accord bounded into their clothes and disappeared through the door just as a longdrawn chord from the invisible orchestra announced the conclusion of the grand dukes turn  general vodkakoff strutted into the room listening complacently to the applause which was still going on he had gone well he felt pleased with himself  it was not for a moment that he noticed clarence  ah he said the interviewer eh you wish to  clarence began to explain his mission while he was doing so the grand duke strolled to the basin and began to remove his makeup he favoured when on the stage a touch of the raven gipsy no 3 greasepaint it added a picturesque swarthiness to his appearance and made him look more like what he felt to be the popular ideal of a russian general  the lookingglass hung just over the basin  clarence watching him in the glass saw him start as he read the first paragraph a dark flush almost rivalling the raven gipsy no 3 spread over his face he trembled with rage  who put that paper there he roared turning  with reference then to mr hubert waless novel said clarence  the grand duke cursed mr hubert wales his novel and clarence in one sentence  you may possibly continued clarence sticking to his point like a good interviewer have read the trenchant but some say justifiable remarks of the rev canon edgar sheppard dd subdean of his majestys chapels royal deputy clerk of the closet and subalmoner to the king  the grand duke swiftly added that eminent cleric to the list  did you put that paper on this lookingglass he shouted  i did not put that paper on that lookingglass replied clarence precisely  ah said the grand duke if you had id have come and wrung your neck like a chicken and scattered you to the four corners of this dressingroom  im glad i didnt said clarence  have you read this paper on the lookingglass  i have not read that paper on the lookingglass replied clarence whose chief fault as a conversationalist was that he was perhaps a shade too ollendorfian but i know its contents  its a lie roared the grand duke an infamous lie ive a good mind to have him up for libel i know very well he got them to put those paragraphs in if he didnt write them himself  professional jealousy said clarence with a sigh is a very sad thing  ill professional jealousy him  i hear said clarence casually that he has been going very well at the lobelia a friend of mine who was there last night told me he took eleven calls  for a moment the russian generals face swelled apoplectically then he recovered himself with a tremendous effort  wait he said with awful calm wait till tomorrow night ill show him went very well did he ha took eleven calls did he oh ha ha and hell take them tomorrow night too onlyand here his voice took on a note of fiendish purpose so terrible that hardened scout as he was clarence felt his flesh creeponly this time theyll be catcalls  and with a shout of almost maniac laughter the jealous artiste flung himself into a chair and began to pull off his boots  clarence silently withdrew the hour was very near     chapter 7  the bird   the grand duke vodkakoff was not the man to let the grass grow under his feet he was no lobster no flatfish he did it nowswift secret deadlya typical muscovite by midnight his staff had their orders  those orders were for the stalls at the lobelia  price of entrance to the gallery and pit was served out at daybreak to the eighth and fifteenth cossacks of the don those fierce semicivilised fightingmachines who know no fear  grand duke vodkakoffs preparations were ready                                       few more fortunate events have occurred in the history of english literature than the quite accidental visit of mr bart kennedy to the lobelia on that historic night he happened to turn in there casually after dinner and was thus enabled to see the whole thing from start to finish at a quarter to eleven a wildeyed man charged in at the main entrance of carmelite house and too impatient to use the lift dashed up the stairs shouting for pens ink and paper  next morning the daily mail was one riot of headlines the whole of page five was given up to the topic the headlines were not elusive they flung the facts at the reader      scene at the lobelia     prince otto of saxepfennig     given the bird by     russian soldiers     what will be the outcome  there were about seventeen more and then came mr bart kennedys special report  he wrote as follows  a night to remember a marvellous night a night such as few will see again a night of fear and wonder the night of september the eleventh last night  ninethirty i had dined i had eaten my dinner my dinner so inextricably are the prose and romance of life blended my dinner i had eaten my dinner on this night this wonderful night this night of september the eleventh last night  i had dined at the club a chop a boiled potato mushrooms on toast a touch of stilton halfabottle of beaune i lay back in my chair i debated within myself a hall a theatre a book in the library that night the night of september the eleventh i as near as a toucher spent in the library of my club with a book that night the night of september the eleventh last night  fate took me to the lobelia fate we are its toys its footballs we are the footballs of fate fate might have sent me to the gaiety fate took me to the lobelia this fate which rules us  i sent in my card to the manager he let me through ever courteous he let me through on my face this manager this genial and courteous manager  i was in the lobelia a deadhead i was in the lobelia as a deadhead  here in the original draft of the article there are reflections at some length on the interior decorations of the hall and an excursus on musichall performances in general it is not till he comes to examine the audience that mr kennedy returns to the main issue  and what manner of audience was it that had gathered together to view the entertainment provided by the genial and courteous manager of the lobelia the audience beyond whom there is no appeal the caesars of the musichall the audience  at this point the author has a few extremely interesting and thoughtful remarks on the subject of audiences these may be omitted in the stalls i noted a solid body of russian officers these soldiers from the steppes these bearded men these russians they sat silent and watchful they applauded little the programme left them cold the trick cyclist the dashing soubrette and idol of belgravia the argumentative college chums the swell comedian the man with the performing canaries none of these could rouse them they were waiting waiting waiting tensely every muscle taut husbanding their strength waiting for what  a man at my side told a friend that a fellow had told him that he had been told by a commissionaire that the pit and gallery were full of russians russians russians everywhere why were they genuine patrons of the halls or were they there from some ulterior motive there was an air of suspense we were all waiting waiting for what  the atmosphere is summed up in a word one word sinister the atmosphere was sinister  aa a stir in the crowded house the ruffling of the face of the sea before a storm the sisters sigsbee coon delineators and unrivalled burlesque artists have finished their dance smiled blown kisses skipped off skipped on again smiled blown more kisses and disappeared a long chord from the orchestra a chord that is almost a wail a wail of regret for that which is past

saxepfennig prince otto general of the german army prince otto is number 15  a burst of applause from the house but not from the russians they are silent they are waiting for what  the orchestra plays a lively air the massive curtains part a tall handsome military figure strides on to the stage he bows this tall handsome military man bows he is prince otto of saxepfennig general of the army of germany one of our conquerors  he begins to speak ladies and gentlemen this man this general says ladies and gentlemen  but no more no more no more nothing more no more he says ladies and gentlemen but no more  and why does he say no more has he finished his turn is that all he does are his eight hundred and seventyfive pounds a week paid him for saying ladies and gentlemen  no  he would say more he has more to say this is only the beginning this tall handsome man has all his music still within him  why then does he say no more why does he say ladies and gentlemen but no more no more only that no more nothing more no more  because from the stalls a solid vast crushing boo is hurled at him from the russians in the stalls comes this vast crushing boo it is for this that they have been waiting it is for this that they have been waiting so tensely for this they have been waiting for this colossal boo  the general retreats a step he is amazed startled perhaps frightened he waves his hands  from gallery and pit comes a hideous whistling and howling the noise of wild beasts the noise of exploding boilers the noise of a musichall audience giving a performer the bird  everyone is standing on his feet some on mine everyone is shouting this vast audience is shouting  words begin to emerge from the babel  get offski rotten turnovitch these bearded russians these stern critics shout rotten turnovitch  fire shoots from the eyes of the german this strong mans eyes  get offski swankietoff rotten turnovitch  the fury of this audience is terrible this audience this last court of appeal this audience in its fury is terrible  what will happen the german stands his ground this man of blood and iron stands his ground he means to go on this strong man he means to go on if it snows  the audience is pulling up the benches a tomato shatters itself on the princes right eye an overripe tomato  get offski three eggs and a cat sail through the air falling short they drop on to the orchestra these eggs this cat they fall on the conductor and the second trombone they fall like the gentle dew from heaven upon the place beneath that cat those eggs  aa at last the stagemanagerkeen alert resourcefulsaves the situation this man this stagemanager this man with the big brain slowly inevitably the fireproof curtain falls it is halfway down it is down before it the audience the audience behind it the prince the prince that general that man of iron that performer who has just got the bird  the russian national anthem rings through the hall thunderous triumphant the russian national anthem a paean of joy  the menials reappear those calm passionless menials they remove the number fifteen they insert the number sixteen they are like destiny pitiless unmoved purposeful silent those menials  a crash from the orchestra turn number sixteen has begun     chapter 8  the meeting at the scotch stores   prince otto of saxepfennig stood in the wings shaking in every limb german oaths of indescribable vigour poured from his lips in a group some feet away stood six muscular shortsleeved stagehands it was they who had flung themselves on the general at the fall of the iron curtain and prevented him dashing round to attack the stalls with his sabre at a sign from the stagemanager they were ready to do it again  the stagemanager was endeavouring to administer balm  bless you your highness he was saying its nothing its what happens to everyone some time ask any of the topnotch pros ask em whether they never got the bird when they were starting why even now some of the biggest stars cant go to some towns because they always cop it there bless you it  a stagehand came up with a piece of paper in his hand  young feller in spectacles and a rum sort o suit give me this for your ighness  the prince snatched it from his hand  the note was written in a round boyish hand it was signed a friend it ranthe men who booed you tonight were sent for that purpose by general vodkakoff who is jealous of you because of the paragraphs in the encore this week  prince otto became suddenly calm  excuse me your highness said the stagemanager anxiously as he moved you cant go round to the front stand by bill  right sir said the stagehands  prince otto smiled pleasantly  there is no danger i do not intend to go to the front i am going to look in at the scotch stores for a moment  oh in that case your highness goodnight your highness better luck tomorrow your highness                                       it had been the custom of the two generals since they had joined the musichall profession to go after their turn to the scotch stores where they stood talking and blocking the gangway as etiquette demands that a successful artiste shall  the prince had little doubt but that he would find vodkakoff there tonight  he was right the russian general was there chatting affably across the counter about the weather  he nodded at the prince with a wellassumed carelessness  go well tonight he inquired casually  prince otto clenched his fists but he had had a rigorously diplomatic upbringing and knew how to keep a hold on himself when he spoke it was in the familiar language of diplomacy  the rain has stopped he said but the pavements are still wet underfoot has your grace taken the precaution to come out in a good stout pair of boots  the shaft plainly went home but the grand dukes manner as he replied was unruffled  rain he said sipping his vermouth is always wet but sometimes it is cold as well  but it never falls upwards said the prince pointedly  rarely i understand your powers of observation are keen my dear prince  there was a silence then the prince momentarily baffled returned to the attack  the quickest way to get from charing cross to hammersmith broadway he said is to go by underground  men have died in hammersmith broadway replied the grand duke suavely  the prince gritted his teeth he was no match for his slippery adversary in a diplomatic dialogue and he knew it  the sun rises in the east he cried halfchoking but it setsit sets  so does a hen was the cynical reply  the last remnants of the princes selfcontrol were slipping away this elusive diplomatic conversation is a terrible strain if one is not in the mood for it its proper setting is the gay glittering ballroom at some frivolous court to a man who has just got the bird at a musichall and who is trying to induce another man to confess that the thing was his doing it is little short of maddening  hen he echoed clenching and unclenching his fists have you studied the habits of hens  the truth seemed very near to him now but the masterdiplomat before him was used to extracting himself from awkward corners  pullets with a southern exposure he drawled have yellow legs and ripen quickest  the prince was nonplussed he had no answer  the girl behind the bar spoke  you do talk silly you two she said  it was enough trivial as the remark was it was the last straw the prince brought his fist down with a crash on the counter  yes he shouted you are right we do talk silly but we shall do so no longer i am tired of this verbal fencing a plain answer to a plain question did you or did you not send your troops to give me the bird tonight  my dear prince  the grand duke raised his eyebrows  did you or did you not  the wise man said the russian still determined on evasion never takes sides unless they are sides of bacon  the prince smashed a glass  you did he roared i know you did listen to me ill give you one chance ill give you and your precious soldiers twentyfour hours from midnight tonight to leave this country if you are still here then  he paused dramatically  the grand duke slowly drained his vermouth  have you seen my professional advertisement in the era my dear prince he asked  i have what of it  you noticed nothing about it  i did not  ah if you had looked more closely you would have seen the words permanent address hampstead  you mean  i mean that i see no occasion to alter that advertisement in any way  there was another tense silence the two men looked hard at each other  that is your final decision said the german  the russian bowed  so be it said the prince turning to the door i have the honour to wish you a very good night  the same to you said the grand duke mind the step     chapter 9  the great battle   the news that an open rupture had occurred between the generals of the two invading armies was not slow in circulating the early editions of the evening papers were full of it a symposium of the opinions of dr emil reich dr saleeby sandow mr chiozza money and lady grove was hastily collected young men with knobbly and bulging foreheads were turned on by their editors to write charactersketches of the two generals all was stir and activity  meanwhile those who look after londons public amusements were busy with telephone and telegraph the quarrel had taken place on friday night it was probable that unless steps were taken the battle would begin early on saturday which it did not require a man of unusual intelligence to see would mean a heavy financial loss to those who supplied london with its saturday afternoon amusements the matinees would suffer the battle might not affect the stalls and dresscircle perhaps but there could be no possible doubt that the pit and gallery receipts would fall off terribly to the public which supports the pit and gallery of a theatre there is an irresistible attraction about a fight on anything like a large scale when one considers that a quite ordinary streetfight will attract hundreds of spectators it will be plainly seen that no theatrical entertainment could hope to compete against so strong a counterattraction as a battle between the german and russian armies  the various footballgrounds would be heavily hit too and there was to be a monster rollerskating carnival at olympia that also would be spoiled  a deputation of amusementcaterers hurried to the two camps within an hour of the appearance of the first evening paper they put their case plainly and well the generals were obviously impressed messages passed and repassed between the two armies and in the end it was decided to put off the outbreak of hostilities till monday morning                                       satisfactory as this undoubtedly was for the theatremanagers and directors of football clubs it was in some ways a pity from the standpoint of the historian it spoiled the whole affair but for the postponement readers of this history mightnay wouldhave been able to absorb a vivid and masterly account of the great struggle with a careful description of the tactics by which victory was achieved they would have been told the disposition of the various regiments the stratagems the dashing advances the skilful retreats and the lessons of the war  as it is owing to the mistaken goodnature of the rival generals the date of the fixture was changed and practically all that a historian can do is to record the result  a slight mist had risen as early as four oclock on saturday by nightfall the atmosphere was a little dense but the lampposts were still clearly visible at a distance of some feet and nobody accustomed to living in london would have noticed anything much out of the common it was not till sunday morning that the fog proper really began  london awoke on sunday to find the world blanketed in the densest yellowest london particular that had been experienced for years it was the sort of day when the city clerk has the exhilarating certainty that at last he has an excuse for lateness which cannot possibly be received with harsh disbelief people spent the day indoors and hoped it would clear up by tomorrow  they cant possibly fight if its like this they told each other  but on the monday morning the fog was if possible denser it wrapped london about as with a garment people shook their heads  theyll have to put it off they were saying when of a suddenboom and again boom  it was the sound of heavy guns  the battle had begun                                       one does not wish to grumble or make a fuss but still it does seem a little hard that a battle of such importance a battle so outstanding in the history of the world should have been fought under such conditions london at that moment was richer than ever before in descriptive reporters it was the age of descriptive reporters of vivid penpictures in every newspaper office there were men who could have hauled up their slacks about that battle in a way that would have made a ymca lecturer want to get at somebody with a bayonet men who could have handed out the adjectives and exclamationmarks till you almost heard the roar of the guns and there they wereidle supinelike careened battleships they were helpless bart kennedy did start an article which began fog black fog and the roar of guns two nations fighting in the fog but it never came to anything it was promising for a while but it died of inanition in the middle of the second stick  it was hard  the lot of the actual warcorrespondents was still worse it was useless for them to explain that the fog was too thick to give them a chance if its light enough for them to fight said their editors remorselessly its light enough for you to watch them and out they had to go  they had a perfectly miserable time edgar wallace seems to have lost his way almost at once he was found two days later in an almost starving condition at steeple bumpstead how he got there nobody knows he said he had set out to walk to where the noise of the guns seemed to be and had gone on walking bennett burleigh that crafty old campaigner had the sagacity to go by tube this brought him to hampstead the scene it turned out later of the fiercest operations and with any luck he might have had a story to tell but the lift stuck halfway up owing to a german shell bursting in its neighbourhood and it was not till the following evening that a searchparty heard and rescued him  the resta g hales frederick villiers charles hands and the othersmet on a smaller scale the same fate as edgar wallace hales starting for tottenham arrived in croydon very tired with a nail in his boot villiers equally unlucky fetched up at richmond the most curious fate of all was reserved for charles hands as far as can be gathered he got on all right till he reached leicester square there he lost his bearings and seems to have walked round and round shakespeares statue under the impression that he was going straight to tottenham after a day and ahalf of this he sat down to rest and was there found when the fog had cleared by a passing policeman  and all the while the unseen guns boomed and thundered and strange thin shoutings came faintly through the darkness     chapter 10  the triumph of england   it was the afternoon of wednesday september the sixteenth the battle had been over for twentyfour hours the fog had thinned to a light lemon colour it was raining  by now the country was in possession of the main facts full details were not to be expected though it is to the credit of the newspapers that with keen enterprise they had at once set to work to invent them and on the whole had not done badly  broadly the facts were that the russian army outmanoeuvered had been practically annihilated of the vast force which had entered england with the other invaders there remained but a handful these the grand duke vodkakoff among them were prisoners in the german lines at tottenham  the victory had not been gained bloodlessly not a fifth of the german army remained it is estimated that quite twothirds of each army must have perished in that last charge of the germans up the hampstead heights which ended in the storming of jack straws castle and the capture of the russian general                                       prince otto of saxepfennig lay sleeping in his tent at tottenham he was worn out in addition to the strain of the battle there had been the heavy work of seeing the interviewers signing autographbooks sitting to photographers writing testimonials for patent medicines and the thousand and one other tasks burdensome but unavoidable of the man who is in the public eye also he had caught a bad cold during the battle a bottle of ammoniated quinine lay on the table beside him now as he slept                                       as he lay there the flap of the tent was pulled softly aside two figures entered each was dressed in a flatbrimmed hat a coloured handkerchief a flannel shirt football shorts stockings brown boots and a whistle each carried a hockeystick one however wore spectacles and a look of quiet command which showed that he was the leader  they stood looking at the prostrate general for some moments then the spectacled leader spoke  scoutmaster wagstaff  the other saluted  wake him  scoutmaster wagstaff walked to the side of the bed and shook the sleepers shoulder the prince grunted and rolled over on to his other side the scoutmaster shook him again he sat up blinking  as his eyes fell on the quiet stern spectacled figure he leaped from the bed  whatwhatwhat he stammered whats the beadig of this  he sneezed as he spoke and turning to the table poured out and drained a bumper of ammoniated quinine  i told the sedtry pardicularly not to let adybody id who are you  the intruder smiled quietly  my name is clarence chugwater he said simply  jugwater dodt doe you frob adab what do

your duty  the scoutmaster moved forward the prince bounding to the bed thrust his hand under the pillow clarences voice rang out like a trumpet  cover that man  the prince looked up two feet away scoutmaster wagstaff was standing catapult in hand ready to shoot  he is never known to miss said clarence warningly  the prince wavered  he has broken more windows than any other boy of his age in south london  the prince sullenly withdrew his handempty  well whad do you wad he snarled  resistance is useless said clarence the moment i have plotted and planned for has come your troops worn out
