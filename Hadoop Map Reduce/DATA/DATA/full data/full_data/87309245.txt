something was wrong stopped and puffed hard at his pipe  through the cover of the smoke he bestowed a sympathetic wink upon his daughter  you neednt go on too fast said the latter turning to her mother  i havent made up my mind yet  charlies looks are all right but he aint over and above steady and ben is steady but he aint much to look at  what does your art say inquired the sentimental mr dowson  neither lady took the slightest notice  charlie foss is too larky said mrs dowson solemnly its easy come and easy go with im  hes just such another as your fathers cousin billand look what appened to him  miss dowson shrugged her shoulders and subsiding in her chair went on with her book until a loud knock at the door and a cheerful but peculiarly shrill whistle sounded outside  illustration miss dowson subsiding in her chair went on with her book  there is my lord exclaimed mrs dowson waspishly anybody might think the ouse belonged to him  and now hes dancing on my clean doorstep  might be only knocking the mud off afore coming in said mr dowson as he rose to open the door  ive noticed hes very careful  i just came in to tell you a joke said mr foss as he followed his host into the kitchen and gazed tenderly at miss dowsonbest joke i ever had in my life ive ad my fortune toldguess what it was  ive been laughing to myself ever since  who told it inquired mrs dowson after a somewhat awkward silence  old gypsy woman in peter street replied mr foss  i gave er a wrong name and address just in case she might ha heard about me and she did make a mess of it upon my word she did  wot did she say inquired mr dowson  mr foss laughed  said i was a wrong un he said cheerfully and would bring my mothers gray hairs to the grave with sorrow  im to ave bad companions and take to drink im to steal money to gamble with and after all that im to ave five years for bigamy  i told her i was disappointed i wasnt to be hung and she said it would be a disappointment to a lot of other people too  laugh  i thought i should ave killed myself  i dont see nothing to laugh at said mrs dowson coldly  i shouldnt tell anybody else charlie said her husband  keep it a secret my boy  but youyou dont believe it stammered the crestfallen mr foss  mrs dowson cast a stealthy glance at her daughter  its wonderful ow some o those fortunetellers can see into the future she said shaking her head  ah said her husband with a confirmatory nod  wonderful is no name for it  i ad my fortune told once when i was a boy and she told me i should marry the prettiest and the nicest and the sweetesttempered gal in poplar  mr foss with a triumphant smile barely waited for him to finish there you he began and stopped suddenly  illustration i just came in to tell you a joke  what was you about to remark inquired mrs dowson icily  i was going to say replied mr fossi was going to sayi ad just got it on the tip o my tongue to say there youyouyou ad all the luck mr dowson  he edged his chair a little nearer to flora but there was a chilliness in the atmosphere against which his high spirits strove in vain  mr dowson remembered other predictions which had come true notably the case of one man who learning that he was to come in for a legacy gave up a twopoundaweek job and did actually come in for twenty pounds and a birdcage seven years afterwards  illustration he edged his chair a little nearer to flora  its all nonsense protested mr foss she only said all that because i made fun of her  you dont believe it do you flora  i dont see anything to laugh at returned miss dowson  fancy five years for bigamy  fancy the disgrace of it  but youre talking as if i was going to do it objected mr foss  i wish youd go and ave your fortune told  go and see what she says about you  praps you wont believe so much in fortunetelling afterwards  mrs dowson looked up quickly and then lowering her eyes took her hand out of the stocking she had been darning and placing it beside its companion rolled the pair into a ball  you go round tomorrow night flora she said deliberately  it shant be said a daughter of mine was afraid to hear the truth about herself fatherll find the money  and she can say what she likes about you but i shant believe it said mr foss reproachfully  i dont suppose itll be anything to be ashamed of said miss dowson sharply  mr foss bade them goodnight suddenly and finding himself accompanied to the door by mr dowson gave way to gloom  he stood for so long with one foot on the step and the other on the mat that mr dowson who disliked draughts got impatient  illustration mr foss bade them goodnight suddenly  youll catch cold charlie he said at last  thats what im trying to do said mr foss my death o cold  then i shant get five years for bigamy he added bitterly  cheer up said mr dowson five years aint much out of a lifetime and you cant expect to ave your fun without  he watched the retreating figure of mr foss as it stamped its way down the street and closing the door returned to the kitchen to discuss palmistry and other sciences until bedtime  mrs dowson saw husband and daughter off to work in the morning and after washing up the breakfast things drew her chair up to the kitchen fire and became absorbed in memories of the past all the leading incidents in floras career passed in review before her  measles whoopingcough schoolprizes and other things peculiar to the age of innocence were all there  in her enthusiasm she nearly gave her a sprained ankle which had belonged to her sister  still shaking her head over her mistake she drew floras latest portrait carefully from its place in the album and putting on her hat and jacket went round to make a call in peter street  by the time flora returned home mrs dowson appeared to have forgotten the arrangement made the night before and being reminded by her daughter questioned whether any good could come of attempts to peer into the future  mr dowson was still more emphatic but his objections being recognized by both ladies as trouserpocket ones carried no weight  it ended in flora going off with half a crown in her glove and an urgent request from her father to make it as difficult as possible for the sibyl by giving a false name and address  no name was asked for however as miss dowson was shown into the untidy little back room on the first floor in which the sorceress ate slept and received visitors  she rose from an old rockingchair as the visitor entered and regarding her with a pair of beady black eyes bade her sit down  are you the fortuneteller inquired the girl  men call me so was the reply  yes but are you persisted miss dowson who inherited her fathers fondness for half crowns  yes said the other in a more natural voice  she took the girls left hand and pouring a little dark liquid into the palm gazed at it intently  left for the past right for the future she said in a deep voice  she muttered some strange words and bent her head lower over the girls hand  illustration she muttered some strange words and bent her head lower over the girls hand  i see a fairhaired infant she said slowly i see a little girl of four racked with the whoopingcough i see her later eight she appears to be  she is in bed with measles  miss dowson stared at her openmouthed  she goes away to the seaside to get strong continued the sorceress she is paddling she falls into the water and spoils her frock her mother  never mind about that interrupted the staring miss dowson hastily i was only eight at the time and mother always was ready with her hands  people on the beach smile resumed the other  they  it dont take much to make some people laugh said miss dowson with bitterness  at fourteen she and a boy next door but seven both have the mumps  and why not demanded miss dowson with great warmth  why not  im only reading what i see in your hand said the other  at fifteen i see her knocked down by a boatswing a boy from opposite brings her home  passing at the time murmured miss dowson  his head is done up with stickingplaster  i see her apprenticed to a dressmaker  i see her  the voice went on monotonously and flora gasping with astonishment listened to a long recital of the remaining interesting points in her career  that brings us to the present said the soothsayer dropping her hand now for the future  she took the girls other hand and poured some of the liquid into it miss dowson shrank back  if its anything dreadful she said quickly i dont want to hear it itit aint natural  i can warn you of dangers to keep clear of said the other detaining her hand  i can let you peep into the future and see what to do and what to avoid  ah  she bent over the girls hand again and uttered little ejaculations of surprise and perplexity  i see you moving in gay scenes surrounded by happy faces she said slowly  you are much sought after  handsome presents and fine clothes are showered upon you  you will cross the sea  i see a dark young man and a fair young man  they will both influence your life  the fair young man works in his fathers shop  he will have great riches  what about the other inquired miss dowson after a somewhat lengthy pause  the fortuneteller shook her head  he is his own worst enemy she said and he will drag down those he loves with him  you are going to marry one of them but i cant see cleari cant see which  look again said the trembling flora  i cant see was the reply therefore it isnt meant for me to see its for you to choose  i can see them now as plain as i can see you you are all three standing where two roads meet  the fair young man is beckoning to you and pointing to a big house and a motorcar and a yacht  and the other said the surprised miss dowson  hes in knickerbockers said the other doubtfully  what does that mean  ah i see  theyve got the broad arrow on them and he is pointing to a jail  its all gonei can see no more  she dropped the girls hand and drawing her hand across her eyes sank back into her chair  miss dowson with trembling fingers dropped the half crown into her lap and with her head in a whirl made her way downstairs  after such marvels the streets seemed oddly commonplace as she walked swiftly home  she decided as she went to keep her knowledge to herself but inclination on the one hand and mrs dowson on the other got the better of her resolution  with the exception of a few things in her past already known and therefore not worth dwelling upon the whole of the interview was disclosed  it fair takes your breath away declared the astounded mr dowson  the fair young man is meant for ben lippet said his wife and the dark one is charlie foss  it must be  its no use shutting your eyes to things  its as plain as a pikestaff agreed her husband  and she told charlie five years for bigamy and when shes telling floras fortune she sees im in convicts clothes  how she does it i cant think  its a gift said mrs dowson briefly and i do hope that flora is going to act sensible  anyhow she can let ben lippet come and see her without going upstairs with the toothache  he can come if he likes said flora though why charlie couldnt have ad the motorcar and im the five years i dont know  mr lippet came in the next evening and the evening after  in fact so easy is it to fall into habits of an agreeable nature that nearly every evening saw him the happy guest of mr dowson  a spirit of resignation fostered by a present or two and a visit to the theatre descended upon miss dowson  fate and her mother combined were in a fair way to overcome her inclinations when mr foss who had been out of town on a job came in to hear the result of her visit to the fortuneteller and found mr lippet installed in the seat that used to be his  at first mrs dowson turned a deaf ear to his request for information and it was only when his jocularity on the subject passed the bounds of endurance that she consented to gratify his curiosity  i didnt want to tell you she said when she had finished but you asked for it and now youve got it  its very amusing said mr foss  i wonder who the dark young man in the fancy knickers is  ah i daresay youll know some day said mrs dowson  was the fair young man a goodlooking chap inquired the inquisitive mr foss  mrs dowson hesitated  yes she said defiantly  wonder who it can be  muttered mr foss in perplexity  youll know that too some day no doubt was the reply  im glad its to be a goodlooking chap he said not that i think flora believes in such rubbish as fortunetelling  shes too sensible  i do said flora  how should she know all the things i did when i was a little girl  tell me that  i believe in it too said mrs dowson  praps youll tell me im not sensible  mr foss quailed at the challenge and relapsed into moody silence  the talk turned on an aunt of mr lippets rumored to possess money and an uncle who was rolling in it  he began to feel in the way and only his native obstinacy prevented him from going  it was a relief to him when the front door opened and the heavy step of mr dowson was heard in the tiny passage  if anything it seemed heavier than usual and mr dowsons manner when he entered the room and greeted his guests was singularly lacking in its usual cheerfulness  he drew a chair to the fire and putting his feet on the fender gazed moodily between the bars  ive been wondering as i came along he said at last with an obvious attempt to speak carelessly whether this ere fortunetelling as weve been hearing so much about lately always comes out true  it depends on the fortuneteller said his wife  i mean said mr dowson slowly i mean that gypsy woman that charlie and flora went to  of course it does snapped his wife  id trust what she says afore anything  i know five or six that she has told said mr lippet plucking up courage and they all believe er  they couldnt help themselves they said so  still she might make a mistake sometimes said mr dowson faintly might get mixed up so to speak  never said mrs dowson firmly  never echoed flora and mr lippet  mr dowson heaved a big sigh and his eye wandered round the room  it lighted on mr foss  shes an old humbug said that gentleman  ive a good mind to put the police on to her  mr dowson reached over and gripped his hand  then he sighed again  of course it suits charlie foss to say so said mrs dowson naturally hed say so hes got reasons  i believe every word she says if she told me i was coming in for a fortune i should believe her and if she told me i was going to have misfortunes i should believe her  dont say that shouted mr dowson with startling energy  dont say that  thats what she did say  what cried his wife sharply  what are you talking about  i won eighteenpence off of bob stevens said her husband staring at the table  eighteenpence is er price for telling the future only and being curious and feeling id like to know whats going to appen to me i went in and had eighteenpennorth  well youre upset said mrs dowson with a quick glance at him  you get upstairs to bed  id sooner stay ere said her husband resuming his seat it seems more cheerful and lifelike  i wish i adnt gorn thats what i wish  what did she tell you inquired mr foss  mr dowson thrust his hands into his trouser pockets and spoke desperately  she says im to live to ninety and im to travel to foreign parts  you get to bed said his wife  come along  mr dowson shook his head doggedly  im to be rich he continued slowlyrich and loved  after my pore dear wifes death im to marry again a young woman with money and stormy brown eyes  mrs dowson sprang from her chair and stood over him quivering with passion  how dare you she gasped  youyouve been drinking  ive ad two arfpints said her husband solemnly  i shouldnt ave ad the second only i felt so miserable  i know i shant be appy with a young woman  mrs dowson past speech sank back in her chair and stared at him  i shouldnt worry about it if i was you mrs dowson said mr foss kindly  look what she said about me  that ought to show you she aint to be relied on  eyes like lamps said mr dowson musingly and im fortynine next month  well they do say every eye as its own idea of beauty  a strange sound half laugh and half cry broke from the lips of the overwrought mrs dowson  she controlled herself by an effort  if she said it she said doggedly with a fierce glance at mr foss itll come true  if after my death my usband is going to marry a young woman withwith  stormy brown eyes interjected mr foss softly  its his fate and it cant be avoided concluded mrs dowson  but its so soon said the unfortunate husband  youre to die in three weeks and im to be married three months after  mrs dowson moistened her lips and tried but in vain to avoid the glittering eye of mr foss  three she said mechanically three three weeks  dont be frightened said mr foss in a winning voice  i dont believe it and besides we shall soon see  and if you dont die in three weeks perhaps i shant get five years for bigamy and perhaps flora wont marry a fair man with millions of money and motorcars  no perhaps she is wrong after all mother said mr dowson hopefully  mrs dowson gave him a singularly unkind look for one about to leave him so soon and afraid to trust herself to speech left the room and went upstairs  as the door closed behind her mr foss took the chair which mr lippet had thoughtlessly vacated and offered such consolations to flora as he considered suitable to the occasion
