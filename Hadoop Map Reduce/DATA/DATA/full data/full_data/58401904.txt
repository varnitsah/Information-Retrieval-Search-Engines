established beyond doubt that mr butler was drunk at the time this rests upon the evidence of sergeant flanagan and the troopers who accompanied him and it rests upon mr butlers own word as we shall see and let me add here and now that however wild and irresponsible a rascal he may have been yet by his own lights he was a man of honour incapable of falsehood even though it were calculated to save his skin i do not deny that sir thomas picton has described him as a thieving blackguard but i am sure that this was merely the downright rather extravagant manner of censure peculiar to that distinguished general and that those who have taken the expression at its purely literal value have been lacking at once in charity and in knowledge of the caustic uncompromising terms of speech of general picton whom lord wellington you will remember called a rough foulmouthed devil  in further extenuation it may truthfully be urged that the whole hideous and odious affair was the result of a misapprehension although i cannot go so far as one of lieutenant butlers apologists and accept the view that he was the victim of a deliberate plot on the part of his toogenial host at regoa that is a misconception easily explained this hosts name happened to be souza and the apologist in question has very rashly leapt at the conclusion that he was a member of that notoriously intriguing family of which the chief members were the principal souza of the council of regency at lisbon and the chevalier souza portuguese minister to the court of st jamess unacquainted with portugal our apologist was evidently in ignorance of the fact that the name of souza is almost as common in that country as the name of smith in this he may also have been misled by the fact that principal souza did not neglect to make the utmost capital out of the affair thereby increasing the difficulties with which lord wellington was already contending as a result of incompetence and deliberate malice on the part both of the ministry at home and of the administration in lisbon  indeed but for these factors it is unlikely that the affair could ever have taken place at all if there had been more energy on the part of mr perceval and the members of the cabinet if there had been less bad faith and selfseeking on the part of the opposition lord wellingtons campaign would not have been starved as it was and if there had been less bad faith and selfseeking of an even more stupid and flagrant kind on the part of the portuguese council of regency the british expeditionary force would not have been left without the stipulated supplies and otherwise hindered at every step  lord wellington might have experienced the mental agony of sir john moore under similar circumstances fifteen months earlier that he did suffer and was to suffer yet more his correspondence shows but his iron will prevented that suffering from disturbing the equanimity of his mind the council of regency in its concern to court popularity with the aristocracy of portugal might balk his measures by its deliberate supineness echoes might reach him of the voices at st stephens that loudly dubbed his dispositions rash presumptuous and silly catchhalfpenny journalists at home and men of the stamp of lord grey might exploit their abysmal military ignorance in reckless criticism and censure of his operations he knew what a passionate storm of anger and denunciation had arisen from the opposition when he had been raised to the peerage some months earlier after the glorious victory of talavera and how that victory notwithstanding it had been proclaimed that his conduct of the campaign was so incompetent as to deserve not reward but punishment and he was aware of the growing unpopularity of the war in england knew that the governmentignorant of what he was so laboriously preparingwas chafing at his inactivity of the past few months so that a member of the cabinet wrote to him exasperatedly incredibly and fatuouslyfor gods sake do somethinganything so that blood be spilt  a heart less stout might have been broken a genius less mighty stifled in this evil tangle of stupidity incompetence and malignity that sprang up and flourished about him on every hand a man less singleminded must have succumbed to exasperation thrown up his command and taken ship for home inviting some of his innumerable critics to take his place at the head of the troops and give free rein to the military genius that inspired their critical dissertations wellington however has been rightly termed of iron and never did he show himself more of iron than in those trying days of 1810 stern but with a passionless sternness he pursued his way towards the goal he had set himself allowing no criticism no censure no invective so much as to give him pause in his majestic progress  unfortunately the lofty calm of the commanderinchief was not shared by his lieutenants the light division was quartered along the river agueda watching the spanish frontier beyond which marshal ney was demonstrating against ciudad rodrigo and for lack of funds its fierytempered commander sir robert craufurd found himself at last unable to feed his troops exasperated by these circumstances sir robert was betrayed into an act of rashness he seized some church plate at pinhel that he might convert it into rations it was an act which considering the general state of public feeling in the country at the time might have had the gravest consequences and sir robert was subsequently forced to do penance and afford redress that however is another story i but mention the incident here because the affair of tavora with which i am concerned may be taken to have arisen directly out of it and sir roberts behaviour may be construed as setting an example and thus as affording yet another extenuation of lieutenant butlers offence  our lieutenant was sent upon a foraging expedition into the valley of the upper douro at the head of a halftroop of the 8th dragoons two squadrons of which were attached at the time to the light division to be more precise he was to purchase and bring into pinhel a hundred head of cattle intended some for slaughter and some for draught his instructions were to proceed as far as regoa and there report himself to one bartholomew bearsley a prosperous and influential english winegrower whose father had acquired considerable vineyards in the douro he was reminded of the almost hostile disposition of the peasantry in certain districts warned to handle them with tact and to suffer no straggling on the part of his troopers and advised to place himself in the hands of mr bearsley for all that related to the purchase of the cattle let it be admitted at once that had sir robert craufurd been acquainted with mr butlers featherbrained irresponsible nature he would have selected any officer rather than our lieutenant to command that expedition but the irish dragoons had only lately come to pinhel and the general himself was not immediately concerned  lieutenant butler set out on a blustering day of march at the head of his troopers accompanied by cornet orourke and two sergeants and at pesqueira he was further reinforced by a portuguese guide they found quarters that night at ervedoza and early on the morrow they were in the saddle again riding along the heights above the cachao da valleria through which the yellow swollen river swirled and foamed along its rocky way the prospect formidable even in the full bloom of fruitful and luxuriant summer was forbidding and menacing now as some imagined gorge of the nether regions the towering granite heights across the turgid stream were shrouded in mist and sweeping rain and from the leaden heavens overhead the downpour was of a sullen and merciless steadiness starting at every step a miniature torrent to go swell the roaring waters in the gorge and drenching the troop alike in body and in spirit ahead swathed to the chin in his blue cavalry cloak the water streaming from his leather helmet rode lieutenant butler cursing the weather the country the light division and everything else that occurred to him as contributing to his present discomfort beside him astride of a mule rode the portuguese guide in a caped cloak of thatched straw which made him look for all the world like a bottle of his native wine in its straw sheath conversation between the two was out of the question for the guide spoke no english and the lieutenants knowledge of portuguese was very far from conversational  presently the ground sloped and the troop descended from the heights by a road flanked with dripping pinewoods black and melancholy that for a while screened them off from the remainder of the sodden world thence they emerged near the head of the bridge that spanned the swollen river and led them directly into the town of regoa through the mud and clay of the deserted narrow unpaved streets the dragoons squelched their way under a superdeluge for the rain was now reinforced by steady and overwhelming sheets of water descending on either side from the guttershaped tiles that roofed the houses  inquisitive faces showed here and there behind blurred windows odd doors were opened that a peasant family might stare in questioning wonderand perhaps in some concernat the sodden pageant that was passing but in the streets themselves the troopers met no living thing all the world having scurried to shelter from the pitiless downpour  beyond the town they were brought by their guide to a walled garden and halted at a gateway beyond this could be seen a fair white house set in the foreground of the vineyards that rose in terraces up the hillside until they were lost from sight in the lowering veils of mist carved on the granite lintel of that gateway the lieutenant beheld the inscription bartholomeu bearsley 1744 and knew himself at his destination at the gates of the son or grandsonhe knew not which nor caredof the original tenant of that wine farm  mr bearsley however was from home the lieutenant was informed of this by mr bearsleys steward a portly genial rather priestly gentleman in smooth black broadcloth whose name was souzaa name which as i have said has given rise to some misconceptions mr bearsley himself had lately left for england there to wait until the disturbed state of portugal should be happily repaired he had been a considerable sufferer from the french invasion under soult and none may blame him for wishing to avoid a repetition of what already he had undergone especially now that it was rumoured that the emperor in person would lead the army gathering for conquest on the frontiers  but had mr bearsley been at home the dragoons could have received no warmer welcome than that which was extended to them by fernando souza greeting the lieutenant in intelligible english he implored him in the florid manner of the peninsula to count the house and all within it his own property and to command whatever he might desire  the troopers found accommodation in the kitchen and in the spacious hall where great fires of pine logs were piled up for their comfort and for the remainder of the day they abode there in various states of nakedness relieved by blankets and straw capotes what time the house was filled with the steam and stench of their drying garments rations had been short of late on the agueda and in addition their weary ride through the rain had made the men sharpset abundance of food was placed before them by the solicitude of fernando souza and they feasted as they had not feasted for many months upon roast kid boiled rice and golden maize bread washed down by a copious supply of a rough and not too heady wine that the discreet and discriminating steward judged appropriate to their palates and capable of supporting some abuse  akin to the treatment of the troopers in hall and kitchen but on a nobler scale was the treatment of lieutenant butler and cornet orourke in the diningroom for them a wellroasted turkey took the place of kid and souza went down himself to explore the cellars for a wellsunned timeripened douro table wine which he vowedand our dragoons agreed with himwould put the noblest burgundy to shame and then with the dessert there was a port the like of which mr butlerwho was always of a nice taste in wine and who was coming into some knowledge of port from his residence in the countryhad never dreamed existed  for four and twenty hours the dragoons abode at mr bearsleys quinta thanking god for the discomforts that had brought them to such comfort feasting in this land of plenty as only those can feast who have kept a rigid lent nor was this all the benign souza was determined that the sojourn there of these representatives of his countrys deliverers should be a complete rest and holiday not for mr butler to journey to the uplands in this matter of a herd of bullocks fernando souza had at command a regiment of labourers who were idle at this time of year and whom his good nature would engage on behalf of his english guests let the lieutenant do no more than provide the necessary money for the cattle and the rest should happen as by enchantmentand souza himself would see to it that the price was fair and proper  the lieutenant asked no better he had no great opinion of himself either as cattle dealer or cattle drover nor did his ambitions beget in him any desire to excel as one or the other so he was well content that his host should have the bullocks fetched to regoa for him the herd was driven in on the following afternoon by when the rain had ceased and our lieutenant had every reason to be pleased when he beheld the solid beasts procured having disbursed the amount demandedan amount more reasonable far than he had been prepared to paymr butler would have set out forthwith to return to pinhel knowing how urgent was the need of the division and with what impatience the choleric general craufurd would be awaiting him  why so you shall so you shall said the priestly soothing souza but first youll dine there is good dinnerah but what good dinnerthat i have order and there is a wineah but you shall give me news of that wine  lieutenant butler hesitated cornet orourke watched him anxiously praying that he might succumb to the temptation and attempted suasion in the form of a murmured blessing upon souzas hospitality  sir robert will be impatient demurred the lieutenant  but halfhour protested souza what is halfhour and in halfhour you will have dine  true ventured the cornet and its the devil himself knows when we may dine again  and the dinner is ready it can be serve this instant it shall said souza with finality and pulled the bellrope  mr butler never dreamingas indeed how could hethat fate was taking a hand in this business gave way and they sat down to dinner henceforth you see him the sport of pitiless circumstance  they dined within the halfhour as souza had promised and they dined exceedingly well if yesterday the steward had been able without warning of their coming to spread at short notice so excellent a feast conceive what had been accomplished now by preparation emptying his fourth and final bumper of rich red douro mr butler paid his host the compliment of a sigh and pushed back his chair  but souza detained him waving a hand that trembled with anxiety and with anxiety stamped upon his benignly rotund and shaven countenance  an instant yet he implored mr bearsley would never pardon me did i let you go without what he call a stirrupcup to keep you from the ills that lurk in the wind of the serra a glassbut oneof that port you tasted yesterday i say but a glass yet i hope you will do honour to the bottle but a glass at least at least he implored it almost with tears mr butler had reached that state of delicious torpor in which to take the road is the last agony but duty was duty and sir robert craufurd had the fiends own temper torn thus between consciousness of duty and the weakness of the flesh he looked at orourke orourke a cherubic fellow who had for his years a very pretty taste in wine returned the glance with a moist eye and licked his lips  in your place i should let myself be tempted says he its an elegant wine and ten minutes more or less is no great matter  the lieutenant discovered a middle way which permitted him to take a prompt decision creditable to his military instincts but revealing a disgraceful though quite characteristic selfishness  very well he said leave sergeant flanagan and ten men to wait for me orourke and do you set out at once with the rest of the troop and take the cattle with you i shall overtake you before you have gone very far  orourkes crestfallen air stirred the sympathetic souzas pity  but captain he besought will you not allow the lieutenant  mr butler cut him short duty said he sententiously is duty be off orourke  and orourke clicking his heels viciously saluted and departed  came presently the bottles in a basketnot one as souza had said but three and when the first was done butler reflected that since orourke and the cattle were already well upon the road there need no longer be any hurry about his own departure a herd of bullocks does not travel very quickly and even with a few hours start in a fortymile journey is easily overtaken by a troop of horse travelling without encumbrance  you understand then how easily our lieutenant yielded himself to the luxurious circumstances and disposed himself to savour the second bottle of that nectar distilled from the very sunshine of the dourothe phrase is his own the steward produced a box of very choice cigars and although the lieutenant was not an habitual smoker he permitted himself on this exceptional occasion to be further tempted stretched in a deep chair beside the roaring fire of pine logs he sipped and smoked and drowsed away the greater par of that wintry afternoon soon the third bottle had gone the way of the second and mr bearsleys steward being a man of extremely temperate habit it follows that most of the wine had found its way down the lieutenants thirsty gullet  it was perhaps a more potent vintage than he had at first suspected and as the torpor produced by the dinner and the earlier fuller wine was wearing off it was succeeded by an exhilaration that played havoc with the few wits that mr butler could call his own  the steward was deeply learned in wines and wine growing and in very little besides consequently the talk was almost confined to that subject in its many branches and he could be interesting enough like all enthusiasts to a fresh burst of praise from butler of the ruby vintage to which he had been introduced the steward presently responded with a sigh  indeed as you say captain a great wine but we had a greater  impossible by god swore butler with a hiccup  you may say so but it is the truth we had a greater a wonderful clear vintage it was of the year 1798a famous year on the douro the quite most famous year that we have ever known mr bearsley sell some pipes to the monks at tavora who have bottle it and keep it i beg him at the time not to sell knowing the value it must come to have one day but he sell all the same ah meu deus the steward clasped his hands and raised rather prominent eyes to the ceiling protesting to his maker against his masters folly he say we have plenty and nowhe spread fat hands in a gesture of despairand now we have none some sons of dogs of french who came with marshal soult happen this way on a forage they discover the wine and they guzzle it like pigs he swore and his benignity was eclipsed by wrathful memory he heaved himself up in a passion  think of that so priceless vintage drink like hogwash as mr bearsley say by those goddammed french swine not a dropnot a spoonful remain but the monks at tavora still have much of what they buy i am told they treasure it for they know good wine all priests know good wine ah yes goddam he fell into deep reflection  lieutenant butler stirred and became sympathetic  san infernl shame said he indignantly ill no forgerrit when i meet the french then he too fell into reflection  he was a good catholic and moreover a catholic who did not take things for granted the sloth and selfindulgence of the clergy in portugal being his first glimpse of conventuals in latin countries had deeply shocked him the vows of a monastic poverty that was kept carefully beyond the walls of the monastery offended his sense of propriety that men who had vowed themselves to pauperism who wore coarse garments and went barefoot should batten upon rich food and store up wines that gold could not purchase struck him as a hideous incongruity  and the monks drink this nectar he said aloud and laughed sneeringly i know the breedthe fair found belly wi fat capon lined thas your poverty stricken capuchin  souza looked at him in sudden alarm bethinking himself that all englishmen were heretics and knowing nothing of subtle distinctions between english and irish in silence butler finished the third and last bottle and his thoughts fixed themselves with increasing insistence upon a wine reputed better than this of which there was great store in the cellars of the convent of tavora  abruptly he asked wheres tavora he was thinking perhaps of the comfort that such wine would bring to a company of warworn soldiers in the valley of the agueda  some ten leagues from here answered souza and pointed to a map that hung upon the wall  the lieutenant rose and rolled a thought unsteadily across the room he was a tall looselimbed fellow blueeyed faircomplexioned with a thatch of fiery red hair excellently suited to his temperament he halted before the map and with legs wide apart to afford him the steadying support of a broad basis he traced with his finger the course of the douro fumbled about the district of regoa and finally hit upon the place he sought  why he said seems to me sif we should ha come that way is shorrer road to pesqueira than by the river  as the bird fly said souza but the roads be badjust mule tracks while by the river the road is tolerable good  yet said the lieutenant i think i shall go back tha way  the fumes of the wine were mounting steadily to addle his indifferent brains every moment he was seeing things in proportions more and more false his resentment against priests who sworn to selfabnegation hoarded good wine whilst soldiers sent to keep harm from priests fat carcasses were left to suffer cold and even hunger was increasing with every moment he would sample that wine at tavora and he would bear some of it away that his brother officers at pinhel might sample it he would buy it oh yes there should be no plundering no irregularity no disregard of general orders he would buy the wine and pay for itbut himself he would fix the price and see that the monks of tavora made no profit out of their defenders  thus he thought as he considered the map presently when having taken leave of fernando souzathat prince of hostsmr butler was riding down through the town with sergeant flanagan and ten troopers at his heels his purpose deepened and became more fierce i think the change of temperature must have been to blame it was a chill bleak evening overhead across a background of faded blue scudded ragged banks of clouds the lingering flotsam of the shattered rainstorm of yesterday and a cavalry cloak afforded but indifferent protection against the wind that blew hard and sharp from the atlantic  coming from the genial warmth of mr souzas parlour into this the evaporation of the wine within him was quickened its fumes mounted now overwhelmingly to his brain and from comfortably intoxicated that he had been hitherto the lieutenant now became furiously drunk and the transition was a very rapid one it was now that he looked upon the business he had in hand in the light of a crusade a sort of religious fanaticism began to actuate him  the souls of these wretched monks must be saved the temptation to selfindulgence which spelt perdition for them must be removed from their midst it was a christian duty he no longer thought of buying the wine and paying for it his one aim now was to obtain possession of it not merely a part of it but all of itand carry it off thereby accomplishing two equally praiseworthy ends to rescue a conventful of monks from damnation and to regale the muchenduring halfstarved campaigners of the agueda  thus reasoned mr butler with admirable if drunken logic and reasoning thus he led the way over the bridge and kept straight on when he had crossed it much to the dismay of sergeant flanagan who perceiving the lieutenants condition conceived that he was missing his way this the sergeant ventured to point out reminding his officer that they had come by the road along the river  so we did said butler shortly bu we go back by way of tavora  they had no guide the one who had conducted them to regoa had returned with orourke and although souza had urged upon the lieutenant at parting that he should take one of the men from the quinta butler with wit enough to see that this was not desirable under the circumstances had preferred to find his way alone  his confused mind strove now to revisualise the map which he had consulted in souzas parlour he discovered naturally enough that the task was altogether beyond his powers meanwhile night was descending they were however upon the mule track which went up and round the shoulder of a hill and by this they came at dark upon a hamlet  sergeant flanagan was a shrewd fellow and perhaps the most sober man in the troopfor the wine had run very freely in souzas kitchen too and the men whilst awaiting their commanders pleasure had taken the fullest advantage of an opportunity that was all too rare upon that campaign now sergeant flanagan began to grow anxious he knew the peninsula from the days of sir john moore and he knew as much of the ways of the peasantry of portugal as any man he knew of the brutal ferocity of which that peasantry was capable he had seen evidence more than once of the unspeakable fate of french stragglers from the retreating army of marshal soult he knew of crucifixions mutilations and hideous abominations practised upon them in these remote hill districts by the merciless men into whose hands they happened to fall and he knew that it was not upon french soldiers alonethat these abominations had been practised some of those fierce peasants had been unable to discriminate between invader and deliverer to them a foreigner was a foreigner and no more others who were capable of discriminating were in the position of having come to look upon french and english with almost equal execration  it is true that whilst the emperors troops made war on the maxim that an army must support itself upon the country it traverses thereby achieving a greater mobility since it was thus permitted to travel comparatively light the british law was that all things requisitioned must be paid for wellington maintained this law in spite of all difficulties at all times with an unrelaxing rigidity and punished with the utmost vigour those who offended against it nevertheless breaches were continual men broke out here and there often be it said under stress of circumstances for which the portuguese were themselves responsible plunder and outrage took place and provoked indiscriminating rancour with consequences at times as terrible to stragglers from the british army of deliverance as to those from the french army of oppressors then too there was the portuguese militia act recently enforced by wellingtonacting through the portuguese governmentdeeply resented by the peasantry upon whom it bore and rendering them disposed to avenge it upon such stray british soldiers as might fall into their hands  knowing all this sergeant flanagan did not at all relish this night excursion into the hill fastnesses where at any moment as it seemed to him they might miss their way after all they were but twelve men all told and he accounted it a stupid thing to attempt to take a short cut across the hills for the purpose of overtaking an encumbered troop that must of necessity be moving at a very much slower pace this was the way not to overtake but to outdistance yet since it was not for him to remonstrate with the lieutenant he kept his peace and hoped anxiously for the best  at the mean wineshop of that hamlet mr butler inquired his way by the simple expedient of shouting tavora with a strong interrogative inflection the vintner made it plain by gesturesaccompanied by a rattling musketry of incomprehensible speech that their way lay straight ahead and straight ahead they went following that mule track for some five or six miles until it began to slope gently towards the plain again below them they presently beheld a cluster of twinkling lights to advertise a township they dropped swiftly down and in the outskirts overtook a belated bullockcart whose ungreased axle was arousing the hillside echoes with its plangent wail  of the vigorous young woman who marched barefoot beside it shouldering her goad as if it were a pikestaff mr butler inquiredby his usual methodif this were tavora to receive an answer which though voluble was unmistakably affirmative  covento dominicano was his next inquiry made after they had gone some little way  the woman pointed with her goad to a massive dark building flanked by a little church which stood just across the square they were entering  a moment later the sergeant by mr butlers orders was knocking upon the ironstudded main door they waited awhile in vain none came to answer the knock no light showed anywhere upon the dark face of the convent the sergeant knocked again more vigorously than before presently came timid shuffling steps a shutter opened in the door and the grille thus disclosed was pierced by a shaft of feeble yellow light a quavering aged voice demanded to know who knocked  english soldiers answered the lieutenant in portuguese open  a faint exclamation suggestive of dismay was the answer the shutter closed again with a snap the shuffling steps retreated and unbroken silence followed  now wharra devil may this mean growled mr butler drugged wits like stupid ones are readily suspicious wharra they hatching in here that they are afraid of lerring briish soldiers see knock again flanagan louder man  the sergeant beat the door with the butt of his carbine the blows gave out a hollow echo but evoked no more answer than if they had fallen upon the door of a mausoleum mr butler completely lost his temper seems to me that weve stumbled upon a hotbed o treason hotbed o treason he repeated as if pleased with the phrase thats wharrit is and he added peremptorily break down the door  but sir began the sergeant in protest greatly daring  break down the door repeated mr butler lerrus be after seeing wha these monks are afraid of showing us ive a notion theyre hiding moren their wine  some of the troopers carried axes precisely against such an emergency as this dismounting they fell upon the door with a will but the oak was stout fortified by bands of iron and great iron studs and it resisted long the thud of the axes and the crash of rending timbers could be heard from one end of tavora to the other yet from the convent it evoked no slightest response but presently as the door began to yield to the onslaught there came another sound to arouse the town from the belfry of the little church a bell suddenly gave tongue upon a frantic hurried note that spoke unmistakably of alarm dingdingdingding it went a tocsin summoning the assistance of all true sons of mother church  mr butler however paid little heed to it the door was down at last and followed by his troopers he rode under the massive gateway into the spacious close dismounting there and leaving the woefully anxious sergeant and a couple of men to guard the horses the lieutenant led the way along the cloisters faintly revealed by a newrisen moon towards a gaping doorway whence a feeble light was gleaming he stumbled over the step into a hall dimly lighted by a lantern swinging from the ceiling he found a chair mounted it and cut the lantern down then led the way again along an endless corridor stoneflagged and flanked on either side by rows of cells many of the doors stood open as if in silent token of the tenants hurried flight showing what a panic had been spread by the sudden advent of this troop  mr butler became more and more deeply intrigued more and more deeply suspicious that here all was not well why should a community of loyal monks take flight in this fashion from british soldiers  bad luck to them he growled as he stumbled on they may hide as they will but its myself ll run the shavelings to earth  they were brought up short at the end of that long chill gallery by closed double doors beyond these an organ was pealing and overhead the clapper of the alarm bell was beating more furiously than ever all realised that they stood upon the threshold of the chapel and that the conventuals had taken refuge there  mr butler checked upon a sudden suspicion maybe after all theyve taken us for french said he  a trooper ventured to answer him best let them see were not before we have the whole village about our ears  damn that bell said the lieutenant and added put your shoulders to the door  its fastenings were but crazy ones and it yielded almost instantly to their pressureyielded so suddenly that mr butler who himself had been foremost in straining against it shot forward halfadozen yards into the chapel and measured his length upon its cold flags  simultaneously from the chancel came a great cry libera nos domine followed by a shuddering murmur of prayer  the lieutenant picked himself up recovered the lantern that had rolled from his grasp and lurched forward round the angle that hid the chancel from his view there huddled before the main altar like a flock of scared and stupid sheep he beheld the conventualssome two score of them perhaps and in the dim light of the heavy altar lamp above them he could make out the black and white habit of the order of st dominic  he came to a halt raised his lantern aloft and called to them peremptorily  ho there  the organ ceased abruptly but the bell overhead went clattering on  mr butler addressed them in the best french he could command what do you fear why do you flee we are friendsenglish soldiers seeking quarters for the night  a vague alarm was stirring in him it began to penetrate his obfuscated mind that perhaps he had been rash that this forcible rape of a convent was a serious matter therefore he attempted this peaceful explanation  from that huddled group a figure rose and advanced with a solemn stately grace there was a faint swish of robes the faint rattle of rosary beads something about that figure caught the lieutenants attention sharply he craned forward half sobered by the sudden fear that clutched him his eyes bulging in his face  i had thought said a gentle melancholy womans voice that the seals of a nunnery were sacred to british soldiers  for a moment mr butler seemed to be labouring for breath fully sobered now understanding of his ghastly error reached him at the gallop  my god he gasped and incontinently turned to flee  but as he fled in horror of his sacrilege he still kept his head turned staring over his shoulder at the stately figure of the abbess either in fascination or with some lingering doubt of what he had seen and heard running thus he crashed headlong into a pillar and stunned by the blow he reeled and sank unconscious to the ground  this the troopers had not seen for they had not lingered understanding on their own part the horrible blunder they had turned even as their leader turned and they had raced madly back the way they had come conceiving that he followed and there was reason for their haste other than their anxiety to set a term to the sacrilege of their presence from the cloistered garden of the convent uproar reached them and the metallic voice of sergeant flanagan calling loudly for help  the alarm bell of the convent had done its work the villagers were up enraged by the outrage and armed with sticks and scythes and billhooks an army of them was charging to avenge this infamy the troopers reached the close no more than in time sergeant flanagan only half understanding the reason for so much anger but understanding that this anger was very real and very dangerous was desperately defending the horses with his two companions against the vanguard of the assailants there was a swift rush of the dragoons and in an instant they were in the saddle all but the lieutenant of whose absence they were suddenly made conscious flanagan would have gone back for him and he had in fact begun to issue an order with that object when a sudden surge of the swelling roaring crowd cut off the dragoons from the door through which they had emerged sitting their horses the little troop came together their sabres drawn solid as a rock in that angry human sea that surged about them the moon riding now clear overhead irradiated that scene of impending strife  flanagan standing in his stirrups attempted to harangue the mob but he was at a loss what to say that would appease them nor able to speak a language they could understand an angry peasant made a slash at him with a billhook he parried the blow on his sabre and with the flat of it knocked his assailant senseless  then the storm burst and the mob flung itself upon the dragoons  bad cess to you cried flanagan will ye listen to me ye murthering villains then in despair charrrge he roared and headed for the gateway  the troopers attempted in vain to reach it the mob hemmed them about too closely and then a horrid handtohand fight began under the cold light of the moon in that garden consecrated to peace and piety two saddles had been emptied and the exasperated troopers were slashing now at their assailants with the edge intent upon cutting a way out of that murderous press it is doubtful if a man of them would have survived for the odds were fully ten to one against them to their aid came now the abbess she stood on a balcony above and called upon the people to desist and hear her thence she harangued them for some moments commanding them to allow the soldiers to depart they obeyed with obvious reluctance and at last a lane was opened in that solid seething mass of angry clods  but flanagan hesitated to pass down this lane and so depart three of his troopers were down by now and his lieutenant was missing he was exercised to resolve where his duty lay behind him the mob was solid cutting off the dragoons from their fallen comrades an attempt to go back might be misunderstood and resisted leading to a renewal of the combat and surely in vain for he could not doubt but that the fallen troopers had been finished outright  similarly the mob stood as solid between him and the door that led to the interior of the convent where mr butler was lingering alive or dead a number of peasants had already invaded the actual building so that in that connection too the sergeant concluded that there was little reason to hope that the lieutenant should have escaped the fate his own rashness had invoked he had his remaining seven men to think of and he concluded that it was his duty under all the circumstances to bring these off alive and not procure their massacre by attempting fruitless quixotries  so forward roared the voice of sergeant flanagan and forward went the seven through the passage that had opened out before them in that hooting angry mob  beyond the convent walls they found fresh assailants awaiting them enemies these who had not been soothed by the gentle reassuring voice of the abbess but here there was more room to manoeuvre  trot the sergeant commanded and soon that trot became a gallop a shower of stones followed them as they thundered out of tavora and the sergeant himself had a lump as large as a duckegg on the middle of his head when next day he reported himself at pesqueira to cornet orourke whom he overtook there  when eventually sir robert craufurd heard the story of the affair he was as angry as only sir robert could be to have lost four dragoons and to have set a match to a train that might end in a conflagration was reason and to spare  how came such a mistake to be made he inquired a scowl upon his full red countenance  mr orourke had been investigating and was primed with knowledge  it appears sir that at tavora there is a convent of dominican nuns as well as a monastery of dominican friars mr butler will have used the word convento which more particularly applies to the nunnery and so he was directed to the wrong house  and you say the sergeant has reason to believe that mr butler did not survive his folly  i am afraid there can be no hope sir  its perhaps just as well said sir robert for lord wellington would certainly have had him shot  and there you have the true account of the stupid affair of tavora which was to produce as we shall see such farreaching effects upon persons nowise concerned in it     chapter ii the ultimatum   news of the affair at tavora reached sir terence omoy the adjutantgeneral at lisbon about a week later in dispatches from headquarters these informed him that in the course of the humble apology and explanation of the regrettable occurrence offered by the colonel of the 8th dragoons in person to the mother abbess it had transpired that lieutenant butler had left the convent alive but that nevertheless he continued absent from his regiment  those dispatches contained other unpleasant matters of a totally different nature with which sir terence must proceed to deal at once but their gravity was completely outweighed in the adjutants mind by this deplorable affair of lieutenant butlers without wishing to convey an impression that the blunt and downright omoy was gifted with any undue measure of shrewdness it must nevertheless be said that he was quick to perceive what fresh thorns the occurrence was likely to throw in a path that was already thorny enough in all conscience what a semblance of justification it must give to the hostility of the intriguers on the council of regency what a formidable weapon it must place in the hands of principal souza and his partisans in itself this was enough to trouble a man in omoys position but there was more lieutenant butler happened to be his brotherinlaw own brother to omoys lovely frivolous wife irresponsibility ran strongly in that branch of the butler family  for the sake of the young wife whom he loved with a passionate and fearful jealousy such as is not uncommon in a man of omoys temperament when at his agehe was approaching his fortysixth birthdayhe marries a girl of half his years the adjutant had pulled his brotherinlaw out of many a difficulty shielded him on many an occasion from the proper consequences of his incurable rashness  this affair of the convent however transcended anything that had gone before and proved altogether too much for omoy it angered him as much as it afflicted him yet when he took his head in his hands and groaned it was only his sorrow that he was expressing and it was a sorrow entirely concerned with his wife  the groan attracted the attention of his military secretary captain tremayne of fletchers engineers who sat at work at a littered writingtable placed in the window recess he looked up sharply sudden concern in the strong young face and the steady grey eyes he bent upon his chief the sight of omoys hunched attitude brought him instantly to his feet  whatever is the matter sir  its that damned fool richard growled omoy hes broken out again  the captain looked relieved and is that all  omoy looked at him whitefaced and in his blue eyes a blaze of that swift passion that had made his name a byword in the army  all he roared youll say its enough by god when you hear what the fools been at this time violation of a nunnery no less and he brought his massive fist down with a crash upon the document that had conveyed the information with a detachment of dragoons he broke into the convent of the dominican nuns at tavora one night a week ago the alarm bell was sounded and the village turned out to avenge the outrage consequences three troopers killed five peasants sabred to death and seven other casualties dick himself missing and reported to have escaped from the convent but understood to remain in hidingso that he adds desertion to the other crime as if that in itself were not enough to hang him thats all as you say and i hope you consider it enough even for dick butlerbad luck to him  my god said captain tremayne  im glad that you agree with me  captain tremayne stared at his chief the utmost dismay upon his fine young face but surely sir surelyi mean sir if this report is correct some explanation he broke down utterly at fault  to be sure theres an explanation you may always depend upon a most elegant explanation for anything that dick butler does his life is made up of mistakes and explanations he spoke bitterly he broke into the nunnery under a misapprehension according to the account of the sergeant who accompanied him and sir terence read out that part of the report but how is that to help him and at such a time as this with public feeling as it is and wellington in his present temper about it the provosts men are beating the country for the blackguard when they find him its a firing party hell have to face  tremayne turned slowly to the window and looked down the fair prospect of the hillside over a forest of cork oaks alive with fresh green shoots to the silver sheen of the river a mile away the storms of the preceding week had spent their furythe travail that had attended the birth of springand the day was as fair as a day of june in england weaned forth by the generous sunshine the burgeoning of vine and fig of olive and cork went on apace and the skeletons of trees which a fortnight since had stood gaunt and bare were already fleshed in tender green  from the window of this fine conventual house on the heights of monsanto above the suburb of alcantara where the adjutantgeneral had taken up his quarters captain tremayne stood a moment considering the panorama spread to his gaze from the redbrown roofs of lisbon on his leftthat city which boasted with rome that it was built upon a cluster of seven hillsto the lines of embarkation that were building about the fort of st julian on his left then he turned facing again the spacious handsome room with its heavy semiecclesiastical furniture and sir terence who hunched in his chair at the ponderously carved black writingtable scowled fiercely at nothing  what are you going to do sir he inquired  sir terence shrugged impatiently and heaved himself up in his chair  nothing he growled  nothing  the interrogation which seemed almost to cover a reproach irritated the adjutant  and what the devil can i do he rapped  youve pulled dick out of scrapes before now  i have that seems to have been my principal occupation ever since i married his sister but this time hes gone too far what can i do  lord wellington is fond of you suggested captain tremayne he was your imperturbable young man and he remained as calm now as omoy was excited although by some twenty years the adjutants junior there was between omoy and himself as well as between tremayne and the butler family with which he was remotely connected a strong friendship which was largely responsible for the captains present appointment as sir terences military secretary  omoy looked at him and looked away yes he agreed but hes still fonder of law and order and military discipline and i should only be imperilling our friendship by pleading with him for this young blackguard  the young blackguard is your brotherinlaw tremayne reminded him  bad luck to you tremayne dont i know it besides what is there i can do he asked again and ended testily faith man i dont know what youre thinking of  im thinking of una said captain tremayne in that composed way of his and the words fell like cold water upon the hot iron of omoys anger  the man who can receive with patience a reproach implicit or explicit of being wanting in consideration towards his wife is comparatively rare and never a man of omoys temperament and circumstances tremaynes reminder stung him sharply and the more sharply because of the strong friendship that existed between tremayne and lady omoy that friendship had in the past been a thorn in omoys flesh in the days of his courtship he had known a fierce jealousy of tremayne beholding in him for a time a rival who with the strong advantage of youth must in the end prevail but when omoy putting his fortunes to the test had declared himself and been accepted by una butler there had been an end to the jealousy and the old relations of cordial friendship between the men had been resumed  omoy had conceived that jealousy of his to have been slain but there had been times when from its faint uneasy stirrings he should have taken warning that it did no more than slumber like most warm hearted generous bignatured men omoy was of a singular humility where women were concerned and this humility of his would often breathe a doubt lest in choosing between himself and tremayne una might have been guided by her head rather than her heart by ambition rather than affection and that in taking himself she had taken the man who could give her by far the more assured and affluent position  he had crushed down such thoughts as disloyal to his young wife as ungrateful and unworthy and at such times he would fall into selfcontempt for having entertained them then una herself had revived those doubts three months ago when she had suggested that ned tremayne who was then at torres vedras with colonel fletcher was the very man to fill the vacant place of military secretary to the adjutant if he would accept it in the reaction of selfcontempt and in a curious surge of pride almost as perverse as his humility omoy had adopted her suggestion and thereafterin the pastthree months that is to saythe unreasonable devil of omoys jealousy had slept almost forgotten now by a chance remark whose indiscretion tremayne could not realise since he did not so much as suspect the existence of that devil he had suddenly prodded him into wakefulness that tremayne should show himself tender of lady omoys feelings in a matter in which omoy himself must seem neglectful of them was gall and wormwood to the adjutant he dissembled it however out of a natural disinclination to appear in the ridiculous role of the jealous husband  that he said is a matter that you may safely leave to me and his lips closed tightly upon the words when they were uttered  oh quite so said tremayne no whit abashed he persisted nevertheless you know unas feelings for dick  when i married una the adjutant cut in sharply i did not marry the entire butler family it hardened him unreasonably against dick to have the family cause pleaded in this way its sick to death i am of master richard and his escapades he can get himself out of this mess or he can stay in it  you mean that youll not lift a hand to help him  devil a finger said omoy  and tremayne looking straight into the adjutants faintly smouldering blue eyes beheld there a fierce and rancorous determination which he was at a loss to understand but which he attributed to something outside his own knowledge that must lie between omoy and his brotherinlaw  i am sorry he said gravely since that is how you feel it is to be hoped that dick butler may not survive to be taken the alternative would weigh so cruelly upon una that i do not care to contemplate it  and who the devil asks you to contemplate it snapped omoy i am not aware that it is any concern of yours at all  my dear omoy it was an exclamation of protest something between pain and indignation under the stress of which tremayne stepped entirely outside of the official relations that prevailed between himself and the adjutant and the exclamation was accompanied by such a look of dismay and wounded sensibilities that omoy meeting this and noting the honest manliness of tremaynes bearing and countenance was there and then the victim of reaction his warmhearted and impulsive nature made him at once profoundly ashamed of himself he stood up a tall martial figure and his ruggedly handsome shaven countenance reddened under its tan he held out a hand to tremayne  my dear boy i beg your pardon its so utterly annoyed i am that the savage in me will be breaking out sure it isnt as if it were only this affair of dicks that is almost the least part of the unpleasantness contained in this dispatch here in gods name read it for yourself and judge for yourself whether its in human nature to be patient under so much  with a shrug and a smile to show that he was entirely mollified captain tremayne took the papers to his desk and sat down to con them as he did so his face grew more and more grave before he had reached the end there was a tap at the door an orderly entered with the announcement that dom miguel forjas had just driven up to monsanto to wait upon the adjutantgeneral  ha said omoy shortly and exchanged a glance with his secretary show the gentleman up  as the orderly withdrew tremayne came over and placed the dispatch on the adjutants desk he arrives very opportunely he said  so opportunely as to be suspicious bedad said omoy he had brightened suddenly his irish blood quickening at the immediate prospect of strife which this visit boded may the devil admire me but theres a warm morning in store for mr forjas ned  shall i leave you  by no means  the door opened and the orderly admitted miguel forjas the portuguese secretary of state he was a slight dapper gentleman all in black from his silk stockings and steelbuckled shoes to his satin stock his keen aquiline face was swarthy and the razor had left his chin and cheeks blueblack his sleek hair was irongrey a portentous gravity invested him this morning as he bowed with profound deference first to the adjutant and then to the secretary  your excellencies he saidhe spoke an english that was smooth and fluent for all its foreign accent your excellencies this is a terrible affair  to what affair will your excellency be alluding wondered omoy  have you not received news of what has happened at tavora of the violation of a convent by a party of british soldiers of the fight that took place between these soldiers and the peasants who went to succour the nuns  oh and is that all said omoy for a moment i imagined your excellency referred to other matters i have news of more terrible affairs than the convent business with which to entertain you this morning  that if you will pardon me sir terence is quite impossible  you may think so but you shall judge bedad a chair dom miguel  the secretary of state sat down crossed his knees and placed his hat in his lap the other two resumed their seats omoy leaning forward his elbows on the writingtable immediately facing senhor forjas  first however he said to deal with this affair of tavora the council of regency will no doubt have been informed of all the circumstances you will be aware therefore that this very deplorable business was the result of a misapprehension and that the nuns of tavora might very well have avoided all this trouble had they behaved in a sensible reasonable manner if instead of shutting themselves up in the chapel and ringing the alarm bell the motherabbess or one of the sisters had gone to the wicket and answered the demand of admittance from the officer commanding the detachment he would instantly have realised his mistake and withdrawn  what does your excellency suggest was this mistake inquired the secretary  you have had your report sir and surely it was complete you must know that he conceived himself to be knocking at the gates of the monastery of the dominican fathers  can your excellency tell me what was this officers business at the monastery of the dominican fathers quoth the secretary his manner frostily hostile  i am without information on that point omoy admitted no doubt because the officer in question is missing as you will also have been informed but i have no reason to doubt that whatever his business may have been it was concerned with the interests which are common alike to the british and the portuguese nation  that is a charitable assumption sir terence  perhaps you will inform me dom miguel of the uncharitable assumption which the principal souza prefers snapped omoy whose temper began to simmer  a faint colour kindled in the cheeks of the portuguese minister but his manner remained unruffled  i speak sir not with the voice of principal souza but with that of the entire council of regency and the council has formed the opinion which your own words confirm that his excellency lord wellington is skilled in finding excuses for the misdemeanours of the troops under his command  that said omoy who would never have kept his temper in control but for the pleasant consciousness that he held a hand of trumps with which he would presently overwhelm this representative of the portuguese government that is an opinion for which the council may presently like to apologise admitting its entire falsehood  senhor forjas started as if he had been stung he uncrossed his black silk legs and made as if to rise  falsehood sir he cried in a scandalised voice  it is as well that we should be plain so as to be avoiding all misconceptions said omoy you must know sir and your council must know that wherever armies move there must be reason for complaint the british army does not claim in this respect to be superior to othersalthough i dont say mark me that it might not claim it with perfect justice but we do claim for ourselves that our laws against plunder and outrage are as strict as they well can be and that where these things take place punishment inevitably follows out of your own knowledge sir you must admit that what i say is true  true certainly where the offenders are men from the ranks but in this case where the offender is an officer it does not transpire that justice has been administered with the same impartial hand that sir answered omoy sharply testily is because he is missing  the secretarys thin lips permitted themselves to curve into the faintest ghost of a smile precisely he said  for answer omoy red in the face thrust forward the dispatch he had received relating to the affair  read sirread for yourself that you may report exactly to the council of regency the terms of the report that has just reached me from headquarters you will be able to announce that diligent search is being made for the offender  forjas perused the document carefully and returned it  that is very good he said and the council will be glad to hear of it it will enable us to appease the popular resentment in some degree but it does not say here that when taken this officer will not be excused upon the grounds which yourself you have urged to me  it does not but considering that he has since been guilty of desertion there can be no doubtall else apartthat the finding of a court martial will result in his being shot  very well said forjas i will accept your assurance and the council will be relieved to hear of it he rose to take his leave i am desired by the council to express to lord wellington the hope that he will take measures to preserve better order among his troops and to avoid the recurrence of such extremely painful incidents  a moment said omoy and rising waved his guest back into his chair then resumed his own seat under a more or less calm exterior he was a seething cauldron of passion the matter is not quite at an end as your excellency supposes from your last observation and from a variety of other evidence i infer that the council is far from satisfied with lord wellingtons conduct of the campaign  that is an inference which i cannot venture to contradict you will understand general that i do not speak for myself but for the council when i say that many of his measures seem to us not merely unnecessary but detrimental the power having been placed in the hands of lord wellington the council hardly feels itself able to interfere with his dispositions but it nevertheless deplores the destruction of the mills and the devastation of the country recommended and insisted upon by his lordship it feels that this is not warfare as the council understands warfare and the people share the feelings of the council it is felt that it would be worthier and more commendable if lord wellington were to measure himself in battle with the french making a definite attempt to stem the tide of invasion on the frontiers  quite so said omoy his hand clenching and unclenching and tremayne who watched him wondered how long it would be before the storm burst quite so and because the council disapproves of the very measures which at lord wellingtons instigation it has publicly recommended it does not trouble to see that those measures are carried out as you say it does not feel itself able to interfere with his dispositions but it does not scruple to mark its disapproval by passively hindering him at every turn magistrates are left to neglect these enactments and because he added with bitter sarcasm portuguese valour is so redhot and so devilish set on battle the militia acts calling all men to the colours are forgotten as soon as published there is no one either to compel the recalcitrant to take up arms or to punish the desertions of those who have been driven into taking them up yet you want battles you want your frontiers defended a moment sir there is no need for heat no need for any words the matter may be said to be at an end he smileda thought viciously be it confessedand then played his trump card hurled his bombshell since the views of your council are in such utter opposition to the views of the commanderinchief you will no doubt welcome lord wellingtons proposal to withdraw from this country and to advise his majestys government to withdraw the assistance which it is affording you  there followed a long spell of silence omoy sitting back in his chair his chin in his hand to observe the result of his words nor was he in the least disappointed dom miguels mouth fell open the colour slowly ebbed from his cheeks leaving them an ivoryyellow his eyes dilated and protruded he was consternation incarnate  my god he contrived to gasp at last and his shaking hands clutched at the carved arms of his chair  ye dont seem as pleased as i expected ventured omoy  but general surely surely his excellency cannot mean to take so so terrible a step  terrible to whom sir wondered omoy  terrible to us all forjas rose in his agitation he came to lean upon omoys writingtable facing the adjutant surely sir our interestsenglands interests and portugalsare one in this  to be sure but englands interests can be defended elsewhere than in portugal and it is lord wellingtons view that they shall be he has already warned the council of regency that since his majesty and the prince regent have entrusted him with the command of the british and portuguese armies he will not suffer the council or any of its members to interfere with his conduct of the military operations or suffer any criticism or suggestion of theirs to alter system formed upon mature consideration but when finding their criticisms fail the members of the council in their wrongheadedness in their anxiety to allow private interest to triumph over public duty go the length of thwarting the measures of which they do not approve the end of lord wellingtons patience has been reached i am giving your excellency his own words he feels that it is futile to remain in a country whose government is determined to undermine his every endeavour to bring this campaign to a successful issue  yourself sir you appear to be distressed but the council of regency will no doubt take a different view it will rejoice in the departure of a man whose military operations it finds so detestable you will no doubt discover this when you come to lay lord wellingtons decision before the council as i now invite you to do  bewildered and undecided forjas stood there for a moment vainly seeking words finally  is this really lord wellingtons last word he asked in tones of profoundest consternation  there is one alternativeone only said omoy slowly  and that instantly forjas was all eagerness  omoy considered him faith i hesitate to state it  no no please please  i feel that it is idle  let the council judge i implore you general let the council judge  very well omoy shrugged and took up a sheet of the dispatch which lay before him you will admit sir i think that the beginning of these troubles coincided with the advent of the principal souza upon the council of regency he waited in vain for a reply forjas the diplomat preserved an uncompromising silence in which presently omoy proceeded from this and from other evidence of which indeed there is no lack lord wellington has come to the conclusion that all the resistance passive and active which he has encountered results from the principal souzas influence upon the council you will not i think trouble to deny it sir  forjas spread his hands you will remember general he answered in tones of conciliatory regret that the principal souza represents a class upon whom lord wellingtons measures bear in a manner peculiarly hard  you mean that he represents the portuguese nobility and landed gentry who putting their own interests above those of the state have determined to oppose and resist the devastation of the country which lord wellington recommends  you put it very bluntly forjas admitted  you will find lord wellingtons own words even more blunt said omoy with a grim smile and turned to the dispatch he held let me read you exactly what he writes  as for principal souza i beg you to tell him from me that as i have had no satisfaction in transacting the business of this country since he has become a member of the government no power on earth shall induce me to remain in the peninsula if he is either to remain a member of the government or to continue in lisbon either he must quit the country or i will do so and this immediately after i have obtained his majestys permission to resign my charge  the adjutant put down the letter and looked expectantly at the secretary of state who returned the look with one of utter dismay never in all his career had the diplomat been so completely dumbfounded as he was now by the simple directness of the man of action in himself dom miguel forjas was both shrewd and honest he was shrewd enough to apprehend to the full the military genius of the british commanderinchief fruits of which he had already witnessed he knew that the withdrawal of junots army from lisbon two years ago resulted mainly from the operations of sir arthur wellesleyas he was thenbefore his supersession in the supreme command of that first expedition and he more than suspected that but for that supersession the defeat of the first french army of invasion might have been even more signal he had witnessed the masterly campaign of 1809 the battle of the douro and the relentless operations which had culminated in hurling the shattered fragments of soults magnificent army over the portuguese frontier thus liberating that country for the second time from the thrall of the mighty french invader and he knew that unless this man and the troops under his command remained in portugal and enjoyed complete liberty of action there could be no hope of stemming the third invasion for which massenathe ablest of all the emperors marshals was now gathering his divisions in the north if wellington were to execute his threat and withdraw with his army forjas beheld nothing but ruin for his country the irresistible french would sweep forward in devastating conquest and portuguese independence would be ground to dust under the heel of the terrible emperor  all this the clearsighted dom miguel forjas now perceived to do him full justice he had feared for some time that the unreasonable conduct of his government might ultimately bring about some such desperate situation but it was not for him to voice those fears he was the servant of that government the mere instrument and mouthpiece of the council of regency  this he said at length in a voice that was awed is an ultimatum  it is that omoy admitted readily  forjas sighed shook his dark head and drew himself up like a man who has chosen his part being shrewd he saw the immediate necessity of choosing and being honest he chose honestly  perhaps it is as well he said  that lord wellington should go cried omoy  that lord wellington should announce intentions of going forjas explained and having admitted so much he now stripped off the official mask completely he spoke with his own voice and not with that of the council whose mouthpiece he was of course it will never be permitted lord wellington has been entrusted with the defence of the country by the prince regent consequently it is the duty of every portuguese to ensure that at all costs he shall continue in that office  omoy was mystified only a knowledge of the ministers inmost thoughts could have explained this oddly sudden change of manner  but your excellency understands the termsthe only terms upon which his lordship will so continue  perfectly i shall hasten to convey those terms to the council it is also quite clearis it notthat i may convey to my government and indeed publish your complete assurance that the officer responsible for the raid on the convent at tavora will be shot when taken  looking intently into omoys face dom miguel saw the clear blue eyes flicker under his gaze he beheld a grey shadow slowly overspreading the adjutants ruddy cheek knowing nothing of the relationship between omoy and the offender unable to guess the sources of the hesitation of which he now beheld such unmistakable signs the minister naturally misunderstood it  there must be no flinching in this general he cried let me speak to you for a moment quite frankly and in confidence not as the secretary of state of the council of regency but as a portuguese patriot who places his country and his countrys welfare above every other consideration you have issued your ultimatum it may be harsh it may be arbitrary with that i have no concern the interests the feelings of principal souza or of any other individual however highplaced are without weight when the interests of the nation hang against them in the balance better that an injustice be done to one man than that the whole country should suffer therefore i do not argue with you upon the rights and wrongs of lord wellingtons ultimatum that is a matter apart lord wellington demands the removal of principal souza from the government or in the alternative proposes himself to withdraw from portugal in the national interest the government can come to only one decision i am frank with you general myself i shall stand ranged on the side of the national interest and what my influence in the council can do it shall do but if you know principal souza at all you must know that he will not relinquish his position without a fight he has friends and influencethe patriarch of lisbon and many of the nobility will be on his side i warn you solemnly against leaving any weapon in his hands  he paused impressively but omoy greyfaced now and haggard waited in silence for him to continue  from the message i brought you forjas resumed you will have perceived how principal souza has fastened upon this business at tavora to support his general censure of lord wellingtons conduct of the campaign that is the weapon to which my warning refers you mustif we who place the national interest supreme are to prevailyou must disarm him by the assurance that i ask for you will perceive that i am disloyal to a member of my council so that i may be loyal to my country but i repeat i speak to you in confidence this officer has committed a gross outrage which must bring the british army into odium with the people unless we have your assurance that the british army is the first to censure and to punish the offender with the utmost rigour give me now that i may publish everywhere your official assurance that this man will be shot and on my side i assure you that principal souza thus deprived of his stoutest weapon must succumb in the struggle that awaits us  i hope said omoy slowly his head bowed his voice dull and even unsteady i hope that i am not behind you in placing public duty above private consideration you may publish my official assurance that the officer in question will be shot when taken  general i thank you my country thanks you you may be confident of this issue he bowed gravely to omoy and then to tremayne your excellencies i have the honour to wish you goodday he was shown out by the orderly who had admitted him and he departed well satisfied in his patriotic heart that the crisis which he had always known to be inevitable should have been reached at last yet as he went he wondered why the adjutantgeneral had looked so downcast why his voice had broken when he pledged his word that justice should be done upon the offending british officer that however was no concern of dom miguels and there was more than enough to engage his thoughts when he came to consider the ultimatum to his government with which he was charged    chapter iii lady omoy   across the frontier in the northwest was gathering the third army of invasion some sixty thousand strong commanded by marshal massena prince of esslingen the most skilful and fortunate of all napoleons generals a leader who because he had never known defeat had come to be surnamed by his emperor the dear child of victory  wellington at the head of a british force of little more than one third of the french host watched and waited maturing his stupendous strategic plan which those in whose interests it had been conceived had done so much to thwart that plan was inspired by and based upon the emperors maxim that war should support itself that an army on the march must not be hampered and immobilised by its commissariat but that it must draw its supplies from the country it is invading that it must in short live upon that country  behind the british army and immediately to the north of lisbon in an arc some thirty miles long following the inflection of the hills from the sea at the mouth of the zizandre to the broad waters of the tagus at alhandra the lines of torres vedras were being constructed under the direction of colonel fletcher and this so secretly and with such careful measures as to remain unknown to british and portuguese alike even those employed upon the works knew of nothing save the section upon which they happened to be engaged and had no conception of the stupendous and impregnable whole that was preparing  to these lines it was the british commanders plan to effect a slow retreat before the french flood when it should sweep forward thus luring the enemy onward into a country which he had commanded should be laid relentlessly waste that there that enemy might fast be starved and afterwards destroyed to this end had his proclamations gone forth commanding that all the land lying between the rivers tagus and mondego in short the whole of the country between beira and torres vedras should be stripped naked converted into a desert as stark and empty as the sahara not a head of cattle not a grain of corn not a skin of wine not a flask of oil not a crumb of anything affording nourishment should be left behind the very mills were to be rendered useless bridges were to be broken down the houses emptied of all property which the refugees were to carry away with them from the line of invasion  such was his terrible demand upon the country for its own salvation but such as we have seen was not war as principal souza and some of his adherents understood it they had not the foresight to perceive the inevitable result of this strategic plan if effectively and thoroughly executed they did not even realise that the devastation had better be effected by the british in this defensiveand in its results at the same time overwhelmingly offensivemanner than by the french in the course of a conquering onslaught they did not realise these things partly because they did not enjoy wellingtons full confidence and in a greater measure because they were blinded by selfinterest because as omoy told forjas they placed private considerations above public duty the northern nobles whose lands must suffer opposed the measure violently they even opposed the withdrawal of labour from those lands which the militia act had rendered necessary and antonio de souza made himself their champion until he was broken by wellingtons ultimatum to the council for broken he was the nation had come to a parting of the ways it had been brought to the necessity of choosing and however much the principal voicing the outcry of his party might argue that the british plan was as detestable and ruinous as a french invasion the nation preferred to place its confidence in the conqueror of vimeiro and the douro  souza quitted the government and the capital as had been demanded but if wellington hoped that he would quit intriguing he misjudged his man he was a fellow of monstrous vanity pride and selfsufficiency of the sort than which there is none more dangerous to offend his wounded pride demanded a salve to be procured at any cost the wound had been administered by wellington and must be returned with interest so that he ruined wellington it mattered nothing to antonio de souza that he should ruin himself and his own country at the same time he was like some blinded ferocious and unreasoning beast ready even eager to sacrifice its own life so that in dying it can destroy its enemy and slake its bloodthirst  in that mood he passes out of the councils of the portuguese government into a brooding and secretly active retirement of which the fruits shall presently be shown with his departure the council of regency rudely shaken by the ultimatum which had driven him forth became more docile and active and for a season the measures enjoined by the commanderinchief were pursued with some show of earnestness  as a result of all this life at monsanto became easier and omoy was able to breathe more freely and to devote more of his time to matters concerning the fortifications which wellington had left largely in his charge then too as the weeks passed the shadow overhanging him with regard to richard butler gradually lifted no further word had there been of the missing lieutenant and by the end of may both omoy and tremayne had come to the conclusion that he must have fallen into the hands of some of the ferocious mountaineers to whom a soldierwhether his uniform were british or frenchwas a thing to be done to death  for his wifes sake omoy came thankfully to that conclusion under the circumstances it was the best possible termination to the episode she must be told of her brothers death presently when evidence of it was forthcoming she would mourn him passionately no doubt for her attachment to him was deepextraordinarily deep for so shallow a womanbut at least she would be spared the pain and shame she must inevitably have felt had he been taken and shot  meanwhile however the lack of news from him in another sense would have to be explained to una sooner or later for a fitful correspondence was maintained between brother and sisterand omoy dreaded the moment when this explanation must be made lacking invention he applied to tremayne for assistance and tremayne glumly supplied him with the necessary lie that should meet lady omoys inquiries when they came  in the end however he was spared the necessity of falsehood for the truth itself reached lady omoy in an unexpected manner it came about a month after that day when omoy had first received news of the escapade at tavora it was a resplendent morning of early june and the adjutant was detained a few moments from breakfast by the arrival of a mailbag from headquarters now established at vizeu leaving captain tremayne to deal with it sir terence went down to breakfast bearing with him only a few letters of a personal character which had reached him from friends on the frontier  the architecture of the house at monsanto was of a semiclaustral character three sides of it enclosed a sheltered luxuriant garden whilst on the fourth side a connecting corridor completing the quadrangle spanned bridgewise the spacious archway through which admittance was gained directly from the parklands that sloped gently to alcantara this archway closed at night by enormous wooden doors opened wide during the day upon a grassy terrace bounded by a baluster of white marble that gleamed now in the brilliant sunshine it was omoys practice to breakfast outofdoors in that genial climate and during april before the sun had reached its present intensity the table had been spread out there upon the terrace now however it was wiser even in the early morning to seek the shade and breakfast was served within the quadrangle under a trellis of vine supported in the portuguese manner by roughhewn granite columns it was a delicious spot cool and fragrant secluded without being enclosed since through the broad archway it commanded a view of the tagus and the hills of alemtejo  here omoy found himself impatiently awaited that morning by his wife and her cousin sylvia armytage more recently arrived from england  you are very late lady omoy greeted him petulantly since she spent her life in keeping other people waiting it naturally fretted her to discover unpunctuality in others  her portrait by raeburn which now adorns the national gallery had been painted in the previous year you will have seen it or at least you will have seen one of its numerous replicas and you will have remarked its singular delicate rosepetal lovelinessthe gleaming golden head the flawless outline of face and feature the immaculate skin the dark blue eyes with their look of innocence awakening  thus was she now in her artfully simple gown of flowered muslin with its white fichu folded across her neck that was but a shade less white thus was she just as raeburn had painted her saving of course that her expression matching her words was petulant  i was detained by the arrival of a mailbag from vizeu sir terence excused himself as he took the chair which mullins the elderly pontifical butler drew out for him ned is attending to it and will be kept for a few moments yet  lady omoys expression quickened are there no letters for me  none my dear i believe  no word from dick again there was that note of ever ready petulance it is too provoking he should know that he must make me anxious by his silence dick is so thoughtlessso careless of other peoples feelings i shall write to him severely  the adjutant paused in the act of unfolding his napkin the prepared explanation trembled on his lips but its falsehood repellent to him was not uttered  i should certainly do so my dear was all he said and addressed himself to his breakfast  what news from headquarters miss armytage asked him are things going well  much better now that principal souzas influence is at an end cotton reports that the destruction of the mills in the mondego valley is being carried out systematically  miss armytages dark thoughtful eyes became wistful  do you know terence she said that i am not without some sympathy for the portuguese resistance to lord wellingtons decrees they must bear so terribly hard upon the people to be compelled with their own hands to destroy their homes and lay waste the lands upon which they have labouredwhat could be more cruel  war can never be anything but cruel he answered gravely god help the people over whose lands it sweeps devastation is often the least of the horrors marching in its train  why must war be she asked him in intelligent rebellion against that most monstrous and infamous of all human madnesses  omoy proceeded to do his best to explain the unexplainable and since himself a professional soldier he could not take the sane view of his sane young questioner hot argument ensued between them to the infinite weariness of lady omoy who out of selfprotection gave herself to the study of the latest fashion plates from london and the consideration of a gown for the ball which the count of redondo was giving in the following week  it was thus in all things for these cousins represented the two poles of womanhood miss armytage without any of lady omoys insistent and excessive femininity was nevertheless feminine to the core but hers was the diana type of womanliness she was tall and of a cleanlimbed supple grace now emphasised by the ridinghabit which she was wearingfor she had been in the saddle during the hour which lady omoy had consecrated to the rites of toilet and devotions done before her mirror darkhaired darkeyed vivacity and intelligence lent her countenance an attraction very different from the allurement of her cousins delicate loveliness and because her countenance was a true mirror of her mind she argued shrewdly now so shrewdly that she drove omoy to entrench himself behind generalisations  my dear sylvia war is most merciful where it is most merciless he assured her with the irish gift for paradox at home in the government itself there are plenty who argue as you argue and who are wondering when we shall embark for england that is because they are intellectuals and war is a thing beyond the understanding of intellectuals it is not intellect but brute instinct and brute force that will help humanity in such a crisis as the present therefore let me tell you my child that a government of intellectual men is the worst possible government for a nation engaged in a war  this was far from satisfying miss armytage lord wellington himself was an intellectual she objected nobody could deny it there was the work he had done as irish secretary and there was the calculating genius he had displayed at vimeiro at oporto at talavera  and then observing her husband to be in distress lady omoy put down her fashion plate and brought up her heavy artillery to relieve him  sylvia dear she interpolated i wonder that you will for ever be arguing about things you dont understand  miss armytage laughed goodhumouredly she was not easily put out of countenance what woman doesnt she asked  i dont and i am a woman surely  ah but an exceptional woman her cousin rallied her affectionately tapping the shapely white arm that protruded from a foam of lace and lady omoy to whom words never had any but a literal meaning set herself to purr precisely as one would have expected complacently she discoursed upon the perfection of her own endowments appealing ever and anon to her husband for confirmation and omoy who loved her with all the passionate reverence which nature working inscrutably to her ends so often inspires in just such strong essentially masculine men for just such fragile and excessively feminine women afforded this confirmation with all the enthusiasm of sincere conviction  thus until mullins broke in upon them with the announcement of a visit from count samoval an announcement more welcome to lady omoy than to either of her companions  the portuguese nobleman was introduced he had attained to a degree of familiarity in the adjutants household that permitted of his being received without ceremony there at that breakfasttable spread in the open he was a slender handsome swarthy man of thirty scrupulously dressed as graceful and elegant in his movements as a fencing master which indeed he might have been for his skill with the foils was a matter of pride to himself and notoriety to all the world nor was it by any means the only skill he might have boasted for jeronymo de samoval was in many things a very subtle supple gentleman his friendship with the omoys now some three months old had been considerably strengthened of late by the fact that he had unexpectedly become one of the most hostile critics of the council of regency as lately constituted and one of the most ardent supporters of the wellingtonian policy  he bowed with supremest grace to the ladies ventured to kiss the fair smooth hand of his hostess undeterred by the frosty stare of omoys blue eyes whose approval of all men was in inverse proportion to their approval of his wifeand finally proffered her the armful of early roses that he brought  these poor roses of portugal to their sister from england said his softly caressing tenor voice  yere a poet said omoy tartly  having found castalia here said the count shall i not drink its limpid waters  not i hope while theres an agreeable vintage of port on the table a morning whet samoval omoy invited him taking up the decanter  two fingers thenno more it is not my custom in the morning but hereto drink your ladys health and yours miss armytage with a graceful flourish of his glass he pledged them both and sipped delicately then took the chair that omoy was proffering  good news i hear general antonio de souzas removal from the government is already bearing fruit the mills in the valley of the mondego are being effectively destroyed at last  yere very well informed grunted omoy who himself had but received the news as well informed indeed as i am myself there was a note almost of suspicion in the words and he was vexed that matters which it was desirable be kept screened as much as possible from general knowledge should so soon be put abroad  naturally and with reason was the answer delivered with a rueful smile am i not interested is not some of my property in question samoval sighed but i bow to the necessities of war at least it cannot be said of me as was said of those whose interests souza represented that i put private considerations above public dutythat is the phrase i think the individual must suffer that the nation may triumph a roman maxim my dear general  and a british one said omoy to whom britain was a second rome  oh admitted replied the amiable samoval you proved it by your uncompromising firmness in the affair of tavora  what was that inquired miss armytage  have you not heard cried samoval in astonishment  of course not snapped omoy who had broken into a cold perspiration hardly a subject for the ladies count  rebuked for his intention samoval submitted instantly  perhaps not perhaps not he agreed as if dismissing it whereupon omoy recovered from his momentary breathlessness but in your own interests my dear general i trust there will be no weakening when this lieutenant butler is caught and  who  sharp and stridently came that single word from her ladyship  desperately omoy sought to defend the breach  nothing to do with dick my dear a fellow named philip butler who  but the toowellinformed samoval corrected him not philip generalrichard butler i had the name but yesterday from forjas  in the scared hush that followed the count perceived that he had stumbled headlong into a mystery he saw lady omoys face turn whiter and whiter saw her sapphire eyes dilating as they regarded him  richard butler she echoed what of richard butler tell me tell me at once  hesitating before such signs of distress samoval looked at omoy to meet a dejected scowl  lady omoy turned to her husband what is it she demanded you know something about dick and you are keeping it from me dick is in trouble  he is omoy admitted in great trouble  what has he done you spoke of an affair at evora or tavora which is not to be mentioned before ladies i demand to know her affection and anxiety for her brother invested her for a moment with a certain dignity lent her a force that was but rarely displayed by her  seeing the men stricken speechless samoval from bewildered astonishment omoy from distress she jumped to the conclusion after what had been said that motives of modesty accounted for their silence  leave us sylvia please she said forgive me dear but you see they will not mention these things while you are present she made a piteous little figure as she stood trembling there her fingers tearing in agitation at one of samovals roses  she waited until the obedient and discreet miss armytage had passed from view into the wing that contained the adjutants private quarters then sinking limp and nerveless to her chair  now she bade them please tell me  and omoy with a sigh of regret for the lie so laboriously concocted which would never now be uttered delivered himself huskily of the hideous truth     chapter iv count samoval   miss armytages own notions of what might be fit and proper for her virginal ears were by no means coincident with lady omoys thus although you have seen her pass into the private quarters of the adjutants establishment and although in fact she did withdraw to her own room she found it impossible to abide there a prey to doubt and misgivings as to what dick butler might have donedoubt and misgivings be it understood entertained purely on unas account and not at all on dicks  by the corridor spanning the archway on the southern side of the quadrangle and serving as a connecting bridge between the adjutants private and official quarters miss armytage took her way to sir terences workroom knowing that she would find captain tremayne there and assuming that he would be alone  may i come in she asked him from the doorway  he sprang to his feet why certainly miss armytage for so imperturbable a young man he seemed oddly breathless in his eagerness to welcome her are you looking for omoy he left me nearly halfanhour ago to go to breakfast and i was just about to follow  i scarcely dare detain you then  on the contrary i mean not at all but were you wanting me  she closed the door and came forward into the room moving with that supple grace peculiarly her own  i want you to tell me something captain tremayne and i want you to be frank with me  i hope i could never be anything else  i want you to treat me as you would treat a man a friend of your own sex  tremayne sighed he had recovered from the surprise of her coming and was again his imperturbable self  i assure you that is the last way in which i desire to treat you but if you insist  i do she had frowned slightly at the earlier part of his speech with its subtle halfjesting gallantry and she spoke sharply now  i bow to your will said captain tremayne  what has dick butler been doing  he looked into her face with sharply questioning eyes  what was it that happened at tavora  he continued to look at her what have you heard he asked at last  only that he has done something at tavora for which the consequences i gather may be grave i am anxious for unas sake to know what it is  does una know  she is being told now count samoval let slip just what i have outlined and she has insisted upon being told everything  then why did you not remain to hear  because they sent me away on the plea thatoh on the silly plea of my youth and innocence which were not to be offended  but which you expect me to offend  no because i can trust you to tell me without offending  sylvia it was a curious exclamation of satisfaction and of gratitude for the implied confidence we must admit that it betrayed a selfish forgetfulness of dick butler and his troubles but it is by no means clear that it was upon such grounds that it offended her  she stiffened perceptibly really captain tremayne  i beg your pardon said he but you seemed to imply he checked at a loss  her colour rose well sir what do you suggest that i implied or seemed to imply but as suddenly her manner changed i think we are too concerned with trifles where the matter on which i have sought you is a serious one  it is of the utmost seriousness he admitted gravely  wont you tell me what it is  he told her quite simply the whole story not forgetting to give prominence to the circumstances extenuating it in butlers favour she listened with a deepening frown rather pale her head bowed  and when he is taken she asked whatwhat will happen to him  let us hope that he will not be taken  but if he isif he is she insisted almost impatiently  captain tremayne turned aside and looked out of the window i should welcome the news that he is dead he said softly for if he is taken he will find no mercy at the hands of his own people  you mean that he will be shot horror charged her voice dilated her eyes  inevitably  a shudder ran through her and she covered her face with her hands when she withdrew then tremayne beheld the lovely countenance transformed it was white and drawn  but surely terence can save him she cried piteously  he shook his head his lips tight pressed there is no man less able to do so  what do you mean why do you say that  he looked at her hesitating for a moment then answered her omoy has pledged his word to the portuguese government that dick butler shall be shot when taken  terence did that  he was compelled to it honour and duty demanded no less of him i alone who was present and witnessed the undertaking know what it cost him and what he suffered but he was forced to sink all private considerations it was a sacrifice rendered necessary inevitable for the success of this campaign and he proceeded to explain to her all the circumstances that were interwoven with lieutenant butlers illtimed offence thus you see that from terence you can hope for nothing his honour will not admit of his wavering in this matter  honour she uttered the word almost with contempt and what of una  i was thinking of una when i said i should welcome the news of dicks death somewhere in the hills it is the best that can be hoped for  i thought you were dicks friend captain tremayne  why so i have been so i am perhaps that is another reason why i should hope that he is dead  is it no reason why you should do what you can to save him  he looked at her steadily for an instant calm under the reproach of her eyes  believe me miss armytage if i saw a way to save him to do anything to help him i should seize it both for the sake of my friendship for himself and because of my affection for una since you yourself are interested in him that is an added reason for me but it is one thing to admit willingness to help and another thing actually to afford help what is there that i can do i assure you that i have thought of the matter indeed for days i have thought of little else but i can see no light i await events perhaps a chance may come  her expression had softened i see she put out a hand generously to ask forgiveness i was presumptuous and i had no right to speak as i did  he took the hand i should never question your right to speak to me in any way that seemed good to you he assured her  i had better go to una she will be needing me poor child i am grateful to you captain tremayne for your confidence and for telling me and thus she left him very thoughtful as concerned for una as she was herself  now una omoy was the natural product of such treatment there had ever been something so appealing in her lovely helplessness and fragility that all her life others had been concerned to shelter her from every wind that blew because it was so she was what she was and because she was what she was it would continue to be so  but lady omoy at the moment did not stand in such urgent need of miss armytage as miss armytage imagined she had heard the appalling story of her brothers escapade but she had been unable to perceive in what it was so terrible as it was declared he had made a mistake he had invaded the convent under a misapprehension for which it was ridiculous to blame him it was a mistake which any man might have made in a foreign country lives had been lost it is true but that was owing to the stupidity of other peopleof the nuns who had run for shelter when no danger threatened save in their own silly imaginations and of the peasants who had come blundering to their assistance where no assistance was required the latter were the people responsible for the bloodshed since they had attacked the dragoons could it be expected of the dragoons that they should tamely suffer themselves to be massacred  thus lady omoy upon the affair of tavora the whole thing appeared to her to be rather silly and she refused seriously to consider that it could have any grave consequences for dick his continued absence made her anxious but if he should come to be taken surely his punishment would be merely a formal matter at the worst he might be sent home which would be a very good thing for after all the climate of the peninsula had never quite suited him  in this fashion she nimbly pursued a train of vitiated logic passing from inconsequence to inconsequence and omoy thankful that she should take such a view as thismercifully hopeful that the last had been heard of his peccant and vexatious brotherinlawcontent more than content to leave her comforted such illusions  and then while she was still discussing the matter in terms of comparative calm came an orderly to summon him away so that he left her in the company of samoval  the count had been deeply shocked by the discovery that dick butler was lady omoys brother and a little confused that he himself in his ignorance should have been the means of bringing to her knowledge a painful matter that touched her so closely and that hitherto had been so carefully concealed from her by her husband he was thankful that she should take so optimistic a view and quick to perceive omoys charitable desire to leave her optimism undispelled but he was no less quick to perceive the opportunities which the circumstances afforded him to further a certain deep intrigue upon which he was engaged  therefore he did not take his leave just yet he sauntered with lady omoy on the terrace above the wooded slopes that screened the village of alcantara and there discovered her mind to be even more frivolous and unstable than his perspicuity had hitherto suspected under stress lady omoy could convey the sense that she felt deeply she could be almost theatrical in her displays of emotion but these were as transient as they were intense nothing that was not immediately present to her senses was ever capable of a deep impression upon her spirit and she had the facility characteristic of the selfloving and selfindulgent of putting aside any matter that was unpleasant thus easily selfpersuaded as we have seen that this escapade of richards was not to be regarded too seriously and that its consequences were not likely to be grave she chattered with gay inconsequence of other thingsof the dinnerparty last week at the house of the marquis of minas that prominent member of the council of regency of the forthcoming ball to be given by the count of redondo of the latest news from home the latest fashion and the latest scandal the amours of the duke of york and the shortcomings of mr perceval  samoval however did not intend that the matter of her brother should be so entirely forgotten so lightly treated deliberately at last he revived it  considering her as she leant upon the granite balustrade her pink sunshade aslant over her shoulder her flimsy lace shawl festooned from the crook of either arm and floating behind her a wisp of cloudy vapour samoval permitted himself a sigh  she flashed him a sidelong glance arch and rallying  you are melancholy sira poor compliment she told him  but do not misunderstand her hers was an almost childish coquetry inevitable fruit of her intense femininity craving ever the worship of the sterner sex and the incense of its flattery and samoval after all young noble handsome with a halfsinister reputation was something of a figure of romance as a good many women had discovered to their cost  he fingered his snowy stock and bent upon her eyes of glowing adoration dear lady omoy his tenor voice was soft and soothing as a caress i sigh to think that one so adorable so entirely made for lifes sunshine and gladness should have cause for a moments uneasiness perhaps for secret grief at the thought of the peril of her brother  her glance clouded under this reminder then she pouted and made a little gesture of impatience dick is not in peril she answered he is foolish to remain so long in hiding and of course he will have to face unpleasantness when he is found but to say that he is in peril is just nonsense terence said nothing of peril he agreed with me that dick will probably be sent home surely you dont think  no no he looked down studying his hessians for a moment then his dark eyes returned to meet her own i shall see to it that he is in no danger you may depend upon me who ask but the happy chance to serve you should there be any trouble let me know at once and i will see to it that all is well your brother must not suffer since he is your brother he is very blessed and enviable in that  she stared at him her brows knitting but i dont understand  is it not plain whatever happens you must not suffer lady omoy no man of feeling and i least of any could endure it and since if your brother were to suffer that must bring suffering to you you may count upon me to shield him  you are very good count but shield him from what  from whatever may threaten the portuguese government may demand in selfprotection to appease the clamour of the people stupidly outraged by this affair that an example shall be made of the offender  oh but how could they with what reason she displayed a vague alarm and a less vague impatience of such hypotheses  he shrugged the people are like thata fierce vengeful god to whom appeasing sacrifices must be offered from time to time if the people demand a scapegoat governments usually provide one but be comforted in his eagerness of reassurance he caught her delicate mittened hand in his own and her anxiety rendering her heedless she allowed it to lie there gently imprisoned be comforted i shall be here to guard him there is much that i can do and you may depend upon me to do itfor your sake dear lady the government will listen to me i would not have you imagine me capable of boasting i have influence with the government that is all and i give you my word that so far as the portuguese government is concerned your brother shall take no harm  she looked at him for a long moment with moist eyes moved and flattered by his earnestness and intensity of homage i take this very kindly in you sir i have no thanks that are worthy she said her voice trembling a little i have no means of repaying you you have made me very happy count  he bent low over the frail hand he was holding  your assurance that i have made you happy repays me very fully since your happiness is my tenderest concern believe me dear lady you may ever count jeronymo de samoval your most devoted and obedient slave  he bore the hand to his lips and held it to them for a long moment whilst with heightened colour and eyes that sparkled more be it confessed from excitement than from gratitude she stood passively considering his bowed dark head  as he came erect again a movement under the archway caught his eye and turning he found himself confronting sir terence and miss armytage who were approaching if it vexed him to have been caught by a husband notoriously jealous in an attitude not altogether uncompromising samoval betrayed no sign of it  with smooth selfpossession he hailed omoy  general you come in time to enable me to take my leave of you i was on the point of going  so i perceived said omoy tartly he had almost said so i had hoped  his frosty manner would have imposed constraint upon any man less master of himself than samoval but the count ignored it and ignoring it delayed a moment to exchange amiabilities politely with miss armytage before taking at last an unhurried and unperturbed departure  but no sooner was he gone than omoy expressed himself full frankly to his wife  i think samoval is becoming too attentive and too assiduous  he is a dear said lady omoy  that is what i mean replied sir terence grimly  he has undertaken that if there should be any trouble with the portuguese government about dicks silly affair he will put it right  oh said omoy that was it and out of his tender consideration for her said no more  but sylvia armytage knowing what she knew from captain tremayne was not content to leave the matter there she reverted to it presently as she was going indoors alone with her cousin  una she said gently i should not place too much faith in count samoval and his promises  what do you mean lady omoy was never very tolerant of advice especially from an inexperienced young girl  i do not altogether trust him nor does terence  pooh terence mistrusts every man who looks at me my dear never marry a jealous man she added with her inevitable inconsequence  he is the last manthe count i meanto whom in your place i should go for assistance if there is trouble about dick she was thinking of what tremayne had told her of the attitude of the portuguese government and her clearsighted mind perceived an obvious peril in permitting count samoval to become aware of dicks whereabouts should they ever be discovered  what nonsense sylvia you conceive the oddest and most foolish notions sometimes but of course you have no experience of the world and beyond that she refused to discuss the matter nor did the wise sylvia insist     chapter v the fugitive   although dick butler might continue missing in the flesh in the spirit he and his miserable affair seem to have been ever present and ubiquitous and a most fruitful source of trouble  it would be at about this time that there befell in lisbon the deplorable event that nipped in the bud the career of that most promising young officer major berkeley of the famous diehards the 29th foot  coming into lisbon on leave from his regiment which was stationed at abrantes and formed part of the division under sir rowland hill the major happened into a company that contained at least one member who was hostile to lord wellingtons conduct of the campaign or rather to the measures which it entailed as in the case of the principal souza prejudice drove him to take up any weapon that came to his hand by means of which he could strike a blow at a system he deplored  since we are concerned only indirectly with the affair it may be stated very briefly the young gentleman in question was a portuguese officer and a nephew of the patriarch of lisbon and the particular criticism to which major berkeley took such just exception concerned the very troublesome dick butler our patrician ventured to comment with sneers and innuendoes upon the fact that the lieutenant of dragoons continued missing and he went so far as to indulge in a sarcastic prophecy that he never would be found  major berkeley stung by the slur thus slyly cast upon british honour invited the young gentleman to make himself more explicit  i had thought that i was explicit enough says young impudence leering at the stalwart redcoat but if you want it more clearly still then i mean that the undertaking to punish this ravisher of nunneries is one that you english have never intended to carry out to save your faces you will take good care that lieutenant butler is never found indeed i doubt if he was ever really missing  major berkeley was quite uncompromising and downright i am afraid he had none of the graces that can exalt one of these affairs  yere just a very foolish liar sir and you deserve a good caning was all he said but the way in which he took his cane from under his arm was so suggestive of more to follow there and then that several of the company laid preventive hands upon him instantly  the patriarchs nephew very white and very fierce to hear himself addressed in terms whichout of respect for his august and powerful unclehad never been used to him before demanded instant satisfaction he got it next morning in the shape of halfanounce of lead through his foolish brain and a terrible uproar ensued to appease it a scapegoat was necessary as samoval so truly said the mob is a ferocious god to whom sacrifices must be made in this instance the sacrifice of course was major berkeley he was broken and sent home to cut his pigtail the adornment still clung to by the 29th and retire into private life whereby the british army was deprived of an officer of singularly brilliant promise thus you see the score against poor richard butlerthat foolish victim of wine and circumstancewent on increasing  but in my haste to usher major berkeley out of a narrative which he touches merely at a tangent i am guilty of violating the chronological order of the events the ship in which major berkeley went home to england and the rural life was the frigate telemachus and the telemachus had but dropped anchor in the tagus at the date with which i am immediately concerned she came with certain stores and a heavy load of mails for the troops and it would be a full fortnight before she would sail again for home her officers would be ashore during the time the welcome guests of the officers of the garrison bearing their share in the gaieties with which the latter strove to kill the time of waiting for events and marcus glennie the captain of the frigate an old friend of tremaynes was by virtue of that friendship an almost daily visitor at the adjutants quarters  but there again i am anticipating the telemachus came to her moorings in the tagus at which for the present we may leave her on the morning of the day that was to close with count redondos semiofficial ball lady omoy had risen late taking from one end of the day what she must relinquish to the other that thus fully rested she might look her best that night the greater part of the afternoon was devoted to preparation it was amazing even to herself what an amount of detail there was to be considered and from sylvia she received but very indifferent assistance there were times when she regretfully suspected in sylvia a lack of proper womanliness a taint almost of masculinity there was to lady omoys mind something very wrong about a woman who preferred a canter to a waltz it was unnatural it was suspicious she was not quite sure that it wasnt vaguely immoral  at last there had been dinnerto which she came a full halfhour late but of so ravishing and angelic an appearance that the sight of her was sufficient to mollify sir terences impatience and stifle the withering sarcasms he had been laboriously preparing after dinnerwhich was taken at six oclockthere was still an hour to spare before the carriage would come to take them into lisbon  sir terence pleaded stress of work occasioned by the arrival of the telemachus that morning and withdrew with tremayne to the official quarters to spend that hour in disposing of some of the many matters awaiting his attention sylvia who to lady omoys exasperation seemed now for the first time to give a thought to what she should wear that night went off in haste to gown herself and so lady omoy was left to her own resourceswhich i assure you were few indeed  the evening being calm and warm she sauntered out into the open she was more or less annoyed with everybodywith sir terence and tremayne for their assiduity to duty and with sylvia for postponing all thought of dressing until this eleventh hour when she might have been better employed in beguiling her ladyships loneliness in this petulant mood lady omoy crossed the quadrangle loitered a moment by the table and chairs placed under the trellis and considered sitting there to await the others finally however attracted by the glory of the sunset behind the hills towards abrantes she sauntered out on to the terrace to the intense thankfulness of a poor wretch who had waited there for the past ten hours in the almost despairing hope that precisely such a thing might happen  she was leaning upon the balustrade when a rustle in the pines below drew her attention the rustle worked swiftly upwards and round to the bushes on her right and her eyes faintly startled followed its career what time she stood tense and vaguely frightened  then the bushes parted and a limping figure that leaned heavily upon a stick disclosed itself a shaggy redbearded man in the garb of a peasant and marvel of marvelsthis figure spoke her name sharply warningly almost before she had time to think of screaming  una una dont move  the voice was certainly the voice of mr butler but how came that voice into the body of this peasant terrified with drumming pulses yet obedient to the injunction she remained without speech or movement whilst crouching so as to keep below the level of the balustrade the man crept forward until he was immediately before and below her  she stared into that haggard face and through the halfmask of stubbly beard gradually made out the features of her brother  richard the name broke from her in a scream  sh he waved his hands in wild alarm to repress her for gods sake be quiet its a ruined man i am if they find me here youll have heard whats happened to me  she nodded and uttered a halfstrangled yes  is there anywhere you can hide me can you get me into the house without being seen i am almost starving and my leg is on fire i was wounded three days ago to make matters worse than they were already i have been lying in the woods there watching for the chance to find you alone since sunrise this morning and its devil a bite or sup ive had since this time yesterday  poor poor richard she leaned down towards him in an attitude of compassionate ministering grace but why why did you not come up to the house and ask for me no one would have recognised you  terence would if he had seen me  but terence wouldnt have mattered terence will help you  terence he almost laughed from excess of bitterness labouring under an egotistical sense of wrong hes the last man i should wish to meet as i have good reason to know if it hadnt been for that i should have come to you a month agoimmediately after this trouble of mine as it is i kept away until despair left me no other choice una on no account a word of my presence to terence  but hes my husband  sure and hes also adjutantgeneral and if i know him at all hes the very man to place official duty and honour and all the rest of it above family considerations  oh richard how little you know terence how wrong you are to misjudge him like this  right or wrong id prefer not to take the risk it might end in my being shot one fine morning before long  richard  for gods sake less of your richard its all the world will be hearing you can you hide me do you think for a day or two if you cant ill be after shifting for myself as best i can ive been playing the part of an english overseer from bearsleys wine farm and it has brought me all the way from the douro in safety but the strain of it and the eternal fear of discovery are beginning to break me and now theres this infernal wound i was assaulted by a footpad near abrantes as if i was worth robbing anyhow i gave the fellow more than i took unless i have rest i think i shall go mad and give myself up to the provostmarshal to be shot and done with  why do you talk of being shot you have done nothing to deserve that why should you fear it  now mr butler was awarehaving gathered the information lately on his travelsof the undertaking given by the british to the council of regency with regard to himself but irresponsible egotist though he might be yet in common with others he was actuated by the desire which his sisters fragile loveliness inspired in every one to spare her unnecessary pain or anxiety  its not myself will take any risks he said again we are at war and when men are at war killing becomes a sort of habit and one life more or less is neither here nor there and upon that he renewed his plea that she should hide him if she could and that on no account should she tell a single souland sir terence least of anyof his presence  having driven him to the verge of frenzy by the waste of precious moments in vain argument she gave him at last the promise he required go back to the bushes there she bade him and wait until i come for you i will make sure that the coast is clear  contiguous to her dressingroom which overlooked the quadrangle there was a small alcove which had been converted into a storeroom for the array of trunks and dress boxes that lady omoy had brought from england a door opening directly from her dressing room communicated with this alcove and of that door bridget her maid was in possession of the key  as she hurried now indoors she happened to meet bridget on the stairs the maid announced herself on her way to supper in the servants quarters and apologised for her presumption in assuming that her ladyship would no further require her services that evening but since it fell in so admirably with her ladyships own wishes she insisted with quite unusual solicitude with vehemence almost that bridget should proceed upon her way  just give me the key of the alcove she said there are one or two things i want to get  cant i get them your ladyship  thank you bridget i prefer to get them myself  there was no more to be said bridget produced a bunch of keys which she surrendered to her mistress having picked out for her the one required  lady omoy went up to come down again the moment that bridget had disappeared the quadrangle was deserted the household disposed of and it wanted yet halfanhour to the time for which the carriage was ordered no moment could have been more propitious but in any case no concealment was attemptedsince if detected it must have provoked suspicions hardly likely to be aroused in any other way  when lady omoy returned indoors in the gathering dusk she was followed at a respectful distance by the limping fugitive who might had he been seen have been supposed some messenger or perhaps some person employed about the house or gardens coming to her ladyship for instructions no one saw them however and they gained the dressingroom and thence the alcove in complete safety  there whilst richard allowing his exhaustion at last to conquer him sank heavily down upon one of his sisters many trunks recking nothing of the havoc wrought in its priceless contents her ladyship all atremble collapsed limply upon another  but there was no rest for her richards wound required attention and he was faint for want of meat and drink so having procured him the wherewithal to wash and dress his hurta nasty knifeslash which had penetrated to the bone of his thigh the very sight of which turned her ladyship sick and faintshe went to forage for him in a haste increased by the fact that time was growing short  on the diningroom sideboard from the remains of dinner she found and furtively abstracted what she neededbest part of a roast chicken a small loaf and a halfflask of collares mullins the butler would no doubt be exercised presently when he discovered the abstraction let him blame one of the footmen sir terences orderly or the cat it mattered nothing to lady omoy  having devoured the food and consumed the wine richards exhaustion assumed the form of a lethargic torpor to sleep was now his overmastering desire she fetched him rugs and pillows and he made himself a couch upon the floor she had demurred of course when he himself had suggested this she could not conceive of any one sleeping anywhere but in a bed but dick made short work of that illusion  havent i been in hiding for the last six weeks he asked her and havent i been thankful to sleep in a ditch and wasnt i campaigning before that i tell you i couldnt sleep in a bed its a habit ive lost entirely  convinced she gave way  well talk tomorrow una he promised her as he stretched himself luxuriously upon that hard couch but meanwhile on your life not a word to any one you understand  of course i understand my poor dick  she stooped to kiss him but he was fast asleep already  she went out and locked the door and when on the point of setting out for count redondos she returned the bunch of keys to bridget the key of the alcove was missing  i shall require it again in the morning bridget she explained lightly and then added kindly as it seemed dont wait for me child get to bed i shall be late in coming home and i shall not want you     chapter vi miss armytages pearls   lady omoy and miss armytage drove alone together into lisbon the adjutant still occupied would follow as soon as he possibly could whilst captain tremayne would go on directly from the lodgings which he shared in alcantara with major carruthersalso of the adjutants staffwhither he had ridden to dress some twenty minutes earlier  are you ill una had been sylvias concerned greeting of her cousin when she came within the range of the carriage lamps you are pale as a ghost to this her ladyship had replied mechanically that a slight headache troubled her  but now that they sat side by side in the well upholstered carriage miss armytage became aware that her companion was trembling  una dear whatever is the matter  had it not been for the dominant fear that the shedding of tears would render her countenance unsightly lady omoy would have yielded to her feelings and wept heroically in the cause of her own flawless beauty she conquered the almost overmastering inclination  ii have been so troubled about richard she faltered it is preying upon my mind  poor dear in sheer motherliness miss armytage put an arm about her cousin and drew her close we must hope for the best  now if you have understood anything of the character of lady omoy you will have understood that the burden of a secret was the last burden that such a nature was capable of carrying it was because dick was fully aware of this that he had so emphatically and repeatedly impressed upon her the necessity for saying not a word to any one of his presence she realised in her vague wayor rather she believed it since he had assured herthat there would be grave danger to him if he were discovered but discovery was one thing and the sharing of a confidence as to his presence another that confidence must certainly be shared  lady omoy was in an emotional maelstrom that swept her towards a cataract the cataract might inspire her with dread standing as it did for death and disaster but the maelstrom was not to be resisted she was helpless in it unequal to breasting such strong waters she who in all her futile charming life had been borne snugly in safe crafts that were steered by others  remained but to choose her confidant nature suggested terence but it was against terence in particular that she had been warned circumstance now offered sylvia armytage but pride or vanity if you prefer it denied her here sylvia was an inexperienced young girl as she herself had so often found occasion to remind her cousin moreover she fostered the fond illusion that sylvia looked to her for precept that upon sylvias life she exercised a precious guiding influence how then should the supporting lean upon the supported yet since she must there and then lean upon something or succumb instantly and completely she chose a middle course a sort of temporary assistance  i have been imagining things she said it may be a premonition i dont know do you believe in premonitions sylvia  sometimes sylvia humoured her  i have been imagining that if dick is hiding a fugitive he might naturally come to me for help i am fanciful perhaps she added hastily lest she should have said too much but there it is all day the notion has clung to me and i have been asking myself desperately what i should do in such a case  time enough to consider it when it happens una after all  i know her ladyship interrupted on that everready note of petulance of hers i know of course but i think i should be easier in my mind if i could find an answer to my doubt if i knew what to do to whom to appeal for assistance for i am afraid that i should be very helpless myself there is terence of course but i am a little afraid of terence he has got dick out of so many scrapes and he is so impatient of poor dick i am afraid he doesnt understand him and so i should be a little frightened of appealing to terence again  no said sylvia gravely i shouldnt go to terence indeed he is the last man to whom i should go  you say that too exclaimed her ladyship  why quoth sylvia sharply who else has said it  there was a brief pause in which lady omoy shuddered she had been so near to betraying herself how very quick and shrewd sylvia was she made however a good recovery  myself of course it is what i have thought myself there is count samoval he promised that if ever any such thing happened he would help me and he assured me i could count upon him i think it may have been his offer that made me fanciful  i should go to sir terence before i went to count samoval by which i mean that i should not go to count samoval at all under any circumstances i do not trust him  you said so once before dear said lady omoy  and you assured me that i spoke out of the fullness of my ignorance and inexperience  ah forgive me  there is nothing to forgive no doubt you were right but remember that instinct is most alive in the ignorant and inexperienced and that instinct is often a surer guide than reason yet if you want reason i can supply that too count samoval is the intimate friend of the marquis of minas who remains a member of the government and who next to the principal souza was and no doubt is the most bitter opponent of the british policy in portugal yet count samoval one of the largest landowners in the north and the nobleman who has perhaps suffered most severely from that policy represents himself as its most vigorous supporter  lady omoy listened in growing amazement also she was a little shocked it seemed to her almost indecent that a young girl should know so much about politicsso much of which she herself a married woman and the wife of the adjutantgeneral was completely in ignorance  save us child she ejaculated you are so extraordinarily informed  i have talked to captain tremayne said sylvia he has explained all this  extraordinary conversation for a young man to hold with a young girl pronounced her ladyship terence never talked of such things to me  terence was too busy making love to you said sylvia and there was the least suspicion of regret in her almost boyish voice  that may account for it her ladyship confessed and fell for a moment into consideration of that delicious and rather amusing past when omoys ferocious hesitancy and flaming jealousy had delighted her with the full perception of her beautys power with a rush however the present forced itself back upon her notice but i still dont see why count samoval should have offered me assistance if he did not intend to grant it when the time came  sylvia explained that it was from the portuguese government that the demand for justice upon the violator of the nunnery at tavora emanated and that samovals offer might be calculated to obtain him information of butlers whereabouts when they became known so that he might surrender him to the government  my dear lady omoy was shocked almost beyond expression how you must dislike the man to suggest that he could be such asuch a judas  i do not suggest that he could be i warn you never to run the risk of testing him he may be as honest in this matter as he pretends but if ever dick were to come to you for help you must take no risk  the phrase was a happier one than sylvia could suppose it was almost the very phrase that dick himself had used and its reiteration by another bore conviction to her ladyship  to whom then should i go she demanded plaintively and sylvia speaking with knowledge remembering the promise that tremayne had given her answered readily there is but one man whose assistance you could safely seek indeed i wonder you should not have thought of him in the first instance since he is your own as well as dicks lifelong friend  ned tremayne her ladyship fell into thought do you know i am a little afraid of ned he is so very sober and cold you do mean neddont you  whom else should i mean  but what could he do  my dear how should i know but at least i knowfor i think i can be sure of thisthat he will not lack the will to help you and to have the will in a man like captain tremayne is to find a way  the confident almost respectful tone in which she spoke arrested her ladyships attention it promptly sent her off at a tangent  you like ned dont you dear  i think everybody likes him sylvias voice was now studiously cold  yes but i dont mean quite in that way and then before the subject could be further pursued the carriage rolled to a standstill in a flood of light from gaping portals scattering a mob of curious sightseers intersprinkled with chairmen footmen linkmen and all the valetaille that hovers about the functions of the great world  the carriage door was flung open and the steps let down a brace of footmen plump as capons in gorgeous liveries bowed powdered heads and proffered scarlet arms to assist the ladies to alight  above in the crowded spacious colonnaded vestibule at the foot of the great staircase they were metby captain tremayne who had just arrived with major carruthers both resplendent in full dress and captain marcus glennie of the telemachus in blue and gold together they ascended the great staircase lined with chatting groups and ablaze with uniforms military naval and diplomatic british and portuguese to be welcomed above by the count and countess of redondo  lady omoys entrance of the ballroom produced the effect to which custom had by now inured her soon she found herself the centre of assiduous attentions cavalrymen in blue riflemen in green scarlet officers of the line regiments winged lightinfantrymen rakishly pelissed goldbraided hussars and all the smaller fry of court and camp fluttered insistently about her it was no novelty to her who had been the recipient of such homage since her first ball five years ago at dublin castle and yet the wine of it had gone ever to her head a little but tonight she was rather pale and listless her rosepetal loveliness emphasised thereby perhaps an unusual air of indifference hung about her as she stood there amid this throng of martial jostlers who craved the honour of a dance and at whom she smiled a thought mechanically over the top of her slowly moving fan  the first quadrille impended and the senior service had carried off the prize from under the noses of the landsmen as she was swept away by captain glennie she came face to face with tremayne who was passing with sylvia on his arm she stopped and tapped his arm with her fan  you havent asked to dance ned she reproached him  with reluctance i abstained  but i dont intend that you shall i have something to say to you he met her glance and found it oddly seriousmost oddly serious for her responding to its entreaty he murmured a promise in courteous terms of delight at so much honour  but either he forgot the promise or did not conceive its redemption to be an urgent matter for the quadrille being done he sauntered through one of the crowded anterooms with miss armytage and brought her to the cool of a deserted balcony above the garden beyond this was the river agleam with the lights of the british fleet that rode at anchor on its placid bosom  una will be waiting for you miss armytage reminded him she was leaning on the sill of the balcony standing erect beside her he considered the graceful profile sharply outlined against a background of gloom by the light from the windows behind them a heavy curl of her dark hair lay upon a neck as flawlessly white as the rope of pearls that swung from it with which her fingers were now idly toying it were difficult to say which most engaged his thoughts the profile the lovely line of neck or the rope of pearls these latter were of price such things as it might seldomand then only by sacrificelie within the means of captain tremayne to offer to the woman whom he took to wife  he so lost himself upon that train of thought that she was forced to repeat her reminder  una will be waiting for you captain tremayne  scarcely as eagerly he answered as others will be waiting for you  she laughed amusedly a frank boyish laugh i thank you for not saying as eagerly as i am waiting for others  miss armytage i have ever cultivated truth  but we are dealing with surmise  oh no surmise at all i speak of what i know  and so do i and yet again she repeated una will be waiting for you  he sighed and stiffened slightly of course if you insist said he and made ready to reconduct her  she swung round as if to go but checked and looked him frankly in the eyes  why will you for ever be misunderstanding me she challenged him  perhaps it is the inevitable result of my overanxiety to understand  then begin by taking me more literally and do not read into my words more meaning than i intend to give them when i say una is waiting for you i state a simple fact not a command that you shall go to her indeed i want first to talk to you  if i might take you literally now  should i have suffered you to bring me here if i did not  i beg your pardon he said contrite and something shaken out of his imperturbability sylvia he ventured very boldly and there checked so terrified as to be a shame to his brave scarlet goldlaced uniform  yes she said she was leaning upon the balcony again and in such a way now that he could no longer see her profile but her fingers were busy at the pearls once more and this he saw and seeing recovered himself  you have something to say to me he questioned in his smooth level voice  had he not looked away as he spoke he might have observed that her fingers tightened their grip of the pearls almost convulsively as if to break the rope it was a gesture slight and trivial yet arguing perhaps vexation but tremayne did not see it and had he seen it it is odds it would have conveyed no message to him  there fell a long pause which he did not venture to break at last she spoke her voice quiet and level as his own had been  it is about una  i had hoped he spoke very softly that it was about yourself  she flashed round upon him almost angrily why do you utter these set speeches to me she demanded and then before he could recover from his astonishment to make any answer she had resumed a normal manner and was talking quickly  she told him of unas premonitions about dick told him in short what it was that una desired to talk to him about   you bade her come to me he said  of course after your promise to me  he was silent and very thoughtful for a moment i wonder that una needed to be told that she had in me a friend he said slowly  i wonder to whom she would have gone on her own impulse  to count samoval miss armytage informed him  samoval he rapped the name out sharply he was clearly angry that man i cant understand why omoy should suffer him about the house so much  terence like everybody else will suffer anything that una wishes   then terence is more of a fool than i ever suspected  there was a brief pause if you were to fail una in this said miss armytage presently i mean that unless you yourself give her the assurance that you are ready to do what you can for dick should the occasion arise i am afraid that in her present foolish mood she may still avail herself of count samoval that would be to give samoval a hold upon her and i tremble to think what the consequences might be that man is a snakea horror  the frankness with which she spoke was to tremayne full evidence of her anxiety he was prompt to allay it  she shall have that assurance this very evening he promised  i at least have not pledged my word to anything or to any one even so he added slowly the chances of my services being ever required grow more slender every day una may be full of premonitions about dick but between premonition and event there is something of a gap  again a pause and then i am glad said miss armytage to think that una has a friend a trustworthy friend upon whom she can depend she is so incapable of depending upon herself all her life there has been some one at hand to guide her and screen her from unpleasantness until she has remained just a sweet dear child to be taken by the hand in every dark lane of life  but she has you miss armytage  me miss armytage spoke deprecatingly i dont think i am a very able or experienced guide besides even such as i am she may not have me very long now i had letters from home this morning father is not very well and mother writes that he misses me i am thinking of returning soon  butbut you have only just come  she brightened and laughed at the dismay in his voice indeed i have been here six weeks she looked out over the shimmering moonlit waters of the tagus and the shadowy ghostly ships of the british fleet that rode at anchor there and her eyes were wistful her fingers with that little gesture peculiar to her in moments of constraint were again entwining themselves in her rope of pearls yes she said almost musingly i think i must be going soon  he was dismayed he realised that the moment for action had come his heart was sounding the charge within him and then that cursed rope of pearls emblem of the wealth and luxury in which she had been nurtured stood like an impassable abattis across his path  youyou will be glad to go of course he suggested  hardly that it has been very pleasant here she sighed  we shall miss you very much he said gloomily the house at monsanto will not be the same when you are gone una will be lost and desolate without you  it occurs to me sometimes she said slowly that the people about una think too much of una and too little of themselves  it was a cryptic speech in another it might have signified a spitefulness unthinkable in sylvia armytage therefore it puzzled him very deeply he stood silent wondering what precisely she might mean and thus in silence they continued for a spell then slowly she turned and the blaze of light from the windows fell about her irradiantly she was rather pale and her eyes were of a suspiciously excessive brightness and again she made use of the phrase  una will be waiting for you  yet as before he stood silent and immovable considering her questioning himself searching her face and his own soul all he saw was that rope of shimmering pearls  and after all as yourself suggested it is possible that others may be waiting for me she added presently  instantly he was crestfallen and contrite i sincerely beg your pardon miss armytage and with a pang of which his imperturbable exterior gave no hint he proffered her his arm  she took it barely touching it with her fingertips and they reentered the anteroom  when do you think that you will be leaving he asked her gently  there was a note of harshness in the voice that answered him  i dont know yet but very soon the sooner the better i think  and then the sleek and courtly samoval detaching from seeming to materialise out of the glittering throng they had entered was bowing low before her claiming her attention knowing her feelings tremayne would not have relinquished her but to his infinite amazement she herself slipped her fingers from his scarlet sleeve to place them upon the black one that samoval was gracefully proffering and greeted samoval with a gay raillery as oddly in contrast with her grave demeanour towards the captain as with her recent avowal of detestation for the count  stricken and half angry tremayne stood looking after them as they receded towards the ballroom to increase his chagrin came a laugh from miss armytage sharp and rather strident floating towards him and miss armytages laugh was wont to be low and restrained samoval no doubt had resources to amuse a womaneven a woman who instinctively disliked himresources of which captain tremayne himself knew nothing  and then some one tapped him on the shoulder a very tall hawkfaced man in a scarlet coat and tightly strapped blue trousers stood beside him it was colquhoun grant the ablest intelligence officer in wellingtons service  why colonel cried tremayne holding out his hand i didnt know you were in lisbon  i arrived only this afternoon the keen eyes flashed after the disappearing figures of sylvia and her cavalier tell me what is the name of the irresistible gallant who has so lightly ravished you of your quite delicious companion  count samoval said tremayne shortly  grants face remained inscrutable really he said softly so that is jeronymo de samoval eh how very interesting a great supporter of the british policy therefore an altruist since himself he is a sufferer by it and i hear that he has become a great friend of omoys  he is at monsanto a good deal certainly tremayne admitted  most interesting grant was slowly nodding and a faint smile curled his thin sensitive lips but im keeping you tremayne and no doubt you would be dancing i shall perhaps see you tomorrow i shall be coming up to monsanto  and with a wave of the hand he passed on and was gone     chapter vii the ally   tremayne elbowed his way through the gorgeous crowd exchanging greetings here and there as he went and so reached the ballroom during a pause in the dancing he looked round for lady omoy but he could see her nowhere and would never have found her had not carruthers pointed out a knot of officers and assured him that the lady was in the heart of it and in imminent peril of being suffocated  thither the captain bent his steps looking neither to right nor left in his singleness of purpose thus it happened that he saw neither omoy who had just arrived nor the massive decorated bulk of marshal beresford with whom the adjutant stood in conversation on the skirts of the throng that so assiduously worshipped at her ladyships shrine  captain tremayne went through the group with all a sappers skill at piercing obstacles and so came face to face with the lady of his quest seeing her so radiant now with sparkling eyes and ready laugh it was difficult to conceive her haunted by any such anxieties as miss armytage had mentioned yet the moment she perceived him as if his presence acted as a reminder to lift her out of the delicious present something of her gaiety underwent eclipse  child of impulse that she was she gave no thought to her action and the construction it might possibly bear in the minds of men chagrined and slighted  why ned she cried you have kept me waiting and with a complete and charming ignoring of the claims of all who had been before him and who were warring there for precedence of one another she took his arm in token that she yielded herself to him before even the honour was so much as solicited  with nods and smiles to right and lefta queen dismissing her courtshe passed on the captains arm through the little crowd that gave way before her dismayed and intrigued and so away  omoy who had been awaiting a favourable moment to present the marshal by the marshals own request attempted to thrust forward now with beresford at his side but the bowing line of officers whose backs were towards him effectively barred his progress and before they had broken up that formation her ladyship and her cavalier were out of sight lost in the moving crowd  the marshal laughed goodhumouredly the infallible reward of patience said he and omoy laughed with him but the next moment he was scowling at what he overheard  on my soul that was impudence an irish infantryman had protested  have you ever heard quoth a heavy dragoon who was also a heavy jester that in heaven the last shall be first if you pay court to an angel you must submit to celestial customs  and bedad rejoined the infantryman as theres no marryin in heaven yeve got to make the best of it with other mens wives sure its a great success that fellow should be in paradise did ye remark the way she melted to him beauty swooning at the sight of temptation bad luck to him who is he at all  they dispersed laughing and followed by omoys scowling eyes it annoyed him that his wifes thoughtless conduct should render her the butt of such jests as these and perhaps a subject for lewd gossip he would speak to her about it later meanwhile the marshal had linked arms with him  since the privilege must be postponed said he suppose that we seek supper i have always found that a man can best heal in his stomach the wounds taken by his heart his fleshy bulk afforded a certain primafacie confirmation of the dictum  with a roll more suggestive of the quarterdeck than the saddle the great man bore off omoy in quest of material consolation yet as they went the adjutants eyes raked the ballroom in quest of his wife that quest however was unsuccessful for his wife was already in the garden  i want to talk to you most urgently ned take me somewhere where we can be quite private she had begged the captain somewhere where there is no danger of being overheard  her agitation now uncontrolled suggested to tremayne that the matter might be far more serious and urgent than miss armytage had represented it he thought first of the balcony where he had lately been but then the balcony opened immediately from the anteroom and was likely at any moment to be invaded so since the night was soft and warm he preferred the garden her ladyship went to find a wrap then arm in arm they passed out and were lost in the shadows of an avenue of palmtrees  it is about dick she said breathlessly  i knowmiss armytage told me  what did she tell you  that you had a premonition that he might come to you for assistance  a premonition her ladyship laughed nervously it is more than a premonition ned he has come  the captain stopped in his stride and stood quite still  come he echoed dick  sh she warned him and sank her voice from very instinct he came to me this evening half an hour before we left home i have put him in an alcove adjacent to my dressingroom for the present  you have left him there he was alarmed  oh theres no fear no one ever goes there except bridget and i have locked the alcove hes fast asleep he was asleep before i left the poor fellow was so worn and weary followed details of his appearance and a recital of his wanderings so far as he had made them known to her and he was so insistent that no one should know not even terence  terence must not know he said gravely  you think that too  if terence knowswell you will regret it all the days of your life una  he was so stern so impressive that she begged for explanation he afforded it you would be doing terence the utmost cruelty if you told him you would be compelling him to choose between his honour and his concern for you and since he is the very soul of honour he must sacrifice you and himself your happiness and his own everything that makes life good for you both to his duty  she was aghast for all that she was far from understanding but he went on relentlessly to make his meaning clear for the sake of omoy as much as for her ownfor the sake of the future of these two people who were perhaps his dearest friends he saw in what danger of shipwreck their happiness now stood and he took the determination of clearly pointing out to her every shoal in the water through which she must steer her course  since this has happened una you must be told the whole truth you must listen and above all be reasonable i am dicks friend as i am your own and terences your father was my best friend perhaps and my gratitude to him is unbounded as i hope you know you and dick are almost as brother and sister to me in spite of thisindeed because of this i have prayed for news that dick was dead  her grasp interrupted him and he felt the tightening clutch of her hands upon his arm in the gloom  i have prayed this for dicks sake and more than all for the sake of your happiness and terences if dick is taken the choice before terence is a tragic one you will realise it when i tell you that duty forced him to pledge his word to the portuguese government that dick should be shot when found  oh it was a gasp of horror of incredulity she loosed his arm and drew away from him it is infamous i cant believe it i cant  it is true i swear it to you i was present and i heard  and you allowed it  what could i do how could i interfere besides the minister who demanded that undertaking knew nothing of the relationship between omoy and this missing officer  butbut he could have been told  that would have made no differenceunless it were to create fresh difficulties  she stood there ghostly white against the gloom a dry sob broke from her terence did that terence did that she moaned and then in a surge of anger i shall never speak to terence again i shall not live with him another day it was infamous infamous  it was not infamous it was almost noble almost heroic he amazed her listen una and try to understand he took her arm again and drew her gently on down that avenue of moonlightfretted darkness  oh i understand she cried bitterly i understand perfectly he has always been hard on dick he has always made mountains out of molehills where dick was concerned he forgets that dick is young a mere boy he judges dick from the standpoint of his own sober middle age why hes an old mana wicked old man  thus her rage hurling at omoy what in the insolence of her youth seemed the last insult  you are very unjust una you are even a little stupid he said deeming the punishment necessary and salutary  stupid i stupid i have never been called stupid before  but you have undoubtedly deserved to be he assured her with perfect calm  it took her aback by its directness and for a moment left her without an answer then i think you had better leave me she told him frostily you forget yourself  perhaps i do he admitted that is because i am more concerned to think of dick and terence and yourself sit down una  they had reached a little circle by a piece of ornamental water facing which a granitehewn seat had been placed she sank to it obediently if sulkily  it may perhaps help you to understand what terence has done when i tell you that in his place loving dick as i do i must have pledged myself precisely as he did or else despised myself for ever and being pledged i must keep my word or go in the same selfcontempt he elaborated his argument by explaining the full circumstances under which the pledge had been exacted but be in no doubt about it he concluded if terence knows of dicks presence at monsanto he has no choice he must deliver him up to a firing partyor to a courtmartial which will inevitably sentence him to death no matter what the defence that dick may urge he is a man prejudged foredoomed by the necessities of war and terence will do this although it will break his heart and ruin all his life understand me then that in enjoining you never to allow terence to suspect that dick is present i am pleading not so much for you or for dick but for terence himselffor it is upon terence that the hardest and most tragic suffering must fall now do you understand  i understand that men are very stupid was her way of admitting it  and you see that you were wrong in judging terence as you did  ii suppose so  she didnt understand it all but since tremayne was so insistent she supposed there must be something in his point of view she had been brought up in the belief that ned tremayne was common sense incarnate and although she often doubted itas you may doubt the dogmas of a religion in which you have been bredyet she never openly rebelled against that inculcated faith above all she wanted to cry she knew that it would be very good for her she had often found a singular relief in tears when vexed by things beyond her understanding but she had to think of that flock of gallants in the ballroom waiting to pay court to her and of her duty towards them of preserving her beauty unimpaired by the ravages of a vented sorrow  tremayne sat down beside her so now that we understand each other on that score let us consider ways and means to dispose of dick  at once she was uplifted and became all eagerness  yes yes you will help me ned  you can depend upon me to do all in human power  he thought rapidly and gave voice to some of his thoughts if i could i would take him to my lodgings at alcantara but carruthers knows him and would see him there so that is out of the question then again it is dangerous to move him about at any moment he might be seen and recognised  hardly recognised she said his beard disguises him and his dress she shuddered at the very thought of the figure he had cut he the jaunty dandy richard butler  that is something of course he agreed and then asked how long do you think that you could keep him hidden  i dont know you see theres bridget she is the only danger as she has charge of my dressingroom  it may be desperate butcan you trust her  oh i am sure i can she is devoted to me she would do anything  she must be bought as well devotion and gain when linked together will form an unbreakable bond dont let us be stingy una take her into your confidence boldly and promise her a hundred guineas for her silencepayable on the day that dick leaves the country  but how are we to get him out of the country  i think i know a way i can depend on marcus glennie i may tell him the whole truth and the identity of our man or i may not i must think about that but whatever i decide i am sure i can induce glennie to take our fugitive home in the telemachus and land him safely somewhere in ireland where he will have to lose himself for awhile perhaps for glennies sake it will be safer not to disclose dicks identity then if there should be trouble later glennie having known nothing of the real facts will not be held responsible i will talk to him tonight  do you think he will consent she asked in strained anxietyanxiety to have her anxieties dispelled  i am sure he will i can almost pledge my word on it marcus would do anything to serve me oh set your mind at rest consider the thing done keep dick safely hidden for a week or so until the telemachus is ready to sailhe mustnt go on board until the last moment for several reasonsand i will see to the rest  under that confident promise her troubles fell from her as lightly as they ever did  you are very good to me ned forgive me what i said just now and i think i understand about terencepoor dear old terence  of course you do moved to comfort her as he might have been moved to comfort a child he flung his arm along the seat behind her and patted her shoulder soothingly i knew you would understand and not a word to terence not a word that could so much as awaken his suspicions remember that  oh i shall  fell a step upon the patch behind them crunching the gravel captain tremayne his arm still along the back of the seat and seeming to envelop her ladyship looked over her shoulder a tall figure was advancing briskly he recognised it even in the gloom by its height and gait and swing for omoys  why here is terence he said easilyso easily with such frank and obvious honesty of welcome that the anger in which omoy came wrapped fell from him on the instant to be replaced by shame  i have been looking for you everywhere my dear he said to una marshal beresford is anxious to pay you his respects before he leaves and you have been so hedged about by gallants all the evening that its devil a chance hes had of approaching you there was a certain constraint in his voice for a man may not recover instantly from such feelings as those which had fetched him hotfoot down that path at sight of those two figures sitting so close and intimate the young mans arm so proprietorialy about the ladys shouldersas it seemed  lady omoy sprang up at once with a little silvery laugh that was singularly carefree for had not tremayne lifted the burden entirely from her shoulders  you should have married a dowd she mocked him then youd have found her more easily accessible  instead of finding her dallying in the moonlight with my secretary he rallied back between good and ill humour and he turned to tremayne damned indiscreet of you ned he added more severely suppose you had been seen by any of the scandalmongering old wives of the garrison a nice thing for una and a nice thing for me begad to be made the subject of flyblown talk over the teacups  tremayne accepted the rebuke in the friendly spirit in which it appeared to be conveyed sorry omoy he said youre quite right we should have thought of it everybody isnt to know what our relations are and again he was so manifestly honest and so completely at his ease that it was impossible to harbour any thought of evil and omoy felt again the glow of shame of suspicions so utterly unworthy and dishonouring     chapter viii the intelligence officer   in a small room of count redondos palace a room that had been set apart for cards sat three men about a cardtable they were count samoval the elderly marquis of minas lean bald and vulturine of aspect with a deepset eye that glared fiercely through a single eyeglass rimmed in tortoiseshell and a gentleman still on the fair side of middle age with a clearcut face and irongrey hair who wore the dark green uniform of a major of cacadores  considering his portuguese uniform it is odd that the lowtoned earnest conversation amongst them should have been conducted in french  there were cards on the table but there was no pretence of play you might have conceived them a group of players who wearied of their game had relinquished it for conversation they were the only tenants of the room which was small cedarpanelled and lighted by a girandole of sparkling crystal through the closed door came faintly from the distant ballroom the strains of the dance music  with perhaps the single exception of the principal souza the british policy had no more bitter opponent in portugal than the marquis of minas once a member of the council of regencybefore souza had been elected to that bodyhe had quitted it in disgust at the british measures his chief ground of umbrage had been the appointment of british officers to the command of the portuguese regiments which formed the division under marshal beresford in this he saw a deliberate insult and slight to his country and his countrymen he was a man of burning and blinded patriotism to whom portugal was the most glorious nation in the world he lived in his countrys splendid past refusing to recognise that the days of henry the navigator of vasco da gama of manuel the fortunatedays in which portugal had been great indeed among the nations of the old world were gone and done with he respected britons as great merchants and industrious traders but after all merchants and traders are not the peers of fighters on land and sea of navigators conquerors and civilisers such as his countrymen had been such as he believed them still to be that the descendants of gamas cunhas magalhaes and albuquerquesmen whose names were indelibly written upon the very face of the worldshould be passed over whilst alien officers lead been brought in to train and command the portuguese legions was an affront to portugal which minas could never forgive  it was thus that he had become a rebel withdrawing from a government whose supineness he could not condone for a while his rebellion had been passive until the principal souza had heated him in the fire of his own rage and fashioned him into an intriguing instrument of the first power he was listening intently now to the soft rapid speech of the gentleman in the majors uniform  of course rumours had reached the prince of this policy of devastation he was saying but his highness has been disposed to treat these rumours lightly unable to see as indeed are we all what useful purpose such a policy could finally serve he does not underrate the talents of milord wellington as a commander he does not imagine that he would pursue such operations out of pure wantonness yet if such operations are indeed being pursued what can they be but wanton a moment count he stayed samoval who was about to interrupt his mind and manner were authoritative we know most positively from the emperors london agents that the war is unpopular in england we know that public opinion is being prepared for a british retreat for the driving of the british into the sea as must inevitably happen once monsieur le prince decides to launch his bolt here in the tagus the british fleet lies ready to embark the troops and the british cabinet itself he spoke more slowly and emphatically expects that embarkation to take place at latest in september which is just about the time that the french offensive should be at its height and the french troops under the very walls of lisbon i admit that by this policy of devastation if indeed it be trueadded to a stubborn contesting of every foot of ground the french advance may be retarded but the process will be costly to britain in lives and money  and more costly still to portugal croaked the marquis of minas  and as you say monsieur le marquis more costly still to portugal let me for a moment show you another side of the picture the french administration so sane so cherishing animated purely by ideas of progress enforcing wise and beneficial laws making ever for the prosperity and wellbeing of conquered nations knows how to render itself popular wherever it is established this portugal knows alreadyor at least some part of it there was the administration of soult in oporto so entirely satisfactory to the people that it was no inconsiderable party was prepared subject to the emperors consent to offer him the crown and settle down peacefully under his rule there was the administration of junot in lisbon i ask you when was lisbon better governed  contrast for a moment with these the present british administrationfor it amounts to an administration consider the burning grievances that must be left behind by this policy of laying the country waste of pauperising a million people of all degrees driving them homeless from the lands on which they were born after compelling them to lend a hand in the destruction of all that their labour has built up through long years if any policy could better serve the purposes of france i know it not the people from here to beira should be ready to receive the french with open arms and to welcome their deliverance from this most costly and bitter british protection  do you messieurs detect a flaw in these arguments  both shook their heads  bien said the major of portuguese cacadores then we reach one or two only possible conclusions either these rumours of a policy of devastation which have reached the prince of esslingen are as utterly false as he believes them to be or  to my cost i know them to be true as i have already told you samoval interrupted bitterly  or the major persisted raising a hand to restrain the count or there is something further that has not been yet discovereda mystery the enucleation of which will shed light upon all the rest since you assure me monsieur le comte that milord wellingtons policy is beyond doubt as reported to monsieur le marechal it but remains to address ourselves to the discovery of the mystery underlying it what conclusions have you reached you monsieur de samoval have had exceptional opportunities of observation i understand  i am afraid my opportunities have been none so exceptional as you suppose replied samoval with a dubious shake of his sleek dark head at one time i founded great hopes in lady omoy but lady omoy is a fool and does not enjoy her husbands confidence in official matters what she knows i know unfortunately it does not amount to very much one conclusion however i have reached wellington is preparing in portugal a snare for massenas army  a snare hum the major pursed his full lips into a smile of scorn there cannot be a trap with two exits my friend massena enters portugal at almeida and marches to lisbon and the open sea he may be inconvenienced or hampered in his march but its goal is certain where then can lie the snare your theory presupposes an impassable barrier to arrest the french when they are deep in the country and an overwhelming force to cut off their retreat when that barrier is reached the overwhelming force does not exist and cannot be manufactured as for the barrier no barrier that it lies within human power to construct lies beyond french power to overstride  i should not make too sure of that samoval warned him and you have overlooked something  the major glanced at the count sharply and without satisfaction he accounted himselftrained as he had been under the very eye of the great emperorof some force in strategy and tactics a player too well versed in the game to overlook the possible moves of an opponent  ha he said with the ghost of a sneer for instance monsieur le comte  the overwhelming force exists said samoval  where is it then whence has it been created if you refer to the united british and portuguese troops you will be good enough to bear in mind that they will be retreating before the prince they cannot at once be before and behind him  the mans cool assurance and cooler contempt of samovals views stung the count into some sharpness  are you seeking information sir or are you bestowing it he inquired  ah your pardon monsieur le comte i inquire of course i put forward arguments to anticipate conditions that may possibly be erroneous  samoval waived the point there is another force besides the british and portuguese troops that you have left out of your calculations  and that the major was still faintly incredulous  you should remember what wellington obviously remembers that a french army depends for its sustenance upon the country it is invading that is why wellington is stripping the french line of penetration as bare of sustenance as this cardtable if we assume the existence of the barrieran impassable line of fortifications encountered within many marches of the frontierwe may also assume that starvation will be the overwhelming force that will cut off the french retreat  the others keen eyes flickered for a moment his face lost its assurance and it was samovals turn to smile but the major made a sharp recovery he slowly shook his irongrey head  you have no right to assume an impassable barrier that is an inadmissible hypothesis there is no such thing as a line of fortifications impassable to the french  you will pardon me major but it is yourself have no right to your own assumptions again you overlook something i will grant that technically what you say is true no fortifications can be built that cannot be destroyedgiven adequate power with which it is yet to prove that massena not knowing what may await him will be equipped  but let us for a moment take so much for granted and now consider this fortifications are unquestionably building in the region of torres vedras and wellington guards the secret so jealously that not even the britisheither here or in englandare aware of their nature that is why the cabinet in london takes for granted an embarkation in september wellington has not even taken his government into his confidence that is the sort of man he is now these fortifications have been building since last october best part of eight months have already gone in their construction it may be another two or three months before the french army reaches them i do not say that the french cannot pass them given time but how long will it take the french to pull down what it will have taken ten or eleven months to construct and if they are unable to draw sustenance from a desolate wasted country what time will they have at their disposal it will be with them a matter of life or death having come so far they must reach lisbon or perish and if the fortifications can delay them by a single month then granted that all lord wellingtons other dispositions have been duly carried out perish they must it remains monsieur le major for you to determine whether with all their energy with all their genius and all their valour the french canin an illnourished conditiondestroy in a few weeks the considered labour of nearly a year  the major was aghast he had changed colour and through his eyes wide and staring his stupefaction glared forth at them  minas uttered a dry cough under cover of his hand and screwed up his eyeglass to regard the major more attentively you do not appear to have considered all that he said  but my dear marquis was the halfindignant answer why was i not told all this to begin with you represented yourself as but indifferently informed monsieur de samoval whereas  so i am my dear major as far as information goes if i did not use these arguments before it was because it seemed to me an impertinence to offer what after all are no more than the conclusions of my own constructive and deductive reasoning to one so well versed in strategy as yourself  the major was silenced for a moment i congratulate you count he said monsieur le marechal shall have your views without delay tell me he begged you say these fortifications lie in the region of torres vedras can you be more precise  i think so but again i warn you that i can tell you only what i infer i judge they will run from the sea somewhere near the mouth of the zizandre in a semicircle to the tagus somewhere to the south of santarem i know that they do not reach as far north as san because the roads there are open whereas all roads to the south where i am assuming that the fortifications lie are closed and closely guarded  why do you suggest a semicircle  because that is the formation of the hills and presumably the line of heights would be followed  yes the major approved slowly and the distance then would be some thirty or forty miles  fully  the majors face relaxed its gravity he even smiled you will agree count that in a line of that extent a uniform strength is out of the question it must perforce present many weak many vulnerable places  oh undoubtedly  plans of these lines must be in existence  again undoubtedly sir terence omoy will have plans in his possession showing their projected extent colonel fletcher who is in charge of the construction is in constant communication with the adjutant himself an engineer andas i partly imagine partly infer from odd phrases that i have overheardespecially entrusted by lord wellington with the supervision of the works  two things then are necessary said the major promptly the first is that the devastation of the country should be retarded and as far as possible hindered altogether  that said minas you may safely leave to myself and souzas other friends the northern noblemen who have no intention of becoming the victims of british disinclination to pitched battles  the secondand this is more difficultis that we should obtain by hook or by crook a plan of the fortifications and he looked directly at samoval  the count nodded slowly but his face expressed doubt  i am quite alive to the necessity i always have been but  to a man of your resource and intelligencean intelligence of which you have just given such very signal proofthe matter should be possible he paused a moment then if i understand you correctly monsieur de samoval your fortunes have suffered deeply and you are almost ruined by this policy of wellingtons you are offered the opportunity of making a magnificent recovery the emperor is the most generous paymaster in the world and he is beyond measure impatient at the manner in which the campaign in the peninsula is dragging on he has spoken of it as an ulcer that is draining the empire of its resources for the man who could render him the service of disclosing the weak spot in this armour the achilles heel of the british there would be a reward beyond all your possible dreams obtain the plans then and  he checked abruptly the door had opened and in a venetian mirror facing him upon the wall the major caught the reflection of a british uniform the stiff gold collar surmounted by a bronzed hawk face with which he was acquainted  i beg your pardon gentlemen said the officer in portuguese i was looking for  his voice became indistinct so that they never knew who it was that he had been seeking when he intruded upon their privacy the door had closed again and the reflection had vanished from the mirror but there were beads of perspiration on the majors brow  it is fortunate he muttered breathlessly that my back was towards him i would as soon meet the devil face to face i didnt dream he was in lisbon  who is he asked minas  colonel grant the british intelligence officer phew name of a name what an escape the major mopped his brow with a silk handkerchief beware of him monsieur de samoval  he rose he was obviously shaken by the meeting  if one of you will kindly make quite sure that he is not about i think that i had better go if we should meet everything might be ruined then with a change of manner he stayed samoval who was already on his way to the door we understand each other then he questioned them i have my papers and at dawn i leave lisbon i shall report your conclusions to the prince and in anticipation i may already offer you the expression of his profoundest gratitude meanwhile you know what is to do opposition to the policy and the plans of the fortificationsabove all the plans  he shook hands with them and having waited until samoval assured him that the corridor outside was clear he took his departure and was soon afterwards driving home congratulating himself upon his most fortunate escape from the hawk eye of colquhoun grant  but when in the dead of that night he was awakened to find a british sergeant with a halbert and six redcoats with fixed bayonets surrounding his bed it occurred to him belatedly that what one man can see in a mirror is also visible to another and that marshal massena prince of esslingen waiting for information beyond ciudad rodrigo would never enjoy the advantages of a report of count samovals masterly constructive and deductive reasoning    chapter ix the general order   sir terence sat alone in his spacious severely furnished private room in the official quarters at monsanto on the broad carved writingtable before him there was a mass of documents relating to the clothing and accoutrement of the forces to leaves of absence to staff appointments there were returns from the various divisions of the sick and wounded in hospital from which a complete list was to be prepared for the secretary of state for war at home there were plans of the lines at torres vedras just received indicating the progress of the works at various points and there were documents and communications of all kinds concerned with the adjutantgenerals multifarious and arduous duties including an urgent letter from colonel fletcher suggesting that the commanderinchief should take an early opportunity of inspecting in person the inner lines of fortification  sir terence however sat back in his chair his work neglected his eyes dreamily gazing through the open window but seeing nothing of the sundrenched landscape beyond a heavy frown darkening his bronzed and rugged face his mind was very far from his official duties and the mass of reminders before himthis augean stable of arrears he was lost in thought of his wife and tremayne  five days had elapsed since the ball at count redondos where sir terence had surprised the pair together in the garden and his suspicions had been fired by the compromising attitude in which he had discovered them tremaynes frank easy bearing so unassociable with guilt had as we know gone far to reassure him and had even shamed him so that he had trampled his suspicions underfoot but other things had happened since to revive his bitter doubts daily constantly had he been coming upon tremayne and lady omoy alone together in intimate confidential talk which was ever silenced on his approach the two had taken to wandering by themselves in the gardens at all hours a thing that had never been so before and omoy detected or imagined that he detected a closer intimacy between them a greater warmth towards the captain on the part of her ladyship  thus matters had reached a pass in which peace of mind was impossible to him it was not merely what he saw it was his knowledge of what was it was his everpresent consciousness of his own age and his wifes youth it was the memory of his antenuptial jealousy of tremayne which had been awakened by the gossip of those daysa gossip that pronounced tremayne una butlers poor suitor too poor either to declare himself or to be accepted if he did the old wound which that gossip had dealt him then was reopened now he thought of tremaynes manifest concern for una he remembered how in that very room some six weeks ago when butlers escapade had first been heard of it was from avowed concern for una that tremayne had urged him to befriend and rescue his rascally brotherinlaw he remembered too with increasing bitterness that it was una herself had induced him to appoint tremayne to his staff  there were moments when the conviction of tremaynes honesty the thought of tremaynes unswerving friendship for himself would surge up to combat and abate the fires of his devastating jealousy  but evidence would kindle those fires anew until they flamed up to scorch his soul with shame and anger he had been a fool in that he had married a woman of half his years a fool in that he had suffered her former lover to be thrown into close association with her  thus he assured himself but he would abide by his folly and so must she and he would see to it that whatever fruits that folly yielded dishonour should not be one of them through all his darkening rage there beat the light of reason to avert he bethought him was better than to avenge nor were such stains to be wiped out by vengeance a cuckold remains a cuckold though he take the life of the man who has reduced him to that ignominy  tremayne must go before the evil transcended reparation let him return to his regiment and do his work of sapping and mining elsewhere than in omoys household  eased by that resolve he rose a tall martial figure youth and energy in every line of it for all his six and forty years awhile he paced the room in thought then suddenly with hands clenched behind his back he checked by the window checked on a horrible question that had flashed upon his tortured mind what if already the evil should be irreparable what proof had he that it was not so  the door opened and tremayne himself came in quickly  heres the very devil to pay sir he announced with that odd mixture of familiarity towards his friend and deference to his chief  omoy looked at him in silence with smouldering questioning eyes thinking of anything but the trouble which the captains air and manner heralded  captain stanhope has just arrived from headquarters with messages for you a terrible thing has happened sir the dispatches from home by the thunderbolt which we forwarded from here three weeks ago reached lord wellington only the day before yesterday  sir terence became instantly alert  garfield who carried them came into collision at penalva with an officer of ansons brigade there was a meeting and garfield was shot through the lung he lay between life and death for a fortnight with the result that the dispatches were delayed until he recovered sufficiently to remember them and to have them forwarded by other hands but you had better see stanhope himself  the aidedecamp came in he was splashed from head to foot in witness of the fury with which he had ridden his hair was caked with dust and his face haggard but he carried himself with soldierly uprightness and his speech was brisk he repeated what tremayne had already stated with some few additional details  this wretched fellow sent lord wellington a letter dictated from his bed in which he swore that the duel was forced upon him and that his honour allowed him no alternative i dont think any feature of the case has so deeply angered lord wellington as this stupid plea he mentioned that when sir john moore was at herrerias in the course of his retreat upon corunna he sent forward instructions for the leading division to halt at lugo where he designed to deliver battle if the enemy would accept it that dispatch was carried to sir david baird by one of sir johns aides but sir david forwarded it by the hand of a trooper who got drunk and lost it that says lord wellington is the only parallel so far as he is aware of the present case with this difference that whilst a common trooper might so far fail to appreciate the importance of his mission no such lack of appreciation can excuse captain garfield  i am glad of that said sir terence who had been bristling for a moment i imagined that it was to be implied i had been as indiscreet in my choice of a messenger as sir david baird  no no sir terence i merely repeated lord wellingtons words that you may realise how deeply angered he is if garfield recovers from his wound he will be tried by courtmartial he is under open arrest meanwhile as is his opponent in the duela major sykes of the 23rd dragoons that they will both be broke is beyond doubt but that is not all this affair which might have had such grave consequences coming so soon upon the heels of major berkeleys business has driven lord wellington to a step regarding which this letter will instruct you  sir terence broke the seal the letter penned by a secretary but bearing wellingtons own signature ran as follows  the bearer captain stanhope will inform you of the particulars of this disgraceful business of captain garfields the affair following so soon upon that of major berkeley has determined me to make it clearly understood to the officers in his majestys service that they have been sent to the peninsula to fight the french and not each other or members of the civilian population while this campaign continues and as long as i am in charge of it i am determined not to suffer upon any plea whatever the abominable practice of duelling among those under my command i desire you to publish this immediately in general orders enjoining upon officers of all ranks without exception the necessity to postpone the settlement of private quarrels at least until the close of this campaign and to add force to this injunction you will make it known that any infringement of this order will be considered as a capital offence that any officer hereafter either sending or accepting a challenge will if found guilty by a general courtmartial be immediately shot  sir terence nodded slowly  very well he said the measure is most wise although i doubt if it will be popular but then unpopularity is the fate of wise measures i am glad the matter has not ended more seriously the dispatches in question so far as i can recollect were not of great urgency  there is something more said captain stanhope the dispatches bore signs of having been tampered with  tampered with it was a question from tremayne charged with incredulity but who would have tampered with them  there were signs that is all garfield was taken to the house of the parish priest where he lay lost until he recovered sufficiently to realise his position for himself no doubt you will have a schedule of the contents of the dispatch sir terence  certainly it is in your possession i think tremayne  tremayne turned to his desk and a brief search in one of its wellordered drawers brought to light an oblong strip of paper folded and endorsed he unfolded and spread it on sir terences table whilst captain stanhope producing a note with which he came equipped stooped to check off the items suddenly he stopped frowned and finally placed his finger under one of the lines of tremaynes schedule carefully studying his own note for a moment  ha he said quietly at last whats this and he read note from lord liverpool of reinforcements to be embarked for lisbon in june or july he looked at the adjutant and the adjutants secretary that would appear to be the most important document of allindeed the only document of any vital importance and it was not included in the dispatch as it reached lord wellington  the three looked gravely at one another in silence  have you a copy of the note sir inquired the aidedecamp  not a copybut a summary of its contents the figures it contained are pencilled there on the margin tremayne answered  allow me sir said stanhope and taking up a quill from the adjutants table he rapidly copied the figures lord wellington must have this memorandum as soon as possible the rest sir terence is of course a matter for yourself you will know what to do meanwhile i shall report to his lordship what has occurred i had best set out at once  if you will rest for an hour and give my wife the pleasure of your company at luncheon i shall have a letter ready for lord wellington replied sir terence perhaps youll see to it tremayne he added without waiting for captain stanhopes answer to an invitation which amounted to a command  thus stanhope was led away and sir terence all other matters forgotten for the moment sat down to write his letter  later in the day after captain stanhope had taken his departure the duty fell to tremayne of framing the general order and seeing to the dispatch of a copy to each division  i wonder he said to sir terence who will be the first to break it  why the fool whos most anxious to be broke himself answered sir terence  there appeared to be reservations about it in tremaynes mind  its a devilish stringent regulation he criticised  but very salutary and very necessary  oh quite tremaynes agreement was unhesitating but i shouldnt care to feel the restraint of it and i thank heaven i have no enemy thirsting for my blood  sir terences brow darkened his face was turned away from his secretary how can a man be confident of that he wondered  oh a clean conscience i suppose laughed tremayne and he gave his attention to his papers  frankness honesty and lightheartedness rang so clear in the words that they sowed in sir terences mind fresh doubts of the galling suspicion he had been harbouring  do you boast a clean conscience eh ned he asked not without a lurking shame at this deliberate sly searching of the others mind yet he strained his ears for the answer  almost clean said tremayne temptation doesnt stain when its resisted does it  sir terence trembled but he controlled himself  nay now thats a question for the casuists they right answer you that it depends upon the temptation and he asked pointblank whats tempting you  tremayne was in a mood for confidences and sir terence was his friend but he hesitated his answer to the question was an irrelevance  its just hell to be poor omoy he said  the adjutant turned to stare at him tremayne was sitting with his head resting on one hand the fingers thrusting through the crisp fair hair and there was gloom in his clearcut face a dullness in the usually keen grey eyes  is there anything on your mind quoth sir terence  temptation was the answer its an unpleasant thing to struggle against  but you spoke of poverty  to be sure if i werent poor i could put my fortunes to the test and make an end of the matter one way or the other  there was a pause sure i hope i am the last man to force a confidence ned said omoy but you certainly seem as if it would do you good to confide  tremayne shook himself mentally i think we had better deal with the matter of this dispatch that was tampered with at penalva  so we will to be sure but it can wait a minute sir terence pushed back his chair and rose he crossed slowly to his secretarys side whats on your mind ned he asked with abrupt solicitude and ned could not suspect that it was the matter on sir terences own mind that was urging himbut urging him hopefully  captain tremayne looked up with a rueful smile i thought you boasted that you never forced a confidence and then he looked away sylvia armytage tells me that she is thinking of returning to england  for a moment the words seemed to sir terence a fresh irrelevance another attempt to change the subject then quite suddenly a light broke upon his mind shedding a relief so great and joyous that he sought to check it almost in fear  it is more than she has told me he answered steadily but then no doubt you enjoy her confidence  tremayne flashed him a wry glance and looked away again  alas he said and fetched a sigh  and is sylvia the temptation ned  tremayne was silent for a while little dreaming how sir terence hung upon his answer how impatiently he awaited it  of course he said at last isnt it obvious to any one and he grew rhapsodical how can a man be daily in her company without succumbing to her loveliness to her matchless grace of body and of mind without perceiving that she is incomparable peerless as much above other women as an angel perhaps might be above herself  before his glum solemnity and before something else that tremayne could not suspect sir terence exploded into laughter of the immense and joyous relief in it his secretary caught no hint all he heard was its sheer amusement and this galled and shamed him for no man cares to be laughed at for such feelings as tremayne had been led into betraying  you think it something to laugh at he said tartly  laugh is it spluttered sir terence god grant i dont burst a bloodvessel  tremayne reddened when youve indulged your humour sir he said stiffly perhaps youll consider the matter of this dispatch  but sir terence laughed more uproariously than ever he came to stand beside tremayne and slapped him heartily on the shoulder  yell kill me ned he protested for gods sake not so glum its that makes ye ridiculous  i am sorry you find me ridiculous  nay then its glad ye ought to be by my soul if sylvia tempts you man why the devil dont ye just succumb and have done with it shes handsome enough and well set up with her air of an amazon and she rides uncommon straight begad indeed its a broth of a girl she is in the huntingfield the ballroom or at the breakfasttable although riper acquaintance may discover her not to be quite all that you imagine her at present let your temptation lead you then entirely and good luck to you my boy  didnt i tell you omoy answered the captain mollified a little by the sympathy and good feeling peeping through the adjutants boisterousness that poverty is just hell its my poverty thats in the way  and is that all then its thankful you should be that sylvia armytage has got enough for two  thats just it  just what  the obstacle i could marry a poor woman but sylvia  have you spoken to her  tremayne was indignant how do you suppose i could  itll not have occurred to you that the lady may have feelings which having aroused you ought to be considering  a wry smile and a shake of the head was tremaynes only answer and then carruthers came in fresh from lisbon where he had been upon business connected with the commissariat and to tremaynes relief the subject was perforce abandoned  yet he marvelled several times that day that the hilarity he should have awakened in sir terence continued to cling to the adjutant and that despite the many vexatious matters claiming attention he should preserve an irrepressible and almost boyish gaiety  meanwhile however the coming of carruthers had brought the adjutant a moments seriousness and he reverted to the business of captain garfield when he had mentioned the missing note carruthers very properly became grave he was a short stiffly built man with a round goodhumoured rather florid face  the matter must be probed at once sir he ventured we know that we move in a tangle of intrigues and espionage but such a thing as this has never happened before have you anything to go upon  captain stanhope gave us nothing said the adjutant  it would be best perhaps to get grant to look into it said tremayne  if he is still in lisbon said sir terence  i passed him in the street an hour ago replied carruthers  then by all means let a note be sent to him asking him if he will step up to monsanto as soon as he conveniently can you might see to it tremayne     chapter x the stifled quarrel   it was noon of the next day before colonel grant came to the house at monsanto from whose balcony floated the british flag and before whose portals stood a sentry in the tall bearskin of the grenadiers  he found the adjutant alone in his room and apologised for the delay in responding to his invitation pleading the urgency of other matters that he had in hand  a wise enactment this of lord wellingtons was his next comment i mean this prohibition of duelling it may be resented by some of our young bloods as an unwarrantable interference with their privileges but it will do a deal of good and no one can deny that there is ample cause for the measure  it is on the subject of the cause that im wanting to consult you said sir terence offering his visitor a chair have you been informed of the details no let me give you them and he related how the dispatch bore signs of having been tampered with and how the only document of any real importance came to be missing from it  colonel grant sitting with his sabre across his knees listened gravely and thoughtfully in the end he shrugged his shoulders the keen hawk face unmoved  the harm is done and cannot very well be repaired the information obtained no doubt on behalf of massena will by now be on its way to him let us be thankful that the matter is not more grave and thankful too that you were able to supply a copy of lord liverpools figures what do you want me to do  take steps to discover the spy whose existence is disclosed by this event  colquhoun grant smiled that is precisely the matter which has brought me to lisbon  how sir terence was amazed you knew  oh not that this had happened but that the spyor rather a network of espionageexisted we move here in a web of intrigue wrought by illwill selfinterest vindictiveness and every form of malice whilst the great bulk of the portuguese people and their leaders are loyally cooperating with us there is a strong party opposing us which would prefer even to see the french prevail of course you are aware of this the heart and brain of all this isas i gather the principal souza wellington has compelled his retirement from the government but if by doing so he has restricted the mans power for evil he has certainly increased his will for evil and his activities  you tell me that garfield was cared for by the parish priest at penalva there you are half the priesthood of the country are on souzas side since the patriarch of lisbon himself is little more than a tool of souzas what happens this priest discovers that the british officer whom he has so charitably put to bed in his house is the bearer of dispatches a loyal man would instantly have communicated with marshal beresford at thomar this fellow instead advises the intriguers in lisbon the captains dispatches are examined and the only document of real value is abstracted of course it would be difficult to establish a case against the priest and it is always vexatious and troublesome to have dealings with that class as it generally means trouble with the peasantry but the case is as clear as crystal  but the intriguers here can you not deal with them  i have them under observation replied the colonel i already knew the leaders souzas lieutenants in lisbon and i can put my hand upon them at any moment if i have not already done so it is because i find it more profitable to leave them at large it is possible indeed that i may never proceed to extremes against them conceive that they have enabled me to seize la fleche the most dangerous insidious and skilful of all napoleons agents i found him at redondos ball last week in the uniform of a portuguese major and through him i was able to track down souzas chief instrumenti discovered them closeted with him in one of the cardrooms  and you didnt arrest them  arrest them i apologised for my intrusion and withdrew la fleche took his leave of them he was to have left lisbon at dawn equipped with a passport countersigned by yourself my dear adjutant  whats that  a passport for major vieira of the portuguese cacadores do you remember it  major vieira sir terence frowned thoughtfully suddenly he recollected but that was countersigned by me at the request of count samoval who represented himself a personal friend of the majors  so indeed he is but the major in question was la fleche nevertheless  and samoval knew this  sir terence was incredulous  colonel grant did not immediately answer the question he preferred to continue his narrative that night i had the false major arrested very quietly i have caused him to disappear for the present his lisbon friends believe him to be on his way to massena with the information they no doubt supplied him massena awaits his return at salamanca and will continue to wait thus when he fails to be seen or heard of there will be a good deal of mystification on all sides which is the proper state of mind in which to place your opponents lord liverpools figures let me add were not among the interesting notes found upon himpossibly because at that date they had not yet been obtained  and you say that samoval was aware of the mans real identity insisted sir terence still incredulous aware of it colonel grant laughed shortly samoval is souzas principal agentthe most dangerous man in lisbon and the most subtle his sympathies are french through and through  sir terence stared at him in frank amazement in utter unbelief oh impossible he ejaculated at last  i saw samoval for the first time said colonel grant by way of answer in oporto at the time of soults occupation he did not call himself samoval just then any more than i called myself colquhoun grant he was very active there in the french interest i should indeed be more precise and say in bonapartes interest for he was the man instrumental in disclosing to soult the bourbon conspiracy which was undermining the marshals army you do not know perhaps that french sympathy runs in samovals family you may not be aware that the portuguese marquis of alorna who holds a command in the emperors army and is at present with massena at salamanca is samovals cousin  but faltered sir terence count samoval has been a regular visitor here for the past three months  so i understand said grant coolly if i had known of it before i should have warned you but as you are aware i have been in spain on other business you realise the danger of having such a man about the place scraps of information  oh as to that sir terence interrupted i can assure you that none have fallen from my official table  never be too sure sir terence matters here must ever be under discussion there are your secretaries and the ladiesand samoval has a great way with the women what they know you may wager that he knows  they know nothing  that is a great deal to say little odds and ends now a hint at one time a word dropped at another these things picked up naturally by feminine curiosity and retailed thoughtlessly under samovals charming suasion and display of britannic sympathies and samoval has the devils own talent for bringing together the pieces of a puzzle take the lines now you may have parted with no details but mention of them will surely have been made in this household however he broke off abruptly that is all past and done with i am as sure as you are that any real indiscretions in this household are unimaginable and so we may be confident that no harm has yet been done but you will gather from what i have now told you that samovals visits here are not a mere social waste of time that he comes acquires familiarity and makes himself the friend of the family with a very definite aim in view  he does not come again said sir terence rising  that is more than i should have ventured to suggest but it is a very wise resolve it will need tact to carry it out for samoval is a man to be handled carefully  ill handle him carefully devil a fear said sir terence you can depend upon my tact  colonel grant rose in this matter of penalva i will consider further but i do not think there is anything to be done now the main thing is to stop up the outlets through which information reaches the french and that is my chief concern how is the stripping of the country proceeding now  it was more active immediately after souza left the government but the last reports announce a slackening again  they are at work in that too you see souza will not slumber while theres vengeance and selfinterest to keep him awake and he held out his hand to take his leave  youll stay to luncheon said sir terence it is about to be served  you are very kind sir terence  they descended to find luncheon served already in the open under the trellis vine and the party consisted of lady omoy miss armytage captain tremayne major carruthers and count samoval of whose presence this was the adjutants first intimation  as a matter of fact the count had been at monsanto for the past hour the first half of which he had spent most agreeably on the terrace with the ladies he had spoken so eulogistically of the genius of lord wellington and the valour of the british soldier and particularlyof the irish soldier that even sylvias instinctive distrust and dislike of him had been lulled a little for the moment  and they must prevail he had exclaimed in a glow of enthusiasm his dark eyes flashing it is inconceivable that they should ever yield to the french although the odds of numbers may lie so heavily against them  are the odds of numbers so heavy said lady omoy in surprise opening wide those almost childish eyes of hers  alas anything from three to five to one ah but why should we despond on that account and his voice vibrated with renewed confidence the country is a difficult one easy to defend and lord wellingtons genius will have made the best of it there are for example the fortifications at torres vedras  ah yes i have heard of them tell me about them count  tell you about them dear lady shall i carry perfumes to the rose what can i tell you that you do not know so much better than myself  indeed i know nothing sir terence is ridiculously secretive she assured him with a little frown of petulance she realised that her husband did not treat her as an intelligent being to be consulted upon these matters she was his wife and he had no right to keep secrets from her in fact she said so  indeed no samoval agreed and i find it hard to credit that it should be so  then you forget said sylvia that these secrets are not sir terences own they are the secrets of his office  perhaps so said the unabashed samoval but if i were sir terence i should desire above all to allay my wifes natural anxiety for i am sure you must be anxious dear lady omoy  naturally she agreed whose anxieties never transcended the fit of her gowns or the suitability of a coiffure but terence is like that  incredible the count protested and raised his dark eyes to heaven as if invoking its punishment upon so unnatural a husband do you tell me that you have never so much as seen the plans of these fortifications  the plans count she almost laughed  ah he said i dare swear then that you do not even know of their existence he was jocular now  i am sure that she does not said sylvia who instinctively felt that the conversation was following an undesirable course  then you are wrong she was assured i saw them once a week ago in sir terences room  why how would you know them if you saw them quoth sylvia seeking to cover what might be an indiscretion  because they bore the name lines of torres vedras i remember  and this unsympathetic sir terence did not explain them to you laughed samoval  indeed he did not  in fact i could swear that he locked them away from you at once the count continued on a jocular note  not at once but he certainly locked them away soon after and whilst i was still there  in your place then said samoval ever on the same note of banter i should have been tempted to steal the key  not so easily done she assured him it never leaves his person he wears it on a gold chain round his neck  what always  always i assure you  too bad protested samoval too bad indeed what then should you have done miss armytage  it was difficult to imagine that he was drawing information from them so bantering and frivolous was his manner more difficult still to conceive that he had obtained any yet you will observe that he had been placed in possession of two facts that the plans of the lines of torres vedras were kept locked up in sir terences own roomin the strongbox no doubtand that sir terence always carried the key on a gold chain worn round his neck  miss armytage laughed whatever i might do i should not be guilty of prying into matters that my husband kept hidden  then you admit a husbands right to keep matters hidden from his wife  why not  madam samoval bowed to her your future husband is to be envied on yet another count  and thus the conversation drifted samoval conceiving that he had obtained all the information of which lady omoy was possessed and satisfied that he had obtained all that for the moment he required how to proceed now was a more difficult matter to be very seriously consideredhow to obtain from sir terence the key in question and reach the plans so essential to marshal massena  he was at table with them as you know when sir terence and colonel grant arrived he and the colonel were presented to each other and bowed with a gravity quite cordial on the part of samoval who was by far the more subtle dissembler of the two each knew the other perfectly for what he was yet each was in complete ignorance of the extent of the others knowledge of himself and certainly neither betrayed anything by his manner  at table the conversation was led naturally enough by tremayne to wellingtons general order against duelling this was inevitable when you consider that it was a topic of conversation that morning at every table to which british officers sat down tremayne spoke of the measure in terms of warm commendation thereby provoking a sharp disagreement from samoval the deep and almost instinctive hostility between these two men which had often been revealed in momentary flashes was such that it must invariably lead them to take opposing sides in any matter admitting of contention  in my opinion it is a most arbitrary and degrading enactment said samoval i say so without hesitation notwithstanding my profound admiration and respect for lord wellington and all his measures  degrading echoed grant looking across at him in what can it be degrading count  in that it reduces a gentleman to the level of the clod was the prompt answer a gentleman must have his quarrels however sweet his disposition and a means must be afforded him of settling them  ye can always thrash an impudent fellow opined the adjutant  thrash echoed samoval his sensitive lip curled in disdain to use your hands upon a man he shuddered in sheer disgust to one of my temperament it would be impossible and men of my temperament are plentiful i think  but if you were thrashed yourself tremayne asked him and the light in his grey eyes almost hinted at a dark desire to be himself the executioner  samovals dark handsome eyes considered the captain steadily to be thrashed myself he questioned my dear captain the idea of having hands laid upon me soiling me brutalising me is so nauseating so repugnant that i assure you i should not hesitate to shoot the man who did it just as i should shoot any other wild beast that attacked me indeed the two instances are exactly parallel and my countrys courts would uphold in such a case the justice of my conduct  then you may thank god said omoy that you are not under british jurisdiction  i do snapped samoval to make an instant recovery at least so far as the matter is concerned and he elaborated i assure you sirs it will be an evil day for the nobility of any country when its government enacts against the satisfaction that one gentleman has the right to demand from another who offends him  isnt the conversation rather too bloodthirsty for a luncheontable wondered lady omoy and tactlessly she added thinking with flattery to mollify samoval and cool his obvious heat you are yourself such a famous swordsman count  and then tremaynes dislike of the man betrayed him into his deplorable phrase  at the present time portugal is in urgent need of her famous swordsmen to go against the french and not to increase the disorders at home  a silence complete and ominous followed the rash words and samoval white to the lips pondered the imperturbable captain with a baleful eye  i think he said at last speaking slowly and softly and picking his words with care i think that is innuendo i should be relieved captain tremayne to hear you say that it is not  tremayne was prompt to give him the assurance no innuendo at all a plain statement of fact  the innuendo i suggested lay in the application of the phrase do you make it personal to myself  of course not said sir terence cutting in and speaking sharply what an assumption  i am asking captain tremayne the count insisted with grim firmness notwithstanding his deferential smile to sir terence  i spoke quite generally sir tremayne assured him partly under the suasion of sir terences interposition partly out of consideration for the ladies who were looking scared of course if you choose to take it to yourself sir that is a matter for your own discretion i think he added also with a smile that the ladies find the topic tiresome  perhaps we may have the pleasure of continuing it when they are no longer present  oh as you please was the indifferent answer carruthers may i trouble you to pass the salt lady ocallaghan was complaining the other night of the abuse of salt in portuguese cookery it is an abuse i have never yet detected  i cant conceive lady ocallaghan complaining of too much salt in anything begad quoth omoy with a laugh if you had heard the story she told me about  terence my dear his wife checked him her fine brows raised her stare frigid  faith we go from bad to worse said carruthers will you try to improve the tone of the conversation miss armytage it stands in urgent need of it  with a general laugh breaking the ice of the restraint that was in danger of settling about the table a semblance of ease was restored and this was maintained until the end of the repast at last the ladies rose and leaving the men at table they sauntered off towards the terrace but under the archway sylvia checked her cousin  una she said gravely you had better call captain tremayne and take him away for the present  unas eyes opened wide why she inquired  miss armytage was almost impatient with her didnt you see resentment is only slumbering between those men it will break out again now that we have left them unless you can get captain tremayne away  una continued to look at her cousin and then her mind fastening ever upon the trivial to the exclusion of the important her glance became arch for whom is your concern for count samoval or ned she inquired and added with a laugh you neednt answer me it is ned you are afraid for  i am certainly not afraid for him was the reply on a faint note of indignation she had reddened slightly but i should not like to see captain tremayne or any other british officer embroiled in a duel you forget lord wellingtons order which they were discussing and the consequences of infringing it  lady omoy became scared  you dont imagine  sylvia spoke quickly i am certain that unless you take captain tremayne away and at once there will be serious trouble  and now behold lady omoy thrown into a state of alarm that bordered upon terror she had more reason than sylvia could dream more reason she conceived than sylvia herself to wish to keep captain tremayne out of trouble just at present instantly agitatedly she turned and called to him  ned floated her silvery voice across the enclosed garden and again ned i want you at once please  captain tremayne rose grant was talking briskly at the time his intention being to cover tremaynes retreat which he himself desired count samovals smouldering eyes were upon the captain and full of menace but he could not be guilty of the rudeness of interrupting grant or of detaining captain tremayne when a lady called him     chapter xi the challenge   rebuke awaited captain tremayne at the hands of lady omoy and it came as soon as they were alone together sauntering in the thicket of pine and corkoak on the slope of the hill below the terrace  how thoughtless of you ned to provoke count samoval at such a time as this  did i provoke him i thought it was the count himself who was provoking tremayne spoke lightly  but suppose anything were to happen to you you know the mans dreadful reputation  tremayne looked at her kindly this apparent concern for himself touched him my dear una i hope i can take care of myself even against so formidable a fellow and after all a man must take his chances a soldier especially  but what of dick she cried do you forget that he is depending entirely upon youthat if you should fail him he will be lost and there was something akin to indignation in the protesting eyes she turned upon him  for a moment tremayne was so amazed that he was at a loss for an answer then he smiled indeed his inclination was to laugh outright the frank admission that her concern which he had fondly imagined to be for himself was all for dick betrayed a state of mind that was entirely typical of una never had she been able to command more than one point of view of any question and that point of view invariably of her own interest all her life she had been accustomed to sacrifices great and small made by others on her own behalf until she had come to look upon such sacrifices her absolute right  i am glad you reminded me he said with an irony that never touched her you may depend upon me to be discreetness itself at least until after dick has been safely shipped  thank you ned you are very good to me they sauntered a little way in silence then when does captain glennie sail she asked him is it decided yet  yes i have just heard from him that the telemachus will put to sea on sunday morning at two oclock  at two oclock in the morning what an uncomfortable hour  tides as king canute discovered are beyond mortal control the telemachus goes out with the ebb and after all for our purposes surely no hour could be more suitable if i come for dick at midnight tomorrow that will just give us time to get him snugly aboard before she sails i have made all arrangements with glennie he believes dick to be what he has represented himselfone of bearsleys overseers named jenkinson who is a friend of mine and who must be got out of the country quietly dick should thank his luck for a good deal my chief anxiety was lest his presence here should be discovered by any one  beyond bridget not a soul knows that he is here not even sylvia  you have been the soul of discreetness  havent i she purred delighted to have him discover a virtue so unusual in her  thereafter they discussed details or rather tremayne discussed them he would come up to monsanto at twelve oclock tomorrow night in a curricle in which he would drive dick down to the river at a point where a boat would be waiting to take him out to the telemachus she must see that dick was ready in time the rest she could safely leave to him he would come in through the official wing of the building the guard would admit him without question accustomed to seeing him come and go at all hours nor would it be remarked that he was accompanied by a man in civilian dress when he departed dick was to be let down from her ladyships balcony to the quadrangle by a rope ladder with which tremayne would come equipped having procured it for the purpose from the telemachus  she hung upon his arm overwhelming him now with her gratitude her parasol sheltering them both from the rays of the sun as they emerged from the thicket intro the meadowland in full view of the terrace where count samoval and sir terence were at that moment talking earnestly together  you will remember that omoy had undertaken to provide that count samovals visits to monsanto should be discontinued about this task he had gone with all the tact of which he had boasted himself master to colquhoun grant you shall judge of the tact for yourself no sooner had the colonel left for lisbon and carruthers to return to his work than finding himself alone with the count sir terence considered the moment a choice one in which to broach the matter  i take it yere fond of walking count had been his singular opening move they had left the table by now and were sauntering together on the terrace  walking said samoval i detest it  and is that so well well of course its not so very far from your place at bispo  not more than halfaleague i should say  just so said omoy halfaleague there and halfaleague back a league its nothing at all of course yet for a gentleman who detests walking its a devilish long tramp for nothing  for nothing samoval checked and looked at his host in faint surprise then he smiled very affably but you must not say that sir terence i assure you that the pleasure of seeing yourself and lady omoy cannot be spoken of as nothing  you are very good sir terence was the very quintessence of courtliness of concern for the other but if there were not that pleasure  then of course it would be different samoval was beginning to be slightly intrigued  thats it said sir terence thats just what im meaning  just what youre meaning but my dear general you are assuming circumstances which fortunately do not exist  not at present perhaps but they might  again samoval stood still and looked at omoy he found something in the bronzed rugged face that was unusually sardonic the blue eyes seemed to have become hard and yet there were wrinkles about their corners suggestive of humour that might be mockery the count stiffened but beyond that he preserved his outward calm whilst confessing that he did not understand sir terences meaning  its this way said sir terence ive noticed that yere not looking so very well lately count  really you think that the words were mechanical the dark eyes continued to scrutinise that bronzed face suspiciously  i do and its sorry i am to see it but i know what it is its this walking backwards and forwards between here and bispo thats doing the mischief better give it up count better not come toiling up here any more its not good for your health why man yere as white as a ghost this minute  he was indeed having perceived at last the insult intended to be denied the house at such a time was to checkmate his designs to set a term upon his crafty and subtle espionage precisely in the season when he hoped to reap its harvest but his chagrin sprang not at all from that his cold anger was purely personal he was a gentlemanof the fine flower as he would have described himselfof the nobility of portugal and that a probably upstart irish soldierhimself from samovals point of view a guest in that countryshould deny him his house and choose such terms of illconsidered jocularity in which to do it was an affront beyond all endurance  for a moment passion blinded him and it was only by an effort that he recovered and kept his selfcontrol but keep it he did you may trust your practised duellist for that when he comes face to face with the necessity to demand satisfaction and soon the mist of passion clearing from his keen wits he sought swiftly for a means to fasten the quarrel upon sir terence in sir terences own coin of galling mockery instantly he found it indeed it was not very far to seek omoys jealousy which was almost a byword as we know had been apparent more than once to samoval remembering it now it discovered to him at once sir terences most vulnerable spot and cunningly samoval proceeded to gall him there  a smile spread gradually over his white facea smile of immeasurable malice  i am having a very interesting and instructive morning in this atmosphere of irish boorishness said he first captain tremayne  now dont be after blaming old ireland for tremaynes shortcomings tremaynes just a clumsy mannered englishman  i am glad to know there is a distinction indeed i might have perceived it for myself in motives of course that distinction is great indeed and i hope that i am not slow to discover it and in your case to excuse it i quite understand and even sympathise with your feelings general  i am glad of that now said sir terence who had understood nothing of all this  naturally the count pursued on a smooth level note of amiability when a man himself no longer young commits the folly of taking a young and charming wife he is to be forgiven when a natural anxiety drives him to lengths which in another might be resented he bowed before the empurpling sir terence  yere a damned coxcomb it seems was the answering roar  of course you would assume it it was to be expected i condone it with the rest and because i condone it because i sympathise with what in a man of your age and temperament must amount to an affliction i hasten to assure you upon my honour that so far as i am concerned there are no grounds for your anxiety  and who the devil asks for your assurances its stark mad ye are to suppose that i ever needed them  of course you must say that samoval insisted with a confident and superior smile he shook his head his expression one of amused sorrow sir terence you have knocked at the wrong door you are youthful at least in your impulsiveness but you are surely as blind as old pantaloon in the comedy or you would see where your industry would be better employed in shielding your wifes honour and your own  goaded to fury his blue eyes aflame now with passion sir terence considered the sleek and subtle gentleman before him and it was in that moment that the counts subtlety soared to its finest heights in a flash of inspiration he perceived the advantages to be drawn by himself from conducting this quarrel to extremes  this is not mere idle speculation knowledge of the real motives actuating him rests upon the evidence of a letter which samoval was to write that same evening to la flecheafterwards to be discoveredwherein he related what had passed how deliberately he had steered the matter and what he meant to do his object was no longer the punishing of an affront that would happen as a mere incident a thing done as it were in passing his real aim now was to obtain the keys of the adjutants strongbox which never left sir terences person and so become possessed of the plans of the lines of torres vedras when you consider in the light of this the manner in which samoval proceeded now you will admire with me at once the opportunism and the subtlety of the man  youll be after telling me exactly what you mean sir terence had said  it was in that moment that tremayne and lady omoy came arm in arm into the open on the hillside halfamile awayvery close and confidential they came most opportunely to the counts need and he flung out a hand to indicate them to sir terence a smile of pity on his lips  you need but to look to take the answer for yourself said he  sir terence looked and laughed he knew the secret of ned tremaynes heart and could laugh now with relish at that which hitherto had left him darkly suspicious  and who shall blame lady omoy count samoval pursued a lady so charming and so courted must seek her consolation for the almost unnatural union fate has imposed upon her captain tremayne is of her own age convenient to her hand and for an englishman not illlooking  he smiled at omoy with insolent compassion and omoy losing all his selfcontrol struck him slapped him resoundingly upon the cheek  yere a dirty liar samoval a muckrake said he  samoval stepped back breathing hard one cheek red the other white yet by a miracle he still preserved his selfcontrol  i have proved my courage too often he said to be under the necessity of killing you for this blow since my honour is safe i will not take advantage of your overwrought condition  yell take advantage of it whether ye like it or not blazed sir terence at him i mean you to take advantage of it d ye think ill suffer any man to cast a slur upon lady omoy ill be sending my friends to wait on you today count andby godtremayne himself shall be one of them  thus did the hotheaded fellow deliver himself into the hands of his enemy nor was he warned when he saw the sudden gleam in samovals dark eyes  ha said the count it was a little exclamation of wicked satisfaction you are offering me a challenge then  if i may make so bold and as ive a mind to shoot you dead  shoot did you say samoval interrupted gently  i said shootand it shall be at ten paces or across a handkerchief or any damned distance you please  the count shook his head he sneered i think notnot shoot and he waved the notion aside with a hand white and slender as a womans that is too english or too irish the pistol i meanappropriately a fools weapon and he explained himself explained at last his extraordinary forbearance under a blow if you think i have practised the smallsword every day of my life for ten years to suffer myself to be shot at like a rabbit in the endho really he laughed aloud you have challenged me i think sir terence because i feared the predilection you have discovered i was careful to wait until the challenge came from you the choice of weapons lies i think with me i shall instruct my friends to ask for swords  sorry a difference will it make to me said sir terence anything from a horsewhip to a howitzer and then recollection descending like a cold hand upon him chilled his hot rage struck the fine irish arrogance all out of him and left him suddenly limp my god he said and it was almost a groan he detained samoval who had already turned to depart a moment count he cried ii had forgotten there is the general orderlord wellingtons enactment  awkward of course said samoval who had never for a moment been oblivious of that enactment and who had been carefully building upon it but you should have considered it before committing yourself so irrevocably  sir terence steadied himself he recovered his truculence irrevocable or not it will just have to be revocable the meetings impossible  i do not see the impossibility i am not surprised you should shelter yourself behind an enactment but you will remember this enactment does not apply to me who am not a soldier  but it applies to me who am not only a soldier but the adjutantgeneral here the man chiefly responsible for seeing the order carried out it would be a fine thing if i were the first to disregard it  i am afraid it is too late you have disregarded it already sir  how so  the letter of the law is against sending or receiving a challenge i think  omoy was distracted samoval he said drawing himself up i will admit that i have been a fool i will apologise to you for the blow and for the word that accompanied it  the apology would imply that my statement was a true one and that you recognised it if you mean that  i mean nothing of the kind damme ive a mind to horsewhip you and leave it at that d ye think i want to face a firing party on your account  i dont think there is the remotest likelihood of any such contingency replied samoval  but omoy went headlong on and another thing where will i be finding a friend to meet your friends who will dare to act for me in view of that enactment  the count considered he was grave now of course that is a difficulty he admitted as if he perceived it now for the first time under the circumstances sir terence and entirely to accommodate you i might consent to dispense with seconds  dispense with seconds sir terence was horrified at the suggestion you know that that is irregularthat a charge of murder would lie against the survivor  oh quite so but it is for your own convenience that i suggest it though i appreciate your considerate concern on the score of what may happen to me afterwards should it come to be known that i was your opponent  afterwards after what  after i have killed you  and is it like that cried omoy his countenance inflaming again his mind casting all prudence to the winds  it followed of course that without further thought for anything but the satisfaction of his rage sir terence became as wax in the hands of samovals desires  where do you suggest that we meet he asked  there is my place at bispo we should be private in the gardens there as for time the sooner the better though for secrecys sake we had better meet at night shall we say at midnight  but sir terence would agree to none of this  tonight is out of the question for me i have an engagement that will keep me until late tomorrow night if you will i shall be at your service and because he did not trust samoval he added as samoval himself had almost reckoned but i should prefer not to come to bispo i might be seen going or returning  since there are no such scruples on my side i am ready to come to you here if you prefer it  it would suit me better  then expect me promptly at midnight tomorrow provided that you can arrange to admit me without my being seen you will perceive my reasons  those gates will be closed said omoy indicating the now gaping massive doors that closed the archway at night but if you knock i shall be waiting for you and i will admit you by the wicket  excellent said samoval suavely thenuntil tomorrow night general he bowed with almost extravagant submission and turning walked sharply away energy and suppleness in every line of his slight figure leaving sir terence to the unpleasant almost desperate thoughts that reflection must usher in as his anger faded     chapter xii the duel   it was a time of stress and even of temptation for sir terence honour and pride demanded that he should keep the appointment made with samoval common sense urged him at all costs to avoid it his frame of mind you see was not at all enviable at moments he would consider his position as adjutantgeneral the enactment against duelling the irregularity of the meeting arranged and consequently the danger in which he stood on every score at others he could think of nothing but the unpardonable affront that had been offered him and the venomously insulting manner in which it had been offered and his rage welled up to blot out every consideration other than that of punishing samoval  for two days and a night he was a sort of shuttlecock tossed between these alternating moods and he was still the same when he paced the quadrangle with bowed head and hands clasped behind him awaiting samoval at a few minutes before twelve of the following night the windows that looked down from the four sides of that enclosed garden were all in darkness the members of the household had withdrawn over an hour ago and were asleep by now the official quarters were closed the rising moon had just mounted above the eastern wing and its white light fell upon the upper half of the facade of the residential site the quadrangle itself remained plunged in gloom  sir terence pacing there was considering the only definite conclusion he had reached if there were no way even now of avoiding this duel at least it must remain secret therefore it could not take place here in the enclosed garden of his own quarters as he had so rashly consented it should be fought upon neutral ground where the presence of the body of the slain would not call for explanations by the survivor  from distant lisbon on the still air came softly the chimes of midnight and immediately there was a sharp rap upon the little door set in one of the massive gates that closed the archway  sir terence went to open the wicket and samoval stepped quickly over the sill he was wrapped in a dark cloak a broadbrimmed hat obscured his face sir terence closed the door again the two men bowed to each other in silence and as samovals cloak fell open he produced a pair of duellingswords swathed together in a skin of leather  you are very punctual sir said omoy  i hope i shall never be so discourteous as to keep an opponent waiting it is a thing of which i have never yet been guilty replied samoval with deadly smoothness in that reminder of his victorious past he stepped forward and looked about the quadrangle i am afraid the moon will occasion us some delay he said it were perhaps better to wait some five or ten minutes by then the light in here should have improved  we can avoid the delay by stepping out into the open said sir terence indeed it is what i had to suggest in any case there are inconveniences here which you may have overlooked  but samoval who had purposes to serve of which this duel was but a preliminary was of a very different mind  we are quite private here your household being abed he answered whilst outside one can never be sure even at this hour of avoiding witnesses and interruption then again the turf is smooth as a table on that patch of lawn and the ground well known to both of us that i can assure you is a very necessary condition in the dark and one not to be found haphazard in the open  but there is yet another consideration sir i prefer that we engage on neutral ground so that the survivor shall not be called upon for explanations that might be demanded if we fought here  even in the gloom sir terence caught the flash of samovals white teeth as he smiled  you trouble yourself unnecessarily on my account was the smoothly ironic answer no one has seen me come and no one is likely to see me depart  you may be sure that no one shall by god snapped omoy stung by the sly insolence of the others assurance  shall we get to work then samoval invited  if youre set on dying here i suppose i must be after humouring you and make the best of it as soon as you please then omoy was very fierce  they stepped to the patch of lawn in the middle of the quadrangle and there samoval threw off altogether his cloak and hat he was closely dressed in black which in that light rendered him almost invisible sir terence less practised and less calculating in these matters wore an undress uniform the red coat of which showed greyish samoval observed this rather with contempt than with satisfaction in the advantage it afforded him then he removed the swathing from the swords and crossing them presented the hilts to sir terence the adjutant took one and the count retained the other which he tested thrashing the air with it so that it hummed like a whip that done however he did not immediately fall on  in a few minutes the moon will be more obliging he suggested if you would prefer to wait  but it occurred to sir terence that in the gloom the advantage might lie slightly with himself since the others superior swordplay would perhaps be partly neutralised he cast a last look round at the dark windows  i find it light enough he answered  samovals reply was instantaneous on guard then he cried and on the words without giving sir terence so much as time to comply with the invitation he whirled his point straight and deadly at the greyish outline of his opponents body but a ray of moonlight caught the blade and its livid flash gave sir terence warning of the thrust so treacherously delivered he saved himself by leaping backwardsjust saved himself with not an inch to spareand threw up his blade to meet the thrust  ye murderous villain he snarled under his breath as steel ground on steel and he flung forward to the attack  but from the gloom came a little laugh to answer him and his angry lunge was foiled by an enveloping movement that ended in a ripost with that they settled down to it sir terence in a rage upon which that assassin stroke had been fresh fuel the count cool and unhurried delaying until the moonlight should have crept a little farther so as to enable him to make quite sure that his stroke when delivered should be final  meanwhile he pressed sir terence towards the side where the moonlight would strike first until they were fighting close under the windows of the residential wing sir terence with his back to them samoval facing them it was fate that placed them so the fate that watched over sir terence even now when he felt his strength failing him his sword arm turning to lead under the strain of an unwonted exercise he knew himself beaten realised the dexterous ease the masterly economy of vigour and the deadly sureness of his opponents play he knew that he was at the mercy of samoval he was even beginning to wonder why the count should delay to make an end of a situation of which he was so completely master and then quite suddenly even as he was returning thanks that he had taken the precaution of putting all his affairs in order something happened  a light showed it flared up suddenly to be as suddenly extinguished and it had its source in the window of lady omoys dressingroom which samoval was facing  that flash drawing off the counts eyes for one instant and leaving them blinded for another had revealed him clearly at the same time to sir terence sir terences blade darted in driven by all that was left of his spent strength and samoval his eyes unseeing in that moment had fumbled widely and failed to find the others steel until he felt it sinking through his body searing him from breast to back  his arms sank to his sides quite nervelessly he uttered a faint exclamation of astonishment almost instantly interrupted by a cough he swayed there a moment the cough increasing until it choked him then suddenly limp he pitched forward upon his face and lay clawing and twitching at sir terences feet  sir terence himself scarcely realising what had taken place for the whole thing had happened within the time of a couple of heartbeats stood quite still amazed and awed in a halfcrouching attitude looking down at the body of the fallen man and then from above ringing upon the deathly stillness he caught a sibilant whisper  what was that sh  he stepped back softly and flattened himself instinctively against the wall thence profoundly intrigued and vaguely alarmed on several scores he peered up at the windows of his wifes room whence the sound had come whence the sudden light had come whichas he now realisedhad given him the victory in that unequal contest looking up at the balcony in whose shadow he stood concealed he saw two figures therehis wifes and anothersand at the same time he caught sight of something black that dangled from the narrow balcony and peered more closely to discover a rope ladder  he felt his skin roughening bristling like a dogs he was conscious of being cold from head to foot as if the flow of his blood had been suddenly arrested and a sense of sickness overcame him and then to turn that horrible doubt of his into still more horrible certainty came a mans voice subdued yet not so subdued but that he recognised it for ned tremaynes  theres some one lying there i can make out the figure  dont go down for pitys sake come back come back and wait ned if any one should come and find you we shall be ruined  thus hoarsely whispering vibrating with terror the voice of his wife reached omoy to confirm him the unsuspecting blind cuckold that samoval had dubbed him to his face for which samovalwarning the guilty pair with his last breath even as he had earlier so mockingly warned sir terencehad coughed up his soul on the turf of that enclosed garden  crouching there for a moment longer a man bereft of movement and of reason stood omoy conscious only of pain in an agony of mind and heart that at one and the same time froze his blood and drew the sweat from his brow  then he was for stepping out into the open and giving flow to the rage and surging violence that followed calling down the man who had dishonoured him and slaying him there under the eyes of that trull who had brought him to this shame but he controlled the impulse or else satan controlled it for him that way whispered the tempter was too straight and simple he must think he must have time to readjust his mind to the horrible circumstances so suddenly revealed  very soft and silently keeping well within the shadow of the wall he sidled to the door which he had left ajar soundlessly he pushed it open passed in and as soundlessly closed it again for a moment he stood leaning heavily against its timbers his breath coming in short panting sobs then he steadied himself and turning made his way down the corridor to the little study which had been fitted up for him in the residential wing and where sometimes he worked at night he had been writing there that evening ever since dinner and he had quitted the room only to go to his assignation with samoval leaving the lamp burning on his open desk  he opened the door but before passing in he paused a moment straining his ears to listen for sounds overhead his eyes glancing up and down were arrested by a thin blade of light under a door at the end of the corridor it was the door of the butlers pantry and the line of light announced that mullins had not yet gone to bed at once sir terence understood that knowing him to be at work the old servant had himself remained below in case his master should want anything before retiring  continuing to move without noise sir terence entered his study closed the door and crossed to his desk wearily he dropped into the chair that stood before it his face drawn and ghastly his smouldering eyes staring vacantly ahead on the desk before him lay the letters that he had spent the past hours in writingone to his wife another to tremayne another to his brother in ireland and several others connected with his official duties making provision for their uninterrupted continuance in the event of his not surviving the encounter  now it happened that amongst the latter there was one that was destined hereafter to play a considerable part it was a note for the commissarygeneral upon a matter that demanded immediate attention and the only one of all those letters that need now survive it was marked most urgent and had been left by him for delivery first thing in the morning he pulled open a drawer and swept into it all the letters he had written save that one  he locked that drawer then unlocked another and took thence a case of pistols with shaking hands he lifted out one of the weapons to examine it and all the while of course his thoughts were upon his wife and tremayne he was considering how wellfounded had been his every twinge of jealousy how wasted how senseless the reactions of shame that had followed them how insensate his trust in tremaynes honesty and above all with what crafty treacherous subtlety tremayne had drawn a red herring across the trail of his suspicions by pretending to an unutterable passion for sylvia armytage it was perhaps that piece of duplicity worthy he thought of the iscariot himself that galled sir terence now most sorely that and the memory of his own silly credulity he had been such a ready dupe how those two together must have laughed at him oh tremayne had been very subtle he had been the friend the quasibrother parading his affection for the butler family to excuse the familiarities with lady omoy which he had permitted himself under sir terences very eyes omoy thought of them as he had seen them in the garden on the night of redondos ball remembered the air of transparent honesty by which that damned hypocrite when discovered had deflected his just resentment  oh there was no doubt that the treacherous blackguard had been subtle butby godsubtlety should be repaid with subtlety he would deal with tremayne as cruelly as tremayne had dealt with him and his wanton wife too should be repaid in kind he beheld the way clear in a flash of wicked inspiration he put back the pistol slapped down the lid of the box and replaced it in its drawer  he rose took up the letter to the commissarygeneral stepped briskly to the door and pulled it open  mullins he called sharply are you there mullins  came the sound of a scraping chair and instantly that door at the end of the corridor was thrown open and mullins stood silhouetted against the light behind him a moment he stood there then came forward  you called sir terence  yes sir terences voice was miraculously calm his back was to the light and his face in shadow so that its drawn haggard look was not perceptible to the butler i am going to bed but first i want you to step across to the sergeant of the guard with this letter for the commissarygeneral tell him that it is of the utmost importance and ask him to arrange to have it taken into lisbon first thing in the morning  mullins bowed venerable as an archdeacon in aspect and bearing as he received the letter from his master certainly sir terence  as he departed sir terence turned and slowly paced back to his desk leaving the door open his eyes had narrowed there was a cruel an almost evil smile on his lips of the generous goodhumoured nature imprinted upon his face every sign had vanished his countenance was a mask of ferocity restrained by intelligence cold and calculating  oh he would pay the score that lay between himself and those two who had betrayed him they should receive treachery for treachery mockery for mockery and for dishonour death they had deemed him an old fool what was the expression that samoval had usedpantaloon in the comedy well well he had been pantaloon in the comedy so far but now they should find him pantaloon in the tragedynay not pantaloon at all but polichinelle the sinister jester the cynical clown who laughs in murdering and in anguished silence should they bear the punishment he would mete out to them or else in no less anguished speech themselves proclaim their own dastardy to the world  his wife he beheld now in a new light it was out of vanity and greed that she had married him because of the position in the world that he could give her having done so at least she might have kept faith she might have been honest and abided by the bargain if she had not done so it was because honesty was beyond her shallow nature he should have seen before what he now saw so clearly he should have known her for a lovely empty husk a silly fluttering butterfly a toy a thing of vanities emotions and nothing else  thus sir terence cursing the day when he had mated with a fool thus sir terence whilst he stood there waiting for the outcry from mullins that should proclaim the discovery of the body and afford him a pretext for having the house searched for the slayer nor had he long to wait  sir terence sir terence for gods sake sir terence he heard the voice of his old servant came the loud crash of the door thrust back until it struck the wall and quick steps along the passage  sir terence stepped out to meet him  why what the devil he was beginning in his bluff normal tones when the servant showing a white scared face cut him short  a terrible thing sir terence oh the saints protect us a dreadful thing this way sir theres a man killedcount samoval i think it is  what where  out yonder in the quadrangle sir  but sir terence checked count samoval did ye say impossible and he went out quickly followed by the butler  in the quadrangle he checked in the few minutes that were sped since he had left the place the moon had overtopped the roof of the opposite wing so that full upon the enclosed garden fell now its white light illumining and revealing  there lay the black still form of samoval supine his white face staring up into the heavens and beside him knelt tremayne whilst in the balcony above leaned her ladyship the rope ladder sir terences swift glance observed had disappeared  he halted in his advance standing at gaze a moment he had hardly expected so much he had conceived the plan of causing the house to be searched immediately upon mullinss discovery of the body but tremaynes rashness in adventuring down in this fashion spared him even that necessity true it set up other difficulties but he was not sure that the matter would not be infinitely more interesting thus  he stepped forward and came to a standstill beside the twohis dead enemy and his living one     chapter xiii polichinelle   why ned he asked gravely what has happened  it is samoval was tremaynes quiet answer he is quite dead  he stood up as he spoke and sir terence observed with terrible inward mirth that his tone had the frank and honest ring his bearing the imperturbable ease which more than once before had imposed upon him as the outward signs of an easy conscience this secretary of his was a cool scoundrel  samoval is it said sir terence and went down on one knee beside the body to make a perfunctory examination then he looked up at the captain  and how did this happen  happen echoed tremayne realising that the question was being addressed particularly to himself that is what i am wondering i found him here in this condition  you found him here oh you found him here in this condition curious over his shoulder he spoke to the butler mullins you had better call the guard he picked up the slender weapon that lay beside samoval a duelling sword then he looked searchingly about him until his eyes caught the gleam of the other blade near the wall where himself he had dropped it ah he said and went to pick it up very odd he looked up at the balcony over the parapet of which his wife was leaning did you see anything my dear he asked and neither tremayne nor she detected the faint note of wicked mockery in the question  there was a moments pause before she answered him faltering  nno i saw nothing sir terences straining ears caught no faintest sound of the voice that had prompted her urgently from behind the curtained windows  how long have you been there he asked her  aa moment only she replied again after a pause ii thought i heard a cry andand i came to see what had happened her voice shook with terror but what she beheld would have been quite enough to account for that  the guard filed in through the doors from the official quarters a sergeant with a halbert in one hand and a lantern in the other followed by four men and lastly by mullins they halted and came to attention before sir terence and almost at the same moment there was a sharp rattling knock on the wicket in the great closed gates through which samoval had entered startled but without showing any signs of it sir terence bade mullins go open and in a general silence all waited to see who it was that came  a tall man bowing his shoulders to pass under the low lintel of that narrow door stepped over the sill and into the courtyard he wore a cocked hat and as his great cavalry cloak fell open the yellow rays of the sergeants lantern gleamed faintly on a british uniform presently as he advanced into the quadrangle he disclosed the aquiline features of colquhoun grant  goodevening general goodevening tremayne he greeted one and the other then his eyes fell upon the body lying between them samoval eh so i am not mistaken in seeking him here i have had him under very close observation during the past day or two and when one of my men brought me word tonight that he had left his place at bispo on foot and alone going along the upper alcantara road if had a notion that he might be coming to monsanto and i followed but i hardly expected to find this how has it happened  that is what i was just asking tremayne replied sir terence mullins discovered him here quite by chance with the body  oh said grant and turned to the captain was it you then  i interrupted tremayne with sudden violence he seemed now to become aware for the first time of the gravity of his position certainly not colonel grant i heard a cry and i came out to see what it was i found samoval here already dead  i see said grant you were with sir terence then when this  nay sir terence interrupted i have been alone since dinner clearing up some arrears of work i was in my study there when mullins called me to tell me what he had discovered it looks as if there had been a duel look at these swords then he turned to his secretary i think captain tremayne he said gravely that you had better report yourself under arrest to your colonel  tremayne stiffened suddenly report myself under arrest he cried my god sir terence you dont believe that i  sir terence interrupted him the voice in which he spoke was stern almost sad but his eyes gleamed with fiendish mockery the while it was polichinelle that spokepolichinelle that mocks what time he slays what were you doing here he asked and it was like moving the checkmating piece  tremayne stood stricken and silent he cast a desperate upward glance at the balcony overhead the answer was so easy but it would entail delivering richard butler to his death colonel grant following his upward glance beheld lady omoy for the first time he bowed swept off his cocked hat and perhaps her ladyship he suggested to sir terence may have seen something  i have already asked her replied omoy  and then she herself was feverishly assuring colonel grant that she had seen nothing at all that she had heard a cry and had come out on to the balcony to see what was happening  and was captain tremayne here when you came out asked omoy the deadly jester  yees she faltered i was only a moment or two before yourself  you see said sir terence heavily to grant and grant with pursed lips nodded his eyes moving from omoy to tremayne  but sir terence cried tremayne i give you my wordi swear to youthat i know absolutely nothing of how samoval met his death  what were you doing here omoy asked again and this time the sinister menacing note of derision vibrated clearly in the question  tremayne for the first time in his honest upright life found himself deliberately choosing between truth and falsehood the truth would clear himsince with that truth he would produce witnesses to it establishing his movements completely but the truth would send a man to his death and so for the sake of that mans life he was driven into falsehood  i was on my way to see you he said  at midnight cried sir terence on a note of grim doubt to what purpose  really sir terence if my word is not sufficient i refuse to submit to crossexamination  sir terence turned to the sergeant of the guard how long is it since captain tremayne arrived he asked  the sergeant stood to attention captain tremayne sir arrived rather more than halfanhour ago he came in a curricle which is still waiting at the gates  halfanhour ago eh said sir terence and from colquhoun grant there was a sharp and audible intake of breath expressive either of understanding or surprise or both the adjutant looked at tremayne again as my questions seem only to entangle you further he said i think you had better do as i suggest without more protests report yourself under arrest to colonel fletcher in the morning sir  still tremayne hesitated for a moment then drawing himself up he saluted curtly very well sir he replied  but terence cried her ladyship from above  ah said sir terence and he looked up you would say he encouraged her for she had broken off abruptly checked againalthough none below could guess itby the one behind who prompted her  couldnt youcouldnt you wait she was faltering compelled to it by his question  certainly but for what quoth he grimly sardonic  wait until you have some explanation she concluded lamely  that will be the business of the courtmartial he answered my duty is quite clear and simple i think you neednt wait captain tremayne  and so without another word tremayne turned and departed the soldiers in compliance with the short command issued by sir terence took up the body and bore it away to a room in the official quarters and in their wake went colonel grant after taking his leave of sir terence her ladyship vanished from the balcony and closed her windows and finally sir terence followed by mullins slowly with bowed head and dragging steps reentered the house in the quadrangle flooded now by the cold white light of the moon all was peace once more sir terence turned into his study sank into the chair by his desk and sat there awhile staring into vacancy a diabolical smile upon his handsome mobile mouth gradually the smile faded and horror overspread his face finally he flung himself forward and buried his head in his arms  there were steps in the hall outside a quick mutter of voices and then the door of his study was flung open and miss armytage came sharply to rouse him  terence what has happened to captain tremayne  he sat up stiffly as she sped across the room to him she was wrapped in a blue quilted bedgown her dark hair hung in two heavy plaits and her bare feet had been hastily thrust into slippers  sir terence looked at her with eyes that were dull and heavy and that yet seemed to search her white startled face  she set a hand on his shoulder and looked down into his ravaged haggard countenance he seemed suddenly to have been stricken into an old man  mullins has just told me that captain tremayne has been ordered under arrest forfor killing count samoval is it true is it true she demanded wildly  it is true he answered her and there was a heavy sneering curl on his upper lip  but she stopped and put a hand to her throat she looked as if she would stifle she sank to her knees beside him and caught his hand in both her own that were trembling oh you cant believe it captain tremayne is not the man to do a murder  the evidence points to a duel he answered dully  a duel she looked at him and then remembering what had passed that morning between tremayne and samoval remembering too lord wellingtons edict oh god she gasped why did you let them take him  they didnt take him i ordered him under arrest he will report himself to colonel fletcher in the morning  you ordered him you you his friend anger scorn reproach and sorrow all blending in her voice bore him a clear message  he looked down at her most closely and gradually compassion crept into his face he set his hands on her shoulders she suffering it passively insensibly  you care for him sylvia he said between inquiry and wonder well well we are both fools together child the man is a dastard a blackguard a judas to be repaid with betrayal for betrayal forget him girl believe me he isnt worth a thought  terence she looked in her turn into that distorted face are you mad she asked him  very nearly he answered with a laugh that was horrible to hear  she drew back and away from him bewildered and horrified slowly she rose to her feet she controlled with difficulty the deep emotion swaying her tell me she said slowly speaking with obvious effort what will they do to captain tremayne  what will they do to him he looked at her he was smiling they will shoot him of course  and you wish it she denounced him in a whisper of horror  above all things he answered a more poetic justice never overtook a blackguard  why do you call him that what do you mean  i will tell youafterwards after they have shot him unless the truth comes out before  what truth do you mean the truth of how samoval came by his death  oh no that matter is quite clear the evidence complete i meanoh i will tell you afterwards what i mean it may help you to bear your trouble thankfully  she approached him again wont you tell me now she begged him  no he answered rising and speaking with finality afterwards if necessary afterwards and now get back to bed child and forget the fellow i swear to you that he isnt worth a thought later i shall hope to prove it to you  that you never will she told him fiercely  he laughed and again his laugh was harsh and terrible in its bitter mockery yet another trusting fool he cried the world is full of themit is made up of them with just a sprinkling of knaves to batten on their folly go to bed sylvia and pray for understanding of men it is a possession beyond riches  i think you are more in need of it than i am she told him standing by the door  of course you do you trust which is why you are a fool trust he said speaking the very language of polichinelle is the livery of fools  she went without answering him and toiled upstairs with dragging feet she paused a moment in the corridor above outside unas door she was in such need of communion with some one that for a moment she thought of going in but she knew beforehand the greeting that would await her the empty platitudes the obvious small change of verbiage which her ladyship would dole out the very thought of it restrained her and so she passed on to her own room and a sleepless night in which to piece together the puzzle which the situation offered her the amazing enigma of sir terences seeming access of insanity  and the only conclusion that she reached was that intertwined with the death of samoval there was some other circumstance which had aroused in the adjutant an unreasoning hatred of his friend converting him into tremaynes bitterest enemy intentas he had confessedupon seeing him shot for that nights work and because she knew them both for men of honour above all the enigma was immeasurably deepened  had she but obeyed the transient impulse to seek lady omoy she might have discovered all the truth at once for she would have come upon her ladyship in a frame of mind almost as distraught as her own and she mighthad she penetrated to the dressingroom where her ladyship washave come upon richard butler at the same time  now in view of what had happened her ladyship ever impulsive was all for going there and then to her husband to confess the whole truth without pausing to reflect upon the consequences to others than ned tremayne as you know it was beyond her to see a thing from two points of view at one and the same time it was also beyond her brotherthe failing as i think i have told you was a family oneand her brother saw this matter only from the point of view of his own safety  a single word to terence he had told her putting his back to the door of the dressingroom to bar her intended egress and you realise that it will be a courtmartial and a firing party for me  that warning effectively checked her yet certain stirrings of conscience made her think of the man who had imperilled himself for her sake and her brothers  but dick what is to become of ned she had asked him  oh ned will be all right what is the evidence against him after all men are not shot for things they havent done justice will out you know leave ned to shift for himself for the present anyhow his danger isnt grave nor is it immediate and mine is  helplessly distraught she sank to an ottoman the night had been a very trying one for her ladyship she gave way to tears  it is all your fault dick she reproached him  naturally you would blame me he said with resignationthe complete martyr  if only you had been ready at the time as he told you to be there would have been no delays and you would have got away before any of this happened  was it my fault that i should have reopened my woundbad luck to itin attempting to get down that damned ladder he asked her is it my fault that i am neither an ape nor an acrobat tremayne should have come up at once to assist me instead of waiting until he had to come up to help me bandage my leg again then time would not have been lost and very likely my life with it he came to a gloomy conclusion  your life what do you mean dick  just that what are my chances of getting away now he asked her was there ever such infernal luck as mine the telemachus will sail without me and the only man who could and would have helped me to get out of this damned country is under arrest its clear i shall have to shift for myself again and i cant even do that for a day or two with my leg in this state i shall have to go back into that stuffy storecupboard of yours till god knows when he lost all selfcontrol at the prospect and broke into imprecations of his luck  she attempted to soothe him but he wasnt easy to soothe  and then he grumbled on you have so little sense that you want to run straight off to terence and explain to him what tremayne was doing here you might at least have the grace to wait until i am off the premises and give me the mercy of a start before you set the dogs on my trail  oh dick dick you are so cruel she protested how can you say such things to me whose only thought is for you to save you  then dont talk any more about telling terence he replied  i wont dick i wont she drew him down beside her on the ottoman and her fingers smoothed his rather tumbled red hair just as her words attempted to smooth the ruffles in his spirit you know i didnt realise or i should not have thought of it even i was so concerned for ned for the moment  dont i tell you theres not the need he assured her ned will be safe enough devil a doubt its for you to keep to what you told them from the balcony that you heard a cry went out to see what was happening and saw tremayne there bending over the body not a word more and not a word less or it will be all over with me     chapter xiv the champion   with the possible exception of her ladyship i do not think that there was much sleep that night at monsanto for any of the four chief actors in this tragicomedy each had his own preoccupations sylvias we know mr butler found his leg troubling him again and the pain of the reopened wound must have prevented him from sleeping even had his anxieties about his immediate future not sufficed to do so as for sir terence his was the most deplorable case of all this man who had lived a life of simple and downright honesty in great things and in small a man who had never stooped to the slightest prevarication found himself suddenly launched upon the most horrible and infamous course of duplicity to encompass the ruin of another the offence of that other against himself might be of the most foul and hideous a piece of treachery that only treachery could adequately avenge yet this consideration was not enough to appease the clamours of sir terences selfrespect  in the end however the primary desire for vengeance and vengeance of the bitterest kind proved master of his mind captain tremayne had been led by his villainy into a coil that should presently crush him and sir terence promised himself an infinite balm for his outraged honour in the entertainment which the futile struggles of the victim should provide with captain tremayne lay the cruel choice of submitting in tortured silence to his fate or of turning craven and saving his miserable life by proclaiming himself a seducer and a betrayer it should be interesting to observe how the captain would decide and his punishment was certain whatever the decision that he took  sir terence came to breakfast in the open greyfaced and haggard but miraculously composed for a man who had so little studied the art of concealing his emotions voice and glance were calm as he gave a goodmorning to his wife and to miss armytage  what are you going to do about ned was one of his wifes first questions  it took him aback he looked askance at her marvelling at the steadiness with which she bore his glance until it occurred to him that effrontery was an essential part of the equipment of all harlots  what am i going to do he echoed why nothing the matter is out of my hands i may be asked to give evidence i may even be called to sit upon the courtmartial that will try him my evidence can hardly assist him my conclusions will naturally be based upon the evidence that is laid before the court  her teaspoon rattled in her saucer i dont understand you terence ned has always been your best friend  he has certainly shared everything that was mine  and you know she went on that he did not kill samoval  indeed his glance quickened a little how should i know that  well i know it anyway  he seemed moved by that statement he leaned forward with an odd eagerness behind which there was something terrible that went unperceived by her  why did you not say so before how do you know what do you know  i am sure that he did not  yes yes but what makes you so sure do you possess some knowledge that you have not revealed  he saw the colour slowly shrinking from her cheeks under his burning gaze so she was not quite shameless then after all there were limits to her effrontery  what knowledge should i possess she filtered  that is what i am asking  she made a good recovery i possess the knowledge that you should possess yourself she told him i know ned for a man incapable of such a thing i am ready to swear that he could not have done it  i see evidence as to character he sank back into his chair and thoughtfully stirred his chocolate it may weigh with the court but i am not the court and my mere opinions can do nothing for ned tremayne  her ladyship looked at him wildly the court she cried do you mean that i shall have to give evidence  naturally he answered you will have to say what you saw  butbut i saw nothing  something i think  yes but nothing that can matter  still the court will wish to hear it and perhaps to examine you upon it  oh no no in her alarm she half rose then sank again to her chair you must keep me out of this terence i couldnti really couldnt  he laughed with an affectation of indulgence masking something else  why he said you would not deprive tremayne of any of the advantages to be derived from your testimony are you not ready to bear witness as to his character to swear that from your knowledge of the man you are sure he could not have done such a thing that he is the very soul of honour a man incapable of anything base or treacherous or sly  and then at last sylvia who had been watching them and seeking to apply to what she heard the wild expressions that sir terence had used to herself last night broke into the conversation  why do you apply these words to captain tremayne she asked  he turned sharply to meet the opposition he detected in her i dont apply them on the contrary i say that as una knows they are not applicable  then you make an unnecessary statement a statement that has nothing to do with the case captain tremayne has been arrested for killing count samoval in a duel a duel may be a violation of the law as recently enacted by lord wellington but it is not an offence against honour and to say that a man cannot have fought a duel because a man is incapable of anything base or treacherous or sly is just to say a very foolish and meaningless thing  oh quite so the adjutant admitted but if tremayne denies having fought if he shelters himself behind a falsehood and says that he has not killed samoval then i think the statement assumes some meaning  does captain tremayne say that she asked him sharply  it is what i understood him to say last night when i ordered him under arrest  then said sylvia with full conviction captain tremayne did not do it  perhaps he didnt sir terence admitted the court will no doubt discover the truth the truth you know must prevail and he looked at his wife again marking the fresh signs of agitation she betrayed  mullins coming to set fresh covers the conversation was allowed to lapse nor was it ever resumed for at that moment with no other announcement save such as was afforded by his quick step and the clickclick of his spurs a short slight man entered the quadrangle from the doorway of the official wing  the adjutant turning to look caught his breath suddenly in an exclamation of astonishment  lord wellington he cried and was immediately on his feet  at the exclamation the newcomer checked and turned he wore a plain grey undress frock and white stock buckskin breeches and lacquered boots and he carried a ridingcrop tucked under his left arm his features were bold and sternly handsome his fine eyes singularly piercing and keen in their glance and the sweep of those eyes now took in not merely the adjutant but the spread table and the ladies seated before it he halted a moment then advanced quickly swept his cocked hat from a brown head that was but very slightly touched with grey and bowed with a mixture of stiffness and courtliness to the ladies  since i have intruded so unwittingly i had best remain to make my apologies he said i was on my way to your residential quarters omoy not imagining that i should break in upon your privacy in this fashion  omoy with a great deference made haste to reassure him on the score of the intrusion whilst the ladies themselves rose to greet him he bore her ladyships hand to his lips with perfunctory courtesy then insisted upon her resuming her chair then he bowedever with that mixture of stiffness and deferenceto miss armytage upon her being presented to him by the adjutant  do not suffer me to disturb you he begged them sit down omoy i am not pressed and i shall be monstrous glad of a few moments rest you are very pleasant here and he looked about the luxuriant garden with approving eyes  sir terence placed the hospitality of his table at his lordships disposal but the latter declined graciously  a glass of wine and water if you will no more i breakfasted at torres vedras with fletcher then to the look of astonishment on the faces of the ladies he smiled oh yes he assured them i was early astir for time is very precious just at present which is why i drop unannounced upon you from the skies omoy he took the glass that mullins proffered on a salver sipped from it and set it down there is so much vexation so much hindrance from these pestilential intriguers here in lisbon that i have thought it as well to come in person and speak plainly to the gentlemen of the council of regency he was peeling off his stout ridinggloves as he spoke if this campaign is to go forward at all it will go forward as i dispose then too i wanted to see fletcher and the works by gad omoy he has performed miracles and i am very pleased with himoh and with you too he told me how ably you have seconded him and counselled him where necessary you must have worked night and day omoy he sighed i wish that i were as well served in every direction and then he broke off abruptly but this is monstrous tedious for your ladyship and for you miss armytage forgive me  her ladyship protested the contrary professing a deep interest in military matters and inviting his lordship to continue lord wellington however ignoring the invitation turned the conversation upon life in lisbon inquiring hopefully whether they found the place afforded them adequate entertainment  indeed yes lady omoy assured him we are very gay at times there are private theatricals and dances occasionally an official ball and we are promised picnics and waterparties now that the summer is here  and in the autumn maam we may find you a little hunting his lordship promised them plenty of foxes a rough country though but whats that to an irishwoman he caught the quickening of miss armytages eye the prospect interests you i see  miss armytage admitted it and thus they made conversation for a while what time the great soldier sipped his wine and water to wash the dust of his morning ride from his throat when at last he set down an empty glass sir terence took this as the intimation of his readiness to deal with official matters and rising he announced himself entirely at his lordships service  lord wellington claimed his attention for a full hour with the details of several matters that are not immediately concerned with this narrative having done he rose at last from sir terences desk at which he had been sitting and took up his ridingcrop and cocked hat from the chair where he had placed them  and now he said i think i will ride into lisbon and endeavour to come to an understanding with count redondo and don miguel forjas  sir terence advanced to open the door but wellington checked him with a sudden sharp inquiry  you published my order against duelling did you not  immediately upon receiving it sir  ha it doesnt seem to have taken long for the order to be infringed then his manner was severe his eyes stern sir terence was conscious of a quickening of his pulses nevertheless his answer was calmly regretful  i am afraid not  the great man nodded disgraceful i heard of it from fletcher this morning captain whatshisname had just reported himself under arrest i understand and fletcher had received a note from you giving the grounds for this the deplorable part of these things is that they always happen in the most troublesome manner conceivable in berkeleys case the victim was a nephew of the patriarchs samoval now was a person of even greater consequence a close friend of several members of the council his death will be deeply resented and may set up fresh difficulties it is monstrous vexatious and abruptly he asked what did they quarrel about  omoy trembled and his glance avoided the others gimlet eye the only quarrel that i am aware of between them he said was concerned with this very enactment of your lordships samoval proclaimed it infamous and tremayne resented the term hot words passed between them but the altercation was allowed to go no further at the time by myself and others who were present  his lordship had raised his brows by gad sir he ejaculated there almost appears to be some justification for the captain he was one of your military secretaries was he not  he was  ha pity pity his lordship was thoughtful for a moment then he dismissed the matter but then orders are orders and soldiers must learn to obey implicitly british soldiers of all degrees seem to find the lesson difficult we must inculcate it more sternly that is all  omoys honest soul was in torturing revolt against the falsehoods he had impliedand to this man of all men to this man whom he reverenced above all others who stood to him for the very fount of military honour and lofty principle he was in such a mood that one more question on the subject from wellington and the whole ghastly truth must have come pouring from his lips but no other question came instead his lordship turned on the threshold and held out his hand  not a step farther omoy ive left you a mass of work and you are short of a secretary so dont waste any of your time on courtesies i shall hope still to find the ladies in the garden so that i may take my leave without inconveniencing them  and he was gone stepping briskly with clicking spurs leaving omoy hunched now in his chair his body the very expression of the dejection that filled his soul  in the garden his lordship came upon miss armytage alone still seated by the table under the trellis from which the cloth had by now been removed she rose at his approach and in spite of gesture to her to remain seated  i was seeking lady omoy said he to take my leave of her i may not have the pleasure of coming to monsanto again  she is on the terrace i think said miss armytage i will find her for your lordship  let us find her together he said amiably and so turned and went with her towards the archway you said your name is armytage i think he commented  sir terence said so  his eyes twinkled you possess an exceptional virtue said he to be truthful is common to be accurate rare well then sir terence said so once i had a great friend of the name of armytage i have lost sight of him these many years we were at school together in brussels  at monsieur gouberts she surprised him by saying that would be john armytage my uncle  god bless my soul maam he ejaculated but i gathered you were irish and jack armytage came from yorkshire  my mother is irish and we live in ireland now i was born there but father none the less was john armytages brother  he looked at her with increased interest marking the straight supple lines of her and the handsome highbred face his lordship remember never lacked an appreciative eye for a fine woman so youre jack armytages niece give me news of him my dear  she did so jack armytage was well and prospering had made a rich marriage and retired from the blues many years ago to live at northampton he listened with interest and thus out of his boyhood friendship for her uncle which of late years he had had no opportunity to express sprang there and then a kindness for the niece her own personal charms may have contributed to it for the great soldier was intensely responsive to the appeal of beauty   they reached the terrace lady omoy was nowhere in sight but lord wellington was too much engrossed in his discovery to be troubled  my dear he said if i can serve you at any time both for jacks sake and your own i hope that you will let me know of it  she looked at him a moment and he saw her colour come and go arguing a sudden agitation  you tempt me sir she said with a wistful smile  then yield to the temptation child he urged her kindly those keen penetrating eyes of his perceiving trouble here  it isnt for myself she responded yet there is something i would ask you if i daresomething i had intended to ask you in any case if i could find the opportunity to be frank that is why i was waiting there in the garden just now it was to waylay you i hoped for a word with you  well well he encouraged her it should be the easier now since in a sense we find that we are old friends  he was so kind so gentle despite that stern strong face of his that she melted at once to his persuasion  it is about lieutenant richard butler she began  ah said he lightly i feared as much when you said it was not for yourself you had a favour to ask  but looking at him she instantly perceived how he had misunderstood her  mr butler she said is the officer who was guilty of the affair at tavora  he knit his brow in thought butlertavora he muttered questioningly suddenly his memory found what it was seeking oh yes the violated nunnery his thin lips tightened the sternness of his ace increased yes he inquired but the tone was now forbidding  nevertheless she was not deterred mr butler is lady omoys brother she said  he stared a moment taken aback good god ye dont say so child her brother omoys brotherinlaw and omoy never said a word to me about it  what should he say sir terence himself pledged his word to the council of regency that mr butler would be shot when taken  did he egad he was still further surprised out of his sternness something of a roman this omoy in his conception of duty hum the council no doubt demanded this  so i understand my lord lady omoy realising her brothers grave danger is very deeply troubled  naturally he agreed but what can i do miss armytage what were the actual facts do you happen to know  she recited them putting the case bravely for the scapegrace mr butler dwelling particularly upon the error under which he was labouring that he had imagined himself to be knocking at the gates of a monastery of dominican friars that he had broken into the convent because denied admittance and because he suspected some treacherous reason for that denial  he heard her out watching her with those keen eyes of his the while  hum you make out so good a case for him that one might almost believe you instructed by the gentleman himself yet i gather that nothing has since been heard of him  nothing sir since he vanished from tavora nearly two months ago and i have only repeated to your lordship the tale that was told by the sergeant and the troopers who reported the matter to sir robert craufurd on their return  he was very thoughtful leaning on the balustrade he looked out across the sunlit valley turning his boldly chiselled profile to his companion at last he spoke slowly reflectively but if this were really soa mere blunderi see no sufficient grounds to threaten him with capital punishment his subsequent desertion if he has desertedi mean if nothing has happened to himis really the graver matter of the two  i gathered sir that he was to be sacrificed to the council of regencya sort of scapegoat  he swung round sharply and the sudden blaze of his eyes almost terrified her instantly he was cold again and inscrutable ah you are oddly well informed throughout but of course you would be he added with an appraising look into that intelligent face in which he now caught a faint likeness of jack armytage well well my dear i am very glad you have told me of this if mr butler is ever taken and in dangerthere will be a courtmartial of coursesend me word of it and i will see what i can do both for your sake and for the sake of strict justice  oh not for my sake she protested reddening slightly at the gentle imputation mr butler is nothing to methat is to say he is just my cousin it is for unas sake that i am asking this  why then for lady omoys sake since you ask it he replied readily but he warned her say nothing of it until mr butler is found it is possible he believed that butler never would be found and remember i promise only to give the matter my attention if it is as you represent it i think you may be sure that the worst that will befall mr butler will be dismissal from the service he deserves that but i hope i should be the last man to permit a british officer to be used as a scapegoat or a burntoffering to the mob or to any council of regency by the way who told you this about a scapegoat  captain tremayne  captain tremayne oh the man who killed samoval  he didnt she cried  on that almost fierce denial his lordship looked at her raising his eyebrows in astonishment  but i am told that he did and he is under arrest for it this momentfor that and for breaking my order against duelling  you were not told the truth my lord captain tremayne says that he didnt and if he says so it is so  oh of course miss armytage he was a man of unparalleled valour and boldness yet so fierce was she in that moment that for the life of him he dared not have contradicted her  captain tremayne is the most honourable man i know she continued and if he had killed samoval he would never have denied it he would have proclaimed it to all the world  there is no need for all this heat my dear he reassured her the point is not one that can remain in doubt the seconds of the duel will be forthcoming and they will tell us who were the principals  there were no seconds she informed him  no seconds he cried in horror d ye mean they just fought a rough and tumble fight  i mean they never fought at all as for this tale of a duel i ask your lordship had captain tremayne desired a secret meeting with count samoval would he have chosen this of all places in which to hold it  this  this the fightwhoever fought ittook place in the quadrangle there at midnight  he was overcome with astonishment and he showed it  upon my soul he said i do not appear to have been told any of the facts strange that omoy should never have mentioned that he muttered and then inquired suddenly where was tremayne arrested  here she informed him  here he was here then at midnight what was he doing here  i dont know but whatever he was doing can your lordship believe that he would have come here to fight a secret duel  it certainly puts a monstrous strain upon belief said he but what can he have been doing here  i dont know she repeated she wanted to add a warning of omoy she was tempted to tell his lordship of the odd words that omoy had used to her last night concerning tremayne but she hesitated and her courage failed her lord wellington was so great a man bearing the destinies of nations on his shoulders and already he had wasted upon her so much of the time that belonged to the world and history that she feared to trespass further and whilst she hesitated came colquhoun grant clanking across the quadrangle looking for his lordship he had come up he announced standing straight and stiff before them to see omoy but hearing of lord wellingtons presence had preferred to see his lordship in the first instance  and indeed you arrive very opportunely grant his lordship confessed  he turned to take his leave of jack armytages niece  ill not forget either mr butler or captain tremayne he promised her and his stern face softened into a gentle friendly smile they are very fortunate in their champion     chapter xv the wallet   a queer mysterious business this death of samoval said colonel grant  so i was beginning to perceive wellington agreed his brow dark  they were alone together in the quadrangle under the trellis through which the sun already high was dappling the table at which his lordship sat  it would be easier to read if it were not for the duelling swords those and the nature of samovals wound certainly point unanswerably to a duel otherwise there would be considerable evidence that samoval was a spy caught in the act and dealt with out of hand as he deserved  how count samoval a spy  in the french interest answered the colonel without emotion acting upon the instructions of the souza faction whose tool he had become and colonel grant proceeded to relate precisely what he knew of samoval  lord wellington sat awhile in silence cogitating then he rose and his piercing eyes looked up at the colonel who stood a good head taller than himself  is this the evidence of which you spoke  by no means was the answer the evidence i have secured is much more palpable i have it here he produced a little wallet of red morocco bearing the initial s surmounted by a coronet opening it he selected from it some papers speaking the while i thought it as well before i left last night to make an examination of the body this is what i found and it contains among other lesser documents these to which i would draw your lordships attention first this and he placed in lord wellingtons hand a holograph note from the prince of esslingen introducing the bearer m de la fleche his confidential agent who would consult with the count and thanking the count for the valuable information already received from him  his lordship sat down again to read the letter it is a full confirmation of what you have told me he said calmly  then this said colonel grant and he placed upon the table a note in french of the approximate number and disposition of the british troops in portugal at the time the handwriting is samovals own as those who know it will have no difficulty in discerning and now this sir he unfolded a small sketch map bearing the title also in french probable position and extent of the fortifications north of lisbon  the notes at the foot he added are in cipher and it is the ordinary cipher employed by the french which in itself proves how deeply samoval was involved here is a translation of it and he placed before his chief a sheet of paper on which lord wellington read  this is based upon my own personal knowledge of the country odd scraps of information received from time to time and my personal verification of the roads closed to traffic in that region it is intended merely as a guide to the actual locale of the fortifications an exact plan of which i hope shortly to obtain  his lordship considered it very attentively but without betraying the least discomposure  for a man working upon such slight data as he himself confesses was the quiet comment he is damnably accurate it is as well i think that this did not reach marshal massena  my own assumption is that he put off sending it intending to replace it by the actual planwhich he here confesses to the expectation of obtaining shortly  i think he died at the right moment anything else  indeed said colonel grant i have kept the best for the last and unfolding yet another document he placed it in the hands of the commanderinchief it was lord liverpools note of the troops to be embarked for lisbon in june and julythe note abstracted from the dispatch carried by captain garfield  his lordships lips tightened as he considered it his death was timely indeed damned timely and the man who killed him deserves to be mentioned in dispatches nothing else i suppose  the rest is of little consequence sir  very well he rose you will leave these with me and the wallet as well if you please i am on my way to confer with the members of the council of regency and i am glad to go armed with so stout a weapon as this whatever may be the ultimate finding of the courtmartial the present assumption must be that samoval met the death of a spy caught in the act as you suggested that is the only conclusion the portuguese government can draw when i lay these papers before it they will effectively silence all protests  shall i tell omoy inquired the colonel  oh certainly answered his lordship instantly to change his mind stay he considered his chin in his hand his eyes dreamy better not perhaps better not tell anybody let us keep this to ourselves for the present it has no direct bearing on the matter to be tried by the way when does the courtmartial sit  i have just heard that marshal beresford has ordered it to sit on thursday here at monsanto  his lordship considered perhaps i shall be present i may be at torres vedras until then it is a very odd affair what is your own impression of it grant have you formed any  grant smiled darkly i have been piecing things together the result is rather curious and still very mystifying still leaving a deal to be explained and somehow this wallet doesnt fit into the scheme at all  you shall tell me about it as we ride into lisbon i want you to come with me lady omoy must forgive me if i take french leave since she is nowhere to be found  the truth was that her ladyship had purposely gone into hiding after the fashion of suffering animals that are denied expression of their pain she had gone off with her load of sorrow and anxiety into the thicket on the flank of monsanto and there sylvia found her presently dejectedly seated by a spring on a bank that was thick with flowering violets her ladyship was in tears her mind swollen to burstingpoint by the secret which it sought to contain but felt itself certainly unable to contain much longer  why una dear cried miss armytage kneeling beside her and putting a motherly arm about that fullgrown child what is this  her ladyship wept copiously the springs of her grief gushing forth in response to that sympathetic touch  oh my dear i am so distressed i shall go mad i think i am sure i have never deserved all this trouble i have always been considerate of others you know i wouldnt give pain to any one andand dick has always been so thoughtless  dick said miss armytage and there was less sympathy in her voice it is dick you are thinking about at present  of course all this trouble has come through dick i mean she recovered that all my troubles began with this affair of dicks and now there is ned under arrest and to be courtmartialled  but what has captain tremayne to do with dick  nothing of course her ladyship agreed with more than usual selfrestraint but its one trouble on another oh its more than i can bear  i know my dear i know miss armytage said soothingly and her own voice was not so steady  you dont know how can you it isnt your brother or your friend it isnt as if you cared very much for either of them if you did if you loved dick or ned you might realise what i am suffering  miss armytages eyes looked straight ahead into the thick green foliage and there was an odd smile half wistful half scornful on her lips  yet i have done what i could she said presently i have spoken to lord wellington about them both  lady omoy checked her tears to look at her companion and there was dread in her eyes  you have spoken to lord wellington  yes the opportunity came and i took it  and whatever did you tell him she was all atremble now as she clutched miss armytages hand  miss armytage related what had passed how she had explained the true facts of dicks case to his lordship how she had protested her faith that tremayne was incapable of lying and that if he said he had not killed samoval it was certain that he had not done so and finally how his lordship had promised to bear both cases in his mind  that doesnt seem very much her ladyship complained  but he said that he would never allow a british officer to be made a scapegoat and that if things proved to be as i stated them he would see that the worst that happened to dick would be his dismissal from the army he asked me to let him know immediately if dick were found  more than ever was her ladyship on the very edge of confiding a chance word might have broken down the last barrier of her will but that word was not spoken and so she was given the opportunity of first consulting her brother  he laughed when he heard the story  a trap to take me thats all he pronounced it my dear girl that stiffnecked martinet knows nothing of forgiveness for a military offence discipline is the god at whose shrine he worships and he afforded her anecdotes to illustrate and confirm his assertion of lord wellingtons ruthlessness i tell you he concluded its nothing but a trap to catch me and if you had been fool enough to yield and to have blabbed of my presence to sylvia you would have had it proved to you  she was terrified and of course convinced for she was easy of conviction believing always the last person to whom she spoke she sat down on one of the boxes that furnished that cheerless refuge of mr butlers  then whats to become of ned she cried oh i had hoped that we had found a way out at last  he raised himself on his elbow on the campbed they had fitted up for him  be easy now he bade her impatiently they cant do anything to ned until they find him guilty and how are they going to find him guilty when hes innocent  yes but the appearances  fiddlesticks he answered herand the expression chosen was a mere concession to her sex and not at all what mr butler intended appearances cant establish guilt do be sensible and remember that they will have to prove that he killed samoval and you cant prove a thing to be what it isnt you cant  are you sure  certain sure he replied with emphasis  do you know that i shall have to give evidence before the court she announced resentfully  it was an announcement that gave him pause thoughtfully he stroked his abominable tuft of red beard then he dismissed the matter with a shrug and a smile  well and what of it he cried they are not likely to bully you or crossexamine you just tell them what you saw from the balcony indeed you cant very well say anything else or they will see that you are lying and then heaven alone knows what may happen to you as well as to me  she got up in a pet youre callous dickcallous she told him oh i wish you had never come to me for shelter  he looked at her and sneered thats a matter you can soon mend he told her call up terence and the others and have me shot i promise i shall make no resistance you see im not able to resist even if i would  oh how can you think it she was indignant  well what is a poor devil to think you blow hot and cold all in a breath im sick and ill and feverish he continued with selfpity and now even you find me a trouble i wish to god theyd shoot me and make an end im sure it would be best for everybody  and now she was on her knees beside him soothing him protesting that he had misunderstood her that she had meantoh she didnt know what she had meant she was so distressed on his account  and theres never the need to be he assured her surely you can be guided by me if you want to help me as soon as ever my leg gets well again ill be after fending for myself and trouble you no further but if you want to shelter me until then do it thoroughly and dont give way to fear at every shadow without substance that falls across your path  she promised it and on that promise left him and believing him she bore herself more cheerfully for the remainder of the day but that evening after they had dined her fears and anxieties drove her at last to seek her natural and legal protector  sir terence had sauntered off towards the house gloomy and silent as he had been throughout the meal she ran after him now and came tripping lightly at his side up the steps she put her arm through his  terence dear you are not going back to work again she pleaded  he stopped and from his fine height looked down upon her with a curious smile slowly he disengaged his arm from the clasp of her own i am afraid i must he answered coldly i have a great deal to do and i am short of a secretary when this inquiry is over i shall have more time to myself perhaps there was something so repellent in his voice in his manner of uttering those last words that she stood rebuffed and watched him vanish into the building  then she stamped her foot and her pretty mouth trembled  oaf she said aloud     chapter xvi the evidence   the board of officers convened by marshal beresford to form the court that was to try captain tremayne was presided over by general sir harry stapleton who was in command of the british troops quartered in lisbon it included amongst others the adjutantgeneral sir terence omoy colonel fletcher of the engineers who had come in haste from torres vedras having first desired to be included in the board chiefly on account of his friendship for tremayne and major carruthers the judgeadvocates task of conducting the case against the prisoner was deputed to the quartermaster of tremaynes own regiment major swan  the court sat in a long cheerless hall once the refectory of the franciscans who had been the first tenants of monsanto it was stoneflagged the windows set at a height of some ten feet from the ground the bare whitewashed walls hung with very wooden portraits of longdeparted kings and princes of portugal who had been benefactors of the order  the court occupied the abbots table which was set on a shallow dais at the end of the rooma table of stone with a covering of oak over which a green cloth had been spread the officerstwelve in number besides the presidentsat with their backs to the wall immediately under the inevitable picture of the last supper  the court being sworn captain tremayne was brought in by the provostmarshals guard and given a stool placed immediately before and a few paces from the table perfectly calm and imperturbable he saluted the court and sat down his guards remaining some paces behind him  he had declined all offers of a friend to represent him on the grounds that the court could not possibly afford him a case to answer  the president a florid rather pompous man who spoke with a faint lisp cleared his throat and read the charge against the prisoner from the sheet with which he had been suppliedthe charge of having violated the recent enactment against duelling made by the commanderinchief of his majestys forces in the peninsula in so far as he had fought a duel with count jeronymo de samoval and of murder in so far as that duel conducted in an irregular manner and without any witnesses had resulted in the death of the said count jeronymo de samoval  how say you then captain tremayne the judgeadvocate challenged him are you guilty of these charges or not guilty  not guilty  the president sat back and observed the prisoner with an eye that was officially benign tremaynes glance considered the court and met the concerned and grave regard of his colonel of his friend carruthers and of two other friends of his own regiment the cold indifference of three officers of the fourteenththen stationed in lisbon with whom he was unacquainted and the utter inscrutability of omoys rather lowering glance which profoundly intrigued him and lastly the official hostility of major swan who was on his feet setting forth the case against him of the remaining members of the court he took no heed  from the opening address it did not seem to captain tremayne as if this casewhich had been hurriedly prepared by major swan chiefly that same morning would amount to very much briefly the major announced his intention of establishing to the satisfaction of the court how on the night of the 28th of may the prisoner in flagrant violation of an enactment in a general order of the 26th of that same month had engaged in a duel with count jeronymo de samoval a peer of the realm of portugal  followed a short statement of the case from the point of view of the prosecution an anticipation of the evidence to be called upon which the major thoughtrather sanguinely opined captain tremayneto convict the accused he concluded with an assurance that the evidence of the prisoners guilt was as nearly direct as evidence could be in a case of murder  the first witness called was the butler mullins he was introduced by the sergeantmajor stationed by the double doors at the end of the hall from the anteroom where the witnesses commanded to be present were in waiting  mullins rather less venerable than usual as a consequence of agitation and affliction on behalf of captain tremayne to whom he was attached stated nervously the facts within his knowledge he was occupied with the silver in his pantry having remained up in case sir terence who was working late in his study should require anything before going to bed sir terence called him and  at what time did sir terence call you asked the major  it was ten minutes past twelve sir by the clock in my pantry  you are sure that the clock was right   quite sure sir i had put it right that same evening  very well then sir terence called you at ten minutes past twelve pray continue  he gave me a letter addressed to the commissarygeneral take that says he to the sergeant of the guard at once and tell him to be sure that it is forwarded to the commissarygeneral first thing in the morning i went out at once and on the lawn in the quadrangle i saw a man lying on his back on the grass and another man kneeling beside him i ran across to them it was a bright moonlight nightbright as day it was and you could see quite clear the gentleman that was kneeling looks up at me and i sees it was captain tremayne sir whats this captain dear says i its count samoval and hes kilt says he for gods sake go and fetch somebody so i ran back to tell sir terence and sir terence he came out with me and mighty startled he was at what he found there whats happenedsays he and the captain answers him just as he had answered me its count samoval and hes kilt but how did it happen says sir terence sure and thats just what i want to know says the captain i found him here and then sir terence turns to me and mullins says he just fetch the guard and of course i went at once  was there any one else present asked the prosecutor  not in the quadrangle sir but lady omoy was on the balcony of her room all the time  well then you fetched the guard what happened when you returned  colonel grant arrived sir and i understood him to say that he had been following count samoval  which way did colonel grant come put in the president  by the gate from the terrace  was it open  no sir sir terence himself went to open the wicket when colonel grant knocked  sir harry nodded and major swan resumed the examination  what happened next  sir terence ordered the captain under arrest  did captain tremayne submit at once  well not quite at once sir he naturally made some bother good god he says yell never be after thinking i kilt him i tell you i just found him here like this what were ye doing here then says sir terence i was coming to see you says the captain what about says sir terence and with that the captain got angry said he refused to be crossquestioned and went off to report himself under arrest as he was bid  that closed the butlers evidence and the judgeadvocate looked across at the prisoner  have you any questions for the witness he inquired  none replied captain tremayne he has given his evidence very faithfully and accurately  major swan invited the court to question the witness in any manner it considered desirable the only one to avail himself of the invitation was carruthers who out of his friendship and concern for tremayneand a conviction of tremaynes innocence begotten chiefly by that friendship desired to bring out anything that might tell in his favour  what was captain tremaynes bearing when he spoke to you and to sir terence  quite as usual sir  he was quite calm not at all perturbed  devil a bit not until sir terence ordered him under arrest and then he was a little hot  thank you mullins  dismissed by the court mullins would have departed but that upon being told by the sergeantmajor that he was at liberty to remain if he chose he found a seat on one of the benches ranged against the wall  the next witness was sir terence who gave his evidence quietly from his place at the board immediately on the presidents right he was pale but otherwise composed and the first part of his evidence was no more than a confirmation of what mullins had said an exact and strictly truthful statement of the circumstances as he had witnessed them from the moment when mullins had summoned him  you were present i believe sir terence said major swan at an altercation that arose on the previous day between captain tremayne and the deceased  yes it happened at lunch here at monsanto  what was the nature of it  count samoval permitted himself to criticise adversely lord wellingtons enactment against duelling and captain tremayne defended it they became a little heated and the fact was mentioned that samoval himself was a famous swordsman captain tremayne made the remark that famous swordsmen were required by count samovals country to save it from invasion the remark was offensive to the deceased and although the subject was abandoned out of regard for the ladies present it was abandoned on a threat from count samoval to continue it later  was it so continued  of that i have no knowledge  invited to crossexamine the witness captain tremayne again declined admitting freely that all that sir terence had said was strictly true then carruthers who appeared to be intent to act as the prisoners friend took up the examination of his chief  it is of course admitted that captain tremayne enjoyed free access to monsanto practically at all hours in his capacity as your military secretary sir terence  admitted said sir terence  and it is therefore possible that he might have come upon the body of the deceased just as mullins came upon it  it is possible certainly the evidence to come will no doubt determine whether it is a tenable opinion  admitting this then the attitude in which captain tremayne was discovered would be a perfectly natural one it would be natural that he should investigate the identity and hurt of the man he found there  certainly  but it would hardly be natural that he should linger by the body of a man he had himself slain thereby incurring the risk of being discovered  that is a question for the court rather than for me  thank you sir terence and as no one else desired to question him sir terence resumed his seat and lady omoy was called  she came in very white and trembling accompanied by miss armytage whose admittance was suffered by the court since she would not be called upon to give evidence one of the officers of the fourteenth seated on the extreme right of the table made gallant haste to set a chair for her ladyship which she accepted gratefully  the oath administered she was invited gently by major swan to tell the court what she knew of the case before them  butbut i know nothing she faltered in evident distress and sir terence his elbow leaning on the table covered his mouth with his hand that its movements might not betray him his eyes glowered upon her with a ferocity that was hardly dissembled  if you will take the trouble to tell the court what you saw from your balcony the major insisted the court will be grateful  perceiving her agitation and attributing it to nervousness moved also by that delicate loveliness of hers and by deference to the adjutantgenerates lady sir harry stapleton intervened  is lady omoys evidence really necessary he asked does it contribute any fresh fact regarding the discovery of the body  no sir major swan admitted it is merely a corroboration of what we have already heard from mullins and sir terence  then why unnecessarily distress this lady  oh for my own part sir the prosecutor was submitting when sir terence cut in  i think that in the prisoners interest perhaps lady omoy will not mind being distressed a little it was at her he looked and for her and tremayne alone that he intended the cutting lash of sarcasm concealed from the rest of the court by his smooth accent mullins has said i think that her ladyship was on the balcony when he came into the quadrangle her evidence therefore takes us further back in point of time than does mullinss again the sarcastic double meaning was only for those two considering that the prisoner is being tried for his life i do not think we should miss anything that may however slightly affect our judgment  sir terence is right i think sir the judgeadvocate supported  very well then said the president proceed if you please  will you be good enough to tell the court lady omoy how you came to be upon the balcony  her pallor had deepened and her eyes looked more than ordinarily large and childlike as they turned this way and that to survey the members of the court nervously she dabbed her lips with a handkerchief before answering mechanically as she had been schooled  i heard a cry and i ran out  you were in bed at the time of course quoth her husband interrupting  what on earth has that to do with it sir terence the president rebuked him out of his earnest desire to cut this examination as short as possible  the question sir does not seem to me to be without point replied omoy he was judicially smooth and selfcontained it is intended to enable us to form an opinion as to the lapse of time between her ladyships hearing the cry and reaching the balcony  grudgingly the president admitted the point and the question was repeated  yees came lady omoys tremulous faltering answer i was in bed  but not asleepor were you asleep rapped omoy again and in answer to the presidents impatient glance again explained himself we should know whether perhaps the cry might not have been repeated several times before her ladyship heard it that is of value  it would be more regular ventured the judgeadvocate if sir terence would reserve his examination of the witness until she has given her evidence  very well grumbled sir terence and he sat back foiled for the moment in his deliberate intent to torture her into admissions that must betray her if made  i was not asleep she told the court thus answering her husbands last question i heard the cry and ran to the balcony at once thatthat is all  but what did you see from the balcony asked major swan  it was night and of courseitit was dark she answered  surely not dark lady omoy there was a moon i thinka full moon  yes butbutthere was a good deal of shadow in the garden andand i couldnt see anything at first  but you did eventually  oh eventually yes eventually her fingers were twisting and untwisting the handkerchief they held and her distressed loveliness was very piteous to see yet it seems to have occurred to none of them that this distress and the minor contradictions into which it led her were the result of her intent to conceal the truth of her terror lest it should nevertheless be wrung from her only omoy watching her and reading in her every word and glance and gesture the signs of her falsehood knew the hideous thing she strove to hide even it seemed at the cost of her lovers life to his lacerated soul her torture was a balm gloating he watched her then and watched her lover marvelling at the blackguards complete selfmastery and impassivity even now  major swan was urging her gently  eventually then what was it that you saw  i saw a man lying on the ground and another kneeling over him and thenalmost at oncemullins came out and  i dont think we need take this any further major swan the president again interposed we have heard what happened after mullins came out  unless the prisoner wishes began the judgeadvocate  by no means said tremayne composedly although outwardly impassive he had been watching her intently and it was his eyes that had perturbed her more than anything in that court it was she who must determine for him how to proceed how far to defend himself he had hoped that by now dick butler might have been got away so that it would have been safe to tell the whole truth although he began to doubt how far that could avail him how far indeed it would be believed in the absence of dick butler her evidence told him that such hopes as he may have entertained had been idle and that he must depend for his life simply upon the courts inability to bring the guilt home to him in this he had some confidence for knowing himself innocent it seemed to him incredible that he could be proven guilty failing that nothing short of the discovery of the real slayer of samoval could save himand that was a matter wrapped in the profoundest mystery the only man who could conceivably have fought samoval in such a place was sir terence himself but then it was utterly inconceivable that in that case sir terence who was the very soul of honour should not only keep silent and allow another man to suffer but actually sit there in judgment upon that other and besides there was no quarrel nor ever had been between sir terence and samoval  there is major swan was saying just one other matter upon which i should like to question lady omoy and thereupon he proceeded to do so your ladyship will remember that on the day before the event in which count samoval met his death he was one of a small luncheon party at your house here in monsanto  yes she replied wondering fearfully what might be coming now  would your ladyship be good enough to tell the court who were the other members of that party  itit was hardly a party sir she answered with her unconquerable insistence upon trifles we were just sir terence and myself miss armytage count samoval colonel grant major carruthers and captain tremayne  can your ladyship recall any words that passed between the deceased and captain tremayne on that occasionwords of disagreement i mean  she knew that there had been something but in her benumbed state of mind she was incapable of remembering what it was all that remained in her memory was sylvias warning after she and her cousin had left the table sylvias insistence that she should call captain tremayne away to avoid trouble between himself and the count but search as she would the actual subject of disagreement eluded her moreover it occurred to her suddenly and sowed fresh terror in her soul that whatever it was it would tell against captain tremayne  ii am afraid i dont remember she faltered at last  try to think lady omoy  ii have tried but ii cant her voice had fallen almost to a whisper  need we insist put in the president compassionately there are sufficient witnesses as to what passed on that occasion without further harassing her ladyship  quite so sir the major agreed in his dry voice it only remains for the prisoner to question the witness if he so wishes  tremayne shook his head it is quite unnecessary sir he assured the president and never saw the swift grim smile that flashed across sir terences stern face  of the court sir terence was the only member who could have desired to prolong the painful examination of her ladyship but he perceived from the presidents attitude that he could not do so without betraying the vindictiveness actuating him and so he remained silent for the present he would have gone so far as to suggest that her ladyship should be invited to remain in court against the possibility of further evidence being presently required from her but that he perceived there was no necessity to do so her deadly anxiety concerning the prisoner must in itself be sufficient to determine her to remain as indeed it proved accompanied and half supported by miss armytage who was almost as pale as herself but otherwise very steady in her bearing lady omoy made her way with faltering steps to the benches ranged against the side wall and sat there to hear the remainder of the proceedings  after the uninteresting and perfunctory evidence of the sergeant of the guard who had been present when the prisoner was ordered under arrest the next witness called was colonel grant his testimony was strictly in accordance with the facts which we know him to have witnessed but when he was in the middle of his statement an interruption occurred  at the extreme right of the dais on which the table stood there was a small oaken door set in the wall and giving access to a small anteroom that was known rightly or wrongly as the abbots chamber that anteroom communicated directly with what was now the guardroom which accounts for the newcomer being ushered in that way by the corporal at the time  at the opening of that door the members of the court looked round in sharp annoyance suspecting here some impertinent intrusion the next moment however this was changed to respectful surprise there was a scraping of chairs and they were all on their feet in token of respect for the slight man in the grey undress frock who entered it was lord wellington  saluting the members of the court with two fingers to his cocked hat he immediately desired them to sit peremptorily waving his hand and requesting the president not to allow his entrance to interrupt or interfere with the course of the inquiry  a chair here for me if you please sergeant he called and when it was fetched took his seat at the end of the table with his back to the door through which he had come and immediately facing the prosecutor he retained his hat but placed his ridingcrop on the table before him and the only thing he would accept was an officers notes of the proceedings as far as they had gone which that officer himself was prompt to offer with a repeated injunction to the court to proceed lord wellington became instantly absorbed in the study of these notes  colonel grant standing very straight and stiff in the originally red coat which exposure to many weathers had faded to an autumnal brown continued and concluded his statement of what he had seen and heard on the night of the 28th of may in the garden at monsanto  the judgeadvocate now invited him to turn his memory back to the luncheonparty at sir terences on the 27th and to tell the court of the altercation that had passed on that occasion between captain tremayne and count samoval  the conversation at table he replied turned as was perhaps quite natural upon the recently published general order prohibiting duelling and making it a capital offence for officers in his majestys service in the peninsula count samoval stigmatised the order as a degrading and arbitrary one and spoke in defence of single combat as the only honourable method of settling differences between gentlemen captain tremayne dissented rather sharply and appeared to resent the term degrading applied by the count to the enactment words followed and then some onelady omoy i think and as i imagine with intent to soothe the feelings of count samoval which appeared to be ruffledappealed to his vanity by mentioning the fact that he was himself a famous swordsman to this captain tremaynes observation was a rather unfortunate one although i must confess that i was fully in sympathy with it at the time he said as nearly as i remember that at the moment portugal was in urgent need of famous swords to defend her from invasion and not to increase the disorders at home  lord wellington looked up from the notes and thoughtfully stroked his highbridged nose his stern handsome face was coldly impassive his fine eyes resting upon the prisoner but his attention all to what colonel grant was saying  it was a remark of which samoval betrayed the bitterest resentment he demanded of captain tremayne that he should be more precise and tremayne replied that whilst he had spoken generally samoval was welcome to the cap if he found it fitted him to that he added a suggestion that as the conversation appeared to be tiresome to the ladies it would be better to change its topic count samoval consented but with the promise rather threateningly delivered that it should be continued at another time that sir is all i think  have you any questions for the witness captain tremayne inquired the judgeadvocate  as before captain tremaynes answer was in the negative coupled with the now usual admission that colonel grants statement accorded perfectly with his own recollection of the facts  the court however desired enlightenment on several subjects came first of all carrutherss inquiries as to the bearing of the prisoner when ordered under arrest eliciting from colonel grant a variant of the usual reply  it was not inconsistent with innocence he said  it was an answer which appeared to startle the court and perhaps carruthers would have acted best in tremaynes interest had he left the question there but having obtained so much he eagerly sought for more  would you say that it was inconsistent with guilt he cried  colonel grant smiled slowly and slowly shook his head i fear i could not go so far as that he answered thereby plunging poor carruthers into despair  and now colonel fletcher voiced a question agitating the minds of several members of the count  colonel grant he said you have told us that on the night in question you had count samoval under observation and that upon word being brought to you of his movements by one of your agents you yourself followed him to monsanto would you be good enough to tell the court why you were watching the deceaseds movements at the time  colonel grant glanced at lord wellington he smiled a little reflectively and shook his head  i am afraid that the public interest will not allow me to answer your question since however lord wellington himself is present i would suggest that you ask his lordship whether i am to give you the information you require  certainly not said his lordship crisply without awaiting further question indeed one of my reasons for being present is to ensure that nothing on that score shall transpire  there followed a moments silence then the president ventured a question may we ask sir at least whether colonel grants observation of count samoval resulted from any knowledge of or expectation of this duel that was impending  certainly you may ask that lord wellington consented  it did not sir said colonel grant in answer to the question  what grounds had you colonel grant for assuming that count samoval was going to monsanto the president asked  chiefly the direction taken  and nothing else  i think we are upon forbidden ground again said colonel grant and again he looked at lord wellington for direction  i do not see the point of the question said lord wellington replying to that glance colonel grant has quite plainly informed the court that his observation of count samoval had no slightest connection with this duel nor was inspired by any knowledge or suspicion on his part that any such duel was to be fought with that i think the court should be content it has been necessary for colonel grant to explain to the court his own presence at monsanto at midnight on the 28th it would have been better perhaps had he simply stated that it was fortuitous although i can understand that the court might have hesitated to accept such a statement that however is really all that concerns the matter colonel grant happened to be there that is all that the court need remember let me add the assurance that it would not in the least assist the court to know more so far as the case under consideration is concerned  in view of that the president notified that he had nothing further to ask the witness and colonel grant saluted and withdrew to a seat near lady omoy  there followed the evidence of major carruthers with regard to the dispute between count samoval and captain tremayne which substantially bore out what sir terence and colonel grant had already said notwithstanding that it manifested a strong bias in favour of the prisoner  the conversation which samoval threatened to resume does not appear to have been resumed he added in conclusion  how can you say that major swan asked him  i may state my opinion sir flashed carruthers his chubby face reddening  indeed sir you may not the president assured him you are upon oath to give evidence of facts directly within your own personal knowledge  it is directly within my own personal knowledge that captain tremayne was called away from the table by lady omoy and that he did not have another opportunity of speaking with count samoval that day i saw the count leave shortly after and at the time captain tremayne was still with her ladyshipas her ladyship can testify if necessary he spent the remainder of the afternoon with me at work and we went home together in the evening we share the same lodging in alcantara  there was still all of the next day said sir harry do you say that the prisoner was never out of your sight on that day too  i do not but i cant believe  i am afraid you are going to state opinions again major swan interposed  yet it is evidence of a kind insisted carruthers with the tenacity of a bulldog he looked as if he would make it a personal matter between himself and major swan if he were not allowed to proceed i cant believe that captain tremayne would have embroiled himself further with count samoval captain tremayne has too high a regard for discipline and for orders and he is the least excitable man i have ever known nor do i believe that he would have consented to meet samoval without my knowledge  not perhaps unless captain tremayne desired to keep the matter secret in view of the general order which is precisely what it is contended that he did  falsely contended then snapped major carruthers to be instantly rebuked by the president  he sat down in a huff and the judgeadvocate called private bates who had been on sentry duty on the night of the 28th to corroborate the evidence of the sergeant of the guard as to the hour at which the prisoner had driven up to monsanto in his curricle  private bates having been heard major swan announced that he did not propose to call any further witnesses and resumed his seat thereupon to the presidents invitation captain tremayne replied that he had no witnesses to call at all  in that case major swan said sir harry the court will be glad to hear you further  and major swan came to his feet again to address the court for the prosecution     chapter xvii bitter water   major swan may or may not have been a gifted soldier history is silent on the point but the surviving records of the courtmartial with which we are concerned go to show that he was certainly not a gifted speaker his vocabulary was limited his rhetoric clumsy and major carruthers denounces his delivery as halting his very voice dull and monotonous also his manner reflecting his mind on this occasion appears to have been perfectly unimpassioned he had been saddled with a duty and he must perform it he would do so conscientiously to the best of his ability for he seems to have been a conscientious man but he could not be expected to put his heart into the matter since he was not inflamed by any zeal born of conviction nor had he any of the incentives of a civil advocate to sway his audience by all possible means  nevertheless the facts themselves properly marshalled made up a dangerous case against the prisoner major swan began by dwelling upon the evidence of motive there had been a quarrel or the beginnings of a quarrel between the deceased and the accused the deceased had shown himself affronted and had been heard quite unequivocally to say that the matter could not be left at the stage at which it was interrupted at sir terences luncheontable major swan dwelt for a moment upon the grounds of the quarrel they were by no means discreditable to the accused but it was singularly unfortunate ironical almost that he should have involved himself in a duel as a result of his outspoken defence of a wise measure which made duelling in the british army a capital offence with that however he did not think that the court was immediately concerned by the duel itself the accused had offended against the recent enactment and moreover the irregular manner in which the encounter had been conducted without seconds or witnesses rendered the accused answerable to a charge of murder if it could be proved that he actually did engage and kill the deceased major swan thought this could be proved  the irregularity of the meeting must be assigned to the enactment against which it offended a matter which under other circumstances considering the good character borne by captain tremayne would have been quite incomprehensible was he thought under existing circumstances perfectly clear because captain tremayne could not have found any friend to act for him he was forced to forgo witnesses to the encounter and because of the consequences to himself of the encounters becoming known he was forced to contrive that it should be held in secret they knew from the evidence of colonel grant and major carruthers that the meeting was desired by count samoval and they were therefore entitled to assume that recognising the conditions arising out of the recent enactment the deceased had consented that the meeting should take place in this irregular fashion since otherwise it could not have been held at all and he would have been compelled to forgo the satisfaction he desired  he passed to the consideration of the locality chosen and there he confessed that he was confronted with a mystery yet the mystery would have been no less in the case of any other opponent than captain tremayne since it was clear beyond all doubt that a duel had been fought and count samoval killed and no less clear that it was a premeditated combat and that the deceased had gone to monsanto expressly to engage in it since the duelling swords found had been identified as his property and must have been carried by him to the encounter  the mystery he repeated would have been no less in the case of any other opponent than captain tremayne indeed in the case of some other opponent it might even have been deeper it must be remembered after all that the place was one to which the accused had free access at all hours  and it was clearly proven that he availed himself of that access on the night in question evidence had been placed before the court showing that he had come to monsanto in a curricle at twenty minutes to twelve at the latest and there was abundant evidence to show that he was found kneeling beside the body of the dead man at ten minutes past twelvethe body being quite warm at the time and the breath hardly out of it proving that he had fallen but an instant before the arrival of mullins and the other witnesses who had testified  unless captain tremayne could account to the satisfaction of the court for the manner in which he had spent that halfhour major swan did not perceive when all the facts of motive and circumstance were considered what conclusion the court could reach other than that captain tremayne was guilty of the death of count jeronymo de samoval in a single combat fought under clandestine and irregular conditions transforming the deed into technical murder  upon that conclusion the major sat down to mop a brow that was perspiring freely from lady omoy in the background came faintly the sound of a halfsuppressed moan terrified she clutched the hand of miss armytageand found that hand to lie like a thing of ice in her own yet she suspected nothing of the deep agitation under her companions outward appearance of calm  captain tremayne rose slowly to address the court in reply to the prosecution as he faced his judges now he met the smouldering eyes of sir terence considering him with such malevolence that he was shocked and bewildered was he prejudged already and by his best friend if so what must be the attitude of the others but the kindly florid countenance of the president was friendly and encouraging there was eager anxiety for him in the gaze of his friend caruthers he glanced at lord wellington sitting at the tables end sternly inscrutable a mere spectator yet one whose habit of command gave him an air that was authoritative and judicial  at length he began to speak he had considered his defence and he had based it mainly upon a falsehoodsince the strict truth must have proved ruinous to richard butler  my answer gentlemen he said will be a very brief one as brief indeed as the prosecution meritsfor i entertain the hope that no member of this court is satisfied that the case made out against me is by any means complete he spoke easily fluently and calmly a man supremely selfcontrolled it amounts indeed to throwing upon me the onus of proving myself innocent and that is a burden which no british laws civil or miliary would ever commit the injustice of imposing upon an accused  that certain words of disagreement passed between count samoval and myself on the eve of the affair in which the count met his death as you have heard from various witnesses i at once and freely admitted thereby i saved the court time and trouble and some other witnesses who might have been caused the distress of having to testify against me but that the dispute ever had any sequel that the further subsequent discussion threatened at the time by count samoval ever took place i most solemnly deny from the moment that i left sir terences luncheontable on the saturday i never set eyes on count samoval again until i discovered him dead or dying in the garden here at monsanto on sunday night i can call no witnesses to support me in this because it is not a matter susceptible to proof by evidence nor have i troubled to call the only witnesses i might have calledwitnesses as to my character and my regard for disciplinewho might have testified that any such encounter as that of which i am accused would be utterly foreign to my nature there are officers in plenty in his majestys service who could bear witness that the practice of duelling is one that i hold in the utmost abhorrence since i have frequently avowed it and since in all my life i have never fought a single duel my service in his majestys army has happily afforded me the means of dispensing with any such proof of courage as the duel is supposed to give i say i might have called witnesses to that fact and i have not done so this is because fortunately there are several among the members of this court to whom i have been known for many years and who can themselves when this court comes to consider its finding support my present assertion  let me ask you then gentlemen whether it is conceivable that entertaining such feelings as these towards single combat i should have been led to depart from them under circumstances that might very well have afforded me an ample shield for refusing satisfaction to a too eager and pressing adversary it was precisely because i hold the duel in such contempt that i spoke with such asperity to the deceased when he pronounced lord wellingtons enactment a degrading one to men of birth the very sentiments which i then expressed proclaimed my antipathy to the practice how then should i have committed the inconsistency of accepting a challenge upon such grounds from count samoval there is even more irony than major swan supposes in a situation which himself has called ironical  so much then for the motives that are alleged to have actuated me i hope you will conclude that i have answered the prosecution upon that matter  coming to the question of fact i cannot find that there is anything to answer for nothing has been proved against me true it has been proved that i arrived at monsanto at halfpast eleven or twenty minutes to twelve on the night of the 28th and it has been further proved that halfanhour later i was discovered kneeling beside the dead body of count samoval but to say that this proves that i killed him is more i think if i understood him correctly than major swan himself dares to assert  major swan is quite satisfied that samoval came to monsanto for the purpose of fighting a duel that had been prearranged and i admit that the two swords found which have been proven the property of count samoval and which therefore he must have brought with him are a primafacie proof of such a contention but if we assume gentlemen that i had accepted a challenge from the count let me ask you can you think of any place less likely to have been appointed or agreed to by me for the encounter than the garden of the adjutantgenerals quarters secrecy is urged as the reason for the irregularity of the meeting what secrecy was ensured in such a place where interruption and discovery might come at any moment although the duel was held at midnight and what secrecy did i observe in my movements considering that i drove openly to monsanto in a curricle which i left standing at the gates in full view of the guard to await my return should i have acted thus if i had been upon such an errand as is alleged common sense i think should straightway acquit me on the grounds of the locality alone and i cannot think that it should even be necessary for me so as to complete my answer to an accusation entirely without support in fact or in logic to account for my presence at monsanto and my movements during the halfhour in question  he paused so far his clear reasoning had held and impressed the court this he saw plainly written on the faces of allwith one single exception sir terence alone the one man from whom he might have looked for the greatest reliefwatched him ever malevolently sardonically with curling lip it gave him pause now that he stood upon the threshold of falsehood and because of that inexplicable but obvious hostility that attitude of expectancy to ensnare and destroy him captain tremayne hesitated to step from the solid ground of reason upon which he had confidently walked thus far on to the uncertain bogland of mendacity  i cannot think he said that the court should consider it necessary for me to advance an alibi to make a statement in proof of my innocence where i contend that no proof has been offered of my guilt  i think it will be better sir in your own interests so that you may be the more completely cleared the president replied and so compelled him to continue  there was he resumed then a certain matter connected with the commissarygenerals department which was of the greatest urgency yet which under stress of work had been postponed until the morrow it was concerned with some tents for general pictons division at celorico it occurred to me that night that it would be better dealt with at once so that the documents relating to it could go forward early on monday morning to the commissarygeneral accordingly i returned to monsanto entered the official quarters and was engaged upon that task when a cry from the garden reached my ears that cry in the dead of night was sufficiently alarming and i ran out at once to see what might have occasioned it i found count samoval either just dead or just dying and i had scarcely made the discovery when mullins the butler came out of the residential wing as he has testified  that sirs is all that i know of the death of count samoval and i will conclude with my solemn affirmation on my honour as a soldier that i am as innocent of having procured it as i am ignorant of how it came about  i leave myself with confidence in your hands gentlemen he ended and resumed his seat  that he had favourably impressed the court was clear miss armytage whispered it to lady omoy exultation quivering in her whisper  he is safe and she added he was magnificent  lady omoy pressed her hand in return thank god oh thank god she murmured under her breath  i do said miss armytage  there was silence broken only by the rustle of the presidents notes as he briefly looked them over as a preliminary to addressing the court and then suddenly grating harshly upon that silence came the voice of omoy  might i suggest sir harry that before we hear you three of the witnesses be recalled they are sergeant flynn private bates and mullins  the president looked round in surprise and carruthers took advantage of the pause to interpose an objection  is such a course regular sir harry he too had become conscious at last of sir terences relentless hostility to the accused the court has been given an opportunity of examining those witnesses the accused has declined to call any on his own behalf and the prosecution has already closed its case  sir harry considered a moment he had never been very clear upon matters of procedure which he looked upon as none of a soldiers real business instinctively in this difficulty he looked at lord wellington as if for guidance but his lordships face told him absolutely nothing the commanderinchief remaining an impassive spectator then whilst the president coughed and pondered major swan came to the rescue  the court said the judgeadvocate is entitled at any time before the finding to call or recall any witnesses provided that the prisoner is afforded an opportunity of answering anything further that may be elicited in reexamination of these witnesses  that is the rule said sir terence and rightly so for as in the present instance the prisoners own statement may make it necessary  the president gave way thereby renewing miss armytages terrors and shaking at last even the prisoners calm  sergeant flynn was the first of the witnesses recalled at sir terences request and it was sir terence who took up his reexamination  you said i think that you were standing in the guardroom doorway when captain tremayne passed you at twenty minutes to twelve on the night of the 28th  yes sir i had turned out upon hearing the curricle draw up i had come to see who it was  naturally well now did you observe which way captain tremayne wentwhether he went along the passage leading to the garden or up the stairs to the offices  the sergeant considered for a moment and captain tremayne became conscious for the first time that morning that his pulses were throbbing at last his dreadful suspense came to an end  no sir captain tremayne turned the corner and was out of my sight seeing that i didnt go beyond the guardroom doorway  sir terences lips parted with a snap of impatience but you must have heard he insisted you must have heard his stepswhether they went upstairs or straight on  i am afraid i didnt take notice sir  but even without taking notice it seems impossible that you should not have heard the direction of his steps steps going up stairs sound quite differently from steps walking along the level try to think  the sergeant considered again but the president interposed the testiness which sir terence had been at no pains to conceal annoyed sir harry and this insistence offended his sense of fair play  the witness has already said that the didnt take notice i am afraid it can serve no good purpose to compel him to strain his memory the court could hardly rely upon his answer after what he has said already  very well said sir terence curtly we will pass on after the body of count samoval had been removed from the courtyard did mullins my butler come to you  yes sir terence  what was his message please tell the court  he brought me a letter with instructions that it was to be forwarded first thing in the morning to the commissarygenerals office  did he make any statement beyond that when he delivered that letter  the sergeant pondered a moment only that he had been bringing it when he found count samovals body  that is all i wish to ask sir harry omoy intimated and looked round at his fellowmembers of that court as if to inquire whether they had drawn any inference from the sergeants statements  have you any questions to ask the witness captain tremayne the president inquired  none sir replied the prisoner  came private bates next and sir terence proceeded to question him  you said in your evidence that captain tremayne arrived at monsanto between halfpast eleven and twenty minutes to twelve  yes sir  you told us i think that you determined this by the fact that you came on duty at eleven oclock and that it would be halfanhour or a little more after that when captain tremayne arrived  yes sir  that is quite in agreement with the evidence of your sergeant now tell the court where you were during the halfhour that followeduntil you heard the guard being turned out by the sergeant  pacing in front of quarters sir  did you notice the windows of the building at all during that time  i cant say that i did sir  why not  why not echoed the private  yeswhy not dont repeat my words how did it happen that you didnt notice the windows  because they were in darkness sir  omoys eyes gleamed all of them  certainly sir all of them  you are quite certain of that  oh quite certain sir if a light had shown from one of them i couldnt have failed to notice it  that will do  captain tremayne began the president  i have no questions for the witness sir tremayne announced  sir harrys face expressed surprise after the statement he has just made he exclaimed and thereupon he again invited the prisoner in a voice that was as grave as his countenance to crossexamine he witness he did more than invitehe seemed almost to plead but tremayne preserving by a miracle his outward calm for all that inwardly he was filled with despair and chagrin to see what a pit he had dug for himself by his falsehood declined to ask any questions  private bates retired and mullins was recalled a gloom seemed to have settled now upon the court a moment ago their way had seemed fairly clear to its members and they had been inwardly congratulating themselves that they were relieved from the grim necessity of passing sentence upon a brother officer esteemed by all who knew him but now a subtle change had crept in the statement drawn by sir terence from the sentry appeared flatly to contradict captain tremaynes own account of his movements on the night in question  you told the court omoy addressed the witness mullins consulting his notes as he did so that on the night on which count samoval met his death i sent you at ten minutes past twelve to take a letter to the sergeant of the guard an urgent letter which was to be forwarded to its destination first thing on the following morning and it was in fact in the course of going upon this errand that you discovered the prisoner kneeling beside the body of count samoval this is correct is it not  it is sir  will you now inform the court to whom that letter was addressed  it was addressed to the commissarygeneral  you read the superscription  i am not sure whether i did that but i clearly remember sir that you told me at the time that it was for the commissarygeneral  sir terence signified that he had no more to ask and again the president invited the prisoner to question the witness to receive again the prisoners unvarying refusal  and now omoy rose in his place to announce that he had himself a further statement to make to the court a statement which he had not conceived necessary until he had heard the prisoners account of his movements during the halfhour he had spent at monsanto on the night of the duel  you have heard from sergeant flynn and my butler mullins that the letter carried from me by the latter to the former on the night of the 28th was a letter for the commissarygeneral of an urgent character to be forwarded first thing in the morning if the prisoner insists upon it the commissarygeneral himself may be brought before this court to confirm my assertion that that communication concerned a complaint from headquarters on the subject of the tents supplied to the third division sir thomas pictonsat celorico the documents concerning that complaintthat is to say the documents upon which we are to presume that the prisoner was at work during tine halfhour in questionwere at the time in my possession in my own private study and in another wing of the building altogether  sir terence sat down amid a rustling stir that ran through the court but was instantly summoned to his feet again by the president  a moment sir terence the prisoner will no doubt desire to question you on that statement and he looked with serious eyes at captain tremayne  i have no questions for sir terence sir was his answer  indeed what question could he have asked the falsehoods he had uttered had woven themselves into a rope about his neck and he stood before his brother officers now in an agony of shame a man discredited as he believed  but no doubt you will desire the presence of the commissarygeneral this was from colonel fletcher his own colonel and a man who esteemed himand it was asked in accents that were pleadingly insistent  what purpose could it serve sir sir terences words are partly confirmed by the evidence he has just elicited from sergeant flynn and his butler mullins since he spent the night writing a letter to the commissary it is not to be doubted that the subject would be such as he states since from my own knowledge it was the most urgent matter in our hands and naturally he would not have written without having the documents at his side to summon the commissarygeneral would be unnecessarily to waste the time of the court it follows that i must have been mistaken and this i admit  but how could you be mistaken broke from the president  i realise your difficulty in crediting it but there it is mistaken i was  very well sir sir harry paused and then added the court will be glad to hear you in answer to the further evidence adduced to refute your statement in your own defence  i have nothing further to say sir was tremaynes answer  nothing further the president seemed aghast nothing sir  and now colonel fletcher leaned forward to exhort him captain tremayne he said let me beg you to realise the serious position in which you are placed  i assure you sir that i realise it fully  do you realise that the statements you have made to account for your movements during the halfhour that you were at monsanto have been disproved you have heard private batess evidence to the effect that at the time when you say you were at work in the offices those offices remained in darkness and you have heard sir terences statement that the documents upon which you claim to have been at work were at the time in his own hands do you realise what inference the court will be compelled to draw from this  the court must draw whatever inference it pleases answered the captain without heat  sir terence stirred captain tremayne said he i wish to add my own exhortation to that of your colonel your position has become extremely perilous if you are concealing anything that may extricate you from it let me enjoin you to take the court frankly and fully into your confidence  the words in themselves were kindly but through them ran a note of bitterness of cruel derision that was faintly perceptible to tremayne and to one or two others  lord wellingtons piercing eyes looked a moment at omoy then turned upon the prisoner suddenly he spoke his voice as calm and level as his glance  captain tremayneif the president will permit me to address you in the interests of truth and justiceyou bear to my knowledge the reputation of an upright honourable man you are a man so unaccustomed to falsehood that when you adventure upon it as you have obviously just done your performance is a clumsy one its faults easily distinguished that you are concealing something the court must have perceived if you are not concealing something other than that count samoval fell by your hand let me enjoin you to speak out if you are shielding any oneperhaps the real perpetrator of this deedlet me assure you that your honour as a soldier demands in the interests of truth and justice that you should not continue silent  tremayne looked into the stern face of the great soldier and his glance fell away he made a little gesture of helplessness then drew himself stiffly up  i have nothing more to say  then captain tremayne said the president the court will pass to the consideration of its finding and if you cannot account for the halfhour that you spent at monsanto while count samoval was meeting his death i am afraid that in view of all the other evidences against you your position is likely to be one of extremest gravity  for the last time sir before i order your removal let me add my own to the exhortations already addressed to you that you should speak if still you elect to remain silent the court i fear will be unable to draw any conclusion but one from your attitude  for a long moment captain tremayne stood there in tense expectant silence yet he was not considering he was waiting lady omoy he knew to be in court behind him she had heard even as he had heard that his fate hung perhaps upon whether richard butlers presence were to be betrayed or not not for him to break faith with her let her decide and awaiting that decision he stood there silent like a man considering and then because no womans voice broke the silence to proclaim at once his innocence and the alibi that must ensure his acquittal he spoke at last  i thank you sir indeed i am very grateful to the court for the consideration it has shown me i appreciate it deeply but i have nothing more to say  and then when all seemed lost a womans voice rang out at last  but i have  its sharp almost strident note acted like an electric discharge upon the court but no member of the assembly was more deeply stricken than captain tremayne for though the voice was a womans yet it was not the voice for which he had been waiting  in his excitement he turned to see miss armytage standing there straight and stiff her white face stamped with purpose and beside her still seated clutching her arm in an agony of fear lady omoy murmuring for all to hear her  no no sylvia be silent for gods sake  but sylvia had risen to speak and speak she did and though the words she uttered were such as a virgin might wish to whisper with veiled countenance and averted glance yet her utterance of them was bold to the point of defiance  i can tell you why captain tremayne is silent i can tell you whom he shields  oh god gasped lady omoy wondering through her anguish how sylvia could have become possessed of her secret  miss armytagei implore you cried tremayne forgetting where he stood his voice shaking at last his hand flung out to silence her  and then the heavy voice of omoy crashed in  let her speak let us have the truththe truth and he smote the table with his clenched fist  and you shall have it answered miss armytage captain tremayne keeps silent to shield a womanhis mistress  sir terence sucked in his breath with a whistling sound lady omoy desisted from her attempts to check the speaker and fell to staring at her in stony astonishment whilst tremayne was too overcome by the same emotion to think of interrupting the others preserved a watchful unbroken silence  captain tremayne spent that halfhour at monsanto in her room he was with her when he heard the cry that took him to the window thence he saw the body in the courtyard and in alarm went down at oncewithout considering the consequences to the woman but because he has considered them since he now keeps silent  sir sir captain tremayne turned in wild appeal to the president this is not true he conceived at once the terrible mistake that miss armytage had made she must have seen him climb down from lady omoys balcony and she had come to the only possible horrible conclusion this lady is mistaken i am ready to  a moment sir you are interrupting the president rebuked  and then the voice of omoy on the note of terrible triumph sounded again like a trumpet through the long room  ah but it is the truth at last we have it now her name her name he shouted who was this wanton  miss armytages answer was as a bludgeonstroke to his ferocious exultation  myself captain tremayne was with me     chapter xviii fools mate   writing years afterwards of this eventin the rather tedious volume of reminiscences which he has left usmajor carruthers ventures the opinion that the court should never have been deceived that it should have perceived at once that miss armytage was lying he argues this opinion upon psychological grounds contending that the ladys deportment in that moment of selfaccusation was the very last that in the circumstances she alleged would have been natural to such a character as her own  had she indeed he writes been tremaynes mistress as she represented herself it was not in her nature to have announced it after the manner in which she did so she bore herself before us with all the effrontery of a harlot and it was well known to most of us that a more pure chaste and modest lady did not live there was here a contradiction so flagrant that it should have rendered her falsehood immediately apparent  major carruthers of course is writing in the light of later knowledge and even setting that aside i am very far from agreeing with his psychological deduction just as a shy man will so overreach himself in his efforts to dissemble his shyness as to assume an air of positive arrogance so might a pure lady who had succumbed as miss armytage pretended upon finding herself forced to such selfaccusation bear herself with a boldness which was no more than a mask upon the shame and anguish of her mind  and this i think was the view that was taken by those present the court it wasbeing composed of honest gentlementhat felt the shame which she dissembled there were the eyes that fell away before the spurious effrontery of her own glance they were disconcerted one and all by this turn of events without precedent in the experience of any and none more disconcertedthough not in the same sensethan sir terence to him this was checkmatefools mate indeed an unexpected yet ridiculously simple move had utterly routed him at the very outset of the deadly game that he was playing he had sat there determined to have either tremaynes life or the truth publicly avowed of tremaynes dastardly betrayal he could not have told you which he preferred but one or the other he was fiercely determined to have and now the springs of the snare in which he had so cunningly taken tremayne had been forced apart by utterly unexpected hands  its a lie he bellowed angrily but he bellowed it seemed upon deaf ears the court just sat and stared utterly and hopelessly at a loss how to proceed and then the dry voice of wellington followed sir terence cutting sharply upon the dismayed silence  how can you know that he asked the adjutant the matter is one upon which few would be qualified to contradict miss armytage you will observe sir harry that even captain tremayne has not thought it worth his while to do so  those words pulled the captain from the spell of sheer horrified amazement in which he had stood stricken dumb ever since miss armytage had spoken  iiam so overwhelmed by the amazing falsehood with which miss armytage has attempted to save me from the predicament in which i stand for it is that gentlemen on my oath as a soldier and a gentleman there is not a word of truth in what miss armytage has said  but if there were said lord wellington who seemed the only person present to retain a cool command of his wits your honour as a soldier and a gentlemanand this ladys honourmust still demand of you the perjury  but my lord i protest  you are interrupting me i think lord wellington rebuked him coldly and under the habit of obedience and the magnetic eye of his lordship the captain lapsed into anguished silence  i am of opinion gentlemen his lordship addressed the court that this affair has gone quite far enough miss armytages testimony has saved a deal of trouble it has shed light upon much that was obscure and it has provided captain tremayne with an unanswerable alibi in my viewand without wishing unduly to influence the court in its decisionit but remains to pronounce captain tremaynes acquittal thereby enabling him to fulfil towards this lady a duty which the circumstances would seem to have rendered somewhat urgent  they were words that lifted an intolerable burden from sir harrys shoulders  in immense relief eager now to make an end he looked to right and left everywhere he met nodding heads and murmurs of yes yes everywhere with one exception sir terence white to the lips gave no sign of assent and yet dared give none of dissent the eye of lord wellington was upon him compelling him by its eagle glance  we are clearly agreed the president began but captain tremayne interrupted him  but you are wrongly agreed  sir sir  you shall listen it is infamous that i should owe my acquittal to the sacrifice of this ladys good name  damme that is a matter that any parson can put right said his lordship  your lordship is mistaken captain tremayne insisted greatly daring the honour of this lady is more dear to me than my life  so we perceive was the dry rejoinder these outbursts do you a certain credit captain tremayne but they waste the time of the court  and then the president made his announcement  captain tremayne you are acquitted of the charge of killing count samoval and you are at liberty to depart and to resume your usual duties the court congratulates you and congratulates itself upon having reached this conclusion in the case of an officer so estimable as yourself  ah but gentlemen hear me yet a moment you my lord  the court has pronounced the matter is at an end said wellington with a shrug and immediately upon the words he rose and the court rose with him immediately with rattle of sabres and sabretaches the officers who had composed the board fell into groups and broke into conversation out of a spirit of consideration for tremayne and definitely to mark the conclusion of the proceedings  tremayne white and trembling turned in time to see miss armytage leaving the hall and assisting colonel grant to support lady omoy who was in a halfswooning condition  he stood irresolute prey to a torturing agony of mind cursing himself now for his silence for not having spoken the truth and taken the consequences together with dick butler what was dick butler to him what was his own life to himif they should demand it for the grave breach of duty he had committed by his readiness to assist a proscribed offender to escapecompared with the honour of sylvia armytage and she why had she done this for him could it be possible that she cared that she was concerned so much for his life as to immolate her honour to deliver him from peril the event would seem to prove it yet the overmastering joy that at any other time and in any other circumstances such a revelation must have procured him was stifled now by his agonised concern for the injustice to which she had submitted herself  and then as he stood there a suffering bewildered man came carruthers to grasp his hand and in terms of warm friendship to express satisfaction at his acquittal  sooner than have such a price as that paid he said bitterly and with a shrug left his sentence unfinished  omoy came stalking past him palefaced with eyes that looked neither to right nor left  omoy he cried  sir terence checked and stood stiffly as if to attention his handsome blue eyes blazing into the captains own thus a moment then  we will talk of this again you and i he said grimly and passed on and out with clanking step leaving tremayne to reflect that the appearances certainly justified sir terences resentment  my god carruthers what must he think of me he ejaculated  if you ask me i think that he has suspected this from the very beginning only that could account for the hostility of his attitude towards you for the persistence with which he has sought either to convict or wring the truth from you  tremayne looked askance at the major in such a tangle as this it was impossible to keep the attention fixed upon any single thread  his mind must be disabused at once he answered i must go to him  omoy had already vanished  there were one or two others would have checked the adjutants departure but he had heeded none in the quadrangle he nodded curtly to colonel grant who would have detained him but he passed on and went to shut himself up in his study with his mental anguish that was compounded of so many and so diverse emotions he needed above all things to be alone and to think if thought were possible to a mind so distraught as his own there were now so many things to be faced considered and dealt with first and foremostand this was perhaps the product of inevitable reactionwas the consideration of his own duplicity his villainous betrayal of trust undertaken deliberately but with an aim very different from that which would appear he perceived how men must assume now when the truth of samovals death became known as become known it mustthat he had deliberately fastened upon another his own crime the fine edifice of vengeance he had been so skilfully erecting had toppled about his ears in obscene ruin and he was a man not only broken but dishonoured let him proclaim the truth now and none would believe it sylvia armytages mad and inexplicable selfaccusation was a final bar to that men of honour would scorn him his friends would turn from him in disgust and wellington that great soldier whom he worshipped and whose esteem he valued above all possessions would be the first to cast him out he would appear as a vulgar murderer who having failed by falsehood to fasten the guilt upon an innocent man sought now by falsehood still more damnable at the cost of his wifes honour to offer some mitigation of his unspeakable offence  conceive this terrible position in which his justifiable jealousyhis naturally vindictive ragehad so irretrievably ensnared him he had been so intent upon the administration of poetic justice so intent upon condignly punishing the false friend who had dishonoured him upon finding a balm for his lacerated soul in the spectacle of tremaynes own ignominy that he had never paused to see whither all this might lead him  he had been a fool to have adopted these subtle tortuous ways a fool not to have obeyed the earlier and honest impulse which had led him to take that case of pistols from the drawer and he was served as a fool deserves to be served his folly had recoiled upon him to destroy him fools mate had checked his perfidious vengeance at a blow  why had sylvia armytage discarded her honour to make of it a cloak for the protection of tremayne did she love tremayne and take that desperate way to save a life she accounted lost or was it that she knew the truth and out of affection for una had chosen to immolate herself  sir terence was no psychologist but he found it difficult to believe in so much of selfsacrifice from a woman for a womans sake however dear therefore he held to the first alternative to confirm it came the memory of sylvias words to him on the night of tremaynes arrest and it was to such a man that she gave the priceless treasure of her love for such a man and in such a sordid cause that she sacrificed the inestimable jewel of her honour he laughed through clenched teeth at a situation so bitterly ironical presently he would talk to her she should realise what she had done and he would wish her joy of it first however there was something else to do he flung himself wearily into the chair at his writingtable took up a pen and began to write     chapter xix the truth   to captain tremayne fretted with impatience in the diningroom came at the end of a long hour of waiting sylvia armytage she entered unannounced at a moment when for the third time he was on the point of ringing for mullins and for a moment they stood considering each other mutually ill at ease then miss armytage closed the door and came forward moving with that grace peculiar to her and carrying her head erect facing captain tremayne now with some lingering signs of the defiance she had shown the members of the courtmartial  mullins tells me that you wish to see me she said the merest conventionality to break the disconcerting uneasy silence  after what has happened that should not surprise you said tremayne his agitation was clear to behold his usual imperturbability all departed why he burst out suddenly why did you do it  she looked at him with the faintest ghost of a smile on her lips as if she found the question amusing but before she could frame any answer he was speaking again quickly and nervously  could you suppose that i should wish to purchase my life at such a price could you suppose that your honour was not more precious to me than my life it was infamous that you should have sacrificed yourself in this manner  infamous of whom she asked him coolly  the question gave him pause i dont know he cried desperately infamous of the circumstances i suppose  she shrugged the circumstances were there and they had to be met i could think of no other way of meeting them  hastily he answered her out of his anger for her sake it should not have been your affair to meet them at all  he saw the scarlet flush sweep over her face and leave it deathly white and instantly he perceived how horribly he had blundered  im sorry to have been interfering she answered stiffly but after all it is not a matter that need trouble you and on the words she turned to depart again goodday captain tremayne  ah wait he flung himself between her and the door we must understand each other miss armytage  i think we do captain tremayne she answered fire dancing in her eyes and she added you are detaining me  intentionally he was calm again and he was masterful for the first time in all his dealings with her we are very far from any understanding indeed we are overhead in a misunderstanding already you misconstrue my words i am very angry with you i do not think that in all my life i have ever been so angry with anybody but you are not to mistake the source of my anger i am angry with you for the great wrong you have done yourself  that should not be your affair she answered him thus flinging back the offending phrase  but it is i make it mine he insisted  then i do not give you the right please let me pass she looked him steadily in the face and her voice was calm to coldness only the heave of her bosom betrayed the agitation under which she was labouring  whether you give me the right or not i intend to take it he insisted  you are very rude she reproved him  he laughed even at the risk of being rude then i must make myself clear to you i would suffer anything sooner than leave you under any misapprehension of the grounds upon which i should have preferred to face a firing party rather than have been rescued at the sacrifice of your good name  i hope she said with faint but cutting irony you do not intend to offer me the reparation of marriage  it took his breath away for a moment it was a solution that in his confused and irate state of mind he had never even paused to consider yet now that it was put to him in this scornfully reproachful manner he perceived not only that it was the only possible course but also that on that very account it might be considered by her impossible  her testiness was suddenly plain to him she feared that he was come to her with an offer of marriage out of a sense of duty as an amende to correct the false position into which for his sake she had placed herself and he himself by his blundering phrase had given colour to that hideous fear of hers  he considered a moment whilst he stood there meeting her defiant glance never had she been more desirable in his eyes and hopeless as his love for her had always seemed never had it been in such danger of hopelessness as at this present moment unless he proceeded here with the utmost care and so ned tremayne became subtle for the first time in his honest straightforward soldierly life no he answered boldly i do not intend it  i am glad that you spare me that she answered him yet her pallor seemed to deepen under his glance  and that he continued is the source of all my anger against you against myself and against circumstances if i had deemed myself remotely worthy of you he continued i should have asked you weeks ago to be my wife oh wait and hear me out i have more than once been upon the point of doing sothe last time was that night on the balcony at count redondos i would have spoken then i would have taken my courage in my hands confessed my unworthiness and my love but i was restrained because although i might confess there was nothing i could ask i am a poor man sylvia you are the daughter of a wealthy one men speak of you as an heiress to ask you to marry me he broke off you realise that i could not that i should have been deemed a fortunehunter not only by the world which matters nothing but perhaps by yourself who matter everything ii he faltered fumbling for words to express thoughts of an overwhelming intricacy it was not perhaps that so much as the thought that if my suit should come to prosper men would say you had thrown yourself away on a fortunehunter to myself i should have accounted the reproach well earned but it seemed to me that it must contain something slighting to you and to shield you from all slights must be the first concern of my deep worship for you that he ended fiercely is why i am so angry so desperate at the slight you have put upon yourself for my sakefor me who would have sacrificed life and honour and everything i hold of any account to keep you up there enthroned not only in my own eyes but in the eyes of every man  he paused and looked at her and she at him she was still very white and one of her long slender hands was pressed to her bosom as if to contain and repress tumult but her eyes were smiling and yet it was a smile he could not read it was compassionate wistful and yet tinged it seemed to him with mockery  i suppose he said it would be expected of me in the circumstances to seek words in which to thank you for what you have done but i have no such words i am not grateful how could i be grateful you have destroyed the thing that i most valued in this world  what have i destroyed she asked him  your own good name the respect that was your due from all men  yet if i retain your own  what is that worth he asked almost resentfully  perhaps more than all the rest she took a step forward and set her hand upon his arm there was no mistaking now her smile it was all tenderness and her eyes were shining ned there is only one thing to be done  he looked down at her who was only a little less tall than himself and the colour faded from his own face now  you havent understood me after all he said i was afraid you would not i have no clear gift of words and if i had i am trying to say something that would overtax any gift  on the contrary ned i understand you perfectly i dont think i have ever understood you until now certainly never until now could i be sure of what i hoped  of what you hoped his voice sank as if in awe what he asked  she looked away and her persisting yet everchanging smile grew slightly arch  you do not then intend to ask me to marry you she said  how could i it was an explosion almost of anger you yourself suggested that it would be an insult and so it would it is to take advantage of the position into which your foolish generosity has betrayed you oh he clenched his fists and shook them a moment at his sides  very well she said in that case i must ask you to marry me  you he was thunderstruck  what alternative do you leave me you say that i have destroyed my good name you must provide me with a new one at all costs i must become an honest woman isnt that the phrase  dont he cried and pain quivered in his voice dont jest upon it  my dear she said and now she held out both hands to him why trouble yourself with things of no account when the only thing that matters to us is within our grasp we love each other and  her glance fell away her lip trembled and her smile at last took flight he caught her hands holding them in a grip that hurt her he bent his head and his eyes sought her own but sought in vain  have you considered he was beginning when she interrupted him her face flushed upward surrendering to that questing glance of his and its expression was now between tears and laughter  you will be for ever considering ned you consider too much where the issues are plain and simple for the last timewill you marry me  the subtlety he had employed had been greater than he knew and it had achieved something beyond his utmost hopes  he murmured incoherently and took her to his arms i really do not see that he could have done anything else it was a plain and simple issue and she herself had protested that the issue was plain and simple  and then the door opened abruptly and sir terence came in nor did he discreetly withdraw as a man of feeling should have done before the intimate and touching spectacle that met his eyes on the contrary he remained like the infernal marplot that he intended to be  very proper he sneered very fit and proper that he should put right in the eyes of the world the reputation you have damaged for his sake sylvia i suppose youre to be married  they moved apart and each stared at omoysylvia in cold anger tremayne in chagrin  you see sylvia the captain cried at this voicing of the worlds opinion he feared so much on her behalf  does she said sir terence misunderstanding i wonder unless youve made all plain  the captain frowned  made what plain he asked there is something here i dont understand omoy your attitude towards me ever since you ordered me under arrest has been entirely extraordinary it has troubled me more than anything else in all this deplorable affair  i believe you snorted omoy as with his hands behind his back he strode forward into the room he was pale and there was a set malignant sneer upon his lip a malignant look in the blue eyes that were habitually so clear and honest  there have been moments said tremayne when i have almost felt you to be vindictive  dye wonder growled omoy has no suspicion crossed your mind that i may know the whole truth  tremayne was taken aback that startles you eh cried omoy and pointed a mocking finger at the captains face whose whole expression had changed to one of apprehension  what is it cried sylvia instinctively she felt that under this troubled surface some evil thing was stirring that the issues perhaps were not quite as simple as she had deemed them  there was a pause omoy with his back to the window now his hands still clasped behind him looked mockingly at tremayne and waited  why dont you answer her he said at last you were confidential enough when i came in can it be that you are keeping something back that you have secrets from the lady who has no doubt promised by now to become your wife as the shortest way to mending her recent folly  tremayne was bewildered his answer apparently an irrelevance was the mere enunciation of the thoughts omoys announcement had provoked  do you mean to say that you have known throughout that i did not kill samoval he asked  of course how could i have supposed you killed him when i killed him myself  you you killed him cried tremayne more and more intrigued and  you killed count samoval exclaimed miss armytage  to be sure i did was the answer cynically delivered accompanied by a short sharp laugh when i have settled other accounts and put all my affairs in order i shall save the provostmarshal the trouble of further seeking the slayer and you didnt know then sylvia when you lied so glibly to the court that your future husband was innocent of that  i was always sure of it she answered and looked at tremayne for explanation  omoy laughed again but he had not told you so he preferred that you should think him guilty of bloodshed of murder even rather than tell you the real truth oh i can understand he is the very soul of honour as you remarked yourself i think the other night he knows how much to tell and how much to withhold he is master of the art of discreet suppression he will carry it to any lengths you had an instance of that before the court this morning you may come to regret my dear that you did not allow him to have his own obstinate way that you should have dragged your own spotless purity in the mud to provide him with an alibi but he had an alibi all the time my child an unanswerable alibi which he preferred to withhold i wonder would you have been so ready to make a shield of your honour could you have known what you were really shielding  ned she cried why dont you speak is he to go on in this fashion of what is he accusing you if you were not with samoval that night where were you  in a ladys room as you correctly informed the court came omoys bitter mockery your only mistake was in the identity of the lady you imagined that the lady was yourself a delusion purely but you and i may comfort each other for we are fellowsufferers at the hands of this man of honour my wife was the lady who entertained this gallant in her room that night  my god omoy it was a strangled cry from tremayne at last he saw light he understood and understanding there entered his heart a great compassion for omoy a conception that he must have suffered all the agonies of the damned in these last few days my god you dont believe that i  do you deny it  the imputation utterly  and if i tell you that myself with these eyes i saw you at the window of her room with her if i tell you that i saw the rope ladder dangling from her balcony if i tell you that crouching there after i had killed samovalkilled him mark me for saying that you and my wife betrayed me killed him for telling me the filthy truthif i tell you that i heard her attempting to restrain you from going down to see what had happenedif i tell you all this will you still deny it will you still lie  i will still say that all that you imply is false as hell and your own senseless jealousy can make it  all that i imply but what i statethe facts themselves are they true  they are true but  true cried miss armytage in horror  ah wait omoy bade her with his heavy sneer you interrupt him he is about to construe those facts so that they shall wear an innocent appearance he is about to prove himself worthy of the great sacrifice you made to save his life well and he looked expectantly at tremayne  miss armytage looked at him too with eyes from which the dread passed almost at once the captain was smiling wistfully tolerantly confidently almost scornfully had he been guilty of the thing imputed he could not have stood so in her presence  omoy he said slowly i should tell you that you have played the knave in this were it not clear to me that you have played the fool he spoke entirely without passion he saw his way quite clearly things had reached a pass in which for the sake of all concerned and perhaps for the sake of miss armytage more than any one the whole truth must be spoken without regard to its consequences to richard butler  you dare to take that tone began omoy in a voice of thunder  yourself shall be the first to justify it presently i should be angry with you omoy for what you have done but i find my anger vanishing in regret i should scorn you for the lie you have acted for your scant regard to your oath in the courtmartial for your attempt to combat an imagined villainy by a real villainy but i realise what you have suffered and in that suffering lies the punishment you fully deserve for not having taken the straight course for not having taxed me there and then with the thing that you suspected  the gentleman is about to lecture me upon morals sylvia but tremayne let pass the interruption  it is quite true that i was in unas room while you were killing samoval but i was not alone with her as you have so rashly assumed her brother richard was there and it was on his behalf that i was present she had been hiding him for a fortnight she begged me as dicks friend and her own to save him and i undertook to do so i climbed to her room to assist him to descend by the rope ladder you saw because he was wounded and could not climb without assistance at the gates i had the curricle waiting in which i had driven up in this i was to have taken him on board a ship that was leaving that night for england having made arrangements with her captain you should have seen had you reflected thatas i told the courthad i been coming to a clandestine meeting i should hardly have driven up in so open a fashion and left the curricle to wait for me at the gates  the death of samoval and my own arrest thwarted our plans and prevented dicks escape that is the truth now that you have it i hope you like it and i hope that you thoroughly relish your own behaviour in the matter  there was a fluttering sigh of relief from miss armytage then silence followed in which omoy stared at tremayne emotion after emotion sweeping across his mobile face  dick butler he said at last and cried out i dont believe a word of it yere lying tremayne  you have cause enough to hope so  the captain was faintly scornful  if it were true una would not have kept it from me it was to me she would have come  the trouble with you omoy is that jealousy seems to have robbed you of the power of coherent thought or else you would remember that you were the last man to whom una could confide dicks presence here i warned her against doing so i told her of the promise you had been compelled to give the secretary forjas and i was even at pains to justify you to her when she was indignant with you for that it would perhaps be better he concluded if you were to send for una  its what i intend said sir terence in a voice that made a threat of the statement he strode stiffly across the room and pulled open the door there was no need to go farther lady omoy white and tearful was discovered on the threshold sir terence stood aside holding the door for her his face very grim  she came in slowly looking from one to another with her troubled glance and finally accepting the chair that captain tremayne made haste to offer her she had so much to say to each person present that it was impossible to know where to begin it remained for sir terence to give her the lead she needed and this he did so soon as he had closed the door again planted before it like a sentry he looked at her between anger and suspicion  how much did you overhear he asked her  all that you said about dick she answered without hesitation  then you stood listening  of course i wanted to know what you were saying  there are other ways of ascertaining that without stooping to keyholes said her husband  i didnt stoop she said taking him literally i could hear what was said without thatespecially what you said terence you will raise your voice so on the slightest provocation  and the provocation in this instance was of course of the slightest since you have heard captain tremaynes story of course youll have no difficulty in confirming it  if you still can doubt omoy said tremayne it must be because you wish to doubt because you are afraid to face the truth now that it has been placed before you i think una it will spare a deal of trouble and save your husband from a great many expressions that he may afterwards regret if you go and fetch dick god knows terence has enough to overwhelm him already  at the suggestion of producing dick omoys anger which had begun to simmer again was stilled he looked at his wife almost in alarm and she met his look with one of utter blankness  i cant she said plaintively dicks gone  gone cried tremayne  gone said omoy and then he began to laugh are you quite sure that he was ever here  but she was a little bewildered and a frown puckered her perfect brow hasnt ned told you then  oh ned has told me ned has told his face was terrible  and dont you believe him dont you believe me she was more plaintive than ever it was almost as if she called heaven to witness what manner of husband she was forced to endure then you had better call mullins and ask him he saw dick leave  and no doubt said miss armytage mercilessly sir terence will believe his butler where he can believe neither his wife nor his friend  he looked at her in a sort of amazement do you believe them sylvia he cried  i hope i am not a fool said she impatiently  meaning he began but broke off how long do you say it is since dick left the house  ten minutes at most replied her ladyship  he turned and pulled the door open again mullins he called mullins  what a man to live with sighed her ladyship appealing to miss armytage what a man and she applied a vinaigrette delicately to her nostrils  tremayne smiled and sauntered to the window and then at last came mullins  has any one left the house within the last ten minutes mullins asked sir terence  mullins looked ill at ease  sure sir youll not be after  will you answer my question man roared sir terence  sure then theres nobody left the house at all but mr butler sir  how long had he been here asked omoy after a brief pause  tis what i cant tell ye sir i never set eyes on him until i saw him coming downstairs from her ladyships room as it might be  you can go mullins  i hope sir  you can go and sir terence slammed the door upon the amazed servant who realised that some unhappy mystery was perturbing the adjutants household  sir terence stood facing them again he was a changed man the fire had all gone out of him his head was bowed and his face looked haggard and suddenly old his lip curled into a sneer  pantaloon in the comedy he said remembering in that moment the bitter gibe that had cost samoval his life  what did you say her ladyship asked him  i pronounced my own name he answered lugubriously  it didnt sound like it terence  its the name i ought to bear he said and i killed that liar for itthe only truth he spoke  he came forward to the table the full sense of his position suddenly overwhelmed him as tremayne had said it would a groan broke from him and he collapsed into a chair a stricken broken man     chapter xx the resignation   at once as he sat there his elbows on the table his head in his hands he found himself surrounded by those three against each of whom he had sinned under the spell of the jealousy that had blinded him and led him by the nose  his wife put an arm about his neck in mute comfort of a grief of which she only understood the halffor of the heavier and more desperate part of his guilt she was still in ignorance sylvia spoke to him kindly words of encouragement where no encouragement could avail but what moved him most was the touch of tremaynes hand upon his shoulder and tremaynes voice bidding him brace himself to face the situation and count upon them to stand by him to the end  he looked up at his friend and secretary in an amazement that overcame his shame  you can forgive me ned  ned looked across at sylvia armytage you have been the means of bringing me to such happiness as i should never have reached without these happenings he said what resentment can i bear you omoy besides i understand and who understands can never do anything but forgive i realise how sorely you have been tried no evidence more conclusive that you were being wronged could have been placed before you  but the courtmartial said omoy in horror he covered his face with his hand oh my god i am dishonoured ii he rose shaking off the arm of his wife and the hand of the friend he had wronged so terribly he broke away from them and strode to the window his face set and white i think i was mad he said i know i was mad but to have done what i did he shuddered in very horror of himself now that he was bereft of the support of that evil jealousy that had fortified him against conscience itself and the very voice of honour lady omoy turned to them pleading for explanation  what does he mean what has he done  himself he answered her i killed samoval it was i who fought that duel and then believing what i did i fastened the guilt upon ned and went the lengths of perjury in my blind effort to avenge myself that is what i have done tell me one of you of your charity what is there left for me to do  oh it was an outcry of horror and indignation from una instantly repressed by the tightening grip of sylvias hand upon her arm miss armytage saw and understood and sorrowed for sir terence she must restrain his wife from adding to his present anguish yet how could you terence oh how could you cried her ladyship and so gave way to tears easier than words to express such natures  because i loved you i suppose he answered on a note of bitter selfmockery that was the justification i should have given had i been asked that was the justification i accounted sufficient  but then she cried a new horror breaking on her mindif this is discoveredterence what will become of you  he turned and came slowly back until he stood beside her facing now the inevitable he recovered some of his calm  it must be discovered he said quietly for the sake of everybody concerned it must  oh no no she sprang up and clutched his arm in terror they may fail to discover the truth  they must not my dear he answered her stroking the fair head that lay against his breast they must not fail i must see to that  you you her eyes dilated as she looked at him she caught her breath on a gasping sob ah no terence she cried wildly you must not you must not you must say nothingfor my sake terence if you love me oh for my sake terence  for honours sake i must he answered her and for the sake of sylvia and of tremayne whom i have wronged and  not for my sake terence sylvia interrupted him  he looked at her and then at tremayne  and you nedwhat do you say he asked  ned could not wish began her ladyship  please let him speak for himself my dear her husband interrupted her  what can i say cried tremayne with a gesture that was almost of anger how can i advise i scarcely know you realise what you must face if you confess  fully and the only part of it i shrink from is the shame and scorn i have deserved yet it is inevitable you agree ned  i am not sure none who understands as i understand can feel anything but regret oh i dont know the evidence of what you suspected was overwhelming and it betrayed you into this mistake the punishment you would have to face is surely too heavy and you have suffered far more already than you can ever be called upon to suffer again no matter what is done to you oh i dont know the problem is too deep for me there is una to be considered too you owe a duty to her and if you keep silent it may be best for all you can depend upon us to stand by you in this  indeed indeed said sylvia  he looked at them and smiled very tenderly  never was a man blessed with nobler friends who deserved so little of them he said slowly you heap coals of fire upon my head you shame me through and through but have you considered ned that all may not depend upon my silence what if the provostmarshal investigating now were to come upon the real facts  it is impossible that sufficient should be discovered to convict you  how can you be sure of that and if it were possible if it came to pass what then would be my position you see ned i must accept the punishment i have incurred lest a worse overtake meto put it at its lowest i must voluntarily go forward and denounce myself before another denounces me it is the only way to save some rag of honour  there was a tap at the door and mullins came to announce that lord wellington was asking to see sir terence  he is waiting in the study sir terence  tell his lordship i will be with him at once  mullins departed and sir terence prepared to follow gently he disengaged himself from the arms her ladyship now flung about him  courage my dear he said wellington may show me more mercy than i deserve  you are going to tell him she questioned brokenly  of course sweetheart what else can i do and since you and tremayne find it in your hearts to forgive me nothing else matters very much he kissed her tenderly and put her from him he looked at sylvia standing beside her and at tremayne beyond the table comfort her he implored them and turning went out quickly  awaiting him in the study he found not only lord wellington but colonel grant and by the cold gravity of both their faces he had an inspiration that in some mysterious way the whole hideous truth was already known to them  the slight figure of his lordship in its grey frock was stiff and erect his booted leg firmly planted his hands behind him clutching his ridingcrop and cocked hat his face was set and his voice as he greeted omoy sharp and staccato  ah omoy there are one or two matters to be discussed before i leave lisbon  i had written to you sir replied omoy perhaps you will first read my letter and he went to fetch it from the writingtable where he had left it when completed an hour earlier  his lordship took the letter in silence and after one piercing glance at omoy broke the seal in the background near the window the tall figure of colquhoun grant stood stiffly erect his hawk face inscrutable  ah your resignation omoy but you give no reasons again his keen glance stabbed into the adjutants face why this he asked sharply  because said sir terence i prefer to tender it before it is asked of me he was very white yet by an effort those deep blue eyes of his met the terrible gaze of his chief without flinching  perhaps youll explain said his lordship coldly  in the first place said omoy it was myself killed samoval and since your lordship was a witness of what followed you will realise that that was the least part of my offence  the great soldier jerked his head sharply backward tilting forward his chin so he said ha i beg your pardon grant for having disbelieved you then turning to omoy again well he demanded his voice hard have you nothing to add  nothing that can matter said omoy with a shrug and they stood facing each other in silence for a long moment  at last when wellington spoke his voice had assumed a gentler note  omoy he said i have known you these fifteen years and we have been friends once you carried your friendship appreciation and understanding of me so far as nearly to ruin yourself on my behalf youll not have forgotten the affair of sir harry burrard in all these years i have known you for a man of shining honour an honest upright gentleman whom i would have trusted when i should have distrusted every other living man yet you stand there and confess to me the basest the most dishonest villainy that i have ever known a british officer to commit and you tell me that you have no explanation to offer for your conduct either i have never known you omoy or i do not know you now which is it  omoy raised his arms only to let them fall heavily to his sides again  what explanation can there be he asked how can a man who has beenas i hope i havea man of honour in the past explain such an act of madness it arose out of your order against duelling he went on samoval offended me mortally he said such things to me of my wifes honour that no man could suffer and i least of any man my temper betrayed me i consented to a clandestine meeting without seconds it took place here and i killed him and then i had as i imaginedquite wrongly as i know nowoverwhelming evidence that what he had told me was true and i went mad briefly he told the story of tremaynes descent from lady omoys balcony and the rest  i scarcely know he resumed what it was i hoped to accomplish in the end i do not knowfor i never stopped to considerwhether i should have allowed captain tremayne to have been shot if it had come to that all that i was concerned to do was to submit him to the ordeal which i conceived he must undergo when he saw himself confronted with the choice of keeping silence and submitting to his fate or saving himself by an avowal that could scarcely be less bitter than death itself  you fool omoyyou damned infernal fool his lordship swore at him grant overheard more than you imagined that night outside the gates his conclusions ran the truth very close indeed but i could not believe him could not believe this of you  of course not said omoy gloomily i cant believe it of myself  when miss armytage intervened to afford tremayne an alibi i believed her in view of what grant had told me i concluded that hers was the window from which tremayne had climbed down because of what i knew i was there to see that the case did not go to extremes against tremayne if necessary grant must have given full evidence of all he knew and there and then left you to your fate miss armytage saved us from that and left me convinced but still not understanding your own attitude and now comes richard butler to surrender to me and cast himself upon my mercy with another tale which completely gives the lie to miss armytages but confirms your own  richard butler cried omoy he has surrendered to you  halfanhour ago  sir terence turned aside with a weary shrug a little laugh that was more a sob broke from him poor una he muttered  the tangle is a shocking onelies lies everywhere and in the places where they were least to be expected wellingtons anger flashed out do you realise what awaits you as a result of all this damned insanity  i do sir that is why i place my resignation in your hands the disregard of a general order punishable in any officer is beyond pardon in your adjutantgeneral  but that is the least of it you fool  sure dont i know i assure you that i realise it all  and you are prepared to face it wellington was almost savage in an anger proceeding from the conflict that went on within him there was his duty as commanderinchief and there was his friendship for omoy and his memory of the past in which omoys loyalty had almost been the ruin of him  what choice have i  his lordship turned away and strode the length of the room his head bent his lips twitching suddenly he stopped and faced the silent intelligence officer  what is to be done grant  that is a matter for your lordship but if i might venture  venture and be damned snapped wellington  the signal service rendered the cause of the allies by the death of samoval might perhaps be permitted to weigh against the offence committed by omoy  how could it snapped his lordship you dont know omoy that upon samovals body were found certain documents intended for massena had they reached him or had samoval carried out the full intentions that dictated his quarrel with you and no doubt sent him here depending upon his swordsmanship to kill you all my plans for the undoing of the french would have been ruined ay you may stare that is another matter in which you have lacked discretion you may be a fine engineer omoy but i dont think i could have found a less judicious adjutantgeneral if i had raked the ranks of the army on purpose to find an idiot samoval was a spythe cleverest spy that we have ever had to deal with only his death revealed how dangerous he was for killing him when you did you deserve the thanks of his majestys government as grant suggests but before you can receive those you will have to stand a courtmartial for the manner in which you killed him and you will probably be shot i cant help you i hope you dont expect it of me  the thought had not so much as occurred to me yet what you tell me sir lifts something of the load from my mind  does it well it lifts no load from mine was the angry retort he stood considering then with an impatient gesture he seemed to dismiss his thoughts i can do nothing he said nothing without being false to my duty and becoming as bad as you have been omoy and without any of the sentimental justification that existed in your case i cant allow the matter to be dropped stifled i have never been guilty of such a thing and i refuse to become guilty of it now i refusedo you understand omoy you have acted and you must take the consequences and be damned to you  faith ive never asked you to help me sir sir terence protested  and you dont intend to i suppose  i do not  i am glad of that he was in one of those rages which were as terrible as they were rare with him i wouldnt have you suppose that i make laws for the sake of rescuing people from the consequences of disobeying them here is this brotherinlaw of yours this fellow butler who has made enough mischief in the country to imperil our relations with our allies and i am half pledged to condone his adventure at tavora theres nothing for it omoy as your friend i am infernally angry with you for placing yourself in this position as your commanding officer i can only order you under arrest and convene a courtmartial to deal with you  sir terence bowed his head he was a little surprised by all this heat i never expected anything else he said and its altogether at a loss i am to understand why your lordship should be vexing yourself in this manner  because ive a friendship for you omoy because i remember that youve been a loyal friend to me and because i must forget all this and remember only that my duty is absolutely rigid and inflexible if i condoned your offence if i suppressed inquiry i should be in duty and honour bound to offer my own resignation to his majestys government and i have to think of other things besides my personal feelings when at any moment now the french may be over the agueda and into portugal  sir terences face flushed and his glance brightened  from my heart i thank you that you can even think of such things at such a time and after what i have done  oh as to what you have donei understand that you are a fool omoy theres no more to be said you are to consider yourself under arrest i must do it if you were my own brother which thank god youre not come grant goodbye omoy and he held out his hand to him  sir terence hesitated staring  its the hand of your friend arthur wellesley im offering you not the hand of your commanding officer said his lordship savagely  sir terence took it and wrung it in silence perhaps more deeply moved than he had yet been by anything that had happened to him that morning  there was a knock at the door and mullins opened it to admit the adjutants orderly who came stiffly to attention  major carrutherss compliments sir he said to omoy and his excellency the secretary of the council of regency wishes to see you very urgently  there was a pause omoy shrugged and spread his hands this message was for the adjutantgeneral and he no longer filled the office  pray tell major carruthers that i he was beginning when lord wellington intervened  desire his excellency to step across here i will see him myself     chapter xxi sanctuary   i will withdraw sir said terence  but wellington detained him since dom miguel asked for you you had better remain perhaps  it is the adjutantgeneral dom miguel desires to see and i am adjutantgeneral no longer  still the matter may concern you i have a notion that it may be concerned with the death of count samoval since i have acquainted the council of regency with the treason practised by the count you had better remain  gloomy and downcast sir terence remained as he was bidden  the sleek and supple secretary of state was ushered in he came forward quickly clicked his heels together and bowed to the three men present  sirs your obedient servant he announced himself with a courtliness almost out of fashion speaking in his extraordinarily fluent english his sallow countenance was extremely grave he seemed even a little ill at ease  i am fortunate to find you here my lord the matter upon which i seek your adjutantgeneral is of considerable gravityso much that of himself he might be unable to resolve it i feared you might already have departed for the north  since you suggest that my presence may be of service to you i am happy that circumstances should have delayed my departure was his lordships courteous answer a chair dom miguel  dom miguel forjas accepted the proffered chair whilst wellington seated himself at sir terences desk sir terence himself remained standing with his shoulders to the overmantel whence he faced them both as well as grant who according to his selfeffacing habit remained in the background by the window  i have sought you began dom miguel stroking his square chin on a matter concerned with the late count samoval immediately upon hearing that the courtmartial pronounced the acquittal of captain tremayne  his lordship frowned and his eagle glance fastened upon the secretarys face  i trust sir you have not come to question the finding of the courtmartial  oh on the contraryon the contrary dom miguel was emphatic i represent not only the council but the samoval family as well both realise that it is perhaps fortunate for all concerned that in arresting captain tremayne the military authorities arrested the wrong man and both have reason to dread the arrest of the right one  he paused and the frown deepened between wellingtons brows  i am afraid he said slowly that i do not quite perceive their concern in this matter  but is it not clear cried dom miguel  if it were i should perceive it said his lordship dryly  ah but let me explain then a further investigation of the manner in which count samoval met his death can hardly fail to bring to light the deplorable practices in which he was engaged for no doubt colonel grant here would consider it his duty in the interests of justice to place before the court the documents found upon the counts dead body if i may permit myself an observation he continued looking round at colonel grant it is that i do not quite understand how this has not already happened  there was a pause in which grant looked at wellington as if for direction but his lordship himself assumed the burden of the answer  it was not considered expedient in the public interest to do so at present he said and the circumstances did not place us under the necessity of divulging the matter  there my lord if you will allow me to say so you acted with a delicacy and wisdom which the circumstances may not again permit indeed any further investigation must almost inevitably bring these matters to light and the effect of such revelation would be deplorable  deplorable to whom asked his lordship  to the counts family and to the council of regency  i can sympathise with the counts family but not with the council  surely my lord the council as a body deserves your sympathy in that it is in danger of being utterly discredited by the treason of one or two of its members  wellington manifested impatience the council has been warned time and again i am weary of warning and even of threatening the council with the consequences of resisting my policy i think that exposure is not only what it deserves but the surest means of providing a healthier government in the future i am weary of picking my way through the web of intrigue with which the council entangles my movements and my dispositions public sympathy has enabled it to hamper me in this fashion that sympathy will be lost to it by the disclosures which you fear  my lord i must confess that there is much reason in what you say he was smoothly conciliatory i understand your exasperation but may i be permitted to assure you that it is not the council as a body that has withstood you but certain selfseeking members one or two friends of principal souza in whose interests the unfortunate and misguided count samoval was acting your lordship will perceive that the moment is not one in which to stir up public indignation against the portuguese government once the passions of the mob are inflamed who can say to what lengths they may not go who can say what disastrous consequences may not follow it is desirable to apply the cautery but not to burn up the whole body  lord wellington considered a moment fingering an ivory paperknife he was partly convinced  when i last suggested the cautery to use your own very apt figure the council did not keep faith with me  my lord  it did not sir it removed antonio de souza but it did not take the trouble to go further and remove his friends at the same time they remained to carry on his subversive treacherous intrigues what guarantees have i that the council will behave better on this occasion  you have our solemn assurances my lord that all those members suspected of complicity in this business or of attachment to the souza faction shall be compelled to resign and you may depend upon the reconstituted council loyally to support your measures  you give me assurances sir and i ask for guarantees  your lordship is in possession of the documents found upon count samoval the council knows this and this knowledge will compel it to guard against further intrigues on the part of any of its members which might naturally exasperate you into publishing those documents is not that some guarantee  his lordship considered and nodded slowly i admit that it is yet i do not see how this publicity is to be avoided in the course of the further investigations into the manner in which count samoval came by his death  my lord that is the pivot of the whole matter all further investigation must be suspended  sir terence trembled and his eyes turned in eager anxiety upon the inscrutable stern face of lord wellington  must cried his lordship sharply  what else my lord in all our interests exclaimed the secretary and he rose in his agitation  and what of british justice sir demanded his lordship in a forbidding tone  british justice has reason to consider itself satisfied british justice may assume that count samoval met his death in the pursuit of his treachery he was a spy caught in the act and there and then destroyeda very proper fate had he been taken british justice would have demanded no less it has been anticipated cannot british justice for the sake of british interests as well as portuguese interests be content to leave the matter there  an argument of expediency eh said wellington why not my lord does not expediency govern politicians  i am not a politician  but a wise soldier my lord does not lose sight of the political consequences of his acts and he sat down again  your excellency may be right said his lordship let us be quite clear then you suggest speaking in the name of the council of regency that i should suppress all further investigations into the manner in which count samoval met his death so as to save his family the shame and the council of regency the discredit which must overtake one and the other if the facts are disclosedas disclosed they would be that samoval was a traitor and a spy in the pay of the french that is what you ask me to do in return your council undertakes that there shall be no further opposition to my plans for the military defence of portugal and that all my measures however harsh and however heavily they may weigh upon the landowners shall be punctually and faithfully carried out that is your excellencys proposal is it not  not so much my proposal my lord as my most earnest intercession we desire to spare the innocent the consequences of the sins of a man who is dead and well dead he turned to omoy standing there tense and anxious it was not for dom miguel to know that it was the adjutants fate that was being decided sir terence he cried you have been here for a year and all matters connected with the council have been treated through you you cannot fail to see the wisdom of my recommendation  his lordships eyes flashed round upon omoy ah yes he said what is your feeling in this matter omoy he inquired his tone and manner void of all expression  sir terence faltered then stiffened ithe matter is one that only your lordship can decide i have no wish to influence your decision  i see ha and you grant no doubt you agree with dom miguel  most emphaticallyupon every count sir replied the intelligence officer without hesitation i think dom miguel offers an excellent bargain and as he says we hold a guarantee of its fulfilment  the bargain might be improved said wellington slowly  if your lordship will tell me how the council i am sure will be ready to do all that lies in its power to satisfy you  wellington shifted his chair round a little and crossed his legs he brought his fingertips together and over the top of them his eyes considered the secretary of state  your excellency has spoken of expediencypolitical expediency sometimes political expediency can overreach itself and perpetrate the most grave injustices individuals at times are unnecessarily called upon to suffer in the interests of a cause your excellency will remember a certain affair at tavora some two months agothe invasion of a convent by a british officer with rather disastrous consequences and the loss of some lives  i remember it perfectly my lord i had the honour of entertaining sir terence upon that subject on the occasion of my last visit here  quite so said his lordship and on the grounds of political expediency you made a bargain then with sir terence i understand a bargain which entailed the perpetration of an injustice  i am not aware of it my lord  then let me refresh your excellencys memory upon the facts to appease the council of regency or rather to enable me to have my way with the council and remove the principal souza you stipulated for the assuranceso that you might lay it before your councilthat the offending officer should be shot when taken  i could not help myself in the matter and  a moment sir that is not the way of british justice and sir terence was wrong to have permitted himself to consent though i profoundly appreciate the loyalty to me the earnest desire to assist me which led him into an act the cost of which to himself your excellency can hardly appreciate but the wrong lay in that by virtue of this bargain a british officer was prejudged he was to be made a scapegoat he was to be sent to his death when taken as a peaceoffering to the people demanded by the council of regency  since all this happened i have had the facts of the case placed before me i will go so far as to tell you sir that the officer in question has been in my hands for the past hour that i have closely questioned him and that i am satisfied that whilst he has been guilty of conduct which might compel me to deprive him of his majestys commission and dismiss him from the army yet that conduct is not such as to merit death he has chiefly sinned in folly and want of judgment i reprove it in the sternest terms and i deplore the consequences it had but for those consequences the nuns of tavora are almost as much to blame as he is himself his invasion of their convent was a pure error committed in the belief that it was a monastery and as a result of the porters foolish conduct  now sir terences word given in response to your absolute demands has committed us to an unjust course which i have no intention of following i will stipulate sir that your council in addition to the matters undertaken shall relieve us of all obligation in this matter leaving it to our discretion to punish mr butler in such manner as we may consider condign in return your excellency i will undertake that there shall be no further investigation into the manner in which count samoval came by his death and consequently no disclosures of the shameful trade in which he was engaged if your excellency will give yourself the trouble of taking the sense of your council upon this we may then reach a settlement  the grave anxiety of dom miguels countenance was instantly dispelled in his relief he permitted himself a smile  my lord there is not the need to take the sense of the council the council has given me carte blanche to obtain your consent to a suppression of the samoval affair and without hesitation i accept the further condition that you make sir terence may consider himself relieved of his parole in the matter of lieutenant butler  then we may look upon the matter as concluded  as happily concluded my lord dom miguel rose to make his valedictory oration it remains for me only to thank your lordship in the name of the council for the courtesy and consideration with which you have received my proposal and granted our petition acquainted as i am with the crystalline course of british justice knowing as i do how it seeks ever to act in the full light of day i am profoundly sensible of the cost to your lordship of the concession you make to the feelings of the samoval family and the portuguese government and i can assure you that they will be accordingly grateful  that is very gracefully said dom miguel replied his lordship rising also  the secretary placed a hand upon his heart bowing it is but the poor expression of what i think and feel and so he took his leave of them escorted by colonel grant who discreetly volunteered for the office  left alone with wellington sir terence heaved a great sigh of supreme relief  in my wifes name sir i should like to thank you but she shall thank you herself for what you have done for me  what i have done for you omoy wellingtons slight figure stiffened perceptibly his face and glance were cold and haughty you mistake i think or else you did not hear what i have done i have done solely upon grounds of political expediency i had no choice in the matter and it was not to favour you or out of disregard for my duty as you seem to imagine that i acted as i did  omoy bowed his head crushed under that rebuff he clasped and unclasped his hands a moment in his desperate anguish  i understand he muttered in a broken voice ii beg your pardon sir  and then wellingtons slender firm fingers took him by the arm  but i am glad omoy that i had no choice he added more gently as a man i suppose i may be glad that my duty as commanderinchief placed me under the necessity of acting as i have done  sir terence clutched the hand in both his own and wrung it fiercely obeying an overmastering impulse  thank you he cried thank you for that  tush said wellington and then abruptly what are you going to do omoy he asked  do said omoy and his blue eyes looked pleadingly down into the sternly handsome face of his chief i am in your hands sir  your resignation is and there it must remain omoy you understand  of course sir naturally you could not after this he shrugged and broke off but must i go home he pleaded  what else and by god sir you should be thankful i think  very well was the dull answer and then he flared out faith its your own fault for giving me a job of this kind you knew me you know that i am just a blunt simple soldierthat my place is at the head of a regiment not at the head of an administration you should have known that by putting me out of my proper element i was bound to get into trouble sooner or later  perhaps i do said wellington but what am i to do with you now he shrugged and strode towards the window you had better go home omoy your health has suffered out here and you are not equal to the heat of summer that is now increasing that is the reason of this resignation you understand  i shall be shamed for ever said omoy to go home when the army is about to take the field  but wellington did not hear him or did not seem to hear him he had reached the window and his eye was caught by something that he saw in the courtyard  what the devils this now he rapped out that is one of sir robert craufurds aides  he turned and went quickly to the door he opened it as rapid steps approached along the passage accompanied by the jingle of spurs and the clatter of sabretache and trailing sabre colonel grant appeared followed by a young officer of light dragoons who was powdered from head to foot with dust the youthhe was little morelurched forward wearily yet at sight of wellington he braced himself to attention and saluted  you appear to have ridden hard sir the commander greeted him  from almeida in fortyseven hours my lord was the answer with these from sir robert and he proffered a sealed letter  what is your name wellington inquired as he took the package  hamilton my lord was the answer hamilton of the sixteenth aidedecamp to sir robert craufurd  wellington nodded that was great horsemanship mr hamilton he commended him and a faint tinge in the lads haggard cheeks responded to that rare praise  the urgency was great my lord replied mr hamilton  the french columns are in movement ney and junot advanced to the investment of ciudad rodrigo on the first of the month  already exclaimed wellington and his countenance set  the commander general herrasti has sent an urgent appeal to sir robert for assistance  and sir robert the question came on a sharp note of apprehension for his lordship was fully aware that valour was the better part of sir robert craufurds discretion  sir robert asks for orders in this dispatch and refuses to stir from almeida without instructions from your lordship  ah it was a sigh of relief he broke the seal and spread the dispatch he read swiftly very well was all he said when he had reached the end of sir roberts letter i shall reply to this in person and at once you will be in need of rest mr hamilton you had best take a day to recuperate then follow me to almeida sir terence no doubt will see to your immediate needs  with pleasure mr hamilton replied sir terence mechanicallyfor his own concerns weighed upon him at this moment more heavily than the french advance he pulled the bellrope and into the fatherly hands of mullins who came in response to the summons the young officer was delivered  lord wellington took up his hat and ridingcrop from sir terences desk i shall leave for the frontier at once he announced sir robert will need the encouragement of my presence to keep him within the prudent bounds i have imposed and i do not know how long ciudad rodrigo may be able to hold out at any moment we may have the french upon the agueda and the invasion may begin as for you omoy this has changed everything the french and the needs of the case have decided for the present no change is possible in the administration here in lisbon you hold the threads of your office and the moment is not one in which to appoint another adjutant to take them over such a thing might be fatal to the success of the british arms you must withdraw this resignation and he proffered the document  sir terence recoiled he went deathly white  i cannot he stammered after what has happened i  lord wellingtons face became set and stern his eyes blazed upon the adjutant  omoy he said and the concentrated anger of his voice was terrifying if you suggest that any considerations but those of this campaign have the least weight with me in what i now do you insult me i yield to no man in my sense of duty and i allow no private considerations to override it you are saved from going home in disgrace by the urgency of the circumstances as i have told you by that and by nothing else be thankful then and in loyally remaining at your post efface what is past you know what is doing at torres vedras the works have been under your direction from the commencement see that they are vigorously pushed forward and that the lines are ready to receive the army in a months time from now if necessary i depend upon youthe army and englands honour depend upon you i bow to the inevitable and so shall you then his sternness relaxed so much as your commanding officer now as your friend and he held out his hand i congratulate you upon your luck after this mornings manifestations of it it should pass into a proverb goodbye omoy i trust you remember  and i shall not fail you gulped omoy who strong man that he was found himself almost on the verge of tears he clutched the extended hand  i shall fix my headquarters for the present at celorico communicate with me there and now one other matter the council of regency will no doubt pester you with representations that i shouldif time still remainsadvance to the relief of ciudad rodrigo understand that is no part of my plan of campaign i do not stir across the frontier of portugal here let the french come and find me and i shall be ready to receive them let the portuguese government have no illusions on that point and stimulate the council into doing all possible to carry out the destruction of mills and the laying waste of the country in the valley of the mondego and wherever else i have required  oh and by the way you will find your brotherinlaw mr butler in the guardroom yonder awaiting my orders provide him with a uniform and bid him rejoin his regiment at once recommend him to be more prudent in future if he wishes me to forget his escapade at tavora and in future omoy trust your wife again goodbye come granti have instructions for you too but you must take them as we ride  and thus sir terence omoy found sanctuary at the altar of his countrys need they left him incredulously to marvel at the luck which had so enlisted circumstances to save him where all had seemed so surely lost an hour ago  he sent a servant to fetch mr butler the prime cause of all this potherfor all of it can be traced to mr butlers invasion of the tavora nunneryand with him went to bear the incredible tidings of their joint absolution to the three who waited so anxiously in the diningroom     postscriptum   the particular story which i have set myself to relate of how sir terence omoy was taken in the snare of his own jealousy may very properly be concluded here but the greater story in which it is enshrined and with which it is interwoven the story of that other snare in which my lord viscount wellington took the french goes on this story is the history of the war in the peninsula there you may pursue it to its very end and realise the iron will and inflexibility of purpose which caused men ultimately to bestow upon him who guided that campaign the singularly felicitous and fitting sobriquet of the iron duke  ciudad rodrigos spanish garrison capitulated on the 10th of july of that year 1810 and a wave of indignation such as must have overwhelmed any but a man of almost superhuman mettle swept up against lord wellington for having stood inactive within the frontiers of portugal and never stirred a hand to aid the spaniards it was not only from spain that bitter invective was hurled upon him british journalism poured scorn and rage upon his incompetence french journalism held his pusillanimity up to the ridicule of the world his own officers took shame in their general and expressed it parliament demanded to know how long british honour was to be imperilled by such a man and finally the emperors great marshal massena gathering his hosts to overwhelm the kingdom of portugal availed himself of all this to appeal to the portuguese nation in terms which the facts would seem to corroborate  he issued his proclamation denouncing the british for the disturbers and mischiefmakers of europe warning the portuguese that they were the catspaw of a perfidious nation that was concerned solely with the serving of its own interests and the gratification of its predatory ambitions and finally summoning them to receive the french as their true friends and saviours  the nation stirred uneasily so far no good had come to them of their alliance with the british indeed wellingtons policy of devastation had seemed to those upon whom it fell more horrible than any french invasion could have been  but wellington held the reins and his grip never relaxed or slackened and here let it be recorded that he was nobly and stoutly served in lisbon by sir terence omoy pressure upon the council resulted in the measures demanded being carried out but much time had been lost through the intrigues of the souza faction with the result that those measures although prosecuted now more vigorously never reached the full extent which wellington had desired treachery too stepped in to shorten the time still further almeida garrisoned by portuguese and commanded by colonel cox and a british staff should have held a month but no sooner had the french appeared before it on the 26th august than a powder magazine traitorously fired exploded and breached the wall rendering the place untenable  to wellington this was perhaps the most vexatious of all things in that vexatious time he had hoped to detain massena before almeida until the rains should have set in when the french would have found themselves struggling through a sodden waterlogged country through bridgeless floods and a land bereft of all that could sustain the troops still what could be done wellington did and did it nobly fighting a rearguard action he fell back upon the grim and naked ridges of busaco where at the end of september he delivered battle and a murderous detaining wound upon the advancing hosts of france that done he continued the retreat through coimbra and now as he went he saw to it that the devastation was completed along the line of march what corn and provisions could not be carried off were burnt or buried and the people forced to quit their dwellings and march with the armya pathetic southward exodus of men and women old and young flocks of sheep and herds of cattle creaking bullockcarts laden with provender and household goods leaving behind them a country bare as the sahara where hunger before long should grip the french army too far committed now to pause in advancing and overtaking must lie massenas hope eventually in lisbon he must bring the british to bay and breaking them open out at last his way into a land of plenty  thus thought massena knowing nothing of the lines of torres vedras and thus too thought the british government at home itself declaring that wellington was ruining the country to no purpose since in the end the british must be driven out with terrible loss and infamy that must make their name an opprobrium in the world  but wellington went his relentless way and at the end of the first week of october brought his army and the multitude of refugees safely within the amazing lines the french pressing hard upon their heels and confident that the end was near were brought up sharply before those stupendous unsuspected impregnable fortifications  after spending best part of a month in vain reconnoitering massena took up his quarters at santarem and thence the country was scoured for what scraps of victuals had been left to relieve the dire straits of the famished host of france how the great marshal contrived to hold out so long in santarem against the onslaught of famine and concomitant disease remains something of a mystery an appeal to the emperor for succour eventually brought drouet with provisions but these were no more than would keep his men alive on a retreat into spain and that retreat he commenced early in the following march by when no less than ten thousand of his army had fallen sick  instantly wellington was up and after him the french retreat became a flight they threw away baggage and ammunition that they might travel the lighter thus they fled towards spain harassed by the british cavalry and scarcely less by the resentful peasantry of portugal their line of march defined by an unbroken trail of carcasses until the tattered remnants of that once splendid army found shelter across the coira beyond this wellington could not continue the pursuit for lack of means to cross the swollen river and also because provisions were running short  but there for the moment he might rest content his immediate object achieved and his stern strategy supremely vindicated  on the heights above the yellow turgid flood rode wellington with a glittering staff that included omoy and murray the quartermastergeneral through his telescope he surveyed with silent satisfaction the straggling columns of the french that were being absorbed by the evening mists from the sodden ground  omoy at his side looked on without satisfaction to him the close of this phase of the campaign which had justified his remaining in office meant the reopening of that painful matter that had been left in suspense by circumstances since that june day of last year at monsanto the resignation then refused from motives of expediency must again be tendered and must now be accepted  abruptly upon the general stillness came a sharply humming sound within a yard of the spot where wellington sat his horse a handful of soil heaved itself up and fell in a tiny scattered shower immediately elsewhere in a dozen places was the phenomenon repeated there was too much glitter about the staff uniforms and vindictive french sharpshooters were finding them an attractive mark  they are firing on us sir cried omoy on a note of sharp alarm  so i perceive lord wellington answered calmly and leisurely he closed his glass so leisurely that omoy in impatient fear of his chief spurred forward and placed himself as a screen between him and the line of fire  lord wellington looked at him with a faint smile he was about to speak when omoy pitched forward and rolled headlong from the saddle  they picked him up unconscious but alive and for once lord wellington was seen to blench as he flung down from his horse to inquire the nature of omoys hurt it was not fatal but as it afterwards proved it was grave enough he had been shot through the body the right lung had been grazed and one of his ribs broken  two days later after the bullet had been extracted lord wellington went to visit him in the house where he was quartered bending over him and speaking quietly his lordship said that which brought a moisture to the eyes of sir terence and a smile to his pale lips what actually were his lordships words may be gathered from the answer he received  yere entirely wrong then and its mighty glad i am for now i need no longer hand you my resignation i can be invalided home  so he was and thus it happens that not until nowwhen this chronicle makes the matter publicdoes the knowledge of sir terences single but grievous departure from the path of honour go beyond the few who were immediately concerned with it they kept faith with him because they loved him and because they had understood all that went to the making of his sin they condoned it  if i have done my duty as a faithful chronicler you who read understanding too will take satisfaction in that it was so
