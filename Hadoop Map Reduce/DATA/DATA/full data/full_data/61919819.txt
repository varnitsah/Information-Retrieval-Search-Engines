61919819	notes on a journey from cornhill to grand cairo  by william makepeace thackeray     dedication    to captain samuel lewis of the peninsular and oriental steam navigation companys service   my dear lewis  after a voyage during which the captain of the ship has displayed uncommon courage seamanship affability or other good qualities grateful passengers often present him with a token of their esteem in the shape of teapots tankards trays c of precious metal among authors however bullion is a much rarer commodity than paper whereof i beg you to accept a little in the shape of this small volume  it contains a few notes of a voyage which your skill and kindness rendered doubly pleasant and of which i dont think there is any recollection more agreeable than that it was the occasion of making your friendship  if the noble company in whose service you command and whose fleet alone makes them a thirdrate maritime power in europe should appoint a few admirals in their navy i hope to hear that your flag is hoisted on board one of the grandest of their steamers  but i trust even there you will not forget the iberia and the delightful mediterranean cruise we had in her in the autumn of 1844  most faithfully yours my dear lewis w m thackeray london  december 24 1845    preface    on the 20th of august 1844 the writer of this little book went to dine at theclub quite unconscious of the wonderful events which fate had in store for him  mr william was there giving a farewell dinner to his friend mr james now sir james  these two asked mr titmarsh to join company with them and the conversation naturally fell upon the tour mr james was about to take  the peninsular and oriental company had arranged an excursion in the mediterranean by which in the space of a couple of months as many men and cities were to be seen as ulysses surveyed and noted in ten years  malta athens smyrna constantinople jerusalem cairo were to be visited and everybody was to be back in london by lord mayors day  the idea of beholding these famous places inflamed mr titmarshs mind and the charms of such a journey were eloquently impressed upon him by mr james  come said that kind and hospitable gentleman and make one of my family party in all your life you will never probably have a chance again to see so much in so short a time  considerit is as easy as a journey to paris or to baden  mr titmarsh considered all these things but also the difficulties of the situation  he had but sixandthirty hours to get ready for so portentous a journeyhe had engagements at home finally could he afford it  in spite of these objections however with every glass of claret the enthusiasm somehow rose and the difficulties vanished  but when mr james to crown all said he had no doubt that his friends the directors of the peninsular and oriental company would make mr titmarsh the present of a berth for the voyage all objections ceased on his part  to break his outstanding engagementsto write letters to his amazed family stating that they were not to expect him at dinner on saturday fortnight as he would be at jerusalem on that dayto purchase eighteen shirts and lay in a sea stock of russia duckswas the work of fourand twenty hours and on the 22nd of august the lady mary wood was sailing from southampton with the subject of the present memoir quite astonished to find himself one of the passengers on board  these important statements are made partly to convince some incredulous friendswho insist still that the writer never went abroad at all and wrote the following pages out of pure fancy in retirement at putney but mainly to give him an opportunity of thanking the directors of the company in question for a delightful excursion  it was one so easy so charming and i think profitableit leaves such a store of pleasant recollections for after daysand creates so many new sources of interest a newspaper letter from beyrout or malta or algiers has twice the interest now that it had formerlythat i cant but recommend all persons who have time and means to make a similar journeyvacation idlers to extend their travels and pursue it  above all young welleducated men entering life to take this course we will say after that at college and having their booklearning fresh in their minds see the living people and their cities and the actual aspect of nature along the famous shores of the mediterranean    chapter i  vigo    the sun brought all the sick people out of their berths this morning and the indescribable moans and noises which had been issuing from behind the fine painted doors on each side of the cabin happily ceased  long before sunrise i had the good fortune to discover that it was no longer necessary to maintain the horizontal posture and the very instant this truth was apparent came on deck at two oclock in the morning to see a noble full moon sinking westward and millions of the most brilliant stars shining overhead  the night was so serenely pure that you saw them in magnificent airy perspective the blue sky around and over them and other more distant orbs sparkling above till they glittered away faintly into the immeasurable distance  the ship went rolling over a heavy sweltering calm sea  the breeze was a warm and soft one quite different to the rigid air we had left behind us two days since off the isle of wight  the bell kept tolling its halfhours and the mate explained the mystery of watch and dogwatch  the sight of that noble scene cured all the woes and discomfitures of seasickness at once and if there were any need to communicate such secrets to the public one might tell of much more good that the pleasant morningwatch effected but there are a set of emotions about which a man had best be shy of talking lightlyand the feelings excited by contemplating this vast magnificent harmonious nature are among these  the view of it inspires a delight and ecstasy which is not only hard to describe but which has something secret in it that a man should not utter loudly hope memory humility tender yearnings towards dear friends and inexpressible love and reverence towards the power which created the infinite universe blazing above eternally and the vast ocean shining and rolling aroundfill the heart with a solemn humble happiness that a person dwelling in a city has rarely occasion to enjoy  they are coming away from london parties at this time  the dear little eyes are closed in sleep under mothers wing  how far off city cares and pleasures appear to be how small and mean they seem dwindling out of sight before this magnificent brightness of nature  but the best thoughts only grow and strengthen under it heaven shines above and the humble spirit looks up reverently towards that boundless aspect of wisdom and beauty  you are at home and with all at rest there however far away they may be and through the distance the heart broods over them bright and wakeful like yonder peaceful stars overhead   the day was as fine and calm as the night at seven bells suddenly a bell began to toll very much like that of a country church and on going on deck we found an awning raised a desk with a flag flung over it close to the compass and the ships company and passengers assembled there to hear the captain read the service in a manly respectful voice  this too was a novel and touching sight to me  peaked ridges of purple mountains rose to the left of the shipfinisterre and the coast of galicia  the sky above was cloudless and shining the vast dark ocean smiled peacefully round about and the ship went rolling over it as the people within were praising the maker of all  in honour of the day it was announced that the passengers would be regaled with champagne at dinner and accordingly that exhilarating liquor was served out in decent profusion the company drinking the captains health with the customary orations of compliment and acknowledgment  this feast was scarcely ended when we found ourselves rounding the headland into vigo bay passing a grim and tall island of rocky mountains which lies in the centre of the bay  whether it is that the sight of land is always welcome to weary mariners after the perils and annoyances of a voyage of three days or whether the place is in itself extraordinarily beautiful need not be argued but i have seldom seen anything more charming than the amphitheatre of noble hills into which the ship now came all the features of the landscape being lighted up with a wonderful clearness of air which rarely adorns a view in our country  the sun had not yet set but over the town and lofty rocky castle of vigo a great ghost of a moon was faintly visible which blazed out brighter and brighter as the superior luminary retired behind the purple mountains of the headland to rest  before the general background of waving heights which encompassed the bay rose a second semicircle of undulating hills as cheerful and green as the mountains behind them were grey and solemn  farms and gardens convent towers white villages and churches and buildings that no doubt were hermitages once upon the sharp peaks of the hills shone brightly in the sun  the sight was delightfully cheerful animated and pleasing  presently the captain roared out the magic words stop her and the obedient vessel came to a standstill at some three hundred yards from the little town with its white houses clambering up a rock defended by the superior mountain whereon the castle stands numbers of people arrayed in various brilliant colours of red were standing on the sand close by the tumbling shining purple waves  and there we beheld for the first time the royal red and yellow standard of spain floating on its own ground under the guardianship of a light blue sentinel whose musket glittered in the sun  numerous boats were seen incontinently to put off from the little shore  and now our attention was withdrawn from the land to a sight of great splendour on board  this was lieutenant bundy the guardian of her majestys mails who issued from his cabin in his long swallowtailed coat with anchor buttons his sabre clattering between his legs a magnificent shirtcollar of several inches in height rising round his goodhumoured sallow face and above it a cocked hat that shone so i thought it was made of polished tin it may have been that or oilskin handsomely laced with black worsted and ornamented with a shining gold cord  a little squat boat rowed by three ragged gallegos came bouncing up to the ship into this mr bundy and her majestys royal mail embarked with much majesty and in the twinkling of an eye the royal standard of england about the size of a pockethandkerchiefand at the bows of the boat the manofwars pennant being a strip of bunting considerably under the value of a farthingstreamed out  they know that flag sir said the goodnatured old tar quite solemnly in the evening afterwards  they respect it sir  the authority of her majestys lieutenant on board the steamer is stated to be so tremendous that he may order it to stop to move to go larboard starboard or what you will and the captain dare only disobey him suo periculo  it was agreed that a party of us should land for halfanhour and taste real spanish chocolate on spanish ground  we followed lieutenant bundy but humbly in the providors boat that officer going on shore to purchase fresh eggs milk for tea in place of the slimy substitute of whipped yolk of egg which we had been using for our morning and evening meals and if possible oysters for which it is said the rocks of vigo are famous  it was low tide and the boat could not get up to the dry shore hence it was necessary to take advantage of the offers of sundry gallegos who rushed barelegged into the water to land on their shoulders  the approved method seems to be to sit upon one shoulder only holding on by the porters whiskers and though some of our party were of the tallest and fattest men whereof our race is composed and their living sedans exceedingly meagre and small yet all were landed without accident upon the juicy sand and forthwith surrounded by a host of mendicants screaming i say sir penny sir  i say english tam your ays penny in all voices from extreme youth to the most lousy and venerable old age when it is said that these beggars were as ragged as those of ireland and still more voluble the irish traveller will be able to form an opinion of their capabilities  through this crowd we passed up some steep rocky steps through a little low gate where in a little guardhouse and barrack a few dirty little sentinels were keeping a dirty little guard and by lowroofed whitewashed houses with balconies and women in them the very same women with the very same headclothes and yellow fans and eyes at once sly and solemn which murillo paintedby a neat church into which we took a peep and finally into the plaza del constitucion or grand place of the town which may be about as big as that pleasing square pump court temple  we were taken to an inn of which i forget the name and were shown from one chamber and storey to another till we arrived at that apartment where the real spanish chocolate was finally to be served out  all these rooms were as clean as scrubbing and whitewash could make them with simple french prints with spanish titles on the walls a few rickety halffinished articles of furniture and finally an air of extremely respectable poverty  a jolly blackeyed yellow shawled dulcinea conducted us through the apartment and provided us with the desired refreshment  sounds of clarions drew our eyes to the place of the constitution and indeed i had forgotten to say that that majestic square was filled with military with exceedingly small firelocks the men ludicrously young and diminutive for the most part in a uniform at once cheap and tawdrylike those supplied to the warriors at astleys or from still humbler theatrical wardrobes  indeed the whole scene was just like that of a little theatre the houses curiously small with arcades and balconies out of which looked women apparently a great deal too big for the chambers they inhabited the warriors were in ginghams cottons and tinsel the officers had huge epaulets of sham silver lace drooping over their bosoms and looked as if they were attired at a very small expense only the generalthe captaingeneral pooch they told us was his name  i know not how tis written in spanishwas well got up with a smart hat a real feather huge stars glittering on his portly chest and tights and boots of the first order  presently after a good deal of trumpeting the little men marched off the place pooch and his staff coming into the very inn in which we were awaiting our chocolate  then we had an opportunity of seeing some of the civilians of the town  three or four ladies passed with fan and mantle to them came three or four dandies dressed smartly in the french fashion with strong jewish physiognomies  there was one a solemn lean fellow in black with his collars extremely turned over and holding before him a long ivorytipped ebony cane who tripped along the little place with a solemn smirk which gave one an indescribable feeling of the truth of gil blas and of those delightful bachelors and licentiates who have appeared to us all in our dreams  in fact we were but halfanhour in this little queer spanish town and it appeared like a dream too or a little show got up to amuse us  boom the gun fired at the end of the funny little entertainment  the women and the balconies the beggars and the walking murillos pooch and the little soldiers in tinsel disappeared and were shut up in their box again  once more we were carried on the beggars shoulders out off the shore and we found ourselves again in the great stalwart roastbeef world the stout british steamer bearing out of the bay whose purple waters had grown more purple  the sun had set by this time and the moon above was twice as big and bright as our degenerate moons are   the providor had already returned with his fresh stores and bundys tin hat was popped into its case and he walking the deck of the packet denuded of tails  as we went out of the bay occurred a little incident with which the great incidents of the day may be said to wind up  we saw before us a little vessel tumbling and plunging about in the dark waters of the bay with a bright light beaming from the mast  it made for us at about a couple of miles from the town and came close up flouncing and bobbing in the very jaws of the paddle which looked as if it would have seized and twirled round that little boat and its light and destroyed them for ever and ever  all the passengers of course came crowding to the ships side to look at the bold little boat  i say howled a man i saya wordi say  pasagero pasagero  pasageeero  we were two hundred yards ahead by this time  go on says the captain  you may stop if you like says lieutenant bundy exerting his tremendous responsibility  it is evident that the lieutenant has a soft heart and felt for the poor devil in the boat who was howling so piteously pasagero  but the captain was resolute  his duty was not to take the man up he was evidently an irregular customersomeone trying to escape possibly  the lieutenant turned away but did not make any further hints the captain was right but we all felt somehow disappointed and looked back wistfully at the little boat jumping up and down far astern now the poor little light shining in vain and the poor wretch within screaming out in the most heartrending accents a last faint desperate i say  pasageroo  we all went down to tea rather melancholy but the new milk in the place of that abominable whipped egg revived us again and so ended the great events on board the lady mary wood steamer on the 25th august 1844    chapter ii  lisboncadiz    a great misfortune which befalls a man who has but a single day to stay in a town is that fatal duty which superstition entails upon him of visiting the chief lions of the city in which he may happen to be  you must go through the ceremony however much you may sigh to avoid it and however much you know that the lions in one capital roar very much like the lions in another that the churches are more or less large and splendid the palaces pretty spacious all the world over and that there is scarcely a capital city in this europe but has its pompous bronze statue or two of some periwigged hooknosed emperor in a roman habit waving his bronze baton on his broadflanked brazen charger  we only saw these state old lions in lisbon whose roar has long since ceased to frighten one  first we went to the church of st roch to see a famous piece of mosaicwork there  it is a famous work of art and was bought by i dont know what king for i dont know how much money all this information may be perfectly relied on though the fact is we did not see the mosaicwork  the sacristan who guards it was yet in bed and it was veiled from our eyes in a sidechapel by great dirty damask curtains which could not be removed except when the sacristans toilette was done and at the price of a dollar  so we were spared this mosaic exhibition and i think i always feel relieved when such an event occurs  i feel i have done my duty in coming to see the enormous animal  if he is not at home virtute mea me cwe have done our best and mortal can do no more  in order to reach that church of the forbidden mosaic we had sweated up several most steep and dusty streetshot and dusty although it was but nine oclock in the morning  thence the guide conducted us into some little dustpowdered gardens in which the people make believe to enjoy the verdure and whence you look over a great part of the arid dreary stony city  there was no smoke as in honest london only dustdust over the gaunt houses and the dismal yellow strips of gardens  many churches were there and tall halfbakedlooking public edifices that had a dry uncomfortable earthquaky look to my idea  the groundfloors of the spacious houses by which we passed seemed the coolest and pleasantest portions of the mansion  they were cellars or warehouses for the most part in which whitejacketed clerks sat smoking easy cigars  the streets were plastered with placards of a bullfight to take place the next evening there was no opera that season but it was not a real spanish tauromachyonly a theatrical combat as you could see by the picture in which the horseman was cantering off at three miles an hour the bull tripping after him with tips to his gentle horns  mules interminable and almost all excellently sleek and handsome were pacing down every street  here and there but later in the day came clattering along a smart rider on a prancing spanish horse and in the afternoon a few families might be seen in the queerest oldfashioned little carriages drawn by their jolly mules and swinging between or rather before enormous wheels  the churches i saw were of the florid periwig architecturei mean of that pompous cauliflower kind of ornament which was the fashion in louis the fifteenths time at which unlucky period a building mania seems to have seized upon many of the monarchs of europe and innumerable public edifices were erected  it seems to me to have been the period in all history when society was the least natural and perhaps the most dissolute and i have always fancied that the bloated artificial forms of the architecture partake of the social disorganisation of the time  who can respect a simpering ninny grinning in a roman dress and a fullbottomed wig who is made to pass off for a hero or a fat woman in a hoop and of a most doubtful virtue who leers at you as a goddess  in the palaces which we saw several court allegories were represented which atrocious as they were in point of art might yet serve to attract the regard of the moraliser  there were faith hope and charity restoring don john to the arms of his happy portugal  there were virtue valour and victory saluting don emanuel  reading writing and arithmetic for what i know or some mythologic nymphs dancing before don miguelthe picture is there still at the ajuda and ah me where is poor mig  well it is these state lies and ceremonies that we persist in going to see whereas a man would have a much better insight into portuguese manners by planting himself at a corner like yonder beggar and watching the real transactions of the day  a drive to belem is the regular route practised by the traveller who has to make only a short stay and accordingly a couple of carriages were provided for our party and we were driven through the long merry street of belem peopled by endless strings of mulesby thousands of gallegos with waterbarrels on their shoulders or lounging by the fountains to hireby the lisbon and belem omnibuses with four mules jingling along at a good pace and it seemed to me to present a far more lively and cheerful though not so regular an appearance as the stately quarters of the city we had left behind us  the little shops were at full work the men brown welldressed manly and handsome  so much cannot i am sorry to say be said for the ladies of whom with every anxiety to do so our party could not perceive a single good looking specimen all day  the noble blue tagus accompanies you all along these three miles of busy pleasant street whereof the chief charm as i thought was its look of genuine businessthat appearance of comfort which the cleverest courtarchitect never knows how to give  the carriages the canvas one with four seats and the chaise in which i drove were brought suddenly up to a gate with the royal arms over it and here we were introduced to as queer an exhibition as the eye has often looked on  this was the statecarriage house where there is a museum of huge old tumbledown gilded coaches of the last century lying here mouldy and dark in a sort of limbo the gold has vanished from the great lumbering old wheels and panels the velvets are wofully tarnished  when one thinks of the patches and powder that have simpered out of those plateglass windowsthe mitred bishops the bigwigged marshals the shovel hatted abbes which they have borne in their timethe human mind becomes affected in no ordinary degree  some human minds heave a sigh for the glories of bygone days while others considering rather the lies and humbug the vice and servility which went framed and glazed and enshrined creaking along in those old juggernaut cars with fools worshipping under the wheels console themselves for the decay of institutions that may have been splendid and costly but were ponderous clumsy slow and unfit for daily wear  the guardian of these defunct old carriages tells some prodigious fibs concerning them  he pointed out one carriage that was six hundred years old in his calendar but any connoisseur in bricabrac can see it was built at paris in the regent orleans time  hence it is but a step to an institution in full life and vigour a noble orphanschool for one thousand boys and girls founded by don pedro who gave up to its use the superb convent of belem with its splendid cloisters vast airy dormitories and magnificent church  some oxford gentlemen would have wept to see the desecrated edificeto think that the shaven polls and white gowns were banished from it to give place to a thousand children who have not even the clergy to instruct them  every lad here may choose his trade our little informant said who addressed us in better french than any of our party spoke whose manners were perfectly gentlemanlike and respectful and whose clothes though of a common cotton stuff were cut and worn with a military neatness and precision  all the children whom we remarked were dressed with similar neatness and it was a pleasure to go through their various rooms for study where some were busy at mathematics some at drawing some attending a lecture on tailoring while others were sitting at the feet of a professor of the science of shoemaking  all the garments of the establishment were made by the pupils even the deaf and dumb were drawing and reading and the blind were for the most part set to perform on musical instruments and got up a concert for the visitors  it was then we wished ourselves of the numbers of the deaf and dumb for the poor fellows made noises so horrible that even as blind beggars they could hardly get a livelihood in the musical way   hence we were driven to the huge palace of necessidades which is but a wing of a building that no king of portugal ought ever to be rich enough to complete and which if perfect might outvie the tower of babel  the mines of brazil must have been productive of gold and silver indeed when the founder imagined this enormous edifice  from the elevation on which it stands it commands the noblest viewsthe city is spread before it with its many churches and towers and for many miles you see the magnificent tagus rolling by banks crowned with trees and towers  but to arrive at this enormous building you have to climb a steep suburb of wretched huts many of them with dismal gardens of dry cracked earth where a few reedy sprouts of indian corn seemed to be the chief cultivation and which were guarded by huge plants of spiky aloes on which the rags of the proprietors of the huts were sunning themselves  the terrace before the palace was similarly encroached upon by these wretched habitations  a few millions judiciously expended might make of this arid hill one of the most magnificent gardens in the world and the palace seems to me to excel for situation any royal edifice i have ever seen  but the huts of these swarming poor have crawled up close to its gates the superb walls of hewn stone stop all of a sudden with a lath andplaster hitch and capitals and hewn stones for columns still lying about on the deserted terrace may lie there for ages to come probably and never take their places by the side of their brethren in yonder tall bankrupt galleries  the air of this pure sky has little effect upon the edificesthe edges of the stone look as sharp as if the builders had just left their work and close to the grand entrance stands an outbuilding part of which may have been burnt fifty years ago but is in such cheerful preservation that you might fancy the fire had occurred yesterday it must have been an awful sight from this hill to have looked at the city spread before it and seen it reeling and swaying in the time of the earthquake  i thought it looked so hot and shaky that one might fancy a return of the fit  in several places still remain gaps and chasms and ruins lie here and there as they cracked and fell  although the palace has not attained anything like its full growth yet what exists is quite big enough for the monarch of such a little country and versailles or windsor has not apartments more nobly proportioned  the queen resides in the ajuda a building of much less pretensions of which the yellow walls and beautiful gardens are seen between belem and the city  the necessidades are only used for grand galas receptions of ambassadors and ceremonies of state  in the throneroom is a huge throne surmounted by an enormous gilt crown than which i have never seen anything larger in the finest pantomime at drury lane but the effect of this splendid piece is lessened by a shabby old brussels carpet almost the only other article of furniture in the apartment and not quite large enough to cover its spacious floor the looms of kidderminster have supplied the web which ornaments the ambassadors waitingroom and the ceilings are painted with huge allegories in distemper which pretty well correspond with the other furniture  of all the undignified objects in the world a palace out at elbows is surely the meanest  such places ought not to be seen in adversitysplendour is their decencyand when no longer able to maintain it they should sink to the level of their means calmly subside into manufactories or go shabby in seclusion  there is a picturegallery belonging to the palace that is quite of a piece with the furniture where are the mythological pieces relative to the kings before alluded to and where the english visitor will see some astonishing pictures of the duke of wellington done in a very characteristic style of portuguese art there is also a chapel which has been decorated with much care and sumptuousness of ornamentthe altar surmounted by a ghastly and horrible carved figure in the taste of the time when faith was strengthened by the shrieks of jews on the rack and enlivened by the roasting of heretics  other such frightful images may be seen in the churches of the city those which we saw were still rich tawdry and splendid to outward show although the french as usual had robbed their shrines of their gold and silver and the statues of their jewels and crowns  but brass and tinsel look to the visitor full as well at a little distanceas doubtless soult and junot thought when they despoiled these places of worship like french philosophers as they were  a friend with a classical turn of mind was bent upon seeing the aqueduct whither we went on a dismal excursion of three hours in the worst carriages over the most diabolical clattering roads up and down dreary parched hills on which grew a few grey olivetrees and many aloes  when we arrived the gate leading to the aqueduct was closed and we were entertained with a legend of some respectable character who had made a good livelihood there for some time past lately having a private key to this very aqueduct and lying in wait there for unwary travellers like ourselves whom he pitched down the arches into the ravines below and there robbed them at leisure  so that all we saw was the door and the tall arches of the aqueduct and by the time we returned to town it was time to go on board the ship again  if the inn at which we had sojourned was not of the best quality the bill at least would have done honour to the first establishment in london  we all left the house of entertainment joyfully glad to get out of the sun burnt city and go home  yonder in the steamer was home with its black funnel and gilt portraiture of lady mary wood at the bows and every soul on board felt glad to return to the friendly little vessel  but the authorities of lisbon however are very suspicious of the departing stranger and we were made to lie an hour in the river before the sanita boat where a passport is necessary to be procured before the traveller can quit the country boat after boat laden with priests and peasantry with handsome redsashed gallegos clad in brown and illfavoured women came and got their permits and were off as we lay bumping up against the old hull of the sanita boat but the officers seemed to take a delight in keeping us there bumping looked at us quite calmly over the ships sides and smoked their cigars without the least attention to the prayers which we shrieked out for release  if we were glad to get away from lisbon we were quite as sorry to be obliged to quit cadiz which we reached the next night and where we were allowed a couple of hours leave to land and look about  it seemed as handsome within as it is stately without the long narrow streets of an admirable cleanliness many of the tall houses of rich and noble decorations and all looking as if the city were in full prosperity  i have seen no more cheerful and animated sight than the long street leading from the quay where we were landed and the market blazing in sunshine piled with fruit fish and poultry under manycoloured awnings the tall white houses with their balconies and galleries shining round about and the sky above so blue that the best cobalt in all the paintbox looks muddy and dim in comparison to it  there were pictures for a year in that marketplacefrom the coppercoloured old hags and beggars who roared to you for the love of heaven to give money to the swaggering dandies of the market with red sashes and tight clothes looking on superbly with a hand on the hip and a cigar in the mouth  these must be the chief critics at the great bullfight house yonder by the alameda with its scanty trees and cool breezes facing the water  nor are there any corks to the bulls horns here as at lisbon  a small old english guide who seized upon me the moment my foot was on shore had a store of agreeable legends regarding the bulls men and horses that had been killed with unbounded profusion in the late entertainments which have taken place  it was so early an hour in the morning that the shops were scarcely opened as yet the churches however stood open for the faithful and we met scores of women tripping towards them with pretty feet and smart black mantillas from which looked out fine dark eyes and handsome pale faces very different from the coarse brown countenances we had seen at lisbon  a very handsome modern cathedral built by the present bishop at his own charges was the finest of the public edifices we saw it was not however nearly so much frequented as another little church crowded with altars and fantastic ornaments and lights and gilding where we were told to look behind a huge iron grille and beheld a bevy of black nuns kneeling  most of the good ladies in the front ranks stopped their devotions and looked at the strangers with as much curiosity as we directed at them through the gloomy bars of their chapel  the mens convents are closed that which contains the famous murillos has been turned into an academy of the fine arts but the english guide did not think the pictures were of sufficient interest to detain strangers and so hurried us back to the shore and grumbled at only getting three shillings at parting for his trouble and his information  and so our residence in andalusia began and ended before breakfast and we went on board and steamed for gibraltar looking as we passed at joinvilles black squadron and the white houses of st marys across the bay with the hills of medina sidonia and granada lying purple beyond them  theres something even in those names which is pleasant to write down to have passed only two hours in cadiz is somethingto have seen real donnas with comb and mantlereal caballeros with cloak and cigarreal spanish barbers lathering out of brass basinsand to have heard guitars under the balconies  there was one that an old beggar was jangling in the market whilst a huge leering fellow in bushy whiskers and a faded velvet dress came singing and jumping after our partynot singing to a guitar it is true but imitating one capitally with his voice and cracking his fingers by way of castanets and performing a dance such as figaro or lablache might envy  how clear that fellows voice thrums on the ear even now and how bright and pleasant remains the recollection of the fine city and the blue sea and the spanish flags floating on the boats that danced over it and joinvilles band beginning to play stirring marches as we puffed out of the bay   the next stage was gibraltar where we were to change horses before sunset we skirted along the dark savage mountains of the african coast and came to the rock just before gunfire  it is the very image of an enormous lion crouched between the atlantic and the mediterranean and set there to guard the passage for its british mistress  the next british lion is malta four days further on in the midland sea and ready to spring upon egypt or pounce upon syria or roar so as to be heard at marseilles in case of need  to the eyes of the civilian the firstnamed of these famous fortifications is by far the most imposing  the rock looks so tremendous that to ascend it even without the compliment of shells or shot seems a dreadful taskwhat would it be when all those mysterious lines of batteries were vomiting fire and brimstone when all those dark guns that you see poking their grim heads out of every imaginable cleft and zigzag should salute you with shot both hot and cold and when after tugging up the hideous perpendicular place you were to find regiments of british grenadiers ready to plunge bayonets into your poor panting stomach and let out artificially the little breath left there  it is a marvel to think that soldiers will mount such places for a shillingensigns for five and ninepencea day  a cabman would ask double the money to go half way  one meekly reflects upon the above strange truths leaning over the ships side and looking up the huge mountain from the tower nestled at the foot of it to the thin flagstaff at the summit up to which have been piled the most ingenious edifices for murder christian science ever adopted  my hobbyhorse is a quiet beast suited for park riding or a gentle trot to putney and back to a snug stable and plenty of feeds of corn it cant abide climbing hills and is not at all used to gunpowder  some mens animals are so spirited that the very appearance of a stonewall sets them jumping at it  regular chargers of hobbies which snort and say ha ha at the mere notion of a battle    chapter iii  the lady mary wood    our weeks voyage is now drawing to a close  we have just been to look at cape trafalgar shining white over the finest blue sea we who were looking at trafalgar square only the other day  the sight of that cape must have disgusted joinville and his fleet of steamers as they passed yesterday into cadiz bay and tomorrow will give them a sight of st vincent  one of their steamvessels has been lost off the coast of africa they were obliged to burn her lest the moors should take possession of her  she was a virgin vessel just out of brest poor innocent to die in the very first month of her union with the noble whiskered god of war  we britons on board the english boat received the news of the groenenlands abrupt demise with grins of satisfaction  it was a sort of national compliment and cause of agreeable congratulation the lubbers we said the clumsy humbugs theres none but britons to rule the waves and we gave ourselves piratical airs and went down presently and were sick in our little buggy berths it was pleasant certainly to laugh at joinvilles admirals flag floating at his foremast in yonder black ship with its two thundering great guns at the bows and stern its busy crew swarming on the deck and a crowd of obsequious shoreboats bustling round the vesseland to sneer at the mogador warrior and vow that we english had we been inclined to do the business would have performed it a great deal better   now yesterday at lisbon we saw hms caledonia  this on the contrary inspired us with feelings of respect and awful pleasure there she laythe huge seacastlebearing the unconquerable flag of our country  she had but to open her jaws as it were and she might bring a second earthquake on the citybatter it into kingdomcomewith the ajuda palace and the necessidades the churches and the lean dry empty streets and don john tremendous on horseback in the midst of black horse square wherever we looked we could see that enormous caledonia with her flashing three lines of guns  we looked at the little boats which ever and anon came out of this monster with humble wonder  there was the lieutenant who boarded us at midnight before we dropped anchor in the river  ten whitejacketed men pulling as one swept along with the barge gig boat curricle or coachandsix with which he came up to us  we examined himhis red whiskershis collars turned downhis duck trousers his bullion epauletswith awe  with the same reverential feeling we examined the seamenthe young gentleman in the bows of the boatthe handsome young officers of marines we met sauntering in the town next daythe scotch surgeon who boarded us as we weighed anchorevery man down to the brokennosed mariner who was drunk in a winehouse and had caledonia written on his hat  whereas at the frenchmen we looked with undisguised contempt  we were ready to burst with laughter as we passed the princes vesselthere was a little french boy in a french boat alongside cleaning it and twirling about a little french mopwe thought it the most comical contemptible french boy mop boat steamer princepsha it is of this wretched vapouring stuff that false patriotism is made  i write this as a sort of homily a propos of the day and cape trafalgar off which we lie  what business have i to strut the deck and clap my wings and cry cockadoodledoo over it  some compatriots are at that work even now  we have lost one by one all our jovial company  there were the five oporto winemerchantsall hearty english gentlemengone to their winebutts and their redlegged partridges and their duels at oporto  it appears that these gallant britons fight every morning among themselves and give the benighted people among whom they live an opportunity to admire the spirit national  there is the brave honest major with his wooden legthe kindest and simplest of irishmen  he has embraced his children and reviewed his little invalid garrison of fifteen men in the fort which he commands at belem by this time and i have no doubt played to every soul of them the twelve tunes of his musicalbox  it was pleasant to see him with that musicalboxhow pleased he wound it up after dinnerhow happily he listened to the little clinking tunes as they galloped dingdong after each other  a man who carries a musicalbox is always a goodnatured man  then there was his grace or his grandeur the archbishop of beyrouth in the parts of the infidels his holinesss nuncio to the court of her most faithful majesty and who mingled among us like any simple mortalexcept that he had an extra smiling courtesy which simple mortals do not always possess and when you passed him as such and puffed your cigar in his face took off his hat with a grin of such prodigious rapture as to lead you to suppose that the most delicious privilege of his whole life was that permission to look at the tip of your nose or of your cigar with this most reverend prelate was his graces brother and chaplaina very greasy and goodnatured ecclesiastic who from his physiognomy i would have imagined to be a dignitary of the israelitish rather than the romish churchas profuse in smiling courtesy as his lordship of beyrouth  these two had a meek little secretary between them and a tall french cook and valet who at meal times might be seen busy about the cabin where their reverences lay  they were on their backs for the greater part of the voyage their yellow countenances were not only unshaven but to judge from appearances unwashed  they ate in private and it was only of evenings as the sun was setting over the western wave and comforted by the dinner the cabinpassengers assembled on the quarterdeck that we saw the dark faces of the reverend gentlemen among us for a while  they sank darkly into their berths when the stewards bell tolled for tea  at lisbon where we came to anchor at midnight a special boat came off whereof the crew exhibited every token of reverence for the ambassador of the ambassador of heaven and carried him off from our company  this abrupt departure in the darkness disappointed some of us who had promised ourselves the pleasure of seeing his grandeur depart in state in the morning shaved clean and in full pontificals the tripping little secretary swinging an incensepot before him and the greasy chaplain bearing his crosier  next day we had another bishop who occupied the very same berth his grace of beyrouth had quittedwas sick in the very same way so much so that this cabin of the lady mary wood is to be christened the bishops berth henceforth and a handsome mitre is to be painted on the basin  bishop no 2 was a very stout soft kindlooking old gentleman in a square cap with a handsome tassel of green and gold round his portly breast and back  he was dressed in black robes and tight purple stockings  and we carried him from lisbon to the little flat coast of faro of which the meek old gentleman was the chief pastor  we had not been halfanhour from our anchorage in the tagus when his lordship dived down into the episcopal berth  all that night there was a good smart breeze it blew fresh all the next day as we went jumping over the blue bright sea and there was no sign of his lordship the bishop until we were opposite the purple hills of algarve which lay some ten miles distanta yellow sunny shore stretching flat before them whose long sandy flats and villages we could see with our telescope from the steamer  presently a little vessel with a huge shining lateen sail and bearing the blue and white portuguese flag was seen playing a sort of leapfrog on the jolly waves jumping over them and ducking down as merry as could be  this little boat came towards the steamer as quick as ever she could jump and captain cooper roaring out stop her to lady mary wood her ladyships paddles suddenly ceased twirling and news was carried to the good bishop that his boat was almost alongside and that his hour was come  it was rather an affecting sight to see the poor old fat gentleman looking wistfully over the water as the boat now came up and her eight seamen with great noise energy and gesticulation laid her by the steamer  the steamer steps were let down his lordships servant in blue and yellow livery like the edinburgh review cast over the episcopal luggage into the boat along with his own bundle and the jackboots with which he rides postilion on one of the bishops fat mules at faro  the blue and yellow domestic went down the steps into the boat  then came the bishops turn but he couldnt do it for a long while  he went from one passenger to another sadly shaking them by the hand often taking leave and seeming loth to depart until captain cooper in a stern but respectful tone touched him on the shoulder and said i know not with what correctness being ignorant of the spanish language senor bispo  senor bispo on which summons the poor old man looking ruefully round him once more put his square cap under his arm tucked up his long black petticoats so as to show his purple stockings and jolly fat calves and went trembling down the steps towards the boat  the good old man  i wish i had had a shake of that trembling podgy hand somehow before he went upon his sea martyrdom  i felt a love for that softhearted old christian  ah let us hope his governante tucked him comfortably in bed when he got to faro that night and made him a warm gruel and put his feet in warm water  the men clung around him and almost kissed him as they popped him into the boat but he did not heed their caresses away went the boat scudding madly before the wind  bang another lateensailed boat in the distance fired a gun in his honour but the wind was blowing away from the shore and who knows when that meek bishop got home to his gruel  i think these were the notables of our party  i will not mention the laughing ogling lady of cadiz whose manners i very much regret to say were a great deal too lively for my sense of propriety nor those fair sufferers her companions who lay on the deck with sickly smiling female resignation  nor the heroic children who no sooner ate biscuit than they were ill and no sooner were ill than they began eating biscuit again  but just allude to one other martyr the kind lieutenant in charge of the mails and who bore his cross with what i cant but think a very touching and noble resignation  theres a certain sort of man whose doom in the world is disappointmentwho excels in itand whose luckless triumphs in his meek career of life i have often thought must be regarded by the kind eyes above with as much favour as the splendid successes and achievements of coarser and more prosperous men  as i sat with the lieutenant upon deck his telescope laid over his lean legs and he looking at the sunset with a pleased withered old face he gave me a little account of his history  i take it he is in nowise disinclined to talk about it simple as it is  he has been seven andthirty years in the navy being somewhat more mature in the service than lieutenant peel rearadmiral prince de joinville and other commanders who need not be mentioned  he is a very well educated man and reads prodigiouslytravels histories lives of eminent worthies and heroes in his simple way  he is not in the least angry at his want of luck in the profession  were i a boy tomorrow he said i would begin it again and when i see my schoolfellows and how they have got on in life if some are better off than i am i find many are worse and have no call to be discontented  so he carries her majestys mails meekly through this world waits upon portadmirals and captains in his old glazed hat and is as proud of the pennon at the bow of his little boat as if it were flying from the mainmast of a thundering manofwar he gets two hundred a year for his services and has an old mother and a sister living in england somewhere who i will wager though he never i swear said a word about it have a good portion of this princely income  is it breaking a confidence to tell lieutenant bundys history let the motive excuse the deed  it is a good kind wholesome and noble character  why should we keep all our admiration for those who win in this world as we do sycophants as we are  when we write a novel our great stupid imaginations can go no further than to marry the hero to a fortune at the end and to find out that he is a lord by right  o blundering lickspittle morality  and yet i would like to fancy some happy retributive utopia in the peaceful cloudland where my friend the meek lieutenant should find the yards of his ship manned as he went on board all the guns firing an enormous salute only without the least noise or vile smell of powder and he be saluted on the deck as admiral sir james or sir josephay or lord viscount bundy knight of all the orders above the sun  i think this is a sufficient if not a complete catalogue of the worthies on board the lady mary wood  in the week we were on boardit seemed a year by the waywe came to regard the ship quite as a home  we felt for the captainthe most goodhumoured active careful ready of captainsa filial a fraternal regard for the providor who provided for us with admirable comfort and generosity a genial gratitude and for the brisk stewards lads brisk in serving the banquet sympathising in handing the basin every possible sentiment of regard and goodwill  what winds blew and how many knots we ran are all noted down no doubt in the ships log  and as for what ships we sawevery one of them with their gunnage tonnage their nation their direction whither they were boundwere not these all noted down with surprising ingenuity and precision by the lieutenant at a family desk at which he sat every night before a great paper elegantly and mysteriously ruled off with his large ruler  i have a regard for every man on board that ship from the captain down to the crewdown even to the cook with tattooed arms sweating among the saucepans in the galley who used with a touching affection to send us locks of his hair in the soup  and so while our feelings and recollections are warm let us shake hands with this knot of good fellows comfortably floating about in their little box of wood and iron across channel biscay bay and the atlantic from southampton water to gibraltar straits    chapter iv  gibraltar    suppose all the nations of the earth to send fitting ambassadors to represent them at wapping or portsmouth point with each under its own national signboard and language its appropriate house of call and your imagination may figure the main street of gibraltar almost the only part of the town i believe which boasts of the name of street at all the remaining houserows being modestly called lanes such as bomb lane battery lane fusee lane and so on  in main street the jews predominate the moors abound and from the jolly sailor or the brave horse marine where the people of our nation are drinking british beer and gin you hear choruses of garryowen or the lass i left behind me while through the flaring lattices of the spanish ventas come the clatter of castanets and the jingle and moan of spanish guitars and ditties  it is a curious sight at evening this thronged street with the people in a hundred different costumes bustling to and fro under the coarse flare of the lamps swarthy moors in white or crimson robes dark spanish smugglers in tufted hats with gay silk handkerchiefs round their heads fuddled seamen from menofwar or merchantmen porters galician or genoese and at every few minutes interval little squads of soldiers tramping to relieve guard at some one of the innumerable posts in the town  some of our party went to a spanish venta as a more convenient or romantic place of residence than an english house others made choice of the clubhouse in commercial square of which i formed an agreeable picture in my imagination rather perhaps resembling the junior united service club in charles street by which every londoner has passed ere this with respectful pleasure catching glimpses of magnificent blazing candelabras under which sit neat halfpay officers drinking halfpints of port  the clubhouse of gibraltar is not however of the charles street sort  it may have been cheerful once and there are yet relics of splendour about it when officers wore pigtails and in the time of governor ohara it may have been a handsome place but it is mouldy and decrepit now and though his excellency mr bulwer was living there and made no complaints that i heard of other less distinguished persons thought they had reason to grumble  indeed what is travelling made of  at least half its pleasures and incidents come out of inns and of them the tourist can speak with much more truth and vivacity than of historical recollections compiled out of histories or filched out of handbooks  but to speak of the best inn in a place needs no apology  that at least is useful information  as every person intending to visit gibraltar cannot have seen the fleabitten countenances of our companions who fled from their spanish venta to take refuge at the club the morning after our arrival they may surely be thankful for being directed to the best house of accommodation in one of the most unromantic uncomfortable and prosaic of towns  if one had a right to break the sacred confidence of the mahogany i could entertain you with many queer stories of gibraltar life gathered from the lips of the gentlemen who enjoyed themselves round the dingy tablecloth of the clubhouse coffeeroom richly decorated with cold gravy and spilt beer  i heard there the very names of the gentlemen who wrote the famous letters from the warspite regarding the french proceedings at mogador and met several refugee jews from that place who said that they were much more afraid of the kabyles without the city than of the guns of the french squadron of which they seemed to make rather light  i heard the last odds on the ensuing match between captain smiths b g bolter and captain browns ch c roarer  how the gunroom of her majestys ship purgatory had cobbed a tradesman of the town and of the row in consequence  i heard capital stories of the way in which wilkins had escaped the guard and thompson had been locked up among the mosquitoes for being out after ten without the lantern  i heard how the governor was an old  but to say what would be breaking a confidence  only this may be divulged that the epithet was exceedingly complimentary to sir robert wilson  all the while these conversations were going on a strange scene of noise and bustle was passing in the marketplace in front of the window where moors jews spaniards soldiers were thronging in the sun and a ragged fat fellow mounted on a tobaccobarrel with his hat cocked on his ear was holding an auction and roaring with an energy and impudence that would have done credit to covent garden  the moorish castle is the only building about the rock which has an air at all picturesque or romantic there is a plain roman catholic cathedral a hideous new protestant church of the cigardivan architecture and a courthouse with a portico which is said to be an imitation of the parthenon  the ancient religions houses of the spanish town are gone or turned into military residences and masked so that you would never know their former pious destination you walk through narrow whitewashed lanes bearing such martial names as are before mentioned and bystreets with barracks on either side  small newgatelike looking buildings at the doors of which you may see the sergeants ladies conversing or at the open windows of the officers quarters ensign fipps lying on his sofa and smoking his cigar or lieutenant simson practising the flute to while away the weary hours of garrison dulness  i was surprised not to find more persons in the garrison library where is a magnificent readingroom and an admirable collection of books  in spite of the scanty herbage and the dust on the trees the alameda is a beautiful walk of which the vegetation has been as laboriously cared for as the tremendous fortifications which flank it on either side  the vast rock rises on one side with its interminable works of defence and gibraltar bay is shining on the other out on which from the terraces immense cannon are perpetually looking surrounded by plantations of cannonballs and beds of bombshells sufficient one would think to blow away the whole peninsula  the horticultural and military mixture is indeed very queer  here and there temples rustic summerseats c have been erected in the garden but you are sure to see a great squat mortar look up from among the flowerpots  and amidst the aloes and geraniums sprouts the green petticoat and scarlet coat of a highlander  fatigueparties are seen winding up the hill and busy about the endless cannonball plantations awkward squads are drilling in the open spaces  sentries marching everywhere and this is a caution to artists i am told have orders to run any man through who is discovered making a sketch of the place  it is always beautiful especially at evening when the people are sauntering along the walks and the moon is shining on the waters of the bay and the hills and twinkling white houses of the opposite shore  then the place becomes quite romantic  it is too dark to see the dust on the dried leaves the cannonballs do not intrude too much but have subsided into the shade the awkward squads are in bed even the loungers are gone the fanflirting spanish ladies the sallow blackeyed children and the trim whitejacketed dandies  a fife is heard from some craft at roost on the quiet waters somewhere or a faint cheer from yonder black steamer at the mole which is about to set out on some night expedition  you forget that the town is at all like wapping and deliver yourself up entirely to romance the sentries look noble pacing there silent in the moonlight and sandys voice is quite musical as he challenges with a who goes there  alls well is very pleasant when sung decently in tune and inspires noble and poetic ideas of duty courage and danger  but when you hear it shouted all the night through accompanied by a clapping of muskets in a time of profound peace the sentinels cry becomes no more romantic to the hearer than it is to the sandy connaughtman or the barelegged highlander who delivers it  it is best to read about wars comfortably in harry lorrequer or scotts novels in which knights shout their warcries and jovial irish bayoneteers hurrah without depriving you of any blessed rest  men of a different way of thinking however can suit themselves perfectly at gibraltar where there is marching and counter marching challenging and relieving guard all the night through and not here in commercial square alone but all over the huge rock in the darknessall through the mysterious zigzags and round the dark cannonball pyramids and along the vast rockgalleries and up to the topmost flagstaff where the sentry can look out over two seas poor fellows are marching and clapping muskets and crying alls well dressed in cap and feather in place of honest nightcaps best befitting the decent hours of sleep  all these martial noises three of us heard to the utmost advantage lying on iron bedsteads at the time in a cracked old room on the groundfloor the open windows of which looked into the square  no spot could be more favourably selected for watching the humours of a garrison town by night  about midnight the door hard by us was visited by a party of young officers who having had quite as much drink as was good for them were naturally inclined for more and when we remonstrated through the windows one of them in a young tipsy voice asked after our mothers and finally reeled away  how charming is the conversation of highspirited youth  i dont know whether the guard got hold of them  but certainly if a civilian had been hiccuping through the streets at that hour he would have been carried off to the guardhouse and left to the mercy of the mosquitoes there and had up before the governor in the morning the young man in the coffeeroom tells me he goes to sleep every night with the keys of gibraltar under his pillow  it is an awful image and somehow completes the notion of the slumbering fortress fancy sir robert wilson his nose just visible over the sheets his nightcap and the huge key you see the very identical one in reynoldss portrait of lord heathfield peeping out from under the bolster   if i entertain you with accounts of inns and nightcaps it is because i am more familiar with these subjects than with history and fortifications  as far as i can understand the former gibraltar is the great british depot for smuggling goods into the peninsula  you see vessels lying in the harbour and are told in so many words they are smugglers  all those smart spaniards with cigar and mantles are smugglers and run tobaccos and cotton into catalonia all the respected merchants of the place are smugglers the other day a spanish revenue vessel was shot to death under the thundering great guns of the fort for neglecting to bring to but it so happened that it was in chase of a smuggler  in this little corner of her dominions britain proclaims war to customhouses and protection to free trade  perhaps ere a very long day england may be acting that part towards the world which gibraltar performs towards spain now and the last war in which we shall ever engage may be a customhouse war  for once establish railroads and abolish preventive duties through europe and what is there left to fight for  it will matter very little then under what flag people live and foreign ministers and ambassadors may enjoy a dignified sinecure the army will rise to the rank of peaceful constables not having any more use for their bayonets than those worthy people have for their weapons now who accompany the law at assizes under the name of javelinmen  the apparatus of bombs and eightyfour pounders may disappear from the alameda and the crops of cannon balls which now grow there may give place to other plants more pleasant to the eye and the great key of gibraltar may be left in the gate for anybody to turn at will and sir robert wilson may sleep in quiet  i am afraid i thought it was rather a release when having made up our minds to examine the rock in detail and view the magnificent excavations and galleries the admiration of all military men and the terror of any enemies who may attack the fortress we received orders to embark forthwith in the tagus which was to early us to malta and constantinople  so we took leave of this famous rock this great blunderbusswhich we seized out of the hands of the natural owners a hundred and forty years ago and which we have kept ever since tremendously loaded and cleaned and ready for use to seize and have it is doubtless a gallant thing it is like one of those tests of courage which one reads of in the chivalrous romances when for instance sir huon of bordeaux is called upon to prove his knighthood by going to babylon and pulling out the sultans beard and front teeth in the midst of his court there but after all justice must confess it was rather hard on the poor sultan  if we had the spaniards established at lands end with impregnable spanish fortifications on st michaels mount we should perhaps come to the same conclusion  meanwhile let us hope during this long period of deprivation the sultan of spain is reconciled to the loss of his front teeth and bristling whiskers let us even try to think that he is better without them  at all events right or wrong whatever may be our title to the property there is no englishman but must think with pride of the manner in which his countrymen have kept it and of the courage endurance and sense of duty with which stout old eliott and his companions resisted crillon and the spanish battering ships and his fifty thousand men  there seems to be something more noble in the success of a gallant resistance than of an attack however brave after failing in his attack on the fort the french general visited the english commander who had foiled him and parted from him and his garrison in perfect politeness and goodhumour  the english troops drinkwater says gave him thundering cheers as he went away and the french in return complimented us on our gallantry and lauded the humanity of our people  if we are to go on murdering each other in the oldfashioned way what a pity it is that our battles cannot end in the oldfashioned way too  one of our fellowtravellers who had written a book and had suffered considerably from seasickness during our passage along the coasts of france and spain consoled us all by saying that the very minute we got into the mediterranean we might consider ourselves entirely free from illness and in fact that it was unheard of in the inland sea  even in the bay of gibraltar the water looked bluer than anything i have ever seenexcept miss smiths eyes  i thought somehow the delicious faultless azure never could look angryjust like the eyes before alluded toand under this assurance we passed the strait and began coasting the african shore calmly and without the least apprehension as if we were as much used to the tempest as mr t p cooke  but when in spite of the promise of the man who had written the book we found ourselves worse than in the worst part of the bay of biscay or off the stormlashed rocks of finisterre we set down the author in question as a gross impostor and had a mind to quarrel with him for leading us into this cruel error  the most provoking part of the matter too was that the sky was deliciously clear and cloudless the air balmy the sea so insultingly blue that it seemed as if we had no right to be ill at all and that the innumerable little waves that frisked round about our keel were enjoying an anerithmon gelasma this is one of my four greek quotations  depend on it i will manage to introduce the other three before the tour is doneseemed to be enjoying i say the abovenamed greek quotation at our expense  here is the dismal log of wednesday 4th of september all attempts at dining very fruitless  basins in requisition  wind hard ahead  que diable allaisje faire dans cette galere  writing or thinking impossible so read letters from the aegean  these brief words give i think a complete idea of wretchedness despair remorse and prostration of soul and body  two days previously we passed the forts and moles and yellow buildings of algiers rising very stately from the sea and skirted by gloomy purple lines of african shore with fires smoking in the mountains and lonely settlements here and there  on the 5th to the inexpressible joy of all we reached valetta the entrance to the harbour of which is one of the most stately and agreeable scenes ever admired by seasick traveller  the small basin was busy with a hundred ships from the huge guardship which lies there a city in itselfmerchantmen loading and crews cheering under all the flags of the world flaunting in the sunshine a halfscore of busy black steamers perpetually coming and going coaling and painting and puffing and hissing in and out of harbour slim menofwars barges shooting to and fro with long shining oars flashing like wings over the water hundreds of painted townboats with high heads and white awningsdown to the little tubs in which some naked tawny young beggars came paddling up to the steamer entreating us to let them dive for halfpence round this busy blue water rise rocks blazing in sunshine and covered with every imaginable device of fortification to the right st elmo with flag and lighthouse and opposite the military hospital looking like a palace and all round the houses of the city for its size the handsomest and most stately in the world  nor does it disappoint you on a closer inspection as many a foreign town does  the streets are thronged with a lively comfortablelooking population the poor seem to inhabit handsome stone palaces with balconies and projecting windows of heavy carved stone  the lights and shadows the cries and stenches the fruitshops and fishstalls the dresses and chatter of all nations the soldiers in scarlet and women in black mantillas the beggars boatmen barrels of pickled herrings and macaroni the shovelhatted priests and bearded capuchins the tobacco grapes onions and sunshine the signboards bottledporter stores the statues of saints and little chapels which jostle the strangers eyes as he goes up the famous stairs from the watergate make a scene of such pleasant confusion and liveliness as i have never witnessed before  and the effect of the groups of multitudinous actors in this busy cheerful drama is heightened as it were by the decorations of the stage  the sky is delightfully brilliant all the houses and ornaments are stately castle and palaces are rising all around and the flag towers and walls of fort st elmo look as fresh and magnificent as if they had been erected only yesterday  the strada reale has a much more courtly appearance than that one described  here are palaces churches courthouses and libraries the genteel london shops and the latest articles of perfumery gay young officers are strolling about in shelljackets much too small for them  midshipmen are clattering by on hired horses squads of priests habited after the fashion of don basilio in the opera are demurely pacing to and fro professional beggars run shrieking after the stranger and agents for horses for inns and for worse places still follow him and insinuate the excellence of their goods  the houses where they are selling carpetbags and pomatum were the palaces of the successors of the goodliest company of gallant knights the world ever heard tell of  it seems unromantic but these were not the romantic knights of st john the heroic days of the order ended as the last turkish galley lifted anchor after the memorable siege  the present stately houses were built in times of peace and splendour and decay  i doubt whether the auberge de provence where the union club flourishes now has ever seen anything more romantic than the pleasant balls held in the great room there  the church of st john not a handsome structure without is magnificent within  a noble hall covered with a rich embroidery of gilded carving the chapels of the different nations on either side but not interfering with the main structure of which the whole is simple and the details only splendid it seemed to me a fitting place for this wealthy body of aristocratic soldiers who made their devotions as it were on parade and though on their knees never forgot their epaulets or their quarters of nobility this mixture of religion and worldly pride seems incongruous at first but have we not at church at home similar relics of feudal ceremonythe verger with the silver mace who precedes the vicar to the desk the two chaplains of my lord archbishop who bow over his grace as he enters the communiontable gate even poor john who follows my lady with a coroneted prayerbook and makes his conge as he hands it into the pew  what a chivalrous absurdity is the banner of some high and mighty prince hanging over his stall in windsor chapel when you think of the purpose for which men are supposed to assemble there  the church of the knights of st john is paved over with sprawling heraldic devices of the dead gentlemen of the dead order as if in the next world they expected to take rank in conformity with their pedigrees and would be marshalled into heaven according to the orders of precedence  cumbrous handsome paintings adorn the walls and chapels decorated with pompous monuments of grand masters  beneath is a crypt where more of these honourable and reverend warriors lie in a state that a simpson would admire  in the altar are said to lie three of the most gallant relics in the world  the keys of acre rhodes and jerusalem  what blood was shed in defending these emblems  what faith endurance genius and generosity what pride hatred ambition and savage lust of blood were roused together for their guardianship  in the lofty halls and corridors of the governors house some portraits of the late grand masters still remain  a very fine one by caravaggio of a knight in gilt armour hangs in the dining room near a fulllength of poor louis xvi in royal robes the very picture of uneasy impotency  but the portrait of de vignacourt is the only one which has a respectable air the other chiefs of the famous society are pompous old gentlemen in black with huge periwigs and crowns round their hats and a couple of melancholy pages in yellow and red  but pages and wigs and grand masters have almost faded out of the canvas and are vanishing into hades with a most melancholy indistinctness  the names of most of these gentlemen however live as yet in the forts of the place which all seem to have been eager to build and christen  so that it seems as if in the malta mythology they had been turned into freestone  in the armoury is the very suit painted by caravaggio by the side of the armour of the noble old la valette whose heroism saved his island from the efforts of mustapha and dragut and an army quite as fierce and numerous as that which was baffled before gibraltar by similar courage and resolution  the sword of the lastnamed famous corsair a most truculent little scimitar thousands of pikes and halberts little old cannons and wallpieces helmets and cuirasses which the knights or their people wore are trimly arranged against the wall and instead of spiking turks or arming warriors now serve to point morals and adorn tales  and here likewise are kept many thousand muskets swords and boardingpikes for daily use and a couple of ragged old standards of one of the english regiments who pursued and conquered in egypt the remains of the haughty and famous french republican army at whose appearance the last knights of malta flung open the gates of all their fortresses and consented to be extinguished without so much as a remonstrance or a kick or a struggle  we took a drive into what may be called the country where the fields are rocks and the hedges are stonespassing by the stone gardens of the florian and wondering at the number and handsomeness of the stone villages and churches rising everywhere among the stony hills  handsome villas were passed everywhere and we drove for a long distance along the sides of an aqueduct quite a royal work of the caravaggio in gold armour the grand master de vignacourt  a most agreeable contrast to the arid rocks of the general scenery was the garden at the governors countryhouse with the orangetrees and water its beautiful golden grapes luxuriant flowers and thick cool shrubberies  the eye longs for this sort of refreshment after being seared with the hot glare of the general country and st antonio was as pleasant after malta as malta was after the sea  we paid the island a subsequent visit in november passing seventeen days at an establishment called fort manuel there and by punsters the manuel des voyageurs where government accommodates you with quarters where the authorities are so attentive as to scent your letters with aromatic vinegar before you receive them and so careful of your health as to lock you up in your room every night lest you should walk in your sleep and so over the battlements into the seaif you escaped drowning in the sea the sentries on the opposite shore would fire at you hence the nature of the precaution  to drop however this satirical strain  those who know what quarantine is may fancy that the place somehow becomes unbearable in which it has been endured  and though the november climate of malta is like the most delicious may in england and though there is every gaiety and amusement in the town a comfortable little opera a good old library filled full of good old books none of your works of modern science travel and history but good old useless books of the last two centuries and nobody to trouble you in reading them and though the society of valetta is most hospitable varied and agreeable yet somehow one did not feel safe in the island with perpetual glimpses of fort manuel from the opposite shore and lest the quarantine authorities should have a fancy to fetch one back again on a pretext of posthumous plague we made our way to naples by the very first opportunitythose who remained that is of the little eastern expedition  they were not all there  the giver of life and death had removed two of our company  one was left behind to die in egypt with a mother to bewail his loss another we buried in the dismal lazaretto cemetery      one is bound to look at this too as a part of our journey disease and death are knocking perhaps at your next cabin door your kind and cheery companion has ridden his last ride and emptied his last glass beside you  and while fond hearts are yearning for him far away and his own mind if conscious is turning eagerly towards the spot of the world whither affection or interest calls itthe great father summons the anxious spirit from earth to himself and ordains that the nearest and dearest shall meet here no more  such an occurrence as a death in a lazaretto mere selfishness renders striking  we were walking with him but two days ago on deck  one has a sketch of him another his card with the address written yesterday and given with an invitation to come and see him at home in the country where his children are looking for him  he is dead in a day and buried in the walls of the prison  a doctor felt his pulse by deputya clergyman comes from the town to read the last service over himand the friends who attend his funeral are marshalled by lazarettoguardians so as not to touch each other  every man goes back to his room and applies the lesson to himself  one would not so depart without seeing again the dear dear faces  we reckon up those we love  they are but very few but i think one loves them better than ever now  should it be your turn nextand why not  is it pity or comfort to think of that affection which watches and survives you  the maker has linked together the whole race of man with this chain of love  i like to think that there is no man but has had kindly feelings for some other and he for his neighbour until we bind together the whole family of adam  nor does it end here  it joins heaven and earth together  for my friend or my child of past days is still my friend or my child to me here or in the home prepared for us by the father of all  if identity survives the grave as our faith tells us is it not a consolation to think that there may be one or two souls among the purified and just whose affection watches us invisible and follows the poor sinner on earth    chapter v  athens    not feeling any enthusiasm myself about athens my bounden duty of course is clear to sneer and laugh heartily at all who have  in fact what business has a lawyer who was in pump court this day three weeks and whose common reading is law reports or the newspaper to pretend to fall in love for the long vacation with mere poetry of which i swear a great deal is very doubtful and to get up an enthusiasm quite foreign to his nature and usual calling in life  what call have ladies to consider greece romantic they who get their notions of mythology from the wellknown pages of tookes pantheon  what is the reason that blundering yorkshire squires young dandies from corfu regiments jolly sailors from ships in the harbour and yellow old indians returning from bundelcund should think proper to be enthusiastic about a country of which they know nothing the mere physical beauty of which they cannot for the most part comprehend and because certain characters lived in it two thousand four hundred years ago  what have these people in common with pericles what have these ladies in common with aspasia o fie  of the race of englishmen who come wandering about the tomb of socrates do you think the majority would not have voted to hemlock him  yes  for the very same superstition which leads men by the nose now drove them onward in the days when the lowly husband of xantippe died for daring to think simply and to speak the truth  i know of no quality more magnificent in fools than their faith  that perfect consciousness they have that they are doing virtuous and meritorious actions when they are performing acts of folly murdering socrates or pelting aristides with holy oystershellsall for virtues sake and a history of dulness in all ages of the world is a book which a philosopher would surely be hanged but as certainly blessed for writing  if papa and mamma honour be to them had not followed the faith of their fathers and thought proper to send away their only beloved son afterwards to be celebrated under the name of titmarsh into ten years banishment of infernal misery tyranny annoyance to give over the fresh feelings of the heart of the little michael angelo to the discipline of vulgar bullies who in order to lead tender young children to the temple of learning as they do in the spellingbooks drive them on with clenched fists and low abuse if they fainted revive them with a thump or assailed them with a curse if they were miserable consoled them with a brutal jeerif i say my dear parents instead of giving me the inestimable benefit of a ten years classical education had kept me at home with my dear thirteen sisters it is probable i should have liked this country of attica in sight of the blue shores of which the present pathetic letter is written but i was made so miserable in youth by a classical education that all connected with it is disagreeable in my eyes and i have the same recollection of greek in youth that i have of castoroil  so in coming in sight of the promontory of sunium where the greek muse in an awful vision came to me and said in a patronising way why my dear she always the old spinster adopts this high and mighty tonewhy my dear are you not charmed to be in this famous neighbourhood in this land of poets and heroes of whose history your classical education ought to have made you a master if it did not you have wofully neglected your opportunities and your dear parents have wasted their money in sending you to school  i replied madam your company in youth was made so laboriously disagreeable to me that i cant at present reconcile myself to you in age  i read your poets but it was in fear and trembling and a cold sweat is but an ill accompaniment to poetry i blundered through your histories but history is so dull saving your presence of herself that when the brutal dulness of a schoolmaster is superadded to her own slow conversation the union becomes intolerable  hence i have not the slightest pleasure in renewing my acquaintance with a lady who has been the source of so much bodily and mental discomfort to me  to make a long story short i am anxious to apologise for a want of enthusiasm in the classical line and to excuse an ignorance which is of the most undeniable sort  this is an improper frame of mind for a person visiting the land of aeschylus and euripides add to which we have been abominably overcharged at the inn  and what are the blue hills of attica the silver calm basin of piraeus the heathery heights of pentelicus and yonder rocks crowned by the doric columns of the parthenon and the thin ionic shafts of the erechtheum to a man who has had little rest and is bitten all over by bugs  was alcibiades bitten by bugs i wonder and did the brutes crawl over him as he lay in the rosy arms of phryne  i wished all night for socratess hammock or basket as it is described in the clouds in which resting place no doubt the abominable animals kept perforce clear of him  a french manofwar lying in the silvery little harbour sternly eyeing out of its stern portholes a saucy little english corvette beside began playing sounding marches as a crowd of boats came paddling up to the steamers side to convey us travellers to shore there were russian schooners and greek brigs lying in this little bay dumpy little windmills whirling round on the sunburnt heights round about it an improvised town of quays and marine taverns has sprung up on the shore a host of jingling barouches more miserable than any to be seen even in germany were collected at the landingplace and the greek drivers how queer they looked in skullcaps shabby jackets with profuse embroidery of worsted and endless petticoats of dirty calico began in a generous ardour for securing passengers to abuse each others horses and carriages in the regular london fashion  satire could certainly hardly caricature the vehicle in which we were made to journey to athens and it was only by thinking that bad as they were these coaches were much more comfortable contrivances than any alcibiades or cimon ever had that we consoled ourselves along the road  it was flat for six miles along the plain to the city  and you see for the greater part of the way the purple mount on which the acropolis rises and the gleaming houses of the town spread beneath  round this wide yellow barren plaina stunted district of olivetrees is almost the only vegetation visiblethere rises as it were a sort of chorus of the most beautiful mountains the most elegant gracious and noble the eye ever looked on  these hills did not appear at all lofty or terrible but superbly rich and aristocratic  the clouds were dancing round about them you could see their rosy purple shadows sweeping round the clear serene summits of the hill  to call a hill aristocratic seems affected or absurd but the difference between these hills and the others is the difference between newgate prison and the travellers club for instance  both are buildings but the one stern dark and coarse the other rich elegant and festive  at least so i thought with such a stately palace as munificent nature had built for these people what could they be themselves but lordly beautiful brilliant brave and wise  we saw four greeks on donkeys on the road which is a dustwhirlwind where it is not a puddle and other four were playing with a dirty pack of cards at a barrack that english poets have christened the halfway house  does external nature and beauty influence the soul to good  you go about warwickshire and fancy that from merely being born and wandering in those sweet sunny plains and fresh woodlands shakspeare must have drunk in a portion of that frank artless sense of beauty which lies about his works like a bloom or dew but a coventry ribbonmaker or a slang leamington squire are looking on those very same landscapes too and what do they profit  you theorise about the influence which the climate and appearance of attica must have had in ennobling those who were born there yonder dirty swindling ragged blackguards lolling over greasy cards three hours before noon quarrelling and shrieking armed to the teeth and afraid to fight are bred out of the same land which begot the philosophers and heroes  but the halfway house is passed by this time and behold we are in the capital of king otho  i swear solemnly that i would rather have two hundred a year in fleet street than be king of the greeks with basileus written before my name round their beggarly coin with the bother of perpetual revolutions in my huge plasterofparis palace with no amusement but a drive in the afternoon over a wretched arid country where roads are not made with ambassadors the deuce knows why for what good can the english or the french or the russian party get out of such a bankrupt alliance as this perpetually pulling and tugging at me away from honest germany where there is beer and aesthetic conversation and operas at a small cost  the shabbiness of this place actually beats ireland and that is a strong word  the palace of the basileus is an enormous edifice of plaster in a square containing six houses three donkeys no roads no fountains except in the picture of the inn backwards it seems to look straight to the mountainon one side is a beggarly gardenthe king goes out to drive revolutions permitting at fivesome fourandtwenty blackguards saunter up to the huge sandhill of a terrace as his majesty passes by in a gilt barouche and an absurd fancy dress the gilt barouche goes plunging down the sandhills the two dozen soldiers who have been presenting arms slouch off to their quarters the vast barrack of a palace remains entirely white ghastly and lonely and save the braying of a donkey now and then which longeared minstrels are more active and sonorous in athens than in any place i know all is entirely silent round basileuss palace  how could people who knew leopold fancy he would be so jolly green as to take such a berth  it was only a gobemouche of a bavarian that could ever have been induced to accept it  i beseech you to believe that it was not the bill and the bugs at the inn which induced the writer hereof to speak so slightingly of the residence of basileus  these evils are now cured and forgotten  this is written off the leaden flats and mounds which they call the troad  it is stern justice alone which pronounces this excruciating sentence  it was a farce to make this place into a kingly capital and i make no manner of doubt that king otho the very day he can get away unperceived and get together the passage money will be off for dear old deutschland fatherland beerland  i have never seen a town in england which may be compared to this for though herne bay is a ruin now money was once spent upon it and houses built here beyond a few score of mansions comfortably laid out the town is little better than a rickety agglomeration of larger and smaller huts tricked out here and there with the most absurd cracked ornaments and cheap attempts at elegance  but neatness is the elegance of poverty and these people despise such a homely ornament  i have got a map with squares fountains theatres public gardens and places dothon marked out but they only exist in the paper capitalthe wretched tumbledown wooden one boasts of none  one is obliged to come back to the old disagreeable comparison of ireland  athens may be about as wealthy a place as carlow or killarneythe streets swarm with idle crowds the innumerable little lanes flow over with dirty little children they are playing and puddling about in the dirt everywhere with great big eyes yellow faces and the queerest little gowns and skullcaps  but in the outer man the greek has far the advantage of the irishman most of them are well and decently dressed if fiveandtwenty yards of petticoat may not be called decent what may they swagger to and fro with huge knives in their girdles  almost all the men are handsome but live hard it is said in order to decorate their backs with those fine clothes of theirs  i have seen but two or three handsome women and these had the great drawback which is common to the racei mean a sallow greasy coarse complexion at which it was not advisable to look too closely  and on this score i think we english may pride ourselves on possessing an advantage by we i mean the lovely ladies to whom this is addressed with the most respectful compliments over the most classical country in the world  i dont care for beauty which will only bear to be looked at from a distance like a scene in a theatre  what is the most beautiful nose in the world if it be covered with a skin of the texture and colour of coarse whitey brown paper and if nature has made it as slippery and shining as though it had been anointed with pomatum  they may talk about beauty but would you wear a flower that had been dipped in a greasepot  no give me a fresh dewy healthy rose out of somersetshire not one of those superb tawdry unwholesome exotics which are only good to make poems about  lord byron wrote more cant of this sort than any poet i know of  think of the peasant girls with dark blue eyes of the rhinethe brownfaced flatnosed thicklipped dirty wenches  think of filling high a cup of samian wine small beer is nectar compared to it and byron himself always drank gin  that man never wrote from his heart  he got up rapture and enthusiasm with an eye to the public but this is dangerous ground even more dangerous than to look athens full in the face and say that your eyes are not dazzled by its beauty the great public admires greece and byron  the public knows best murrays guidebook calls the latter our native bard  our native bard  mon dieu  he shakspeares miltons keatss scotts native bard  well woe be to the man who denies the public gods  the truth is then that athens is a disappointment and i am angry that it should be so  to a skilled antiquarian or an enthusiastic greek scholar the feelings created by a sight of the place of course will be different but you who would be inspired by it must undergo a long preparation of reading and possess too a particular feeling both of which i suspect are uncommon in our busy commercial newspaperreading country  men only say they are enthusiastic about the greek and roman authors and history because it is considered proper and respectable  and we know how gentlemen in baker street have editions of the classics handsomely bound in the library and how they use them  of course they dont retire to read the newspaper it is to look over a favourite ode of pindar or to discuss an obscure passage in athenaeus  of course country magistrates and members of parliament are always studying demosthenes and cicero we know it from their continual habit of quoting the latin grammar in parliament  but it is agreed that the classics are respectable therefore we are to be enthusiastic about them  also let us admit that byron is to be held up as our native bard  i am not so entire a heathen as to be insensible to the beauty of those relics of greek art of which men much more learned and enthusiastic have written such piles of descriptions  i thought i could recognise the towering beauty of the prodigious columns of the temple of jupiter and admire the astonishing grace severity elegance completeness of the parthenon  the little temple of victory with its fluted corinthian shafts blazed under the sun almost as fresh as it must have appeared to the eyes of its founders i saw nothing more charming and brilliant more graceful festive and aristocratic than this sumptuous little building  the roman remains which lie in the town below look like the works of barbarians beside these perfect structures  they jar strangely on the eye after it has been accustoming itself to perfect harmony and proportions  if as the schoolmaster tells us the greek writing is as complete as the greek art if an ode of pindar is as glittering and pure as the temple of victory or a discourse of plato as polished and calm as yonder mystical portico of the erechtheum  what treasures of the senses and delights of the imagination have those lost to whom the greek books are as good as sealed  and yet one meets with very dull firstclass men  genius wont transplant from one brain to another or is ruined in the carriage like fine burgundy  sir robert peel and sir john hobhouse are both good scholars but their poetry in parliament does not strike one as fine  muzzle the schoolmaster who is bullying poor trembling little boys was a fine scholar when he was a sizar and a ruffian then and ever since  where is the great poet since the days of milton who has improved the natural offshoots of his brain by grafting it from the athenian tree  i had a volume of tennyson in my pocket which somehow settled that question and ended the querulous dispute between me and conscience under the shape of the neglected and irritated greek muse which had been going on ever since i had commenced my walk about athens  the old spinster saw me wince at the idea of the author of dora and ulysses and tried to follow up her advantage by farther hints of time lost and precious opportunities thrown away you might have written poems like them said she or no not like them perhaps but you might have done a neat prize poem and pleased your papa and mamma  you might have translated jack and jill into greek iambics and been a credit to your college  i turned testily away from her  madam says i because an eagle houses on a mountain or soars to the sun dont you be angry with a sparrow that perches on a garret window or twitters on a twig leave me to myself  look my beak is not aquiline by any means  and so my dear friend you who have been reading this last page in wonder and who instead of a description of athens have been accommodated with a lament on the part of the writer that he was idle at school and does not know greek excuse this momentary outbreak of egotistic despondency  to say truth dear jones when one walks among the nests of the eagles and sees the prodigious eggs they laid a certain feeling of discomfiture must come over us smaller birds  you and i could not inventit even stretches our minds painfully to try and comprehend part of the beauty of the parthenonever so little of itthe beauty of a single columna fragment of a broken shaft lying under the astonishing blue sky there in the midst of that unrivalled landscape  there may be grander aspects of nature but none more deliciously beautiful the hills rise in perfect harmony and fall in the most exquisite cadencesthe sea seems brighter the islands more purple the clouds more light and rosy than elsewhere  as you look up through the open roof you are almost oppressed by the serene depth of the blue overhead  look even at the fragments of the marble how soft and pure it is glittering and white like fresh snow  i was all beautiful it seems to say  even the hidden parts of me were spotless precious and fairand so musing over this wonderful scene perhaps i get some feeble glimpse or idea of that ancient greek spirit which peopled it with sublime races of heroes and gods 1 and which i never could get out of a greek bookno not though muzzle flung it at my head    chapter vi  smyrnafirst glimpses of the east    i am glad that the turkish part of athens was extinct so that i should not be baulked of the pleasure of entering an eastern town by an introduction to any garbled or incomplete specimen of one smyrna seems to me the most eastern of all i have seen as calais will probably remain to the englishman the most french town in the world  the jackboots of the postilions dont seem so huge elsewhere or the tight stockings of the maidservants so gallic the churches and the ramparts and the little soldiers on them remain for ever impressed upon your memory from which larger temples and buildings and whole armies have subsequently disappeared  and the first words of actual french heard spoken and the first dinner at quillacqs remain after twenty years as clear as on the first day  dear jones cant you remember the exact smack of the white hermitage and the toothless old fellow singing largo al factotum  the first day in the east is like that  after that there is nothing  the wonder is gone and the thrill of that delightful shock which so seldom touches the nerves of plain men of the world though they seek for it everywhere  one such looked out at smyrna from our steamer and yawned without the least excitement and did not betray the slightest emotion as boats with real turks on board came up to the ship  there lay the town with minarets and cypresses domes and castles great guns were firing off and the bloodred flag of the sultan flaring over the fort ever since sunrise woods and mountains came down to the gulfs edge and as you looked at them with the telescope there peeped out of the general mass a score of pleasant episodes of eastern lifethere were cottages with quaint roofs silent cool kiosks where the chief of the eunuchs brings down the ladies of the harem  i saw hassan the fisherman getting his nets and ali baba going off with his donkey to the great forest for wood  smith looked at these wonders quite unmoved and i was surprised at his apathy but he had been at smyrna before  a man only sees the miracle once though you yearn over it ever so it wont come again  i saw nothing of ali baba and hassan the next time we came to smyrna and had some doubts recollecting the badness of the inn about landing at all  a person who wishes to understand france or the east should come in a yacht to calais or smyrna land for two hours and never afterwards go back again  but those two hours are beyond measure delightful  some of us were querulous up to that time and doubted of the wisdom of making the voyage  lisbon we owned was a failure athens a dead failure malta very well but not worth the trouble and seasickness  in fact badenbaden or devonshire would be a better move than this when smyrna came and rebuked all mutinous cockneys into silence some men may read this who are in want of a sensation  if they love the odd and picturesque if they loved the arabian nights in their youth let them book themselves on board one of the peninsular and oriental vessels and try one dip into constantinople or smyrna  walk into the bazaar and the east is unveiled to you  how often and often have you tried to fancy this lying out on a summer holiday at school  it is wonderful too how like it is  you may imagine that you have been in the place before you seem to know it so well  the beauty of that poetry is to me that it was never too handsome there is no fatigue of sublimity about it  shacabac and the little barber play as great a part in it as the heroes there are no uncomfortable sensations of terror you may be familiar with the great afreet who was going to execute the travellers for killing his son with a datestone  morgiana when she kills the forty robbers with boiling oil does not seem to hurt them in the least and though king schahriar makes a practice of cutting off his wives heads yet you fancy they have got them on again in some of the back rooms of the palace where they are dancing and playing on dulcimers  how fresh easy goodnatured is all this  how delightful is that notion of the pleasant eastern people about knowledge where the height of science is made to consist in the answering of riddles and all the mathematicians and magicians bring their great beards to bear on a conundrum  when i got into the bazaar among this race somehow i felt as if they were all friends  there sat the merchants in their little shops quiet and solemn but with friendly looks  there was no smoking it was the ramazan no eating the fish and meat fizzing in the enormous pots of the cookshops are only for the christians the children abounded the law is not so stringent upon them and many wandering merchants were there selling figs in the name of the prophet doubtless for their benefit and elbowing onwards with baskets of grapes and cucumbers  countrymen passed bristling over with arms each with a huge bellyful of pistols and daggers in his girdle fierce but not the least dangerous  wild swarthy arabs who had come in with the caravans walked solemnly about very different in look and demeanour from the sleek inhabitants of the town  greeks and jews squatted and smoked their shops tended by sallowfaced boys with large eyes who smiled and welcomed you in negroes bustled about in gaudy colours and women with black nosebags and shuffling yellow slippers chattered and bargained at the doors of the little shops  there was the rope quarter and the sweetmeat quarter and the pipe bazaar and the arm bazaar and the little turnedup shoe quarter and the shops where readymade jackets and pelisses were swinging and the region where under the ragged awning regiments of tailors were at work  the sun peeps through these awnings of mat or canvas which are hung over the narrow lanes of the bazaar and ornaments them with a thousand freaks of light and shadow  cogia hassan alhabbals shop is in a blaze of light while his neighbour the barber and coffeehouse keeper has his premises his low seats and narghiles his queer pots and basins in the shade  the cobblers are always good natured there was one who i am sure has been revealed to me in my dreams in a dirty old green turban with a pleasant wrinkled face like an apple twinkling his little grey eyes as he held them up to talk to the gossips and smiling under a delightful old grey beard which did the heart good to see  you divine the conversation between him and the cucumberman as the sultan used to understand the language of birds  are any of those cucumbers stuffed with pearls and is that armenian with the black square turban haroun alraschid in disguise standing yonder by the fountain where the children are drinkingthe gleaming marble fountain chequered all over with light and shadow and engraved with delicate arabesques and sentences from the koran  but the greatest sensation of all is when the camels come  whole strings of real camels better even than in the procession of blue beard with soft rolling eyes and bended necks swaying from one side of the bazaar to the other to and fro and treading gingerly with their great feet  o you fairy dreams of boyhood  o you sweet meditations of halfholidays here you are realised for halfan hour  the genius which presides over youth led us to do a good action that day  there was a man sitting in an open room ornamented with fine longtailed sentences of the koran  some in red some in blue some written diagonally over the paper some so shaped as to represent ships dragons or mysterious animals  the man squatted on a carpet in the middle of this room with folded arms waggling his head to and fro swaying about and singing through his nose choice phrases from the sacred work  but from the room above came a clear noise of many little shouting voices much more musical than that of naso in the matted parlour and the guide told us it was a school so we went upstairs to look  i declare on my conscience the master was in the act of bastinadoing a little mulatto boy his feet were in a bar and the brute was laying on with a cane so we witnessed the howling of the poor boy and the confusion of the brute who was administering the correction  the other children were made to shout i believe to drown the noise of their little comrades howling but the punishment was instantly discontinued as our hats came up over the stairtrap and the boy cast loose and the bamboo huddled into a corner and the schoolmaster stood before us abashed  all the small scholars in red caps and the little girls in gaudy handkerchiefs turned their big wondering dark eyes towards us and the caning was over for that time let us trust  i dont envy some schoolmasters in a future state  i pity that poor little blubbering mahometan  he will never be able to relish the arabian nights in the original all his life long  from this scene we rushed off somewhat discomposed to make a breakfast off red mullets and grapes melons pomegranates and smyrna wine at a dirty little comfortable inn to which we were recommended  and from the windows of which we had a fine cheerful view of the gulf and its busy craft and the loungers and merchants along the shore  there were camels unloading at one wharf and piles of melons much bigger than the gibraltar cannonballs at another  it was the figseason and we passed through several alleys encumbered with long rows of figdressers children and women for the most part who were packing the fruit diligently into drums dipping them in saltwater first and spreading them neatly over with leaves while the figs and leaves are drying large white worms crawl out of them and swarm over the decks of the ships which carry them to europe and to england where small children eat them with pleasurei mean the figs not the wormsand where they are still served at wineparties at the universities  when fresh they are not better than elsewhere but the melons are of admirable flavour and so large that cinderella might almost be accommodated with a coach made of a big one without any very great distension of its original proportions  our guide an accomplished swindler demanded two dollars as the fee for entering the mosque which others of our party subsequently saw for sixpence so we did not care to examine that place of worship  but there were other cheaper sights which were to the full as picturesque for which there was no call to pay money or indeed for a day scarcely to move at all  i doubt whether a man who would smoke his pipe on a bazaar counter all day and let the city flow by him would not be almost as well employed as the most active curiosityhunter  to be sure he would not see the women  those in the bazaar were shabby people for the most part whose black masks nobody would feel a curiosity to remove  you could see no more of their figures than if they had been stuffed in bolsters and even their feet were brought to a general splay uniformity by the double yellow slippers which the wives of true believers wear  but it is in the greek and armenian quarters and among those poor christians who were pulling figs that you see the beauties and a man of a generous disposition may lose his heart halfadozen times a day in smyrna there was the pretty maid at work at a tambourframe in an open porch with an old duenna spinning by her side and a goat tied up to the railings of the little courtgarden there was the nymph who came down the stair with the pitcher on her head and gazed with great calm eyes as large and stately as junos there was the gentle mother bending over a queer cradle in which lay a small crying bundle of infancy  all these three charmers were seen in a single street in the armenian quarter where the housedoors are all open and the women of the families sit under the arches in the court  there was the figgirl beautiful beyond all others with an immense coil of deep black hair twisted round a head of which raphael was worthy to draw the outline and titian to paint the colour  i wonder the sultan has not swept her off or that the persian merchants who come with silks and sweetmeats have not kidnapped her for the shah of tehran  we went to see the persian merchants at their khan and purchased some silks there from a swarthy blackbearded man with a conical cap of lambswool  is it not hard to think that silks bought of a man in a lambswool cap in a caravanserai brought hither on the backs of camels should have been manufactured after all at lyons others of our party bought carpets for which the town is famous and there was one who absolutely laid in a stock of real smyrna figs and purchased three or four real smyrna sponges for his carriage so strong was his passion for the genuine article  i wonder that no painter has given us familiar views of the east not processions grand sultans or magnificent landscapes but faithful transcripts of everyday oriental life such as each street will supply to him  the camels afford endless motives couched in the marketplaces lying by thousands in the camelsquare snorting and bubbling after their manner the sun blazing down on their backs their slaves and keepers lying behind them in the shade and the caravan bridge above all would afford a painter subjects for a dozen of pictures  over this roman arch which crosses the meles river all the caravans pass on their entrance to the town on one side as we sat and looked at it was a great row of plane trees on the opposite bank a deep wood of tall cypressesin the midst of which rose up innumerable grey tombs surmounted with the turbans of the defunct believers  beside the stream the view was less gloomy  there was under the planetrees a little coffee house shaded by a trelliswork covered over with a vine and ornamented with many rows of shining pots and waterpipes for which there was no use at noonday now in the time of ramazan hard by the coffeehouse was a garden and a bubbling marble fountain and over the stream was a broken summerhouse to which amateurs may ascend for the purpose of examining the river and all round the planetrees plenty of stools for those who were inclined to sit and drink sweet thick coffee or cool lemonade made of fresh green citrons  the master of the house dressed in a white turban and light blue pelisse lolled under the coffeehouse awning the slave in white with a crimson striped jacket his face as black as ebony brought us pipes and lemonade again and returned to his station at the coffeehouse where he curled his black legs together and began singing out of his flat nose to the thrumming of a long guitar with wire strings  the instrument was not bigger than a soupladle with a long straight handle but its music pleased the performer for his eyes rolled shining about and his head wagged and he grinned with an innocent intensity of enjoyment that did one good to look at  and there was a friend to share his pleasure  a turk dressed in scarlet and covered all over with daggers and pistols sat leaning forward on his little stool rocking about and grinning quite as eagerly as the black minstrel as he sang and we listened figures of women bearing pitchers went passing over the roman bridge which we saw between the large trunks of the planes or grey forms of camels were seen stalking across it the string preceded by the little donkey who is always here their longeared conductor  these are very humble incidents of travel  wherever the steamboat touches the shore adventure retreats into the interior and what is called romance vanishes  it wont bear the vulgar gaze or rather the light of common day puts it out and it is only in the dark that it shines at all  there is no cursing and insulting of giaours now  if a cockney looks or behaves in a particularly ridiculous way the little turks come out and laugh at him  a londoner is no longer a spittoon for true believers  and now that dark hassan sits in his divan and drinks champagne and selim has a french watch and zuleika perhaps takes morisons pills byronism becomes absurd instead of sublime and is only a foolish expression of cockney wonder  they still occasionally beat a man for going into a mosque but this is almost the only sign of ferocious vitality left in the turk of the mediterranean coast and strangers may enter scores of mosques without molestation  the paddlewheel is the great conqueror  wherever the captain cries stop her civilisation stops and lands in the ships boat and makes a permanent acquaintance with the savages on shore  whole hosts of crusaders have passed and died and butchered here in vain  but to manufacture european iron into pikes and helmets was a waste of metal  in the shape of pistonrods and furnacepokers it is irresistible and i think an allegory might be made showing how much stronger commerce is than chivalry and finishing with a grand image of mahomets crescent being extinguished in fultons boiler  this i thought was the moral of the days sights and adventures we pulled off to the steamer in the afternoonthe inbat blowing fresh and setting all the craft in the gulf dancing over its blue waters  we were presently under way again the captain ordering his engines to work only at half power so that a french steamer which was quitting smyrna at the same time might come up with us and fancy she could beat their irresistible tagus  vain hope just as the frenchman neared us the tagus shot out like an arrow and the discomfited frenchman went behind  though we all relished the joke exceedingly there was a french gentleman on board who did not seem to be by any means tickled with it but he had received papers at smyrna containing news of marshal bugeauds victory at isly and had this land victory to set against our harmless little triumph at sea  that night we rounded the island of mitylene  and the next day the coast of troy was in sight and the tomb of achillesa dismal looking mound that rises in a low dreary barren shoreless lively and not more picturesque than the scheldt or the mouth of the thames  then we passed tenedos and the forts and town at the mouth of the dardanelles  the weather was not too hot the water as smooth as at putney and everybody happy and excited at the thought of seeing constantinople tomorrow  we had music on board all the way from smyrna  a german commisvoyageur with a guitar who had passed unnoticed until that time produced his instrument about midday and began to whistle waltzes  he whistled so divinely that the ladies left their cabins and men laid down their books he whistled a polka so bewitchingly that two young oxford men began whirling round the deck and performed that popular dance with much agility until they sank down tired  he still continued an unabated whistling and as nobody would dance pulled off his coat produced a pair of castanets and whistling a mazurka performed it with tremendous agility  his whistling made everybody gay and happy made those acquainted who had not spoken before and inspired such a feeling of hilarity in the ship that that night as we floated over the sea of marmora a general vote was expressed for broiled bones and a regular supperparty  punch was brewed and speeches were made and after a lapse of fifteen years i heard the old english gentleman and bright chanticleer proclaims the morn sung in such style that you would almost fancy the proctors must hear and send us all home    chapter vii  constantinople    when we arose at sunrise to see the famous entry to constantinople we found in the place of the city and the sun a bright white fog which hid both from sight and which only disappeared as the vessel advanced towards the golden horn  there the fog cleared off as it were by flakes and as you see gauze curtains lifted away one by one before a great fairy scene at the theatre  this will give idea enough of the fog the difficulty is to describe the scene afterwards which was in truth the great fairy scene than which it is impossible to conceive anything more brilliant and magnificent i cant go to any more romantic place than drury lane to draw my similes fromdrury lane such as we used to see it in our youth when to our sight the grand last pictures of the melodrama or pantomime were as magnificent as any objects of nature we have seen with maturer eyes  well the view of constantinople is as fine as any of stanfields best theatrical pictures seen at the best period of youth when fancy had all the bloom on herwhen all the heroines who danced before the scene appeared as ravishing beauties when there shone an unearthly splendour about baker and diddearand the sound of the bugles and fiddles and the cheerful clang of the cymbals as the scene unrolled and the gorgeous procession meandered triumphantly through itcaused a thrill of pleasure and awakened an innocent fulness of sensual enjoyment that is only given to boys  the above sentence contains the following propositions the enjoyments of boyish fancy are the most intense and delicious in the world  stanfields panorama used to be the realisation of the most intense youthful fancy  i puzzle my brains and find no better likeness for the place  the view of constantinople resembles the ne plus ultra of a stanfield diorama with a glorious accompaniment of music spangled houris warriors and winding processions feasting the eyes and the soul with light splendour and harmony if you were never in this way during your youth ravished at the playhouse of course the whole comparison is useless  and you have no idea from this description of the effect which constantinople produces on the mind  but if you were never affected by a theatre no words can work upon your fancy and typographical attempts to move it are of no use  for suppose we combine mosque minaret gold cypress water blue caiques seventyfour galata tophana ramazan backallum and so forth together in ever so many ways your imagination will never be able to depict a city out of them  or suppose i say the mosque of st sophia is four hundred and seventythree feet in height measuring from the middle nail of the gilt crescent surmounting the dome to the ring in the centre stone the circle of the dome is one hundred and twentythree feet in diameter the windows ninetyseven in numberand all this may be true for anything i know to the contrary  yet who is to get an idea of st sophia from dates proper names and calculations with a measuringline  it cant be done by giving the age and measurement of all the buildings along the river the names of all the boatmen who ply on it  has your fancy which poohpoohs a simile faith enough to build a city with a footrule  enough said about descriptions and similes though whenever i am uncertain of one i am naturally most anxious to fight for it  it is a scene not perhaps sublime but charming magnificent and cheerful beyond any i have ever seenthe most superb combination of city and gardens domes and shipping hills and water with the healthiest breeze blowing over it and above it the brightest and most cheerful sky  it is proper they say to be disappointed on entering the town or any of the various quarters of it because the houses are not so magnificent on inspection and seen singly as they are when beheld en masse from the waters  but why form expectations so lofty  if you see a group of peasants picturesquely disposed at a fair you dont suppose that they are all faultless beauties or that the mens coats have no rags and the womens gowns are made of silk and velvet  the wild ugliness of the interior of constantinople or pera has a charm of its own greatly more amusing than rows of red bricks or drab stones however symmetrical  with brick or stone they could never form those fantastic ornaments railings balconies roofs galleries which jut in and out of the rugged houses of the city  as we went from galata to pera up a steep hill which newcomers ascend with some difficulty but which a porter with a couple of hundredweight on his back paces up without turning a hair i thought the wooden houses far from being disagreeable objects sights quite as surprising and striking as the grand one we had just left  i do not know how the customhouse of his highness is made to be a profitable speculation  as i left the ship a man pulled after my boat and asked for backsheesh which was given him to the amount of about twopence  he was a customhouse officer but i doubt whether this sum which he levied ever went to the revenue  i can fancy the scene about the quays somewhat to resemble the river of london in olden times before coalsmoke had darkened the whole city with soot and when according to the old writers there really was bright weather  the fleets of caiques bustling along the shore or scudding over the blue water are beautiful to look at  in hollars print london river is so studded over with wherry boats which bridges and steamers have since destroyed  here the caique is still in full perfection  there are thirty thousand boats of the kind plying between the cities every boat is neat and trimly carved and painted and i scarcely saw a man pulling in one of them that was not a fine specimen of his race brawny and brown with an open chest and a handsome face  they wear a thin shirt of exceedingly light cotton which leaves their fine brown limbs full play and with a purple sea for a background every one of these dashing boats forms a brilliant and glittering picture passengers squat in the inside of the boat so that as it passes you see little more than the heads of the true believers with their red fez and blue tassel and that placid gravity of expression which the sucking of a tobaccopipe is sure to give to a man  the bosphorus is enlivened by a multiplicity of other kinds of craft  there are the dirty menofwars boats of the russians with unwashed mangy crews the great ferryboats carrying hundreds of passengers to the villages the melonboats piled up with enormous golden fruit his excellency the pashas boat with twelve men bending to their oars and his highnesss own caique with a head like a serpent and eightandtwenty tugging oarsmen that goes shooting by amidst the thundering of the cannon  ships and steamers with black sides and flaunting colours are moored everywhere showing their flags russian and english austrian american and greek and along the quays country ships from the black sea or the islands with high carved poops and bows such as you see in the pictures of the shipping of the seventeenth century the vast groves and towers domes and quays tall minarets and spired spreading mosques of the three cities rise all around in endless magnificence and variety and render this waterstreet a scene of such delightful liveliness and beauty that one never tires of looking at it  i lost a great number of the sights in and round constantinople through the beauty of this admirable scene but what are sights after all and isnt that the best sight which makes you most happy  we were lodged at pera at misseris hotel the host of which has been made famous ere this time by the excellent book eothena work for which all the passengers on board our ship had been battling and which had charmed allfrom our great statesman our polished lawyer our young oxonian who sighed over certain passages that he feared were wicked down to the writer of this who after perusing it with delight laid it down with wonder exclaiming aut diabolus auta book which has since greatest miracle of all excited a feeling of warmth and admiration in the bosom of the godlike impartial stony athenaeum  misseri the faithful and chivalrous tartar is transformed into the most quiet and gentlemanlike of landlords a great deal more gentlemanlike in manner and appearance than most of us who sat at his table and smoked cool pipes on his housetop as we looked over the hill and the russian palace to the water and the seraglio gardens shining in the blue  we confronted misseri eothen in hand and found on examining him that it was aut diabolus aut amicusbut the name is a secret i will never breathe it though i am dying to tell it  the last good description of a turkish bath i think was lady mary wortley montaguswhich voluptuous picture must have been painted at least a hundred and thirty years ago so that another sketch may be attempted by a humbler artist in a different manner  the turkish bath is certainly a novel sensation to an englishman and may be set down as a most queer and surprising event of his life i made the valetdeplace or dragoman it is rather a fine thing to have a dragoman in ones service conduct me forthwith to the best appointed hummums in the neighbourhood and we walked to a house at tophana and into a spacious hall lighted from above which is the coolingroom of the bath  the spacious hall has a large fountain in the midst a painted gallery running round it and many ropes stretched from one gallery to another ornamented with profuse draperies of towels and blue cloths for the use of the frequenters of the place  all round the room and the galleries were matted inclosures fitted with numerous neat beds and cushions for reposing on where lay a dozen of true believers smoking or sleeping or in the happy halfdozing state i was led up to one of these beds to rather a retired corner in consideration of my modesty and to the next bed presently came a dancing dervish who forthwith began to prepare for the bath  when the dancing dervish had taken off his yellow sugarloaf cap his gown shawl c he was arrayed in two large blue cloths a white one being thrown over his shoulders and another in the shape of a turban plaited neatly round his head the garments of which he divested himself were folded up in another linen and neatly put by  i beg leave to state i was treated in precisely the same manner as the dancing dervish  the reverend gentleman then put on a pair of wooden pattens which elevated him about six inches from the ground and walked down the stairs and paddled across the moist marble floor of the hall and in at a little door by the which also titmarsh entered  but i had none of the professional agility of the dancing dervish i staggered about very ludicrously upon the high wooden pattens and should have been down on my nose several times had not the dragoman and the master of the bath supported me down the stairs and across the hall  dressed in three large cotton napkins with a white turban round my head i thought of pall mall with a sort of despair  i passed the little door it was closed behind mei was in the darki couldnt speak the languagein a white turban  mon dieu what was going to happen  the dark room was the tepidarium a moist oozing arched den with a light faintly streaming from an orifice in the domed ceiling yells of frantic laughter and song came booming and clanging through the echoing arches the doors clapped to with loud reverberations  it was the laughter of the followers of mahound rollicking and taking their pleasure in the public bath  i could not go into that place  i swore i would not they promised me a private room and the dragoman left me  my agony at parting from that christian cannot be described  when you get into the sudarium or hot room your first sensations only occur about half a minute after entrance when you feel that you are choking  i found myself in that state seated on a marble slab the bath man was gone he had taken away the cotton turban and shoulder shawl  i saw i was in a narrow room of marble with a vaulted roof and a fountain of warm and cold water the atmosphere was in a steam the choking sensation went off and i felt a sort of pleasure presently in a soft boiling simmer which no doubt potatoes feel when they are steaming  you are left in this state for about ten minutes  it is warm certainly but odd and pleasant and disposes the mind to reverie  but let any delicate mind in baker street fancy my horror when on looking up out of this reverie i saw a great brown wretch extended before me only half dressed standing on pattens and exaggerated by them and the steam until he looked like an ogre grinning in the most horrible way and waving his arm on which was a horsehair glove  he spoke in his unknown nasal jargon words which echoed through the arched room his eyes seemed astonishingly large and bright his ears stuck out and his head was all shaved except a bristling topknot which gave it a demoniac fierceness  this description i feel is growing too frightful ladies who read it will be going into hysterics or saying well upon my word this is the most singular the most extraordinary kind of language jane my love you will not read that odious book and so i will be brief  this grinning man belabours the patient violently with the horsebrush  when he has completed the horsehair part and you lie expiring under a squirting fountain of warm water and fancying all is done he reappears with a large brass basin containing a quantity of lather in the midst of which is something like old miss macwhirters flaxen wig that she is so proud of and that we have all laughed at  just as you are going to remonstrate the thing like the wig is dashed into your face and eyes covered over with soap and for five minutes you are drowned in lather  you cant see the suds are frothing over your eyeballs you cant hear the soap is whizzing into your ears cant gasp for breath miss macwhirters wig is down your throat with half a pailful of suds in an instantyou are all soap  wicked children in former days have jeered you exclaiming how are you off for soap  you little knew what saponacity was till you entered a turkish bath  when the whole operation is concluded you are ledwith what heartfelt joy i need not saysoftly back to the coolingroom having been robed in shawls and turbans as before  you are laid gently on the reposing bed somebody brings a narghile which tastes as tobacco must taste in mahomets paradise a cool sweet dreamy languor takes possession of the purified frame and halfan hour of such delicious laziness is spent over the pipe as is unknown in europe where vulgar prejudice has most shamefully maligned indolencecalls it foul names such as the father of all evil and the like in fact does not know how to educate idleness as those honest turks do and the fruit which when properly cultivated it bears  the afterbath state is the most delightful condition of laziness i ever knew and i tried it wherever we went afterwards on our little tour  at smyrna the whole business was much inferior to the method employed in the capital  at cairo after the soap you are plunged into a sort of stone coffin full of water which is all but boiling  this has its charms but i could not relish the egyptian shampooing  a hideous old blind man but very dexterous in his art tried to break my back and dislocate my shoulders but i could not see the pleasure of the practice and another fellow began tickling the soles of my feet but i rewarded him with a kick that sent him off the bench  the pure idleness is the best and i shall never enjoy such in europe again  victor hugo in his famous travels on the rhine visiting cologne gives a learned account of what he didnt see there  i have a remarkable catalogue of similar objects at constantinople  i didnt see the dancing dervishes it was ramazan nor the howling dervishes at scutari it was ramazan nor the interior of st sophia nor the womens apartment of the seraglio nor the fashionable promenade at the sweet waters always because it was ramazan during which period the dervishes dance and howl but rarely their legs and lungs being unequal to much exertion during a fast of fifteen hours  on account of the same holy season the royal palaces and mosques are shut and though the valley of the sweet waters is there no one goes to walk the people remaining asleep all day and passing the night in feasting and carousing the minarets are illuminated at this season even the humblest mosque at jerusalem or jaffa mounted a few circles of dingy lamps those of the capital were handsomely lighted with many festoons of lamps which had a fine effect from the water  i need not mention other and constant illuminations of the city which innumerable travellers have describedi mean the fires  there were three in pera during our eight days stay there but they did not last long enough to bring the sultan out of bed to come and lend his aid  mr hobhouse quoted in the guidebook says if a fire lasts an hour the sultan is bound to attend it in person and that people having petitions to present have often set houses on fire for the purpose of forcing out this royal trump  the sultan cant lead a very jolly life if this rule be universal  fancy his highness in the midst of his moonfaced beauties handkerchief in hand and obliged to tie it round his face and go out of his warm harem at midnight at the cursed cry of yang en var  we saw his highness in the midst of his people and their petitions when he came to the mosque at tophana not the largest but one of the most picturesque of the public buildings of the city  the streets were crowded with people watching for the august arrival and lined with the squat military in their bastard european costume the sturdy police with bandeliers and brown surtouts keeping order driving off the faithful from the railings of the esplanade through which their emperor was to pass and only admitting with a very unjust partiality i thought us europeans into that reserved space  before the august arrival numerous officers collected colonels and pashas went by with their attendant running footmen the most active insolent and hideous of these great men as i thought being his highnesss black eunuchs who went prancing through the crowd which separated before them with every sign of respect  the common women were assembled by many hundreds  the yakmac a muslin chincloth which they wear makes almost every face look the same but the eyes and noses of these beauties are generally visible and for the most part both these features are good  the jolly negresses wear the same white veil but they are by no means so particular about hiding the charms of their goodnatured black faces and they let the cloth blow about as it lists and grin unconfined  wherever we went the negroes seemed happy  they have the organ of childloving  little creatures were always prattling on their shoulders queer little things in night gowns of yellow dimity with great flowers and pink or red or yellow shawls with great eyes glistening underneath  of such the black women seemed always the happy guardians  i saw one at a fountain holding one child in her arms and giving another a drinka ragged little beggara sweet and touching picture of a black charity  i am almost forgetting his highness the sultan  about a hundred guns were fired off at clumsy intervals from the esplanade facing the bosphorus warning us that the monarch had set off from his summer palace and was on the way to his grand canoe  at last that vessel made its appearance the band struck up his favourite air his caparisoned horse was led down to the shore to receive him the eunuchs fat pashas colonels and officers of state gathering round as the commander of the faithful mounted  i had the indescribable happiness of seeing him at a very short distance  the padishah or father of all the sovereigns on earth has not that majestic air which some sovereigns possess and which makes the beholders eyes wink and his knees tremble under him  he has a black beard and a handsome wellbred face of a french cast he looks like a young french roue worn out by debauch his eyes bright with black rings round them his cheeks pale and hollow  he was lolling on his horse as if he could hardly hold himself on the saddle  or as if his cloak fastened with a blazing diamond clasp on his breast and falling over his horses tail pulled him back  but the handsome sallow face of the refuge of the world looked decidedly interesting and intellectual  i have seen many a young don juan at paris behind a counter with such a beard and countenance the flame of passion still burning in his hollow eyes while on his damp brow was stamped the fatal mark of premature decay  the man we saw cannot live many summers  women and wine are said to have brought the zilullah to this state and it is whispered by the dragomans or laquaisdeplace from whom travellers at constantinople generally get their political information that the sultans mother and his ministers conspire to keep him plunged in sensuality that they may govern the kingdom according to their own fancies  mr urquhart i am sure thinks that lord palmerston has something to do with the business and drugs the sultans champagne for the benefit of russia  as the pontiff of mussulmans passed into the mosques a shower of petitions was flung from the steps where the crowd was collected and over the heads of the gendarmes in brown  a general cry as for justice rose up and one old ragged woman came forward and burst through the throng howling and flinging about her lean arms and baring her old shrunken breast  i never saw a finer action of tragic woo or heard sounds more pitiful than those old passionate groans of hers  what was your prayer poor old wretched soul  the gendarmes hemmed her round and hustled her away but rather kindly  the padishah went on quite impassiblethe picture of debauch and ennui  i like pointing morals and inventing for myself cheap consolations to reconcile me to that state of life into which it has pleased heaven to call me and as the light of the world disappeared round the corner i reasoned pleasantly with myself about his highness and enjoyed that secret selfish satisfaction a man has who sees he is better off than his neighbour  michael angelo i said you are still by courtesy young  if you had five hundred thousand a year and were a great prince i would lay a wager that men would discover in you a magnificent courtesy of demeanour and a majestic presence that only belongs to the sovereigns of the world  if you had such an income you think you could spend it with splendour  distributing genial hospitalities kindly alms soothing misery bidding humility be of good heart rewarding desert  if you had such means of purchasing pleasure you think you rogue you could relish it with gusto  but fancy being brought to the condition of the poor light of the universe yonder and reconcile yourself with the idea that you are only a farthing rushlight  the cries of the poor widow fall as dead upon him as the smiles of the brightest eyes out of georgia  he cant stir abroad but those abominable cannon begin roaring and deafening his ears  he cant see the world but over the shoulders of a row of fat pashas and eunuchs with their infernal ugliness  his ears can never be regaled with a word of truth or blessed with an honest laugh  the only privilege of manhood left to him he enjoys but for a month in the year at this time of ramazan when he is forced to fast for fifteen hours and by consequence has the blessing of feeling hungry  sunset during lent appears to be his single moment of pleasure they say the poor fellow is ravenous by that time and as the gun fires the dishcovers are taken off so that for five minutes a day he lives and is happy over pillau like another mortal  and yet when floating by the summer palace a barbaric edifice of wood and marble with gilded suns blazing over the porticoes and all sorts of strange ornaments and trophies figuring on the gates and railingswhen we passed a long row of barred and filigreed windows looking on the waterwhen we were told that those were the apartments of his highnesss ladies and actually heard them whispering and laughing behind the barsa strange feeling of curiosity came over some illregulated mindsjust to have one peep one look at all those wondrous beauties singing to the dulcimers paddling in the fountains dancing in the marble halls or lolling on the golden cushions as the gaudy black slaves brought pipes and coffee  this tumultuous movement was calmed by thinking of that dreadful statement of travellers that in one of the most elegant halls there is a trapdoor on peeping below which you may see the bosphorus running underneath into which some luckless beauty is plunged occasionally and the trapdoor is shut and the dancing and the singing and the smoking and the laughing go on as before  they say it is death to pick up any of the sacks thereabouts if a stray one should float by you  there were none any day when i passed at least on the surface of the water  it has been rather a fashion of our travellers to apologise for turkish life of late and paint glowing agreeable pictures of many of its institutions  the celebrated author of palmleaves his name is famous under the datetrees of the nile and uttered with respect beneath the tents of the bedaween has touchingly described ibrahim pashas paternal fondness who cut off a black slaves head for having dropped and maimed one of his children and has penned a melodious panegyric of the harem and of the fond and beautiful duties of the inmates of that place of love obedience and seclusion  i saw at the mausoleum of the late sultan mahmouds family a good subject for a ghazul in the true new oriental manner  these royal burialplaces are the resort of the pious moslems lamps are kept burning there and in the antechambers copies of the koran are provided for the use of believers and you never pass these cemeteries but you see turks washing at the cisterns previous to entering for prayer or squatted on the benches chanting passages from the sacred volume  christians i believe are not admitted but may look through the bars and see the coffins of the defunct monarchs and children of the royal race each lies in his narrow sarcophagus which is commonly flanked by huge candles and covered with a rich embroidered pall  at the head of each coffin rises a slab with a gilded inscription for the princesses the slab is simple not unlike our own monumental stones  the headstones of the tombs of the defunct princes are decorated with a turban or since the introduction of the latter article of dress with the red fez  that of mahmoud is decorated with the imperial aigrette  in this dismal but splendid museum i remarked two little tombs with little red fezzes very small and for very young heads evidently which were lying under the little embroidered palls of state  i forget whether they had candles too but their little flame of life was soon extinguished and there was no need of many pounds of wax to typify it  these were the tombs of mahmouds grandsons nephews of the present light of the universe and children of his sister the wife of halil pasha  little children die in all ways  these of the muchmaligned mahometan royal race perished by the bowstring  sultan mahmoud may he rest in glory strangled the one but having some spark of human feeling was so moved by the wretchedness and agony of the poor bereaved mother his daughter that his royal heart relented towards her and he promised that should she ever have another child it should be allowed to live  he died and abdul medjid may his name be blessed the debauched young man whom we just saw riding to the mosque succeeded  his sister whom he is said to have loved became again a mother and had a son  but she relied upon her fathers word and her august brothers love and hoped that this little one should be spared  the same accursed hand tore this infant out of its mothers bosom and killed it  the poor womans heart broke outright at this second calamity and she died  but on her deathbed she sent for her brother rebuked him as a perjurer and an assassin and expired calling down the divine justice on his head  she lies now by the side of the two little fezzes  now i say this would be a fine subject for an oriental poem  the details are dramatic and noble and could be grandly touched by a fine artist  if the mother had borne a daughter the child would have been safe that perplexity might be pathetically depicted as agitating the bosom of the young wife about to become a mother  a son is born  you can see her despair and the pitiful look she casts on the child and the way in which she hugs it every time the curtains of her door are removed  the sultan hesitated probably he allowed the infant to live for six weeks  he could not bring his royal soul to inflict pain  he yields at last he is a martyr to be pitied not to be blamed  if he melts at his daughters agony he is a man and a father  there are men and fathers too in the muchmaligned orient  then comes the second act of the tragedy  the new hopes the fond yearnings the terrified misgivings the timid belief and weak confidence the child that is bornand dies smiling prettilyand the mothers heart is rent so that it can love or hope or suffer no more  allah is god  she sleeps by the little fezzes  hark the guns are booming over the water and his highness is coming from his prayers  after the murder of that little child it seems to me one can never look with anything but horror upon the butcherly herod who ordered it  the death of the seventy thousand janissaries ascends to historic dignity and takes rank as war  but a great prince and light of the universe who procures abortions and throttles little babies dwindles away into such a frightful insignificance of crime that those may respect him who will  i pity their excellencies the ambassadors who are obliged to smirk and cringe to such a rascal  to do the turks justiceand two days walk in constantinople will settle this fact as well as a years residence in the citythe people do not seem in the least animated by this herodian spirit  i never saw more kindness to children than among all classes more fathers walking about with little solemn mahometans in red caps and big trousers more business going on than in the toy quarter and in the atmeidan  although you may see there the thebaic stone set up by the emperor theodosius and the bronze column of serpents which murray says was brought from delphi but which my guide informed me was the very one exhibited by moses in the wilderness yet i found the examination of these antiquities much less pleasant than to look at the many troops of children assembled on the plain to play and to watch them as they were dragged about in little queer arobas or painted carriages which are there kept for hire  i have a picture of one of them now in my eyes  a little green oval machine with flowers rudely painted round the window out of which two smiling heads are peeping the pictures of happiness  an old goodhumoured grey bearded turk is tugging the cart and behind it walks a lady in a yakmac and yellow slippers and a black female slave grinning as usual towards whom the little coachriders are looking  a small sturdy barefooted mussulman is examining the cart with some feelings of envy  he is too poor to purchase a ride for himself and the roundfaced puppydog which he is hugging in his arms as young ladies in our country do dolls  all the neighbourhood of the atmeidan is exceedingly picturesque the mosque court and cloister where the persians have their stalls of sweetmeats and tobacco a superb sycamoretree grows in the middle of this overshadowing an aromatic fountain great flocks of pigeons are settling in corners of the cloister and barley is sold at the gates with which the goodnatured people feed them  from the atmeidan you have a fine view of st sophia  and here stands a mosque which struck me as being much more picturesque and sumptuousthe mosque of sultan achmed with its six gleaming white minarets and its beautiful courts and trees  any infidels may enter the court without molestation and looking through the barred windows of the mosque have a view of its airy and spacious interior  a small audience of women was collected there when i looked in squatted on the mats and listening to a preacher who was walking among them and speaking with great energy  my dragoman interpreted to me the sense of a few words of his sermon he was warning them of the danger of gadding about to public places and of the immorality of too much talking and i dare say we might have had more valuable information from him regarding the follies of womankind had not a tall turk clapped my interpreter on the shoulder and pointed him to be off  although the ladies are veiled and muffled with the ugliest dresses in the world yet it appears their modesty is alarmed in spite of all the coverings which they wear  one day in the bazaar a fat old body with diamond rings on her fingers that were tinged with henne of a logwood colour came to the shop where i was purchasing slippers with her son a young aga of six years of age dressed in a braided frockcoat with a huge tassel to his fez exceeding fat and of a most solemn demeanour  the young aga came for a pair of shoes and his contortions were so delightful as he tried them that i remained looking on with great pleasure wishing for leech to be at hand to sketch his lordship and his fat mamma who sat on the counter  that lady fancied i was looking at her though as far as i could see she had the figure and complexion of a rolypoly pudding and so with quite a premature bashfulness she sent me a message by the shoemaker ordering me to walk away if i had made my purchases for that ladies of her rank did not choose to be stared at by strangers and i was obliged to take my leave though with sincere regret for the little lord had just squeezed himself into an attitude than which i never saw anything more ludicrous in general tom thumb  when the ladies of the seraglio come to that bazaar with their cortege of infernal black eunuchs strangers are told to move on briskly  i saw a bevy of about eight of these with their aidesdecamp but they were wrapped up and looked just as vulgar and ugly as the other women and were not i suppose of the most beautiful sort  the poor devils are allowed to come out halfadozen times in the year to spend their little wretched allowance of pocketmoney in purchasing trinkets and tobacco all the rest of the time they pursue the beautiful duties of their existence in the walls of the sacred harem  though strangers are not allowed to see the interior of the cage in which these birds of paradise are confined yet many parts of the seraglio are free to the curiosity of visitors who choose to drop a backsheesh here and there  i landed one morning at the seraglio point from galata close by an ancient pleasurehouse of the defunct sultan a vast broadbrimmed pavilion that looks agreeable enough to be a dancing room for ghosts now  there is another summerhouse the guidebook cheerfully says whither the sultan goes to sport with his women and mutes  a regiment of infantry with their music at their head were marching to exercise in the outer grounds of the seraglio and we followed them and had an opportunity of seeing their evolutions and hearing their bands upon a fine green plain under the seraglio walls where stands one solitary column erected in memory of some triumph of some byzantian emperor  there were three battalions of the turkish infantry exercising here and they seemed to perform their evolutions in a very satisfactory manner  that is they fired all together and charged and halted in very straight lines and bit off imaginary cartridge tops with great fierceness and regularity and made all their ramrods ring to measure just like so many christians  the men looked small young clumsy and illbuilt uncomfortable in their shabby european clothes and about the legs especially seemed exceedingly weak and illformed  some score of military invalids were lolling in the sunshine about a fountain and a marble summer house that stand on the ground watching their comrades manoeuvres as if they could never have enough of that delightful pastime and these sick were much better cared for than their healthy companions  each man had two dressinggowns one of white cotton and an outer wrapper of warm brown woollen  their heads were accommodated with wadded cotton nightcaps and it seemed to me from their condition and from the excellent character of the military hospitals that it would be much more wholesome to be ill than to be well in the turkish service  facing this green esplanade and the bosphorus shining beyond it rise the great walls of the outer seraglio gardens  huge masses of ancient masonry over which peep the roofs of numerous kiosks and outhouses amongst thick evergreens planted so as to hide the beautiful frequenters of the place from the prying eyes and telescopes  we could not catch a glance of a single figure moving in these great pleasuregrounds  the road winds round the walls and the outer park which is likewise planted with trees and diversified by gardenplots and cottages had more the air of the outbuildings of a homely english park than of a palace which we must all have imagined to be the most stately in the world  the most commonplace watercarts were passing here and there roads were being repaired in the macadamite manner and carpenters were mending the parkpalings just as they do in hampshire  the next thing you might fancy would be the sultan walking out with a spud and a couple of dogs on the way to meet the postbag and the saint jamess chronicle  the palace is no palace at all  it is a great town of pavilions built without order here and there according to the fancy of succeeding lights of the universe or their favourites  the only row of domes which looked particularly regular or stately were the kitchens  as you examined the buildings they had a ruinous dilapidated look  they are not furnished it is said with particular splendournot a bit more elegantly than miss joness seminary for young ladies which we may be sure is much more comfortable than the extensive establishment of his highness abdul medjid  in the little stable i thought to see some marks of royal magnificence and some horses worthy of the king of all kings  but the sultan is said to be a very timid horseman  the animal that is always kept saddled for him did not look to be worth twenty pounds and the rest of the horses in the shabby dirty stalls were small illkept commonlooking brutes  you might see better it seemed to me at a country inn stable on any marketday  the kitchens are the most sublime part of the seraglio  there are nine of these great halls for all ranks from his highness downwards where many hecatombs are roasted daily according to the accounts and where cooking goes on with a savage homeric grandeur chimneys are despised in these primitive halls so that the roofs are black with the smoke of hundreds of furnaces which escapes through apertures in the domes above  these too give the chief light in the rooms which streams downwards and thickens and mingles with the smoke and so murkily lights up hundreds of swarthy figures busy about the spits and the cauldrons  close to the door by which we entered they were making pastry for the sultanas and the chief pastrycook who knew my guide invited us courteously to see the process and partake of the delicacies prepared for those charming lips  how those sweet lips must shine after eating these puffs  first huge sheets of dough are rolled out till the paste is about as thin as silver paper  then an artist forms the doughmuslin into a sort of drapery curling it round and round in many fanciful and pretty shapes until it is all got into the circumference of a round metal tray in which it is baked  then the cake is drenched in grease most profusely and finally a quantity of syrup is poured over it when the delectable mixture is complete  the moonfaced ones are said to devour immense quantities of this wholesome food and in fact are eating grease and sweetmeats from morning till night  i dont like to think what the consequences may be or allude to the agonies which the delicate creatures must inevitably suffer  the goodnatured chief pastrycook filled a copper basin with greasy puffs and dipping a dubious ladle into a large cauldron containing several gallons of syrup poured a liberal portion over the cakes and invited us to eat  one of the tarts was quite enough for me  and i excused myself on the plea of illhealth from imbibing any more grease and sugar  but my companion the dragoman finished some forty puffs in a twinkling  they slipped down his opened jaws as the sausages do down clowns throats in a pantomime  his moustaches shone with grease and it dripped down his beard and fingers  we thanked the smiling chief pastrycook and rewarded him handsomely for the tarts  it is something to have eaten of the dainties prepared for the ladies of the harem but i think mr cockle ought to get the names of the chief sultanas among the exalted patrons of his antibilious pills  from the kitchens we passed into the second court of the seraglio beyond which is death  the guidebook only hints at the dangers which would befall a stranger caught prying in the mysterious first court of the palace  i have read bluebeard and dont care for peeping into forbidden doors so that the second court was quite enough for me the pleasure of beholding it being heightened as it were by the notion of the invisible danger sitting next door with uplifted scimitar ready to fall on youpresent though not seen  a cloister runs along one side of this court opposite is the hall of the divan large but low covered with lead and gilt after the moorish manner plain enough  the grand vizier sits in this place and the ambassadors used to wait here and be conducted hence on horseback attired with robes of honour  but the ceremony is now i believe discontinued the english envoy at any rate is not allowed to receive any backsheesh and goes away as he came in the habit of his own nation  on the right is a door leading into the interior of the seraglio none pass through it but such as are sent for the guidebook says  it is impossible to top the terror of that description  about this door lads and servants were lolling ichoglans and pages with lazy looks and shabby dresses and among them sunning himself sulkily on a bench a poor old fat wrinkled dismal white eunuch with little fat white hands and a great head sunk into his chest and two sprawling little legs that seemed incapable to hold up his bloated old body  he squeaked out some surly reply to my friend the dragoman who softened and sweetened by the tarts he had just been devouring was no doubt anxious to be polite  and the poor worthy fellow walked away rather crestfallen at this return of his salutation and hastened me out of the place  the palace of the seraglio the cloister with marble pillars the hall of the ambassadors the impenetrable gate guarded by eunuchs and ichoglans have a romantic look in print but not so in reality  most of the marble is wood almost all the gilding is faded the guards are shabby the foolish perspectives painted on the walls are half cracked off  the place looks like vauxhall in the daytime  we passed out of the second court under the sublime portewhich is like a fortified gate of a german town of the middle agesinto the outer court round which are public offices hospitals and dwellings of the multifarious servants of the palace  this place is very wide and picturesque  there is a pretty church of byzantine architecture at the further end and in the midst of the court a magnificent planetree of prodigious dimensions and fabulous age according to the guides st sophia towers in the further distance  and from here perhaps is the best view of its light swelling domes and beautiful proportions  the porte itself too forms an excellent subject for the sketcher if the officers of the court will permit him to design it  i made the attempt and a couple of turkish beadles looked on very goodnaturedly for some time at the progress of the drawing but a good number of other spectators speedily joined them and made a crowd which is not permitted it would seem in the seraglio so i was told to pack up my portfolio and remove the cause of the disturbance and lost my drawing of the ottoman porte  i dont think i have anything more to say about the city which has not been much better told by graver travellers  i with them could see perhaps it was the preaching of the politicians that warned me of the fact that we are looking on at the last days of an empire and heard many stories of weakness disorder and oppression  i even saw a turkish lady drive up to sultan achmets mosque in a brougham  is not that a subject to moralise upon  and might one not draw endless conclusions from it that the knell of the turkish dominion is rung that the european spirit and institutions once admitted can never be rooted out again and that the scepticism prevalent amongst the higher orders must descend ere very long to the lower and the cry of the muezzin from the mosque become a mere ceremony  but as i only stayed eight days in this place and knew not a syllable of the language perhaps it is as well to pretermit any disquisitions about the spirit of the people  i can only say that they looked to be very goodnatured handsome and lazy that the womens yellow slippers are very ugly that the kabobs at the shop hard by the rope bazaar are very hot and good and that at the armenian cookshops they serve you delicious fish and a stout raisin wine of no small merit  there came in as we sat and dined there at sunset a good old turk who called for a penny fish and sat down under a tree very humbly and ate it with his own bread we made that jolly old mussulman happy with a quart of the raisin wine and his eyes twinkled with every fresh glass and he wiped his old beard delighted and talked and chirped a good deal and i dare say told us the whole state of the empire  he was the only mussulman with whom i attained any degree of intimacy during my stay in constantinople and you will see that for obvious reasons i cannot divulge the particulars of our conversation  you have nothing to say and you own it says somebody  then why write  that question perhaps between ourselves i have put likewise and yet my dear sir there are some things worth remembering even in this brief letter  that woman in the brougham is an idea of significance  that comparison of the seraglio to vauxhall in the daytime is a true and real one from both of which your own great soul and ingenious philosophic spirit may draw conclusions that i myself have modestly forborne to press  you are too clever to require a moral to be tacked to all the fables you read as is done for children in the spellingbooks else i would tell you that the government of the ottoman porte seems to be as rotten as wrinkled and as feeble as the old eunuch i saw crawling about it in the sun that when the lady drove up in a brougham to sultan achmet i felt that the schoolmaster was really abroad and that the crescent will go out before that luminary as meekly as the moon does before the sun    chapter viii  rhodes    the sailing of a vessel direct for jaffa brought a great number of passengers together and our decks were covered with christian jew and heathen  in the cabin we were poles and russians frenchmen germans spaniards and greeks on the deck were squatted several little colonies of people of different race and persuasion  there was a greek papa a noble figure with a flowing and venerable white beard who had been living on breadandwater for i dont know how many years in order to save a little money to make the pilgrimage to jerusalem  there were several families of jewish rabbis who celebrated their feast of tabernacles on board their chief men performing worship twice or thrice a day dressed in their pontifical habits and bound with phylacteries and there were turks who had their own ceremonies and usages and wisely kept aloof from their neighbours of israel  the dirt of these children of captivity exceeds all possibility of description the profusion of stinks which they raised the grease of their venerable garments and faces the horrible messes cooked in the filthy pots and devoured with the nasty fingers the squalor of mats pots old bedding and foul carpets of our hebrew friends could hardly be painted by swift in his dirtiest mood and cannot be of course attempted by my timid and genteel pen  what would they say in baker street to some sights with which our new friends favoured us  what would your ladyship have said if you had seen the interesting greek nun combing her hair over the cabin combing it with the natural fingers and averse to slaughter flinging the delicate little intruders which she found in the course of her investigation gently into the great cabin  our attention was a good deal occupied in watching the strange ways and customs of the various comrades of ours  the jews were refugees from poland going to lay their bones to rest in the valley of jehoshaphat and performing with exceeding rigour the offices of their religion  at morning and evening you were sure to see the chiefs of the families arrayed in white robes bowing over their books at prayer  once a week on the eve before the sabbath there was a general washing in jewry which sufficed until the ensuing friday  the men wore long gowns and caps of fur or else broadbrimmed hats or in service time bound on their heads little iron boxes with the sacred name engraved on them  among the lads there were some beautiful faces and among the women your humble servant discovered one who was a perfect rosebud of beauty when first emerging from her fridays toilet and for a day or two afterwards until each succeeding days smut darkened those fresh and delicate cheeks of hers  we had some very rough weather in the course of the passage from constantinople to jaffa and the sea washed over and over our israelitish friends and their baggages and bundles but though they were said to be rich they would not afford to pay for cabin shelter  one father of a family finding his progeny half drowned in a squall vowed he would pay for a cabin but the weather was somewhat finer the next day and he could not squeeze out his dollars and the ships authorities would not admit him except upon payment  this unwillingness to part with money is not only found amongst the followers of moses but in those of mahomet and christians too when we went to purchase in the bazaars after offering money for change the honest fellows would frequently keep back several piastres and when urged to refund would give most dismally  and begin doling out penny by penny and utter pathetic prayers to their customer not to take any more  i bought five or six pounds worth of broussa silks for the womankind in the bazaar at constantinople and the rich armenian who sold them begged for threehalfpence to pay his boat to galata  there is something naif and amusing in this exhibition of cheaterythis simple cringing and wheedling and passion for twopencehalfpenny  it was pleasant to give a millionaire beggar an alms and laugh in his face and say there dives theres a penny for you  be happy you poor old swindling scoundrel as far as a penny goes  i used to watch these jews on shore and making bargains with one another as soon as they came on board the battle between vendor and purchaser was an agonythey shrieked clasped hands appealed to one another passionately their handsome noble faces assumed a look of woe quite an heroic eagerness and sadness about a farthing  ambassadors from our hebrews descended at rhodes to buy provisions and it was curious to see their dealings  there was our venerable rabbi who robed in white and silver and bending over his book at the morning service looked like a patriarch and whom i saw chaffering about a fowl with a brother rhodian israelite  how they fought over the body of that lean animal  the street swarmed with jews  goggling eyes looked out from the old carved casements hooked noses issued from the low antique doorsjew boys driving donkeys hebrew mothers nursing children dusky tawdry ragged young beauties and most venerable greybearded fathers were all gathered round about the affair of the hen  and at the same time that our rabbi was arranging the price of it his children were instructed to procure bundles of green branches to decorate the ship during their feast  think of the centuries during which these wonderful people have remained unchanged and how from the days of jacob downwards they have believed and swindled  the rhodian jews with their genius for filth have made their quarter of the noble desolate old town the most ruinous and wretched of all  the escutcheons of the proud old knights are still carved over the doors whence issue these miserable greasy hucksters and pedlars  the turks respected these emblems of the brave enemies whom they had overcome and left them untouched when the french seized malta they were by no means so delicate they effaced armorial bearings with their usual hotheaded eagerness and a few years after they had torn down the coatsof arms of the gentry the heroes of malta and egypt were busy devising heraldry for themselves and were wild to be barons and counts of the empire  the chivalrous relics at rhodes are very superb  i know of no buildings whose stately and picturesque aspect seems to correspond better with ones notions of their proud founders  the towers and gates are warlike and strong but beautiful and aristocratic  you see that they must have been highbred gentlemen who built them the edifices appear in almost as perfect a condition as when they were in the occupation of the noble knights of st john and they have this advantage over modern fortifications that they are a thousand times more picturesque  ancient war condescended to ornament itself and built fine carved castles and vaulted gates whereas to judge from gibraltar and malta nothing can be less romantic than the modern military architecture which sternly regards the fighting without in the least heeding the warpaint some of the huge artillery with which the place was defended still lies in the bastions and the touchholes of the guns are preserved by being covered with rusty old corselets worn by defenders of the fort three hundred years ago  the turks who battered down chivalry seem to be waiting their turn of destruction now  in walking through rhodes one is strangely affected by witnessing the signs of this double decay  for instance in the streets of the knights you see noble houses surmounted by noble escutcheons of superb knights who lived there and prayed and quarrelled and murdered the turks and were the most gallant pirates of the inland seas and made vows of chastity and robbed and ravished and professing humility would admit none but nobility into their order and died recommending themselves to sweet st john and calmly hoping for heaven in consideration of all the heathen they had slain  when this superb fraternity was obliged to yield to courage as great as theirs faith as sincere and to robbers even more dexterous and audacious than the noblest knight who ever sang a canticle to the virgin these halls were filled by magnificent pashas and agas who lived here in the intervals of war and having conquered its best champions despised christendom and chivalry pretty much as an englishman despises a frenchman  now the famous house is let to a shabby merchant who has his little beggarly shop in the bazaar to a small officer who ekes out his wretched pension by swindling and who gets his pay in bad coin mahometanism pays in pewter now in place of silver and gold  the lords of the world have run to seed  the powerless old sword frightens nobody nowthe steel is turned to pewter too somehow and will no longer shear a christian head off any shoulders  in the crusades my wicked sympathies have always been with the turks they seem to me the better christians of the two  more humane less brutally presumptuous about their own merits and more generous in esteeming their neighbours  as far as i can get at the authentic story saladin is a pearl of refinement compared to the brutal beefeating richardabout whom sir walter scott has led all the world astray  when shall we have a real account of those times and heroesno goodhumoured pageant like those of the scott romancesbut a real authentic story to instruct and frighten honest people of the present day and make them thankful that the grocer governs the world now in place of the baron  meanwhile a man of tender feelings may be pardoned for twaddling a little over this sad spectacle of the decay of two of the great institutions of the world  knighthood is goneamen it expired with dignity its face to the foe  and old mahometanism is lingering about just ready to drop  but it is unseemly to see such a grand potentate in such a state of decay  the son of bajazet ilderim insolvent the descendants of the prophet bullied by calmucs and english and whippersnapper frenchmen the fountain of magnificence done up and obliged to coin pewter  think of the poor dear houris in paradise how sad they must look as the arrivals of the faithful become less and less frequent every day  i can fancy the place beginning to wear the fatal vauxhall look of the seraglio and which has pursued me ever since i saw it  the fountains of eternal wine are beginning to run rather dry and of a questionable liquor the readyroastedmeat trees may cry come eat me every now and then in a faint voice without any gravy in itbut the faithful begin to doubt about the quality of the victuals  of nights you may see the houris sitting sadly under them darning their faded muslins  ali omar and the imaums are reconciled and have gloomy consultations  and the chief of the faithful himself the awful cameldriver the supernatural husband of khadijah sits alone in a tumbledown kiosk thinking moodily of the destiny that is impending over him and of the day when his gardens of bliss shall be as vacant as the bankrupt olympus   all the town of rhodes has this appearance of decay and ruin except a few consuls houses planted on the seaside here and there with bright flags flaunting in the sun fresh paint english crockery shining mahogany cso many emblems of the new prosperity of their trade while the old inhabitants were going to rackthe fine church of st john converted into a mosque is a ruined church with a ruined mosque inside the fortifications are mouldering away as much as time will let them  there was considerable bustle and stir about the little port but it was the bustle of people who looked for the most part to be beggars and i saw no shop in the bazaar that seemed to have the value of a pedlars pack  i took by way of guide a young fellow from berlin a journeyman shoemaker who had just been making a tour in syria and who professed to speak both arabic and turkish quite fluentlywhich i thought he might have learned when he was a student at college before he began his profession of shoemaking but i found he only knew about three words of turkish which were produced on every occasion as i walked under his guidance through the desolate streets of the noble old town  we went out upon the lines of fortification through an ancient gate and guardhouse where once a chapel probably stood and of which the roofs were richly carved and gilded  a ragged squad of turkish soldiers lolled about the gate now a couple of boys on a donkey a grinning slave on a mule a pair of women flapping along in yellow papooshes a basketmaker sitting under an antique carved portal and chanting or howling as he plaited his osiers  a peaceful well of water at which knights chargers had drunk and at which the doubleboyed donkey was now refreshing himselfwould have made a pretty picture for a sentimental artist  as he sits and endeavours to make a sketch of this plaintive little comedy a shabby dignitary of the island comes clattering by on a thirtyshilling horse and two or three of the ragged soldiers leave their pipes to salute him as he passes under the gothic archway  the astonishing brightness and clearness of the sky under which the island seemed to bask struck me as surpassing anything i had seen not even at cadiz or the piraeus had i seen sands so yellow or water so magnificently blue  the houses of the people along the shore were but poor tenements with humble courtyards and gardens but every figtree was gilded and bright as if it were in an hesperian orchard the palms planted here and there rose with a sort of halo of light round about them the creepers on the walls quite dazzled with the brilliancy of their flowers and leaves the people lay in the cool shadows happy and idle with handsome solemn faces nobody seemed to be at work they only talked a very little as if idleness and silence were a condition of the delightful shining atmosphere in which they lived  we went down to an old mosque by the seashore with a cluster of ancient domes hard by it blazing in the sunshine and carved all over with names of allah and titles of old pirates and generals who reposed there  the guardian of the mosque sat in the garden court upon a high wooden pulpit lazily wagging his body to and fro and singing the praises of the prophet gently through his nose as the breeze stirred through the trees overhead and cast chequered and changing shadows over the paved court and the little fountains and the nasal psalmist on his perch  on one side was the mosque into which you could see with its white walls and coolmatted floor and quaint carved pulpit and ornaments and nobody at prayers  in the middle distance rose up the noble towers and battlements of the knightly town with the deep sealine behind them  it really seemed as if everybody was to have a sort of sober cheerfulness and must yield to indolence under this charming atmosphere  i went into the courtyard by the seashore where a few lazy ships were lying with no one on board and found it was the prison of the place  the door was as wide open as westminster hall  some prisoners one or two soldiers and functionaries and some prisoners wives were lolling under an arcade by a fountain other criminals were strolling about here and there their chains clinking quite cheerfully and they and the guards and officials came up chatting quite friendly together and gazed languidly over the portfolio as i was endeavouring to get the likeness of one or two of these comfortable malefactors  one old and wrinkled she criminal whom i had selected on account of the peculiar hideousness of her countenance covered it up with a dirty cloth at which there was a general roar of laughter among this good humoured auditory of cutthroats pickpockets and policemen  the only symptom of a prison about the place was a door across which a couple of sentinels were stretched yawning while within lay three freshlycaught pirateschained by the leg  they had committed some murders of a very late date and were awaiting sentence but their wives were allowed to communicate freely with them  and it seemed to me that if halfadozen friends would set them flee and they themselves had energy enough to move the sentinels would be a great deal too lazy to walk after them  the combined influence of rhodes and ramazan i suppose had taken possession of my friend the schustergesell from berlin  as soon as he received his fee he cut me at once and went and lay down by a fountain near the port and ate grapes out of a dirty pocket handkerchief  other christian idlers lay near him dozing or sprawling in the boats or listlessly munching watermelons along the coffeehouses of the quay sat hundreds more with no better employment and the captain of the iberia and his officers and several of the passengers in that famous steamship were in this company being idle with all their might  two or three adventurous young men went off to see the valley where the dragon was killed but others more susceptible of the real influence of the island i am sure would not have moved though we had been told that the colossus himself was taking a walk half a mile off    chapter ix  the white squall    on deck beneath the awning i dozing lay and yawning it was the grey of dawning ere yet the sun arose and above the funnels roaring and the fitful winds deploring i heard the cabin snoring with universal nose i could hear the passengers snorting i envied their disporting vainly i was courting the pleasure of a doze  so i lay and wondered why light came not and watched the twilight and the glimmer of the skylight that shot across the deck and the binnacle pale and steady and the dull glimpse of the deadeye and the sparks in fiery eddy that whirled from the chimney neck in our jovial floating prison there was sleep from fore to mizen and never a star had risen the hazy sky to speck  strange company we harboured wed a hundred jews to larboard unwashed uncombed uubarbered jews black and brown and grey with terror it would seize ye and make your souls uneasy to see those rabbis greasy who did nought but scratch and pray their dirty children pucking their dirty saucepans cooking their dirty fingers hooking their swarming fleas away  to starboard turks and greeks were whiskered and brown their cheeks were enormous wide their breeks were their pipes did puff alway each on his mat allotted in silence smoked and squatted whilst round their children trotted in pretty pleasant play he cant but smile who traces the smiles on those brown faces and the pretty prattling graces of those small heathens gay  and so the hours kept tolling and through the ocean rolling went the brave iberia bowling before the break of day  when a squall upon a sudden came oer the waters scudding and the clouds began to gather and the sea was lashed to lather and the lowering thunder grumbled and the lightning jumped and tumbled and the ship and all the ocean woke up in wild commotion  then the wind set up a howling and the poodledog a yowling and the cocks began a crowing and the old cow raised a lowing as she heard the tempest blowing and fowls and geese did cackle and the cordage and the tackle began to shriek and crackle and the spray dashed oer the funnels and down the deck in runnels and the rushing water soaks all from the seamen in the foksal to the stokers whose black faces peer out of their bedplaces and the captain he was bawling and the sailors pulling hauling and the quarterdeck tarpauling was shivered in the squalling and the passengers awaken most pitifully shaken and the steward jumps up and hastens for the necessary basins  then the greeks they groaned and quivered and they knelt and moaned and shivered as the plunging waters met them and splashed and overset them and they call in their emergence upon countless saints and virgins and their marrowbones are bended and they think the world is ended  and the turkish women forard were frightened and behorrord and shrieking and bewildering the mothers clutched their children the men sung allah illah mashallah bismillah  as the warring waters doused them and splashed them and soused them and they called upon the prophet and thought but little of it  then all the fleas in jewry jumped up and bit like fury and the progeny of jacob did on the maindeck wake up i wot those greasy rabbins would never pay for cabins and each man moaned and jabbered in his filthy jewish gaberdine in woe and lamentation and howling consternation and the splashing water drenches their dirty brats and wenches and they crawl from bales and benches in a hundred thousand stenches  this was the white squall famous which latterly oercame us and which all will well remember on the 28th september when a prussian captain of lancers those tightlaced whiskered prancers came on the deck astonished by that wild squall admonished and wondering cried potztausend wie ist der sturm jetzt brausend and looked at captain lewis who calmly stood and blew his cigar in all the bustle and scorned the tempests tussle and oft weve thought thereafter how he beat the storm to laughter for well he knew his vessel with that vain wind could wrestle and when a wreck we thought her and doomed ourselves to slaughter how gaily he fought her and through the hubbub brought her and as the tempest caught her cried george some brandyandwater  and when its force expended the harmless storm was ended and as the sunrise splendid came blushing oer the sea i thought as day was breaking my little girls were waking and smiling and making a prayer at home for me    chapter x  telmessusbeyrout    there should have been a poet in our company to describe that charming little bay of glaucus into which we entered on the 26th of september in the first steamboat that ever disturbed its beautiful waters  you cant put down in prose that delicious episode of natural poetry it ought to be done in a symphony full of sweet melodies and swelling harmonies or sung in a strain of clear crystal iambics such as milnes knows how to write  a mere map drawn in words gives the mind no notion of that exquisite nature  what do mountains become in type or rivers in mr vizetellys best brevier  here lies the sweet bay gleaming peaceful in the rosy sunshine  green islands dip here and there in its waters  purple mountains swell circling round it and towards them rising from the bay stretches a rich green plain fruitful with herbs and various foliage in the midst of which the white houses twinkle  i can see a little minaret and some spreading palmtrees but beyond these the description would answer as well for bantry bay as for makri  you could write so far nay much more particularly and grandly without seeing the place at all and after reading beauforts caramania which gives you not the least notion of it  suppose the great hydrographer of the admiralty himself cant describe it who surveyed the place suppose mr fellowes who discovered it afterwardssuppose i say sir john fellowes knt cant do it and i defy any man of imagination to got an impression of telmessus from his bookcan you vain man hope to try  the effect of the artist as i take it ought to be to produce upon his hearers mind by his art an effect something similar to that produced on his own by the sight of the natural object  only music or the best poetry can do this  keatss ode to the grecian urn is the best description i know of that sweet old silent ruin of telmessus  after you have once seen it the remembrance remains with you like a tune from mozart which he seems to have caught out of heaven and which rings sweet harmony in your ears for ever after  its a benefit for all after life you have but to shut your eyes and think and recall it and the delightful vision comes smiling back to your orderthe divine airthe delicious little pageant which nature set before you on this lucky day  here is the entry made in the notebook on the eventful day in the morning steamed into the bay of glaucuslanded at makri cheerful old desolate villagetheatre by the beautiful seashore great fertility oleandersa palmtree in the midst of the village spreading out like a sultans aigrettesculptured caverns or tombs up the mountaincamels over the bridge  perhaps it is best for a man of fancy to make his own landscape out of these materials  to group the couched camels under the plane trees the little crowd of wandering ragged heathens come down to the calm water to behold the nearing steamer to fancy a mountain in the sides of which some scores of tombs are rudely carved pillars and porticos and doric entablatures  but it is of the little theatre that he must make the most beautiful picturea charming little place of festival lying out on the shore and looking over the sweet bay and the swelling purple islands  no theatregoer ever looked out on a fairer scene  it encourages poetry idleness delicious sensual reverie  o jones friend of my heart would you not like to be a whiterobed greek lolling languidly on the cool benches here and pouring compliments in the ionic dialect into the rosy ears of neaera  instead of jones your name should be ionides instead of a silk hat you should wear a chaplet of roses in your hair  you would not listen to the choruses they were singing on the stage for the voice of the fair one would be whispering a rendezvous for the mesonuktiais horais and my ionides would have no ear for aught beside  yonder in the mountain they would carve a doric cave temple to receive your urn when all was done and you would be accompanied thither by a dirge of the surviving ionidae  the caves of the dead are empty now however and their place knows them not any more among the festal haunts of the living  but by way of supplying the choric melodies sung here in old time one of our companions mounted on the scene and spouted   my name is norval   on the same day we lay to for a while at another ruined theatre that of antiphilos  the oxford men fresh with recollections of the littlego bounded away up the hill on which it lies to the ruin measured the steps of the theatre and calculated the width of the scene while others less active watched them with telescopes from the ships sides as they plunged in and out of the stones and hollows  two days after the scene was quite changed  we were out of sight of the classical country and lay in st georges bay behind a huge mountain upon which st george fought the dragon and rescued the lovely lady sabra the king of babylons daughter  the turkish fleet was lying about us commanded by that halil pasha whose two children the two last sultans murdered  the crimson flag with the star and crescent floated at the stern of his ship  our diplomatist put on his uniform and cordons and paid his excellency a visit  he spoke in rapture when he returned of the beauty and order of the ship and the urbanity of the infidel admiral  he sent us bottles of ancient cyprus wine to drink  and the captain of her majestys ship trump alongside which we were lying confirmed that good opinion of the capitan pasha which the reception of the above present led us to entertain by relating many instances of his friendliness and hospitalities  captain g said the turkish ships were as well manned as well kept and as well manoeuvred as any vessels in any service and intimated a desire to command a turkish seventyfour and a perfect willingness to fight her against a french ship of the same size  but i heartily trust he will neither embrace the mahometan opinions nor be called upon to engage any seventyfour whatever  if he do let us hope he will have his own men to fight with  if the crew of the trump were all like the crew of the captains boat they need fear no two hundred and fifty men out of any country with any joinville at their head  we were carried on shore by this boat for two years during which the trump had been lying off beyrout none of the men but these eight had ever set foot on shore mustnt it be a happy life  we were landed at the busy quay of beyrout flanked by the castle that the fighting old commodore half battered down  along the beyrout quays civilisation flourishes under the flags of the consuls which are streaming out over the yellow buildings in the clear air  hither she brings from england her produce of marinestores and woollens her crockeries her portable soups and her bitter ale  hither she has brought politeness and the last modes from paris  they were exhibited in the person of a pretty lady superintending the great french store and who seeing a stranger sketching on the quay sent forward a man with a chair to accommodate that artist and greeted him with a bow and a smile such as only can be found in france  then she fell to talking with a young french officer with a beard who was greatly smitten with her  they were making love just as they do on the boulevard  an arab porter left his bales and the camel he was unloading to come and look at the sketch  two stumpy flatfaced turkish soldiers in red caps and white undresses peered over the paper  a noble little lebanonian girl with a deep yellow face and curly dun coloured hair and a blue tattooed chin and for all clothing a little ragged shift of blue cloth stood by like a little statue holding her urn and stared with wondering brown eyes  how magnificently blue the water washow bright the flags and buildings as they shone above it and the lines of the rigging tossing in the bay  the white crests of the blue waves jumped and sparkled like quicksilver the shadows were as broad and cool as the lights were brilliant and rosy the battered old towers of the commodore looked quite cheerful in the delicious atmosphere and the mountains beyond were of an amethyst colour  the french officer and the lady went on chattering quite happily about love the last new bonnet or the battle of isly or the juif errant how neatly her gown and sleeves fitted her pretty little person we had not seen a woman for a month except honest mrs flanigan the stewardess and the ladies of our party and the tips of the noses of the constantinople beauties as they passed by leering from their yakmacs waddling and plapping in their odious yellow papooshes  and this day is to be marked with a second white stone for having given the lucky writer of the present occasion to behold a second beauty  this was a native syrian damsel who bore the sweet name of mariam  so it was she stood as two of us i mention the number for fear of scandal took her picture  so it was that the goodnatured black cook looked behind her young mistress with a benevolent grin that only the admirable leslie could paint  mariam was the sister of the young guide whom we hired to show us through the town and to let us be cheated in the purchase of gilt scarfs and handkerchiefs which strangers think proper to buy  and before the following authentic drawing could be made many were the stratagems the wily artists were obliged to employ to subdue the shyness of the little mariam  in the first place she would stand behind the door from which in the darkness her beautiful black eyes gleamed out like penny tapers nor could the entreaties of her brother and mamma bring her from that hidingplace  in order to conciliate the latter we began by making a picture of her too that is not of her who was an enormous old fat woman in yellow quivering all over with strings of pearls and necklaces of sequins and other ornaments the which descended from her neck and down her ample stomacher  we did not depict that big old woman who would have been frightened at an accurate representation of her own enormity but an ideal being all grace and beauty dressed in her costume and still simpering before me in my sketch book like a lady in a book of fashions  this portrait was shown to the old woman who handed it over to the black cook who grinning carried it to little mariamand the result was that the young creature stepped forward and submitted and has come over to europe as you see 2  a very snug and happy family did this of mariams appear to be  if you could judge by all the laughter and giggling by the splendour of the womens attire by the neatness of the little house prettily decorated with arabesque paintings neat mats and gay carpets they were a family well to do in the beyrout world and lived with as much comfort as any europeans  they had one book and on the wall of the principal apartment a black picture of the virgin whose name is borne by pretty mariam  the camels and the soldiers the bazaars and khans the fountains and awnings which chequer with such delightful variety of light and shade the alleys and markets of an oriental town are to be seen in beyrout in perfection and an artist might here employ himself for months with advantage and pleasure  a new costume was here added to the motley and picturesque assembly of dresses  this was the dress of the blueveiled women from the lebanon stalking solemnly through the markets with huge horns near a yard high on their foreheads  for thousands of years since the time the hebrew prophets wrote these horns have so been exalted in the lebanon   at night captain lewis gave a splendid ball and supper to the trump  we had the trumps band to perform the music and a grand sight it was to see the captain himself enthusiastically leading on the drum  blue lights and rockets were burned from the yards of our ship which festive signals were answered presently from the trump and from another english vessel in the harbour  they must have struck the capitan pasha with wonder for he sent his secretary on board of us to inquire what the fireworks meant and the worthy turk had scarcely put his foot on the deck when he found himself seized round the waist by one of the trumps officers and whirling round the deck in a waltz to his own amazement and the huge delight of the company  his face of wonder and gravity as he went on twirling could not have been exceeded by that of a dancing dervish at scutari and the manner in which he managed to enjamber the waltz excited universal applause  i forgot whether he accommodated himself to european ways so much further as to drink champagne at suppertime to say that he did would be telling tales out of school and might interfere with the future advancement of that jolly dancing turk  we made acquaintance with another of the sultans subjects who i fear will have occasion to doubt of the honour of the english nation after the foul treachery with which he was treated  among the occupiers of the little bazaar matchboxes vendors of embroidered handkerchiefs and other articles of showy eastern haberdashery was a goodlooking neat young fellow who spoke english very fluently and was particularly attentive to all the passengers on board our ship  this gentleman was not only a pockethandkerchief merchant in the bazaar but earned a further livelihood by letting out mules and donkeys and he kept a small lodginghouse or inn for travellers as we were informed  no wonder he spoke good english and was exceedingly polite and wellbred for the worthy man had passed some time in england and in the best society too  that humble haberdasher at beyrout had been a lion here at the very best houses of the great people and had actually made his appearance at windsor where he was received as a syrian prince and treated with great hospitality by royalty itself  i dont know what waggish propensity moved one of the officers of the trump to say that there was an equerry of his royal highness the prince on board and to point me out as the dignified personage in question  so the syrian prince was introduced to the royal equerry and a great many compliments passed between us  i even had the audacity to state that on my very last interview with my royal master his royal highness had said colonel titmarsh when you go to beyrout you will make special inquiries regarding my interesting friend cogia hassan  poor cogia hassan i forget whether that was his name but it is as good as another was overpowered with this royal message and we had an intimate conversation together at which the waggish officer of the trump assisted with the greatest glee  but see the consequences of deceit  the next day as we were getting under way who should come on board but my friend the syrian prince most eager for a last interview with the windsor equerry and he begged me to carry his protestations of unalterable fidelity to the gracious consort of her majesty  nor was this all cogia hassan actually produced a great box of sweetmeats of which he begged my excellency to accept and a little figure of a doll dressed in the costume of lebanon  then the punishment of imposture began to be felt severely by me  how to accept the poor devils sweetmeats  how to refuse them  and as we know that one fib leads to another so i was obliged to support the first falsehood by another and putting on a dignified aircogia hassan says i i am surprised you dont know the habits of the british court better and are not aware that our gracious master solemnly forbids his servants to accept any sort of backsheesh upon our travels  so prince cogia hassan went over the side with his chest of sweetmeats but insisted on leaving the doll which may be worth twopencehalfpenny of which and of the costume of the women of lebanon the following is an accurate likeness    chapter xi  a day and night in syria    when after being for five whole weeks at sea with a general belief that at the end of a few days the marine malady leaves you for good you find that a brisk wind and a heavy rolling swell create exactly the same inward effects which they occasioned at the very commencement of the voyageyou begin to fancy that you are unfairly dealt with  and i for my part had thought of complaining to the company of this atrocious violation of the rules of their prospectus but we were perpetually coming to anchor in various ports at which intervals of peace and goodhumour were restored to us  on the 3rd of october our cable rushed with a huge rattle into the blue sea before jaffa at a distance of considerably more than a mile off the town which lay before us very clear with the flags of the consuls flaring in the bright sky and making a cheerful and hospitable show  the houses a great heap of sunbaked stones surmounted here and there by minarets and countless little whitewashed domes a few datetrees spread out their fanlike heads over these dulllooking buildings long sands stretched away on either side with low purple hills behind them we could see specks of camels crawling over these yellow plains and those persons who were about to land had the leisure to behold the seaspray flashing over the sands and over a heap of black rocks which lie before the entry to the town  the swell is very great the passage between the rocks narrow and the danger sometimes considerable  so the guide began to entertain the ladies and other passengers in the huge country boat which brought us from the steamer with an agreeable story of a lieutenant and eight seamen of one of her majestys ships who were upset dashed to pieces and drowned upon these rocks through which two men and two boys with a very moderate portion of clothing each standing and pulling half an oarthere were but two oars between them and another by way of rudderwere endeavouring to guide us  when the danger of the rocks and surf was passed came another danger of the hideous brutes in brown skins and the briefest shirts who came towards the boat straddling through the water with outstretched arms grinning and yelling their arab invitations to mount their shoulders  i think these fellows frightened the ladies still more than the rocks and the surf but the poor creatures were obliged to submit and trembling were accommodated somehow upon the mahogany backs of these ruffians carried through the shallows and flung up to a ledge before the city gate where crowds more of dark people were swarming howling after their fashion  the gentlemen meanwhile were having arguments about the eternal backsheesh with the roaring arab boatmen and i recall with wonder and delight especially the curses and screams of one small and extremely loudlunged fellow who expressed discontent at receiving a five instead of a sixpiastre piece  but how is one to know without possessing the language  both coins are made of a greasy pewtery sort of tin and i thought the biggest was the most valuable  but the fellow showed a sense of their value and a disposition seemingly to cut any mans throat who did not understand it  mens throats have been cut for a less difference before now  being cast upon the ledge the first care of our gallantry was to look after the ladies who were scared and astonished by the naked savage brutes who were shouldering the poor things to and fro and bearing them through these and a dark archway we came into a street crammed with donkeys and their packs and drivers and towering camels with leering eyes looking into the secondfloor rooms and huge splay feet through which mesdames et mesdemoiselles were to be conducted  we made a rush at the first open door and passed comfortably under the heels of some horses gathered under the arched court and up a stone staircase which turned out to be that of the russian consuls house  his people welcomed us most cordially to his abode and the ladies and the luggage objects of our solicitude were led up many stairs and across several terraces to a most comfortable little room under a dome of its own where the representative of russia sat  women with brown faces and draggletailed coats and turbans and wondering eyes and no stays and blue beads and gold coins hanging round their necks came to gaze as they passed upon the fair neat englishwomen  blowsy black cooks puffing over fires and the strangest pots and pans on the terraces children paddling about in long striped robes interrupted their sports or labours to come and stare and the consul in his cool domed chamber with a lattice overlooking the sea with clean mats and pictures of the emperor the virgin and st george received the strangers with smiling courtesies regaling the ladies with pomegranates and sugar the gentlemen with pipes of tobacco whereof the fragrant tubes were three yards long  the russian amenities concluded we left the ladies still under the comfortable cool dome of the russian consulate and went to see our own representative  the streets of the little town are neither agreeable to horse nor foot travellers  many of the streets are mere flights of rough steps leading abruptly into private houses you pass under archways and passages numberless a steep dirty labyrinth of stonevaulted stables and sheds occupies the ground floor of the habitations and you pass from flat to flat of the terraces at various irregular corners of which little chambers with little private domes are erected and the people live seemingly as much upon the terrace as in the room  we found the english consul in a queer little arched chamber with a strange old picture of the kings arms to decorate one side of it  and here the consul a demure old man dressed in red flowing robes with a feeble janissary bearing a shabby tinmounted staff or mace to denote his office received such of our nation as came to him for hospitality  he distributed pipes and coffee to all and every one he made us a present of his house and all his beds for the night and went himself to lie quietly on the terrace and for all this hospitality he declined to receive any reward from us and said he was but doing his duty in taking us in  this worthy man i thought must doubtless be very well paid by our government for making such sacrifices but it appears that he does not get one single farthing and that the greater number of our levant consuls are paid at a similar rate of easy remuneration  if we have bad consular agents have we a right to complain  if the worthy gentlemen cheat occasionally can we reasonably be angry  but in travelling through these countries english people who dont take into consideration the miserable poverty and scanty resources of their country and are apt to brag and be proud of it have their vanity hurt by seeing the representatives of every nation but their own well and decently maintained and feel ashamed at sitting down under the shabby protection of our mean consular flag  the active young men of our party had been on shore long before us and seized upon all the available horses in the town but we relied upon a letter from halil pasha enjoining all governors and pashas to help us in all ways  and hearing we were the bearers of this document the cadi and vicegovernor of jaffa came to wait upon the head of our party declared that it was his delight and honour to set eyes upon us that he would do everything in the world to serve us that there were no horses unluckily but he would send and get some in three hours and so left us with a world of grinning bows and many choice compliments from one side to the other which came to each filtered through an obsequious interpreter  but hours passed and the clatter of horses hoofs was not heard  we had our dinner of eggs and flaps of bread and the sunset gun fired  we had our pipes and coffee again and the night fell  is this man throwing dirt upon us we began to think  is he laughing at our beards and are our mothers graves illtreated by this smiling swindling cadi  we determined to go and seek in his own den this shuffling dispenser of infidel justice  this time we would be no more bamboozled by compliments but we would use the language of stern expostulation and being roused would let the rascal hear the roar of the indignant british lion so we rose up in our wrath the poor consul got a lamp for us with a bit of waxcandle such as i wonder his means could afford the shabby janissary marched ahead with his tin mace the two laquaisdeplace that two of our company had hired stepped forward each with an old sabre and we went clattering and stumbling down the streets of the town in order to seize upon this cadi in his own divan  i was glad for my part though outwardly majestic and indignant in demeanour that the horses had not come and that we had a chance of seeing this little queer glimpse of oriental life which the magistrates faithlessness procured for us  as piety forbids the turks to eat during the weary daylight hours of the ramazan they spend their time profitably in sleeping until the welcome sunset when the town wakens  all the lanterns are lighted up all the pipes begin to puff and the narghiles to bubble all the sourmilkandsherbetmen begin to yell out the excellence of their wares all the fryingpans in the little dirty cookshops begin to friz and the pots to send forth a steam  and through this dingy ragged bustling beggarly cheerful scene we began now to march towards the bow street of jaffa  we bustled through a crowded narrow archway which led to the cadis police office entered the little room atrociously perfumed with musk and passing by the railboard where the common sort stood mounted the stage upon which his worship and friends sat and squatted down on the divans in stern and silent dignity  his honour ordered us coffee his countenance evidently showing considerable alarm  a black slave whose duty seemed to be to prepare this beverage in a sideroom with a furnace prepared for each of us about a teaspoonful of the liquor  his worships clerk i presume a tall turk of a noble aspect presented it to us and having lapped up the little modicum of drink the british lion began to speak  all the other travellers said the lion with perfect reason have good horses and are gone the russians have got horses the spaniards have horses the english have horses but we we vizirs in our country coming with letters of halil pasha are laughed at spit upon  are halil pashas letters dirt that you attend to them in this way  are british lions dogs that you treat them soand so on  this speech with many variations was made on our side for a quarter of an hour and we finally swore that unless the horses were forthcoming we would write to halil pasha the next morning and to his excellency the english minister at the sublime porte then you should have heard the chorus of turks in reply  a dozen voices rose up from the divan shouting screaming ejaculating expectorating the arabic spoken language seems to require a great employment of the two latter oratorical methods and uttering what the meek interpreter did not translate to us but what i dare say were by no means complimentary phrases towards us and our nation finally the palaver concluded by the cadi declaring that by the will of heaven horses should be forthcoming at three oclock in the morning and that if not why then we might write to halil pasha  this posed us and we rose up and haughtily took leave  i should like to know that fellows real opinion of us lions very much  and especially to have had the translation of the speeches of a huge breeched turbaned roaring infidel who looked and spoke as if he would have liked to fling us all into the sea which was hoarsely murmuring under our windows an accompaniment to the concert within  we then marched through the bazaars that were lofty and grim and pretty full of people  in a desolate broken building some hundreds of children were playing and singing in many corners sat parties over their waterpipes one of whom every now and then would begin twanging out a most queer chant others there were playing at casinoa crowd squatted around the squalling gamblers and talking and looking on with eager interest  in one place of the bazaar we found a hundred people at least listening to a story teller who delivered his tale with excellent action voice and volubility  in another they were playing a sort of thimblerig with coffeecups all intent upon the game and the player himself very wild lest one of our party who had discovered where the pea lay should tell the company  the devotion and energy with which all these pastimes were pursued struck me as much as anything these people have been playing thimblerig and casino that story teller has been shouting his tale of antar for forty years and they are just as happy with this amusement now as when first they tried it  is there no ennui in the eastern countries and are bluedevils not allowed to go abroad there  from the bazaars we went to see the house of mustapha said to be the best house and the greatest man of jaffa  but the great man had absconded suddenly and had fled into egypt  the sultan had made a demand upon him for sixteen thousand purses 80000l mustapha retiredthe sultan pounced down upon his house and his goods his horses and his mules  his harem was desolate  mr milnes could have written six affecting poems had he been with us on the dark loneliness of that violated sanctuary  we passed from hall to hall terrace to terracea few fellows were slumbering on the naked floors and scarce turned as we went by them  we entered mustaphas particular divanthere was the raised floor but no bearded friends squatting away the night of ramazan there was the little coffee furnace but where was the slave and the coffee and the glowing embers of the pipes  mustaphas favourite passages from the koran were still painted up on the walls but nobody was the wiser for them  we walked over a sleeping negro and opened the windows which looked into his gardens  the horses and donkeys the camels and mules were picketed there below but where is the said mustapha  from the fryingpan of the porte has he not fallen into the fire of mehemet ali  and which is best to broil or to fry  if it be but to read the arabian nights again on getting home it is good to have made this little voyage and seen these strange places and faces  then we went out through the arched lowering gateway of the town into the plain beyond and that was another famous and brilliant scene of the arabian nights  the heaven shone with a marvellous brilliancythe plain disappeared far in the hazethe towers and battlements of the town rose black against the skyold outlandish trees rose up here and thereclumps of camels were couched in the rare herbagedogs were baying aboutgroups of men lay sleeping under their haicks round aboutround about the tall gates many lights were twinklingand they brought us waterpipes and sherbet and we wondered to think that london was only three weeks off  then came the night at the consuls  the poor demure old gentleman brought out his mattresses and the ladies sleeping round on the divans we lay down quite happy and i for my part intended to make as delightful dreams as alnaschar butlo the delicate mosquito sounded his horn  the active flea jumped up and came to feast on christian flesh the eastern flea bites more bitterly than the most savage bug in christendom and the bugoh the accursed  why was he made  what duty has that infamous ruffian to perform in the world save to make people wretched  only bulwer in his most pathetic style could describe the miseries of that nightthe moaning the groaning the cursing the tumbling the blistering the infamous despair and degradation  i heard all the cocks in jaffa crow the children crying and the mothers hushing them the donkeys braying fitfully in the moonlight at last i heard the clatter of hoofs below and the hailing of men  it was three oclock the horses were actually come nay there were camels likewise asses and mules packsaddles and drivers all bustling together under the moonlight in the cheerful streetand the first night in syria was over    chapter xii  from jaffa to jerusalem    it took an hour or more to get our little caravan into marching order to accommodate all the packs to the horses the horses to the riders to see the ladies comfortably placed in their litter with a sleek and large black mule fore and aft a groom to each mule and a tall and exceedingly goodnatured and mahoganycoloured infidel to walk by the side of the carriage to balance it as it swayed to and fro and to offer his back as a step to the inmates whenever they were minded to ascend or alight  these three fellows fasting through the ramazan and over as rough a road for the greater part as ever shook mortal bones performed their fourteen hours walk of near forty miles with the most admirable courage alacrity and goodhumour  they once or twice drank water on the march and so far infringed the rule but they refused all bread or edible refreshment offered to them and tugged on with an energy that the best camel and i am sure the best christian might envy  what a lesson of goodhumoured endurance it was to certain pall mall sardanapaluses who grumble if club sofa cushions are not soft enough  if i could write sonnets at leisure i would like to chronicle in fourteen lines my sensations on finding myself on a high turkish saddle with a pair of fireshovel stirrups and worsted reins red padded saddlecloth and innumerable tags fringes glassbeads ends of rope to decorate the harness of the horse the gallant steed on which i was about to gallop into syrian life  what a figure we cut in the moonlight and how they would have stared in the strand  ay or in leicestershire where i warrant such a horse and rider are not often visible  the shovel stirrups are deucedly short the clumsy leathers cut the shins of some equestrians abominably you sit over your horse as it were on a tower from which the descent would be very easy but for the big peak of the saddle  a good way for the inexperienced is to put a stick or umbrella across the saddle peak again so that it is next to impossible to go over your horses neck  i found this a vast comfort in going down the hills and recommend it conscientiously to other dear simple brethren of the city  peaceful men we did not ornament our girdles with pistols yataghans c such as some pilgrims appeared to bristle all over with and as a lesson to such rash people a story may be told which was narrated to us at jerusalem and carries a wholesome moral  the honourable hoggin armer who was lately travelling in the east wore about his stomach two brace of pistols of such exquisite finish and make that a sheikh in the jericho country robbed him merely for the sake of the pistols  i dont know whether he has told the story to his friends at home  another story about sheikhs may here be told a propos  that celebrated irish peer lord oldgent who was distinguished in the buckinghamshire dragoons having paid a sort of black mail to the sheikh of jericho country was suddenly set upon by another sheikh who claimed to be the real jerichonian governor and these twins quarrelled over the body of lord oldgent as the widows for the innocent baby before solomon  there was enough for bothbut these digressions are interminable  the party got under way at near four oclock  the ladies in the litter the french femmedechambre manfully caracoling on a grey horse the cavaliers like your humble servant on their high saddles the domestics flunkeys guides and grooms on all sorts of animalssome fourteen in all  add to these two most grave and stately arabs in white beards white turbans white haicks and raiments sabres curling round their military thighs and immense long guns at their backs  more venerable warriors i never saw they went by the side of the litter soberly prancing  when we emerged from the steep clattering streets of the city into the grey plains lighted by the moon and starlight these militaries rode onward leading the way through the huge avenues of strange diabolicallooking prickly pears plants that look as if they had grown in tartarus by which the first mile or two of route from the city is bounded and as the dawn arose before us exhibiting first a streak of grey then of green then of red in the sky it was fine to see these martial figures defined against the rising light  the sight of that little cavalcade and of the nature around it will always remain with me i think as one of the freshest and most delightful sensations i have enjoyed since the day i first saw calais pier  it was full day when they gave their horses a drink at a large pretty oriental fountain and then presently we entered the open plainthe famous plain of sharonso fruitful in roses once now hardly cultivated but always beautiful and noble  here presently in the distance we saw another cavalcade pricking over the plain  our two white warriors spread to the right and left and galloped to reconnoitre  we too put our steeds to the canter and handling our umbrellas as richard did his lance against saladin went undaunted to challenge this caravan  the fact is we could distinguish that it was formed of the party of our pious friends the poles and we hailed them with cheerful shouting and presently the two caravans joined company and scoured the plain at the rate of near four miles per hour  the horsemaster a courier of this company rode three miles for our one  he was a broken nosed arab with pistols a sabre a fusee a yellow damascus cloth flapping over his head and his nose ornamented with diachylon  he rode a hognecked grey arab bristling over with harness and jumped and whirled and reared and halted to the admiration of all  scarce had the diachylonian arab finished his evolutions when lo yet another cloud of dust was seen and another party of armed and glittering horsemen appeared  they too were led by an arab who was followed by two janissaries with silver maces shining in the sun  twas the party of the new american consulgeneral of syria and jerusalem hastening to that city with the inferior consuls of ramleh and jaffa to escort him  he expects to see the millennium in three years and has accepted the office of consul at jerusalem so as to be on the spot in readiness  when the diachylon arab saw the american arab he straightway galloped his steed towards him took his pipe which he delivered at his adversary in guise of a jereed and galloped round and round and in and out and there and back again as in a play of war  the american replied in a similar playful ferocitythe two warriors made a little tournament for us there on the plains before jaffa in the which diachylon being a little worsted challenged his adversary to a race and fled away on his grey the american following on his bay  here poor stickingplaster was again worsted the yankee contemptuously riding round him and then declining further exercise  what more could mortal man want  a troop of knights and paladins could have done no more  in no page of walter scott have i read a scene more fair and sparkling  the sober warriors of our escort did not join in the gambols of the young men  there they rode soberly in their white turbans by their ladies litter their long guns rising up behind them  there was no lack of company along the road  donkeys numberless camels by twos and threes now a muledriver trudging along the road chanting a most queer melody now a lady in white veil black mask and yellow papooshes bestriding her ass and followed by her husbandmet us on the way and most people gave a salutation  presently we saw ramleh in a smoking mist on the plain before us flanked to the right by a tall lonely tower that might have held the bells of some moutier of caen or evreux  as we entered about three hours and a half after starting among the white domes and stone houses of the little town we passed the place of tombs  two women were sitting on one of themthe one bending her head towards the stone and rocking to and fro and moaning out a very sweet pitiful lamentation  the american consul invited us to breakfast at the house of his subaltern the hospitable oneeyed armenian who represents the united states at jaffa  the stars and stripes were flaunting over his terraces to which we ascended leaving our horses to the care of a multitude of roaring ragged arabs beneath who took charge of and fed the animals though i cant say in the least why but in the same way as getting off my horse on entering jerusalem i gave the rein into the hand of the first person near me and have never heard of the worthy brute since  at the american consuls we were served first with rice soup in pishpash flavoured with cinnamon and spice then with boiled mutton then with stewed ditto and tomatoes then with fowls swimming in grease then with brown ragouts belaboured with onions then with a smoking pilaff of rice  several of which dishes i can pronounce to be of excellent material and flavour when the gentry had concluded this repast it was handed to a side table where the commonalty speedily discussed it  we left them licking their fingers as we hastened away upon the second part of the ride  and as we quitted ramleh the scenery lost that sweet and peaceful look which characterises the pretty plain we had traversed and the sun too rising in the heaven dissipated all those fresh beautiful tints in which gods world is clothed of early morning and which city people have so seldom the chance of beholding  the plain over which we rode looked yellow and gloomy the cultivation little or none the land across the roadside fringed for the most part with straggling wildcarrot plants a patch of green only here and there  we passed several herds of lean small well conditioned cattle  many flocks of black goats tended now and then by a ragged negro shepherd his long gun slung over his back his hand over his eyes to shade them as he stared at our little cavalcade  most of the halfnaked countryfolks we met had this dismal appendage to eastern rustic life and the weapon could hardly be one of mere defence for beyond the faded skullcap or tattered coat of blue or dirty white the brawny brownchested solemnlooking fellows had nothing seemingly to guard  as before there was no lack of travellers on the road  more donkeys trotted by looking sleek and strong camels singly and by pairs laden with a little humble ragged merchandise on their way between the two towns  about noon we halted eagerly at a short distance from an arab village and well where all were glad of a drink of fresh water  a village of beavers or a colony of ants make habitations not unlike these dismal huts piled together on the plain here there were no single huts along the whole line of road poor and wretched as they are the fellahs huddle all together for protection from the other thieves their neighbours  the government which we restored to them has no power to protect them and is only strong enough to rob them  the women with their long blue gowns and ragged veils came to and fro with pitchers on their heads  rebecca had such an one when she brought drink to the lieutenant of abraham  the boys came staring round bawling after us with their fathers for the inevitable backsheesh  the village dogs barked round the flocks as they were driven to water or pasture  we saw a gloomy not very loftylooking ridge of hills in front of us the highest of which the guide pointing out to us told us that from it we should see jerusalem  it looked very near and we all set up a trot of enthusiasm to get into this hill country  but that burst of enthusiasm it may have carried us nearly a quarter of a mile in three minutes was soon destined to be checked by the disagreeable nature of the country we had to traverse before we got to the real mountain district we were in a manner prepared for it by the mounting and descent of several lonely outlying hills up and down which our rough stony track wound then we entered the hill district and our path lay through the clattering bed of an ancient stream whose brawling waters have rolled away into the past along with the fierce and turbulent race who once inhabited these savage hills  there may have been cultivation here two thousand years ago  the mountains or huge stony mounds environing this rough path have level ridges all the way up to their summits on these parallel ledges there is still some verdure and soil  when water flowed here and the country was thronged with that extraordinary population which according to the sacred histories was crowded into the region these mountain steps may have been gardens and vineyards such as we see now thriving along the hills of the rhine  now the district is quite deserted and you ride among what seem to be so many petrified waterfalls  we saw no animals moving among the stony brakes scarcely even a dozen little birds in the whole course of the ride the sparrows are all at jerusalem among the housetops where their ceaseless chirping and twittering forms the most cheerful sound of the place  the company of poles the company of oxford men and the little american army travelled too quick for our caravan which was made to follow the slow progress of the ladies litter and we had to make the journey through the mountains in a very small number  not one of our party had a single weapon more dreadful than an umbrella  and a couple of arabs wickedly inclined might have brought us all to the halt and rifled every carpetbag and pocket belonging to us  nor can i say that we journeyed without certain qualms of fear  when swarthy fellows with girdles full of pistols and yataghans passed us without unslinging their long gunswhen scowling camelriders with awful long bending lances decorated with tufts of rags or savage plumes of scarlet feathers went by without molestationi think we were rather glad that they did not stop and parley  for after all a british lion with an umbrella is no match for an arab with his infernal long gun  what too would have become of our women  so we tried to think that it was entirely out of anxiety for them that we were inclined to push on  there is a shady restingplace and village in the midst of the mountain district where the travellers are accustomed to halt for an hours repose and refreshment and the other caravans were just quitting this spot having enjoyed its cool shades and waters when we came up  should we stop  regard for the ladies of course no other earthly consideration made us say no  what admirable selfdenial and chivalrous devotion  so our poor devils of mules and horses got no rest and no water our panting littermen no breathing time and we staggered desperately after the procession ahead of us  it wound up the mountain in front of us  the poles with their guns and attendants the american with his janissaries fifty or sixty all riding slowly like the procession in bluebeard  but alas they headed us very soon when we got up the weary hill they were all out of sight  perhaps thoughts of fleet street did cross the minds of some of us then and a vague desire to see a few policemen  the district now seemed peopled and with an ugly race savage personages peered at us out of huts and grim holes in the rocks  the mules began to loiter most abominablywater the muleteers must haveand behold we came to a pleasantlooking village of trees standing on a hill children were shaking figs from the treeswomen were going aboutbefore us was the mosque of a holy manthe village looking like a collection of little forts rose up on the hill to our right with a long view of the fields and gardens stretching from it and camels arriving with their burdens  here we must stop paolo the chief servant knew the sheikh of the villagehe very good mangive him water and supper water very good herein fact we began to think of the propriety of halting here for the night and making our entry into jerusalem on the next day  a man on a handsome horse dressed in red came prancing up to us looking hard at the ladies in the litter and passed away  then two others sauntered up one handsome and dressed in red too and he stared into the litter without ceremony began to play with a little dog that lay there asked if we were inglees and was answered by me in the affirmative  paolo had brought the water the most delicious draught in the world  the gentlefolks had had some the poor muleteers were longing for it  the french maid the courageous victoire never since the days of joan of arc has there surely been a more gallant and virtuous female of france refused the drink when suddenly a servant of the party scampers up to his master and says  abou gosh says the ladies must get out and show themselves to the women of the village  it was abou gosh himself the redoubted robber sheikh about whom we had been laughing and crying wolf all day  never was seen such a skurry  march was the instant order given  when victoire heard who it was and the message you should have seen how she changed countenance trembling for her virtue in the ferocious clutches of a gosh  un verre deau pour lamour de dieu gasped she and was ready to faint on her saddle  ne buvez plus victoire screamed a little fellow of our party  push on push on cried one and all  whats the matter exclaimed the ladies in the litter as they saw themselves suddenly jogging on again but we took care not to tell them what had been the designs of the redoubtable abou gosh  away then we wentvictoire was savedand her mistresses rescued from dangers they knew not of until they were a long way out of the village  did he intend insult or good will  did victoire escape the odious chance of becoming madame abou gosh  or did the mountain chief simply propose to be hospitable after his fashion  i think the latter was his desire if the former had been his wish a half dozen of his long guns could have been up with us in a minute and had all our party at their mercy  but now for the sake of the mere excitement the incident was i am sorry to say rather a pleasant one than otherwise  especially for a traveller who is in the happy condition of being able to sing before robbers as is the case with the writer of the present  a little way out of the land of goshen we came upon a long stretch of gardens and vineyards slanting towards the setting sun which illuminated numberless golden clusters of the most delicious grapes of which we stopped and partook  such grapes were never before tasted water so fresh as that which a countryman fetched for us from a well never sluiced parched throats before  it was the ride the sun and above all abou gosh who made that refreshment so sweet and hereby i offer him my best thanks presently in the midst of a most diabolical ravine down which our horses went sliding we heard the evening gun  it was fired from jerusalem  the twilight is brief in this country and in a few minutes the landscape was grey round about us and the sky lighted up by a hundred thousand stars which made the night beautiful   under this superb canopy we rode for a couple of hours to our journeys end  the mountains round about us dark lonely and sad the landscape as we saw it at night it is not more cheerful in the daytime the most solemn and forlorn i have ever seen  the feelings of almost terror with which riding through the night we approached this awful place the centre of the worlds past and future history have no need to be noted down here  the recollection of those sensations must remain with a man as long as his memory lasts and he should think of them as often perhaps as he should talk of them little    chapter xiii  jerusalem    the ladies of our party found excellent quarters in readiness for them at the greek convent in the city where airy rooms and plentiful meals and wines and sweetmeats delicate and abundant were provided to cheer them after the fatigues of their journey  i dont know whether the worthy fathers of the convent share in the good things which they lavish on their guests but they look as if they do  those whom we saw bore every sign of easy conscience and good living there were a pair of strong rosy greasy lazy lay brothers dawdling in the sun on the convent terrace or peering over the parapet into the street below whose looks gave one a notion of anything but asceticism  in the principal room of the strangers house the lay traveller is not admitted to dwell in the sacred interior of the convent and over the building the russian doubleheaded eagle is displayed the place is under the patronage of the emperor nicholas an imperial prince has stayed in these rooms the russian consul performs a great part in the city and a considerable annual stipend is given by the emperor towards the maintenance of the great establishment in jerusalem  the great chapel of the church of the holy sepulchre is by far the richest in point of furniture of all the places of worship under that roof  we were in russia when we came to visit our friends here under the protection of the father of the church and the imperial eagle  this butcher and tyrant who sits on his throne only through the crime of those who held it before himevery step in whose pedigree is stained by some horrible mark of murder parricide adulterythis padded and whiskered pontiffwho rules in his jackboots over a system of spies and soldiers of deceit ignorance dissoluteness and brute force such as surely the history of the world never told of beforehas a tender interest in the welfare of his spiritual children  in the eastern church ranks after divinity and is worshipped by millions of men  a pious exemplar of christianity truly and of the condition to which its union with politics has brought it  think of the rank to which he pretends and gravely believes that he possesses no doubtthink of those who assumed the same ultrasacred character before himand then of the bible and the founder of the religion of which the emperor assumes to be the chief priest and defender  we had some poles of our party but these poor fellows went to the latin convent declining to worship after the emperors fashion the next night after our arrival two of them passed in the sepulchre  there we saw them more than once on subsequent visits kneeling in the latin church before the pictures or marching solemnly with candles in processions or lying flat on the stones or passionately kissing the spots which their traditions have consecrated as the authentic places of the saviours sufferings more honest or more civilised or from opposition the latin fathers have long given up and disowned the disgusting mummery of the eastern firewhich lie the greeks continue annually to tell  their travellers house and convent though large and commodious are of a much poorer and shabbier condition than those of the greeks  both make believe not to take money but the traveller is expected to pay in each  the latin fathers enlarge their means by a little harmless trade in beads and crosses and motherofpearl shells on which figures of saints are engraved and which they purchase from the manufacturers and vend at a small profit  the english until of late used to be quartered in these sham inns but last year two or three maltese took houses for the reception of tourists who can now be accommodated with cleanly and comfortable board at a rate not too heavy for most pockets  to one of these we went very gladly giving our horses the bridle at the door which went off of their own will to their stables through the dark inextricable labyrinths of streets archways and alleys which we had threaded after leaving the main street from the jaffa gate  there there was still some life  numbers of persons were collected at their doors or smoking before the dingy coffeehouses where singing and storytelling were going on but out of this great street everything was silent and no sign of a light from the windows of the low houses which we passed   we ascended from a lower floor up to a terrace on which were several little domed chambers or pavilions  from this terrace whence we looked in the morning a great part of the city spread before us white domes upon domes and terraces of the same character as our own  here and there from among these whitewashed mounds round about a minaret rose or a rare datetree but the chief part of the vegetation near was that odious tree the prickly pearone huge green wart growing out of another armed with spikes as inhospitable as the aloe without shelter or beauty  to the right the mosque of omar rose the rising sun behind it yonder steep tortuous lane before us flanked by ruined walls on either side has borne time out of mind the title of via dolorosa and tradition has fixed the spots where the saviour rested bearing his cross to calvary  but of the mountain rising immediately in front of us a few grey olivetrees speckling the yellow side here and there there can be no question  that is the mount of olives  bethany lies beyond it  the most sacred eyes that ever looked on this world have gazed on those ridges  it was there he used to walk and teach  with shame and humility one looks towards the spot where that inexpressible love and benevolence lived and breathed where the great yearning heart of the saviour interceded for all our race and whence the bigots and traitors of his day led him away to kill him   that company of jews whom we had brought with us from constantinople and who had cursed every delay on the route not from impatience to view the holy city but from rage at being obliged to purchase dear provisions for their maintenance on ship board made what bargains they best could at jaffa and journeyed to the valley of jehoshaphat at the cheapest rate  we saw the tall form of the old polish patriarch venerable in filth stalking among the stinking ruins of the jewish quarter  the sly old rabbi in the greasy folding hat who would not pay to shelter his children from the storm off beyrout greeted us in the bazaars the younger rabbis were furbished up with some smartness  we met them on sunday at the kind of promenade by the walls of the bethlehem gate they were in company of some redbearded coreligionists smartly attired in eastern raiment but their voice was the voice of the jews of berlin and of course as we passed they were talking about so many hundert thaler  you may track one of the people and be sure to hear mention of that silver calf that they worship  the english mission has been very unsuccessful with these religionists  i dont believe the episcopal apparatusthe chaplains and the colleges and the beadleshave succeeded in converting a dozen of them and a sort of martyrdom is in store for the luckless hebrews at jerusalem who shall secede from their faith  their old community spurn them with horror and i heard of the case of one unfortunate man whose wife in spite of her husbands change of creed being resolved like a true woman to cleave to him was spirited away from him in his absence was kept in privacy in the city in spite of all exertions of the mission of the consul and the bishop and the chaplains and the beadles was passed away from jerusalem to beyrout and thence to constantinople and from constantinople was whisked off into the russian territories where she still pines after her husband  may that unhappy convert find consolation away from her  i could not help thinking as my informant an excellent and accomplished gentleman of the mission told me the story that the jews had done only what the christians do under the same circumstances  the woman was the daughter of a most learned rabbi as i gathered suppose the daughter of the rabbi of exeter or canterbury were to marry a man who turned jew would not her right reverend father be justified in taking her out of the power of a person likely to hurl her soul to perdition  these poor converts should surely be sent away to england out of the way of persecution  we could not but feel a pity for them as they sat there on their benches in the church conspicuous and thought of the scorn and contumely which attended them without as they passed in their european dresses and shaven beards among their grisly scowling longrobed countrymen  as elsewhere in the towns i have seen the ghetto of jerusalem is preeminent in filth  the people are gathered round about the dunggate of the city  of a friday you may hear their wailings and lamentations for the lost glories of their city  i think the valley of jehoshaphat is the most ghastly sight i have seen in the world  from all quarters they come hither to bury their dead when his time is come yonder hoary old miser with whom we made our voyage will lay his carcase to rest here  to do that and to claw together money has been the purpose of that strange long life  we brought with us one of the gentlemen of the mission a hebrew convert the rev mr e and lest i should be supposed to speak with disrespect above of any of the converts of the hebrew faith let me mention this gentleman as the only one whom i had the fortune to meet on terms of intimacy  i never saw a man whose outward conduct was more touching whose sincerity was more evident and whose religious feeling seemed more deep real and reasonable  only a few feet off the walls of the anglican church of jerusalem rise up from their foundations on a picturesque open spot in front of the bethlehem gate  the english bishop has his church hard by and near it is the house where the christians of our denomination assemble and worship  there seem to be polyglot services here  i saw books of prayer or scripture in hebrew greek and german  in which latter language dr alexander preaches every sunday  a gentleman who sat near me at church used all these books indifferently reading the first lesson from the hebrew book and the second from the greek  here we all assembled on the sunday after our arrival  it was affecting to hear the music and language of our country sounding in this distant place to have the decent and manly ceremonial of our service the prayers delivered in that noble language  even that stout antiprelatist the american consul who has left his house and fortune in america in order to witness the coming of the millennium who believes it to be so near that he has brought a dove with him from his native land which bird he solemnly informed us was to survive the expected advent was affected by the good old words and service  he swayed about and moaned in his place at various passages during the sermon he gave especial marks of sympathy and approbation  i never heard the service more excellently and impressively read than by the bishops chaplain mr veitch  but it was the music that was most touching i thoughtthe sweet old songs of home  there was a considerable company assembled  near a hundred people i should think  our party made a large addition to the usual congregation  the bishops family is proverbially numerous  the consul and the gentlemen of the mission have wives and children and english establishments  these and the strangers occupied places down the room to the right and left of the desk and communiontable  the converts and the members of the college in rather a scanty number faced the officiating clergyman before whom the silver maces of the janissaries were set up as they set up the beadles maces in england  i made many walks round the city to olivet and bethany to the tombs of the kings and the fountains sacred in story  these are green and fresh but all the rest of the landscape seemed to me to be frightful  parched mountains with a grey bleak olivetree trembling here and there savage ravines and valleys paved with tombstonesa landscape unspeakably ghastly and desolate meet the eye wherever you wander round about the city  the place seems quite adapted to the events which are recorded in the hebrew histories  it and they as it seems to me can never be regarded without terror  fear and blood crime and punishment follow from page to page in frightful succession  there is not a spot at which you look but some violent deed has been done there  some massacre has been committed some victim has been murdered some idol has been worshipped with bloody and dreadful rites  not far from hence is the place where the jewish conqueror fought for the possession of jerusalem  the sun stood still and hasted not to go down about a whole day so that the jews might have daylight to destroy the amorites whose iniquities were full and whose land they were about to occupy  the fugitive heathen king and his allies were discovered in their hidingplace and hanged  and the children of judah smote jerusalem with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire and they left none remaining but utterly destroyed all that breathed  i went out at the zion gate and looked at the socalled tomb of david  i had been reading all the morning in the psalms and his history in samuel and kings  bring thou down shimeis hoar head to the grave with blood are the last words of the dying monarch as recorded by the history  what they call the tomb is now a crumbling old mosque from which jew and christian are excluded alike  as i saw it blazing in the sunshine with the purple sky behind it the glare only served to mark the surrounding desolation more clearly  the lonely walls and towers of the city rose hard by  dreary mountains and declivities of naked stones were round about  they are burrowed with holes in which christian hermits lived and died  you see one green place far down in the valley it is called en rogel  adonijah feasted there who was killed by his brother solomon for asking for abishag for wife  the valley of hinnom skirts the hill  the dismal ravine was a fruitful garden once  ahaz and the idolatrous kings sacrificed to idols under the green trees there and caused their children to pass through the fire  on the mountain opposite solomon with the thousand women of his harem worshipped the gods of all their nations ashtoreth and milcom and molech the abomination of the ammonites  an enormous charnelhouse stands on the hill where the bodies of dead pilgrims used to be thrown and common belief has fixed upon this spot as the aceldama which judas purchased with the price of his treason  thus you go on from one gloomy place to another each seared with its bloody tradition  yonder is the temple and you think of tituss soldiery storming its flaming porches and entering the city in the savage defence of which two million human souls perished  it was on mount zion that godfrey and tancred had their camp  when the crusaders entered the mosque they rode kneedeep in the blood of its defenders and of the women and children who had fled thither for refuge  it was the victory of joshua over again  then after three days of butchery they purified the desecrated mosque and went to prayer  in the centre of this history of crime rises up the great murder of all     i need say no more about this gloomy landscape  after a man has seen it once he never forgets itthe recollection of it seems to me to follow him like a remorse as it were to implicate him in the awful deed which was done there  oh with what unspeakable shame and terror should one think of that crime and prostrate himself before the image of that divine blessed sufferer   of course the first visit of the traveller is to the famous church of the sepulchre  in the archway leading from the street to the court and church there is a little bazaar of bethlehemites who must interfere considerably with the commerce of the latin fathers  these men bawl to you from their stalls and hold up for your purchase their devotional baublesbushels of rosaries and scented beads and carved motherofpearl shells and rude stone saltcellars and figures  now that inns are establishedenvoys of these pedlars attend them on the arrival of strangers squat all day on the terraces before your door and patiently entreat you to buy of their goods  some worthies there are who drive a good trade by tattooing pilgrims with the five crosses the arms of jerusalem under which the name of the city is punctured in hebrew with the auspicious year of the hadjis visit  several of our fellow travellers submitted to this queer operation and will carry to their grave this relic of their journey  some of them had engaged as servant a man at beyrout who had served as a lad on board an english ship in the mediterranean  above his tattooage of the five crosses the fellow had a picture of two hearts united and the pathetic motto betsy my dear  he had parted with betsy my dear five years before at malta  he had known a little english there but had forgotten it  betsy my dear was forgotten too  only her name remained engraved with a vain simulacrum of constancy on the faithless rogues skin  on which was now printed another token of equally effectual devotion  the beads and the tattooing however seem essential ceremonies attendant on the christian pilgrims visit for many hundreds of years doubtless the palmers have carried off with them these simple reminiscences of the sacred city  that symbol has been engraven upon the arms of how many princes knights and crusaders  dont you see a moral as applicable to them as to the swindling beyrout horseboy  i have brought you back that cheap and wholesome apologue in lieu of any of the bethlehemite shells and beads  after passing through the porch of the pedlars you come to the courtyard in front of the noble old towers of the church of the sepulchre with pointed arches and gothic traceries rude but rich and picturesque in design  here crowds are waiting in the sun until it shall please the turkish guardians of the churchdoor to open  a swarm of beggars sit here permanently  old tattered hags with long veils ragged children blind old bearded beggars who raise up a chorus of prayers for money holding out their wooden bowls or clattering with their sticks on the stones or pulling your coatskirts and moaning and whining yonder sit a group of coalblack coptish pilgrims with robes and turbans of dark blue fumbling their perpetual beads  a party of arab christians have come up from their tents or villages  the men halfnaked looking as if they were beggars or banditti upon occasion the women have flung their headcloths back and are looking at the strangers under their tattooed eyebrows  as for the strangers there is no need to describe them  that figure of the englishman with his hands in his pockets has been seen all the world over  staring down the crater of vesuvius or into a hottentot kraalor at a pyramid or a parisian coffeehouse or an esquimaux hutwith the same insolent calmness of demeanour  when the gates of the church are open he elbows in among the first and flings a few scornful piastres to the turkish doorkeeper and gazes round easily at the place in which people of every other nation in the world are in tears or in rapture or wonder  he has never seen the place until now and looks as indifferent as the turkish guardian who sits in the doorway and swears at the people as they pour in  indeed i believe it is impossible for us to comprehend the source and nature of the roman catholic devotion  i once went into a church at rome at the request of a catholic friend who described the interior to be so beautiful and glorious that he thought he said it must be like heaven itself  i found walls hung with cheap stripes of pink and white calico altars covered with artificial flowers a number of wax candles and plenty of giltpaper ornaments  the place seemed to me like a shabby theatre and here was my friend on his knees at my side plunged in a rapture of wonder and devotion  i could get no better impression out of this the most famous church in the world  the deceits are too open and flagrant the inconsistencies and contrivances too monstrous  it is hard even to sympathise with persons who receive them as genuine and though as i know and saw in the case of my friend at rome the believers life may be passed in the purest exercise of faith and charity it is difficult even to give him credit for honesty so barefaced seem the impostures which he professes to believe and reverence  it costs one no small effort even to admit the possibility of a catholics credulity  to share in his rapture and devotion is still further out of your power and i could get from this church no other emotions but those of shame and pain  the legends with which the greeks and latins have garnished the spot have no more sacredness for you than the hideous unreal barbaric pictures and ornaments which they have lavished on it look at the fervour with which pilgrims kiss and weep over a tawdry gothic painting scarcely better fashioned than an idol in a south sea morai  the histories which they are called upon to reverence are of the same period and ordersavage gothic caricatures  in either a saint appears in the costume of the middle ages and is made to accommodate himself to the fashion of the tenth century  the different churches battle for the possession of the various relics  the greeks show you the tomb of melchisedec while the armenians possess the chapel of the penitent thief the poor copts with their little cabin of a chapel can yet boast of possessing the thicket in which abraham caught the ram which was to serve as the vicar of isaac the latins point out the pillar to which the lord was bound  the place of the invention of the sacred cross the fissure in the rock of golgotha the tomb of adam himselfare all here within a few yards space  you mount a few steps and are told it is calvary upon which you stand  all this in the midst of blaring candles reeking incense savage pictures of scripture story or portraits of kings who have been benefactors to the various chapels a din and clatter of strange peoplethese weeping bowing kissingthose utterly indifferent and the priests clad in outlandish robes snuffling and chanting incomprehensible litanies robing disrobing lighting up candles or extinguishing them advancing retreating bowing with all sorts of unfamiliar genuflexions  had it pleased the inventors of the sepulchre topography to have fixed on fifty more spots of ground as the places of the events of the sacred story the pilgrim would have believed just as now  the priests authority has so mastered his faith that it accommodates itself to any demand upon it and the english stranger looks on the scene for the first time with a feeling of scorn bewilderment and shame at that grovelling credulity those strange rites and ceremonies that almost confessed imposture  jarred and distracted by these the church of the holy sepulchre for some time seems to an englishman the least sacred spot about jerusalem  it is the lies and the legends and the priests and their quarrels and their ceremonies which keep the holy place out of sight  a man has not leisure to view it for the brawling of the guardians of the spot  the roman conquerors they say raised up a statue of venus in this sacred place intending to destroy all memory of it  i dont think the heathen was as criminal as the christian is now  to deny and disbelieve is not so bad as to make belief a ground to cheat upon  the liar ananias perished for that and yet out of these gates where angels may have kept watchout of the tomb of christchristian priests issue with a lie in their hands  what a place to choose for imposture good god to sully with brutal struggles for selfaggrandisement or shameful schemes of gain  the situation of the tomb into which be it authentic or not no man can enter without a shock of breathless fear and deep and awful selfhumiliation must have struck all travellers  it stands in the centre of the arched rotunda which is common to all denominations and from which branch off the various chapels belonging to each particular sect  in the coptic chapel i saw one coalblack copt in blue robes cowering in the little cabin surrounded by dingy lamps barbarous pictures and cheap faded trumpery  in the latin church there was no service going on only two fathers dusting the mouldy gewgaws along the brown walls and laughing to one another  the gorgeous church of the fire impostors hard by was always more fully attended as was that of their wealthy neighbours the armenians  these three main sects hate each other their quarrels are interminable each bribes and intrigues with the heathen lords of the soil to the prejudice of his neighbour  now it is the latins who interfere and allow the common church to go to ruin because the greeks purpose to roof it now the greeks demolish a monastery on mount olivet and leave the ground to the turks rather than allow the armenians to possess it on another occasion the greeks having mended the armenian steps which lead to the socalled cave of the nativity at bethlehem the latter asked for permission to destroy the work of the greeks and did so  and so round this sacred spot the centre of christendom the representatives of the three great sects worship under one roof and hate each other  above the tomb of the saviour the cupola is open and you see the blue sky overhead  which of the builders was it that had the grace to leave that under the high protection of heaven and not confine it under the mouldering old domes and roofs which cover so much selfishness and uncharitableness and imposture   we went to bethlehem too and saw the apocryphal wonders there  five miles ride brings you from jerusalem to it over naked wavy hills the aspect of which however grows more cheerful as you approach the famous village  we passed the convent of mar elyas on the road walled and barred like a fort  in spite of its strength however it has more than once been stormed by the arabs and the luckless fathers within put to death  hard by was rebeccas well a dead body was lying there and crowds of male and female mourners dancing and howling round it  now and then a little troop of savage scowling horsemena shepherd driving his black sheep his gun over his shouldera troop of camelsor of women with long blue robes and white veils bearing pitchers and staring at the strangers with their great solemn eyesor a company of labourers with their donkeys bearing grain or grapes to the citymet us and enlivened the little ride  it was a busy and cheerful scene the church of the nativity with the adjoining convents forms a vast and noble christian structure  a party of travellers were going to the jordan that day and scores of their followersof the robbing arabs who profess to protect them magnificent figures some of them with flowing haicks and turbans with long guns and scimitars and wretched horses covered with gaudy trappings were standing on the broad pavement before the little convent gate  it was such a scene as cattermole might paint  knights and crusaders may have witnessed a similar one  you could fancy them issuing out of the narrow little portal and so greeted by the swarms of swarthy clamorous women and merchants and children  the scene within the building was of the same gothic character  we were entertained by the superior of the greek convent in a fine refectory with ceremonies and hospitalities that pilgrims of the middle ages might have witnessed  we were shown over the magnificent barbaric church visited of course the grotto where the blessed nativity is said to have taken place and the rest of the idols set up for worship by the clumsy legend  when the visit was concluded the party going to the dead sea filed off with their armed attendants each individual traveller making as brave a show as he could and personally accoutred with warlike swords and pistols  the picturesque crowds and the arabs and the horsemen in the sunshine the noble old convent and the greybearded priests with their feast and the church and its pictures and columns and incense the wide brown hills spreading round the village with the accidents of the roadflocks and shepherds wells and funerals and cameltrainshave left on my mind a brilliant romantic and cheerful picture  but you dear m without visiting the place have imagined one far finer and bethlehem where the holy child was born and the angels sang glory to god in the highest and on earth peace and goodwill towards men is the most sacred and beautiful spot in the earth to you   by far the most comfortable quarters in jerusalem are those of the armenians in their convent of st james  wherever we have been these eastern quakers look grave and jolly and sleek  their convent at mount zion is big enough to contain two or three thousand of their faithful and their church is ornamented by the most rich and hideous gifts ever devised by uncouth piety  instead of a bell the fat monks of the convent beat huge noises on a board and drub the faithful in to prayers  i never saw men more lazy and rosy than these reverend fathers kneeling in their comfortable matted church or sitting in easy devotion  pictures images gilding tinsel wax candles twinkle all over the place and ten thousand ostrichs eggs or any lesser number you may allot dangle from the vaulted ceiling  there were great numbers of people at worship in this gorgeous church  they went on their knees kissing the walls with much fervour and paying reverence to the most precious relic of the conventthe chair of st james their patron the first bishop of jerusalem  the chair pointed out with greatest pride in the church of the latin convent is that shabby red damask one appropriated to the french consulthe representative of the king of that nationand the protection which it has from time immemorial accorded to the christians of the latin rite in syria  all french writers and travellers speak of this protection with delightful complacency consult the french books of travel on the subject and any frenchman whom you may meet  he says la france monsieur de tous les temps protege les chretiens dorient and the little fellow looks round the church with a sweep of the arm and protects it accordingly  it is bon ton for them to go in processions and you see them on such errands marching with long candles as gravely as may be  but i have never been able to edify myself with their devotion and the religious outpourings of lamartine and chateaubriand which we have all been reading a propos of the journey we are to make have inspired me with an emotion anything but respectful  voyez comme m de chateaubriand prie dieu the viscounts eloquence seems always to say  there is a sanctified grimace about the little french pilgrim which it is very difficult to contemplate gravely  the pictures images and ornaments of the principal latin convent are quite mean and poor compared to the wealth of the armenians the convent is spacious but squalid  many hopping and crawling plagues are said to attack the skins of pilgrims who sleep there it is laid out in courts and galleries the mouldy doors of which are decorated with twopenny pictures of favourite saints and martyrs and so great is the shabbiness and laziness that you might fancy yourself in a convent in italy  brownclad fathers dirty bearded and sallow go gliding about the corridors  the relic manufactory before mentioned carries on a considerable business and despatches bales of shells crosses and beads to believers in europe  these constitute the chief revenue of the convent now  la france is no longer the most christian kingdom and her protection of the latins is not good for much since charles x was expelled and spain which used likewise to be generous on occasions the gifts arms candlesticks baldaquins of the spanish sovereigns figure pretty frequently in the various latin chapels has been stingy since the late disturbances the spoliation of the clergy c  after we had been taken to see the humble curiosities of the place the prior treated us in his wooden parlour with little glasses of pink rosolio brought with many bows and genuflexions by his reverence the convent butler  after this community of holy men the most important perhaps is the american convent a protestant congregation of independents chiefly who deliver tracts propose to make converts have meetings of their own and also swell the little congregation that attends the anglican service  i have mentioned our fellow traveller the consulgeneral for syria of the united states  he was a tradesman who had made a considerable fortune and lived at a countryhouse in comfortable retirement  but his opinion is that the prophecies of scripture are about to be accomplished that the day of the return of the jews is at hand and the glorification of the restored jerusalem  he is to witness thishe and a favourite dove with which he travels and he forsook home and comfortable countryhouse in order to make this journey  he has no other knowledge of syria but what he derives from the prophecy and this as he takes the office gratis has been considered a sufficient reason for his appointment by the united states government  as soon as he arrived he sent and demanded an interview with the pasha explained to him his interpretation of the apocalypse in which he has discovered that the five powers and america are about to intervene in syrian affairs and the infallible return of the jews to palestine  the news must have astonished the lieutenant of the sublime porte and since the days of the kingdom of munster under his anabaptist majesty john of leyden i doubt whether any government has received or appointed so queer an ambassador  the kind worthy simple man took me to his temporary consulatehouse at the american missionary establishment and under pretence of treating me to white wine expounded his ideas talked of futurity as he would about an article in the times and had no more doubt of seeing a divine kingdom established in jerusalem than you that there would be a levee next spring at st jamess  the little room in which we sat was padded with missionary tracts but i heard of scarce any convertsnot more than are made by our own episcopal establishment  but if the latters religious victories are small and very few people are induced by the american tracts and the english preaching and catechising to forsake their own manner of worshipping the divine being in order to follow ours yet surely our religious colony of men and women cant fail to do good by the sheer force of good example pure life and kind offices  the ladies of the mission have numbers of clients of all persuasions in the town to whom they extend their charities  each of their houses is a model of neatness and a dispensary of gentle kindnesses and the ecclesiastics have formed a modest centre of civilisation in the place  a dreary joke was made in the house of commons about bishop alexander and the bishopess his lady and the bishoplings his numerous children who were said to have scandalised the people of jerusalem  that sneer evidently came from the latins and greeks for what could the jews and turks care because an english clergyman had a wife and children as their own priests have  there was no sort of ill will exhibited towards them as far as i could learn and i saw the bishops children riding about the town as safely as they could about hyde park  all europeans indeed seemed to me to be received with forbearance and almost courtesy within the walls  as i was going about making sketches the people would look on very goodhumouredly without offering the least interruption nay two or three were quite ready to stand still for such an humble portrait as my pencil could make of them and the sketch done it was passed from one person to another each making his comments and signifying a very polite approval  here are a pair of them 2 fath allah and ameenut daoodee his father horsedealers by trade who came and sat with us at the inn and smoked pipes the sun being down while the original of the above masterpiece was made  with the arabs outside the walls however and the freshly arriving country people this politeness was not so much exhibited  there was a certain tattooed girl with black eyes and huge silver earrings and a chin delicately picked out with blue who formed one of a group of women outside the great convent whose likeness i longed to carry off there was a woman with a little child with wondering eyes drawing water at the pool of siloam in such an attitude and dress as rebecca may have had when isaacs lieutenant asked her for drink both of these parties standing still for half a minute at the next cried out for backsheesh  and not content with the five piastres which i gave them individually screamed out for more and summoned their friends who screamed out backsheesh too  i was pursued into the convent by a dozen howling women calling for pay barring the door against them to the astonishment of the worthy papa who kept it and at miriams well the women were joined by a man with a large stick who backed their petition  but him we could afford to laugh at for we were two and had sticks likewise  in the village of siloam i would not recommend the artist to loiter  a colony of ruffians inhabit the dismal place who have guns as well as sticks at need  their dogs howl after the strangers as they pass through and over the parapets of their walls you are saluted by the scowls of a villanous set of countenances that it is not good to see with one pair of eyes they shot a man at midday at a few hundred yards from the gates while we were at jerusalem and no notice was taken of the murder hordes of arab robbers infest the neighbourhood of the city with the sheikhs of whom travellers make terms when minded to pursue their journey  i never could understand why the walls stopped these warriors if they had a mind to plunder the city for there are but a hundred and fifty men in the garrison to man the long lonely lines of defence   i have seen only in titians pictures those magnificent purple shadows in which the hills round about lay as the dawn rose faintly behind them and we looked at olivet for the last time from our terrace where we were awaiting the arrival of the horses that were to carry us to jaffa  a yellow moon was still blazing in the midst of countless brilliant stars overhead the nakedness and misery of the surrounding city were hidden in that beautiful rosy atmosphere of mingling night and dawn  the city never looked so noble the mosques domes and minarets rising up into the calm starlit sky  by the gate of bethlehem there stands one palmtree and a house with three domes  put these and the huge old gothic gate as a background dark against the yellowing eastern sky  the foreground is a deep grey  as you look into it dark forms of horsemen come out of the twilight  now there come lanterns more horsemen a litter with mules a crowd of arab horseboys and dealers accompanying their beasts to the gate all the members of our party come up by twos and threes and at last the great gate opens just before sunrise and we get into the grey plains  oh the luxury of an english saddle  an english servant of one of the gentlemen of the mission procured it for me on the back of a little mare which as i am a light weight did not turn a hair in the course of the days marchand after we got quit of the ugly stony clattering mountainous abou gosh district into the fair undulating plain which stretches to ramleh carried me into the town at a pleasant handgallop  a negro of preternatural ugliness in a yellow gown with a crimson handkerchief streaming over his head digging his shovel spurs into the lean animal he rode and driving three others beforeswaying backwards and forwards on his horse now embracing his ears and now almost under his belly screaming yallah with the most frightful shrieks and singing country songsgalloped along ahead of me  i acquired one of his poems pretty well and could imitate his shriek accurately but i shall not have the pleasure of singing it to you in england i had forgotten the delightful dissonance two days after both the negros and that of a real arab minstrel a donkeydriver accompanying our baggage who sang and grinned with the most amusing goodhumour  we halted in the middle of the day in a little wood of olive trees which forms almost the only shelter between jaffa and jerusalem except that afforded by the orchards in the odious village of abou gosh through which we went at a double quick pace under the olives or up in the branches some of our friends took a siesta  i have a sketch of four of them so employed  two of them were dead within a month of the fatal syrian fever  but we did not know how near fate was to us then  fires were lighted and fowls and eggs divided and tea and coffee served round in tin panikins and here we lighted pipes and smoked and laughed at our ease  i believe everybody was happy to be out of jerusalem  the impression i have of it now is of ten days passed in a fever  we all found quarters in the greek convent at ramleh where the monks served us a supper on a terrace in a pleasant sunset a beautiful and cheerful landscape stretching around the land in graceful undulations the towers and mosques rosy in the sunset with no lack of verdure especially of graceful palms  jaffa was nine miles off  as we rode all the morning we had been accompanied by the smoke of our steamer twenty miles off at sea  the convent is a huge caravanserai only three or four monks dwell in it the ghostly hotelkeepers of the place  the horses were tied up and fed in the courtyard into which we rode above were the livingrooms where there is accommodation not only for an unlimited number of pilgrims but for a vast and innumerable host of hopping and crawling things who usually persist in partaking of the travellers bed  let all thinskinned travellers in the east be warned on no account to travel without the admirable invention described in mr fellowess book nay possibly invented by that enterprising and learned traveller  you make a sack of calico or linen big enough for the body appended to which is a closed chimney of muslin stretched out by cane hoops and fastened up to a beam or against the wall  you keep a sharp eye to see that no flea or bug is on the lookout and when assured of this you pop into the bag tightly closing the orifice after you  this admirable bugdisappointer i tried at ramleh and had the only undisturbed nights rest i enjoyed in the east  to be sure it was a short night for our party were stirring at one oclock and those who got up insisted on talking and keeping awake those who inclined to sleep  but i shall never forget the terror inspired in my mind being shut up in the bugdisappointer when a facetious laybrother of the convent fell upon me and began tickling me  i never had the courage again to try the antiflea contrivance preferring the friskiness of those animals to the sports of such a greasy grinning wag as my friend at ramleh  in the morning and long before sunrise our little caravan was in marching order again  we went out with lanterns and shouts of yallah through the narrow streets and issued into the plain where though there was no moon there were blazing stars shining steadily overhead  they become friends to a man who travels especially under the clear eastern sky whence they look down as if protecting you solemn yellow and refulgent  they seem nearer to you than in europe larger and more awful  so we rode on till the dawn rose and jaffa came in view  the friendly ship was lying out in waiting for us the horses were given up to their owners and in the midst of a crowd of naked beggars and a perfect storm of curses and yells for backsheesh our party got into their boats and to the ship where we were welcomed by the very best captain that ever sailed upon this maritime globe namely captain samuel lewis of the peninsular and oriental companys service    chapter xiv  from jaffa to alexandria    from the providors logbook  bill of fare october 12th  mulligatawny soup salt fish and egg sauce roast haunch of mutton boiled shoulder and onion sauce boiled beef roast fowls pillau ditto ham haricot mutton curry and rice  cabbage french beans boiled potatoes baked ditto damson tart  rice puddings currant ditto  currant fritters  we were just at the ports mouthand could see the towers and buildings of alexandria rising purple against the sunset when the report of a gun came booming over the calm golden water and we heard with much mortification that we had no chance of getting pratique that night  already the ungrateful passengers had begun to tire of the shipthough in our absence in syria it had been carefully cleansed and purified though it was cleared of the swarming jews who had infested the decks all the way from constantinople and though we had been feasting and carousing in the manner described above  but very early next morning we bore into the harbour busy with a great quantity of craft  we passed huge black hulks of mouldering menofwar from the sterns of which trailed the dirty red flag with the star and crescent boats manned with redcapped seamen and captains and steersmen in beards and tarbooshes passed continually among these old hulks the rowers bending to their oars so that at each stroke they disappeared bodily in the boat besides these there was a large fleet of country ships and stars and stripes and tricolours and union jacks and many active steamers of the french and english companies shooting in and out of the harbour or moored in the briny waters  the ship of our company the oriental lay therea palace upon the brine and some of the pashas steamvessels likewise looking very like christian boats but it was queer to look at some unintelligible turkish flourish painted on the stern and the longtailed arabian hieroglyphics gilt on the paddleboxes  our dear friend and comrade of beyrout if we may be permitted to call her so hms trump was in the harbour and the captain of that gallant ship coming to greet us drove some of us on shore in his gig  i had been preparing myself overnight by the help of a cigar and a moonlight contemplation on deck for sensations on landing in egypt  i was ready to yield myself up with solemnity to the mystic grandeur of the scene of initiation  pompeys pillar must stand like a mountain in a yellow plain surrounded by a grove of obelisks as tall as palmtrees  placid sphinxes brooding oer the nilemighty memnonian countenances calmhad revealed egypt to me in a sonnet of tennysons and i was ready to gaze on it with pyramidal wonder and hieroglyphic awe  the landing quay at alexandria is like the dockyard quay at portsmouth  with a few score of brown faces scattered among the population  there are slopsellers dealers in marinestores bottledporter shops seamen lolling about flys and cabs are plying for hire and a yelling chorus of donkeyboys shrieking ride sirdonkey siri say sir in excellent english dispel all romantic notions  the placid sphinxes brooding oer the nile disappeared with that shriek of the donkeyboys  you might be as well impressed with wapping as with your first step on egyptian soil  the riding of a donkey is after all not a dignified occupation a man resists the offer at first somehow as an indignity  how is that poor little redsaddled longeared creature to carry you is there to be one for you and another for your legs  natives and europeans of all sizes pass by it is true mounted upon the same contrivance  i waited until i got into a very private spot where nobody could see me and then ascendedwhy not say descended at onceon the poor little animal  instead of being crushed at once as perhaps the rider expected it darted forward quite briskly and cheerfully at six or seven miles an hour requiring no spur or admonitive to haste except the shrieking of the little egyptian gamin who ran along by asinuss side  the character of the houses by which you pass is scarcely eastern at all  the streets are busy with a motley population of jews and armenians slavedrivinglooking europeans largebreeched greeks and wellshaven buxom merchants looking as trim and fat as those on the bourse or on change only among the natives the stranger cant fail to remark as the caliph did of the calenders in the arabian nights that so many of them have only one eye  it is the horrid ophthalmia which has played such frightful ravages with them  you see children sitting in the doorways their eyes completely closed up with the green sickening sore and the flies feeding on them  five or six minutes of the donkeyride brings you to the frank quarter and the handsome broad street like a street of marseilles where the principal hotels and merchants houses are to be found and where the consuls have their houses and hoist their flags  the palace of the french consulgeneral makes the grandest show in the street and presents a great contrast to the humble abode of the english representative who protects his fellowcountrymen from a second floor  but that alexandrian twopairfront of a consulate was more welcome and cheering than a palace to most of us  for there lay certain letters with postmarks of home upon them and kindly tidings the first heard for two months though we had seen so many men and cities since that cornhill seemed to be a year off at least with certain persons dwelling more or less in that vicinity  i saw a young oxford man seize his despatches and slink off with several letters written in a tight neat hand and sedulously crossed which any man could see without looking farther were the handiwork of mary ann to whom he is attached  the lawyer received a bundle from his chambers in which his clerk eased his soul regarding the state of snooks v rodgers smith ats tomkins c the statesman had a packet of thick envelopes decorated with that profusion of sealingwax in which official recklessness lavishes the resources of the country  and your humble servant got just one little modest letter containing another written in pencil characters varying in size between one and two inches but how much pleasanter to read than my lords despatch or the clerks account of smith ats tomkinsyes even than the mary ann correspondence    yes my dear madam you will understand me when i say that it was from little polly at home with some confidential news about a cat and the last report of her new doll  it is worth while to have made the journey for this pleasure  to have walked the deck on long nights and have thought of home  you have no leisure to do so in the city  you dont see the heavens shine above you so purely there or the stars so clearly  how after the perusal of the above documents we enjoyed a file of the admirable galignani and what oconnell was doing and the twelve last new victories of the french in algeria and above all six or seven numbers of punch  there might have been an avenue of pompeys pillars within reach and a live sphinx sporting on the banks of the mahmoodieh canal and we would not have stirred to see them until punch had had his interview and galignani was dismissed  the curiosities of alexandria are few and easily seen  we went into the bazaars which have a much more eastern look than the european quarter with its anglogallicitalian inhabitants and babellike civilisation  here and there a large hotel clumsy and whitewashed with oriental trellised windows and a couple of slouching sentinels at the doors in the ugliest composite uniform that ever was seen was pointed out as the residence of some great officer of the pashas court or of one of the numerous children of the egyptian solomon  his highness was in his own palace and was consequently not visible  he was in deep grief and strict retirement  it was at this time that the european newspapers announced that he was about to resign his empire but the quidnuncs of alexandria hinted that a loveaffair in which the old potentate had engaged with senile extravagance and the effects of a potion of hachisch or some deleterious drug with which he was in the habit of intoxicating himself had brought on that languor and desperate weariness of life and governing into which the venerable prince was plunged  before three days were over however the fit had left him and he determined to live and reign a little longer a very few days afterwards several of our party were presented to him at cairo and found the great egyptian ruler perfectly convalescent  this and the opera and the quarrels of the two prime donne and the beauty of one of them formed the chief subjects of conversation and i had this important news in the shop of a certain barber in the town who conveyed it in a language composed of french spanish and italian and with a volubility quite worthy of a barber of gil blas  then we went to see the famous obelisk presented by mehemet ali to the british government who have not shown a particular alacrity to accept this ponderous present  the huge shaft lies on the ground prostrate and desecrated by all sorts of abominations  children were sprawling about attracted by the dirt there  arabs negroes and donkeyboys were passing quite indifferent by the fallen monster of a stoneas indifferent as the british government who dont care for recording the glorious termination of their egyptian campaign of 1801  if our country takes the compliment so coolly surely it would be disloyal upon our parts to be more enthusiastic i wish they would offer the trafalgar square pillar to the egyptians and that both of the huge ugly monsters were lying in the dirt there side by side  pompeys pillar is by no means so big as the charing cross trophy this venerable column has not escaped illtreatment either numberless ships companies travelling cockneys c have affixed their rude marks upon it  some daring ruffian even painted the name of warrens blacking upon it effacing other inscriptions one wilkinson says of the second psammetichus  i regret deeply my dear friend that i cannot give you this document respecting a lamented monarch in whose history i know you take such an interest  the best sight i saw in alexandria was a negro holiday which was celebrated outside of the town by a sort of negro village of huts swarming with old lean fat ugly infantine happy faces that nature had smeared with a preparation even more black and durable than that with which psammetichuss base has been polished  every one of these jolly faces was on the broad grin from the dusky mother to the indiarubber child sprawling upon her back and the venerable jetty senior whose wool was as white as that of a sheep in florians pastorals  to these dancers a couple of fellows were playing on a drum and a little banjo  they were singing a chorus which was not only singular and perfectly marked in the rhythm but exceeding sweet in the tune  they danced in a circle and performers came trooping from all quarters who fell into the round and began waggling their heads and waving their left hands and tossing up and down the little thin rods which they each carried and all singing to the very best of their power  i saw the chief eunuch of the grand turk at constantinople pass by here is an accurate likeness of his beautiful features 2but with what a different expression  though he is one of the greatest of the great in the turkish empire ranking with a cabinet minister or lord chamberlain here his fine countenance was clouded with care and savage with ennui  here his black brethren were ragged starving and happy and i need not tell such a fine moralist as you are how it is the case in the white as well as the black world that happiness republican leveller who does not care a fig for the fashion often disdains the turrets of kings to pay a visit to the tabernas pauperum  we went the round of the coffeehouses in the evening both the polite european places of resort where you get ices and the french papers and those in the town where greeks turks and general company resort to sit upon uncomfortable chairs and drink wretched muddy coffee and to listen to two or three miserable musicians who keep up a variation of howling for hours together but the pretty song of the niggers had spoiled me for that abominable music    chapter xv  to cairo    we had no need of hiring the country boats which ply on the mahmoodieh canal to atfeh where it joins the nile but were accommodated in one of the peninsular and oriental companys fly boats pretty similar to those narrow irish canal boats in which the enterprising traveller has been carried from dublin to ballinasloe  the present boat was to be sure tugged by a little steamer so that the egyptian canal is ahead of the irish in so far  in natural scenery the one prospect is fully equal to the other it must be confessed that there is nothing to see  in truth there was nothing but this  you saw a muddy bank on each side of you and a blue sky overhead  a few round mudhuts and palmtrees were planted along the line here and there  sometimes we would see on the waterside a woman in a blue robe with her son by her in that tight brown costume with which nature had supplied him  now it was a hat dropped by one of the party into the water a brown arab plunged and disappeared incontinently after the hat reissued from the muddy water prize in hand and ran naked after the little steamer which was by this time far ahead of him his brawny limbs shining in the sun  then we had halfcold fowls and bitter ale  then we had dinnerbitter ale and cold fowls with which incidents the day on the canal passed away as harmlessly as if we had been in a dutch trackschuyt  towards evening we arrived at the town of atfehhalf land half houses half palmtrees with swarms of halfnaked people crowding the rustic shady bazaars and bartering their produce of fruit or manycoloured grain  here the canal came to a check ending abruptly with a large lock  a little fleet of masts and country ships were beyond the lock and it led into the nile  after all it is something to have seen these red waters  it is only low green banks mudhuts and palmclumps with the sun setting red behind them and the great dull sinuous river flashing here and there in the light  but it is the nile the old saturn of a streama divinity yet though younger rivergods have deposed him  hail o venerable father of crocodiles  we were all lost in sentiments of the profoundest awe and respect which we proved by tumbling down into the cabin of the nile steamer that was waiting to receive us and fighting and cheating for sleeping berths  at dawn in the morning we were on deck the character had not altered of the scenery about the river  vast flat stretches of land were on either side recovering from the subsiding inundations  near the mud villages a country ship or two was roosting under the datetrees the landscape everywhere stretching away level and lonely  in the sky in the east was a long streak of greenish light which widened and rose until it grew to be of an opal colour then orange then behold the round red disc of the sun rose flaming up above the horizon  all the water blushed as he got up the deck was all red the steersman gave his helm to another and prostrated himself on the deck and bowed his head eastward and praised the maker of the sun  it shone on his white turban as he was kneeling and gilt up his bronzed face and sent his blue shadow over the glowing deck  the distances which had been grey were now clothed in purple and the broad stream was illuminated  as the sun rose higher the morning blush faded away the sky was cloudless and pale and the river and the surrounding landscape were dazzlingly clear  looking ahead in an hour or two we saw the pyramids  fancy my sensations dear m   two big ones and a little one       there they lay rosy and solemn in the distancethose old majestical mystical familiar edifices  several of us tried to be impressed but breakfast supervening a rush was made at the coffee and cold pies and the sentiment of awe was lost in the scramble for victuals  are we so blases of the world that the greatest marvels in it do not succeed in moving us  have society pall mall clubs and a habit of sneering so withered up our organs of veneration that we can admire no more  my sensation with regard to the pyramids was that i had seen them before  then came a feeling of shame that the view of them should awaken no respect  then i wanted naturally to see whether my neighbours were any more enthusiastic than myselftrinity college oxford was busy with the cold ham downing street was particularly attentive to a bunch of grapes figtree court behaved with decent propriety he is in good practice and of a conservative turn of mind which leads him to respect from principle les faits accomplis  perhaps he remembered that one of them was as big as lincolns inn fields  but the truth is nobody was seriously moved    and why should they because of an exaggeration of bricks ever so enormous  i confess for my part that the pyramids are very big   after a voyage of about thirty hours the steamer brought up at the quay of boulak amidst a small fleet of dirty comfortless cangias in which cottons and merchandise were loading and unloading and a huge noise and bustle on the shore  numerous villas parks and countryhouses had begun to decorate the cairo bank of the stream ere this  residences of the pashas nobles who have had orders to take their pleasure here and beautify the precincts of the capital tall factory chimneys also rise here there are foundries and steamengine manufactories  these and the pleasurehouses stand as trim as soldiers on parade contrasting with the swarming slovenly close tumbledown eastern old town that forms the outport of cairo and was built before the importation of european taste and discipline  here we alighted upon donkeys to the full as brisk as those of alexandria invaluable to timid riders and equal to any weight we had a jerusalem pony race into cairo my animal beating all the rest by many lengths  the entrance to the capital from boulak is very pleasant and picturesqueover a fair road and the wide planted plain of the ezbekieh where are gardens canals fields and avenues of trees and where the great ones of the town come and take their pleasure  we saw many barouches driving about with fat pashas lolling on the cushions statelylooking colonels and doctors taking their ride followed by their orderlies or footmen lines of people taking pipes and sherbet in the coffeehouses and one of the pleasantest sights of alla fine new white building with hotel dorient written up in huge french characters and which indeed is an establishment as large and comfortable as most of the best inns of the south of france  as a hundred christian people or more come from england and from india every fortnight this inn has been built to accommodate a large proportion of them and twice a month at least its sixty rooms are full  the gardens from the windows give a very pleasant and animated view  the hotelgate is besieged by crews of donkeydrivers the noble stately arab women with tawny skins of which a simple robe of floating blue cotton enables you liberally to see the colour and large black eyes come to the well hard by for water  camels are perpetually arriving and setting down their loads  the court is full of bustling dragomans ayahs and children from india and poor old venerable henurses with grey beards and crimson turbans tending little whitefaced babies that have seen the light at dumdum or futtyghur  a coppercoloured barber seated on his hams is shaving a cameldriver at the great inngate  the bells are ringing prodigiously and lieutenant waghorn is bouncing in and out of the courtyard full of business  he only left bombay yesterday morning was seen in the red sea on tuesday is engaged to dinner this afternoon in the regents park and as it is about two minutes since i saw him in the courtyard i make no doubt he is by this time at alexandria or at malta say perhaps at both  il en est capable  if any man can be at two places at once which i dont believe or deny waghorn is he  six oclock bell rings  sixty people sit down to a quasifrench banquet  thirty indian officers in moustaches and jackets ten civilians in ditto and spectacles ten palefaced ladies with ringlets to whom all pay prodigious attention  all the pale ladies drink pale ale which perhaps accounts for it in fact the bombay and suez passengers have just arrived and hence this crowding and bustling and display of military jackets and moustaches and ringlets and beauty  the windows are open and a rush of mosquitoes from the ezbekieh waters attracted by the wax candles adds greatly to the excitement of the scene  there was a little tough old major who persisted in flinging open the windows to admit these volatile creatures with a noble disregard to their stingand the pale ringlets did not seem to heed them either though the delicate shoulders of some of them were bare  all the meat ragouts fricandeaux and roasts which are served round at dinner seem to me to be of the same meat  a black uncertain sort of viand do these fleshpots of egypt contain  but what the meat is no one knew  is it the donkey  the animal is more plentiful than any other in cairo  after dinner the ladies retiring some of us take a mixture of hot water sugar and pale french brandy which is said to be deleterious but is by no means unpalatable  one of the indians offers a bundle of bengal cheroots and we make acquaintance with those honest bearded whitejacketed majors and military commanders finding england here in a french hotel kept by an italian at the city of grand cairo in africa  on retiring to bed you take a towel with you into the sacred interior behind the mosquito curtains  then your duty is having tucked the curtains closely around to flap and bang violently with this towel right and left and backwards and forwards until every mosquito should have been massacred that may have taken refuge within your muslin canopy  do what you will however one of them always escapes the murder and as soon as the candle is out the miscreant begins his infernal droning and trumpeting descends playfully upon your nose and face and so lightly that you dont know that he touches you  but that for a week afterwards you bear about marks of his ferocity you might take the invisible little being to be a creature of fancya mere singing in your ears  this as an account of cairo dear m you will probably be disposed to consider as incomplete  the fact is i have seen nothing else as yet  i have peered into no harems  the magicians proved to be humbugs have been bastinadoed out of town  the dancinggirls those lovely alme of whom i had hoped to be able to give a glowing and elegant though strictly moral description have been whipped into upper egypt and as you are saying in your mind well it isnt a good description of cairo  you are perfectly right  it is england in egypt  i like to see her there with her pluck enterprise manliness bitter ale and harvey sauce  wherever they come they stay and prosper  from the summit of yonder pyramids forty centuries may look down on them if they are minded and i say those venerable daughters of time ought to be better pleased by the examination than by regarding the french bayonets and general bonaparte member of the institute fifty years ago running about with sabre and pigtail  wonders he did to be sure and then ran away leaving kleber to be murdered in the lurcha few hundred yards from the spot where these disquisitions are written  but what are his wonders compared to waghorn  nap massacred the mamelukes at the pyramids  wag has conquered the pyramids themselves dragged the unwieldy structures a month nearer england than they were and brought the country along with them  all the trophies and captives that ever were brought to roman triumph were not so enormous and wonderful as this  all the heads that napoleon ever caused to be struck off as george cruikshank says would not elevate him a monument as big be ours the trophies of peace  o my country  o waghorn  hae tibi erunt artes  when i go to the pyramids i will sacrifice in your name and pour out libations of bitter ale and harvey sauce in your honour  one of the noblest views in the world is to be seen from the citadel which we ascended today  you see the city stretching beneath it with a thousand minarets and mosquesthe great river curling through the green plains studded with innumerable villages  the pyramids are beyond brilliantly distinct and the lines and fortifications of the height and the arsenal lying below  gazing down the guide does not fail to point out the famous mameluke leap by which one of the corps escaped death at the time that his highness the pasha arranged the general massacre of the body  the venerable patriarchs harem is close by where he received with much distinction some of the members of our party  we were allowed to pass very close to the sacred precincts and saw a comfortable white european building approached by flights of steps and flanked by pretty gardens  police and lawcourts were here also as i understood but it was not the time of the egyptian assizes  it would have been pleasant otherwise to see the chief cadi in his hall of justice and painful though instructive to behold the immediate application of the bastinado  the great lion of the place is a new mosque which mehemet ali is constructing very leisurely  it is built of alabaster of a fair white with a delicate blushing tinge but the ornaments are europeanthe noble fantastic beautiful oriental art is forgotten  the old mosques of the city of which i entered two and looked at many are a thousand times more beautiful  their variety of ornament is astonishingthe difference in the shapes of the domes the beautiful fancies and caprices in the forms of the minarets which violate the rules of proportion with the most happy daring grace must have struck every architect who has seen them  as you go through the streets these architectural beauties keep the eye continually charmed  now it is a marble fountain with its arabesque and carved overhanging roof which you can look at with as much pleasure as an antique gem so neat and brilliant is the execution of it then you come to the arched entrance to a mosque which shoots up likelike whatlike the most beautiful pirouette by taglioni let us say  this architecture is not sublimely beautiful perfect loveliness and calm like that which was revealed to us at the parthenon and in comparison of which the pantheon and colosseum are vulgar and coarse mere broadshouldered titans before ambrosial jove but these fantastic spires and cupolas and galleries excite amuse tickle the imagination so to speak and perpetually fascinate the eye  there were very few believers in the famous mosque of sultan hassan when we visited it except the moslemitish beadle who was on the lookout for backsheesh just like his brother officer in an english cathedral and who making us put on straw slippers so as not to pollute the sacred pavement of the place conducted us through it  it is stupendously light and airy the best specimens of norman art that i have seen and surely the crusaders must have carried home the models of these heathenish temples in their eyes do not exceed its noble grace and simplicity  the mystics make discoveries at home that the gothic architecture is catholicism carved in stone in which case and if architectural beauty is a criterion or expression of religion what a dismal barbarous creed must that expressed by the bethesda meetinghouse and independent chapels beif as they would gravely hint because gothic architecture is beautiful catholicism is therefore lovely and rightwhy mahometanism must have been right and lovely too once  never did a creed possess temples more elegant as elegant as the cathedral at rouen or the baptistery at pisa  but it is changed now  there was nobody at prayers only the official beadles and the supernumerary guides who came for backsheesh  faith hath degenerated  accordingly they cant build these mosques or invent these perfect forms any more  witness the tawdry incompleteness and vulgarity of the pashas new temple and the woful failures among the very late edifices in constantinople  however they still make pilgrimages to mecca in great force  the mosque of hassan is hard by the green plain on which the hag encamps before it sets forth annually on its pious peregrination it was not yet its time but i saw in the bazaars that redoubted dervish who is the master of the hagthe leader of every procession accompanying the sacred camel and a personage almost as much respected as mr oconnell in ireland  this fellow lives by alms i mean the head of the hag  winter and summer he wears no clothes but a thin and scanty white shirt  he wields a staff and stalks along scowling and barefoot  his immense shock of black hair streams behind him and his brown brawny body is curled over with black hair like a savage man this saint has the largest harem in the town he is said to be enormously rich by the contributions he has levied and is so adored for his holiness by the infatuated folk that when he returns from the hag which he does on horseback the chief mollahs going out to meet him and escort him home in state along the ezbekieh road the people fling themselves down under the horses feet eager to be trampled upon and killed and confident of heaven if the great hadjis horse will but kick them into it  was it my fault if i thought of hadji daniel and the believers in him  there was no dervish of repute on the plain when i passed only one poor wild fellow who was dancing with glaring eyes and grizzled beard rather to the contempt of the bystanders as i thought who by no means put coppers into his extended bowl  on this poor devils head there was a poorer devil stilla live cock entirely plucked but ornamented with some bits of ragged tape and scarlet and tinsel the most horribly grotesque and miserable object i ever saw  a little way from him there was a sort of play going ona clown and a knowing one like widdicombe and the clown with usthe buffoon answering with blundering responses which made all the audience shout with laughter but the only joke which was translated to me would make you do anything but laugh and shall therefore never be revealed by these lips  all their humour my dragoman tells me is of this questionable sort and a young egyptian gentleman son of a pasha whom i subsequently met at malta confirmed the statement and gave a detail of the practices of private life which was anything but edifying  the great aim of woman he said in the muchmaligned orient is to administer to the brutality of her lord her merit is in knowing how to vary the beasts pleasures  he could give us no idea he said of the wit of the egyptian women and their skill in double entendre nor i presume did we lose much by our ignorance  what i would urge humbly however is thisdo not let us be led away by german writers and aesthetics semilassoisms hahnhahnisms and the like the life of the east is a life of brutes  the much maligned orient i am confident has not been maligned near enough for the good reason that none of us can tell the amount of horrible sensuality practised there  beyond the jackpudding rascal and his audience there was on the green a spot on which was pointed out to me a mark as of blood that morning the blood had spouted from the neck of an arnaoot soldier who had been executed for murder  these arnaoots are the curse and terror of the citizens  their camps are without the city but they are always brawling or drunken or murdering within in spite of the rigid law which is applied to them and which brings one or more of the scoundrels to death almost every week  some of our party had seen this fellow borne by the hotel the day before in the midst of a crowd of soldiers who had apprehended him  the man was still formidable to his score of captors  his clothes had been torn off his limbs were bound with cords but he was struggling frantically to get free and my informant described the figure and appearance of the naked bound writhing savage as quite a model of beauty  walking in the street this fellow had just before been struck by the looks of a woman who was passing and laid hands on her  she ran away and he pursued her  she ran into the policebarrack which was luckily hard by but the arnaoot was nothing daunted and followed into the midst of the police  one of them tried to stop him  the arnaoot pulled out a pistol and shot the policeman dead he cut down three or four more before he was secured  he knew his inevitable end must be death  that he could not seize upon the woman  that he could not hope to resist half a regiment of armed soldiers  yet his instinct of lust and murder was too strong and so he had his head taken off quite calmly this morning many of his comrades attending their brothers last moments  he cared not the least about dying and knelt down and had his head off as coolly as if he were looking on at the same ceremony performed on another  when the head was off and the blood was spouting on the ground a married woman who had no children came forward very eagerly out of the crowd to smear herself with itthe application of criminals blood being considered a very favourable medicine for women afflicted with barrennessso she indulged in this remedy  but one of the arnaoots standing near said what you like blood do you or words to that effect  lets see how yours mixes with my comrades  and thereupon taking out a pistol he shot the woman in the midst of the crowd and the guards who were attending the execution was seized of course by the latter and no doubt tomorrow morning will have his head off too  it would be a good chapter to writethe death of the arnaootbut i shant go seeing one man hanged is quite enough in the course of a life  jy ai ete as the frenchman said of hunting  these arnaoots are the terror of the town  they seized hold of an englishman the other day and were very nearly pistolling him last week one of them murdered a shopkeeper at boulak who refused to sell him a watermelon at a price which he the soldier fixed upon it  so for the matter of threehalfpence he killed the shopkeeper and had his own rascally head chopped off universally regretted by his friends  why i wonder does not his highness the pasha invite the arnaoots to a dejeuner at the citadel as he did the mamelukes and serve them up the same sort of breakfast  the walls are considerably heightened since emin bey and his horse leapt them and it is probable that not one of them would escape  this sort of pistol practice is common enough here it would appear and not among the arnaoots merely but the higher orders thus a short time since one of his highnesss grandsons whom i shall call bluebeard pasha lest a revelation of the name of the said pasha might interrupt our good relations with his country one of the young pashas being rather backward in his education and anxious to learn mathematics and the elegant deportment of civilised life sent to england for a tutor  i have heard he was a cambridge man and had learned both algebra and politeness under the reverend doctor whizzle ofcollege  one day when mr macwhirter ba was walking in shoubra gardens with his highness the young bluebeard pasha inducting him into the usages of polished society and favouring him with reminiscences of trumpington there came up a poor fellah who flung himself at the feet of young bluebeard and calling for justice in a loud and pathetic voice and holding out a petition besought his highness to cast a gracious eye upon the same and see that his slave had justice done him  bluebeard pasha was so deeply engaged and interested by his respected tutors conversation that he told the poor fellah to go to the deuce and resumed the discourse which his illtimed outcry for justice had interrupted  but the unlucky wight of a fellah was pushed by his evil destiny and thought he would make yet another application  so he took a short cut down one of the garden lanes and as the prince and the reverend mr macwhirter his tutor came along once more engaged in pleasant disquisition behold the fellah was once more in their way kneeling at the august bluebeards feet yelling out for justice as before and thrusting his petition into the royal face  when the princes conversation was thus interrupted a second time his royal patience and clemency were at an end  man said he once before i bade thee not to pester me with thy clamour and lo you have disobeyed metake the consequences of disobedience to a prince and thy blood be upon thine own head  so saying he drew out a pistol and blew out the brains of that fellah so that he never bawled out for justice any more  the reverend mr macwhirter was astonished at this sudden mode of proceeding  gracious prince said he we do not shoot an undergraduate at cambridge even for walking over a college grass plotlet me suggest to your royal highness that this method of ridding yourself of a poor devils importunities is such as we should consider abrupt and almost cruel in europe  let me beg you to moderate your royal impetuosity for the future and as your highnesss tutor entreat you to be a little less prodigal of your powder and shot  o mollah said his highness here interrupting his governors affectionate appealyou are good to talk about trumpington and the pons asinorum but if you interfere with the course of justice in any way or prevent me from shooting any dog of an arab who snarls at my heels i have another pistol and by the beard of the prophet a bullet for you too  so saying he pulled out the weapon with such a terrific and significant glance at the reverend mr macwhirter that that gentleman wished himself back in his combination room again and is by this time let us hope safely housed there  another facetious anecdote the last of those i had from a well informed gentleman residing at cairo whose name as many copies of this book that is to be will be in the circulating libraries there i cannot for obvious reasons mention  the revenues of the country come into the august treasury through the means of farmers to whom the districts are let out and who are personally answerable for their quota of the taxation  this practice involves an intolerable deal of tyranny and extortion on the part of those engaged to levy the taxes and creates a corresponding duplicity among the fellahs who are not only wretchedly poor among themselves but whose object is to appear still more poor and guard their money from their rapacious overseers  thus the orient is much maligned but everybody cheats there  that is a melancholy fact  the pasha robs and cheats the merchants knows that the overseer robs him and bides his time until he makes him disgorge by the application of the tremendous bastinado the overseer robs and squeezes the labourer and the povertystricken devil cheats and robs in return and so the government moves in a happy cycle of roguery  deputations from the fellahs and peasants come perpetually before the august presence to complain of the cruelty and exactions of the chiefs set over them  but as it is known that the arab never will pay without the bastinado their complaints for the most part meet with but little attention  his highnesss treasury must be filled and his officers supported in their authority  however there was one village of which the complaints were so pathetic and the inhabitants so supremely wretched that the royal indignation was moved at their story and the chief of the village skinflint beg was called to give an account of himself at cairo  when he came before the presence mehemet ali reproached him with his horrible cruelty and exactions asked him how he dared to treat his faithful and beloved subjects in this way and threatened him with disgrace and the utter confiscation of his property for thus having reduced a district to ruin  your highness says i have reduced these fellahs to ruin said skinflint beg  what is the best way to confound my enemies and to show you the falsehood of their accusations that i have ruined themto bring more money from them  if i bring you five hundred purses from my village will you acknowledge that my people are not ruined yet  the heart of the pasha was touched  i will have no more bastinadoing o skinflint beg you have tortured these poor people so much and have got so little from them that my royal heart relents for the present and i will have them suffer no farther  give me free leavegive me your highnesss gracious pardon and i will bring the five hundred purses as surely as my name is skinflint beg  i demand only the time to go home the time to return and a few days to stay and i will come back as honestly as regulus pasha did to the carthaginiansi will come back and make my face white before your highness  skinflint begs prayer for a reprieve was granted and he returned to his village where he forthwith called the elders together  o friends he said complaints of our poverty and misery have reached the royal throne and the benevolent heart of the sovereign has been melted by the words that have been poured into his ears my heart yearns towards my people of el muddee he says i have thought how to relieve their miseries  near them lies the fruitful land of el guanee  it is rich in maize and cotton in sesame and barley it is worth a thousand purses but i will let it to my children for seven hundred and i will give over the rest of the profit to them as an alleviation for their affliction  the elders of el muddee knew the great value and fertility of the lands of guanee but they doubted the sincerity of their governor who however dispelled their fears and adroitly quickened their eagerness to close with the proffered bargain  i will myself advance two hundred and fifty purses he said do you take counsel among yourselves and subscribe the other five hundred and when the sum is ready a deputation of you shall carry it to cairo and i will come with my share and we will lay the whole at the feet of his highness  so the greybearded ones of the village advised with one another and those who had been inaccessible to bastinadoes somehow found money at the calling of interest and the sheikh and they and the five hundred purses set off on the road to the capital  when they arrived skinflint beg and the elders of el muddee sought admission to the royal throne and there laid down their purses here is your humble servants contribution said skinflint producing his share and here is the offering of your loyal village of el muddee  did i not before say that enemies and deceivers had maligned me before the august presence pretending that not a piastre was left in my village and that my extortion had entirely denuded the peasantry  see here is proof that there is plenty of money still in el muddee  in twelve hours the elders have subscribed five hundred purses and lay them at the feet of their lord  instead of the bastinado skinflint beg was instantly rewarded with the royal favour and the former mark of attention was bestowed upon the fellahs who had maligned him skinflint beg was promoted to the rank of skinflint bey and his manner of extracting money from his people may be studied with admiration in a part of the united kingdom 3   at the time of the syrian quarrel and when apprehending some general rupture with england the pasha wished to raise the spirit of the fellahs and relever la morale nationale he actually made one of the astonished arabs a colonel  he degraded him three days after peace was concluded  the young egyptian colonel who told me this laughed and enjoyed the joke with the utmost gusto  is it not a shame he said to make me a colonel at threeandtwenty i who have no particular merit and have never seen any service death has since stopped the modest and goodnatured young fellows further promotion  the death ofbey was announced in the french papers a few weeks back  my above kindhearted and agreeable young informant used to discourse in our evenings in the lazaretto at malta very eloquently about the beauty of his wife whom he had left behind him at cairoher brown hair her brilliant complexion and her blue eyes  it is this circassian blood i suppose to which the turkish aristocracy that governs egypt must be indebted for the fairness of their skin  ibrahim pasha riding by in his barouche looked like a bluff jollyfaced english dragoon officer with a grey moustache and red cheeks such as you might see on a fieldday at maidstone  all the numerous officials riding through the town were quite as fair as europeans  we made acquaintance with one dignitary a very jovial and fat pasha the proprietor of the inn i believe who was continually lounging about the ezbekieh garden and who but for a slight jewish cast of countenance might have passed any day for a frenchman  the ladies whom we saw were equally fair that is the very slight particles of the persons of ladies which our lucky eyes were permitted to gaze on  these lovely creatures go through the town by parties of three or four mounted on donkeys and attended by slaves holding on at the crupper to receive the lovely riders lest they should fall and shouting out shrill cries of schmaalek ameenek or however else these words may be pronounced and flogging off the people right and left with the buffalothong  but the dear creatures are even more closely disguised than at constantinople  their bodies are enveloped with a large black silk hood like a cabhead the fashion seemed to be to spread their arms out and give this covering all the amplitude of which it was capable as they leered and ogled you from under their black masks with their big rolling eyes  everybody has big rolling eyes here unless to be sure they lose one of ophthalmia  the arab women are some of the noblest figures i have ever seen  the habit of carrying jars on the head always gives the figure grace and motion and the dress the women wear certainly displays it to full advantage  i have brought a complete one home with me at the service of any lady for a masqued ball it consists of a coarse blue dress of calico open in front and fastened with a horn button  three yards of blue stuff for a veil on the top of the veil a jar to be balanced on the head and a little black strip of silk to fall over the nose and leave the beautiful eyes full liberty to roll and roam  but such a costume not aided by any stays or any other article of dress whatever can be worn only by a very good figure  i suspect it wont be borrowed for many balls next season  the men a tall handsome noble race are treated like dogs  i shall never forget riding through the crowded bazaars my interpreter or laquaisdeplace ahead of me to clear the way when he took his whip and struck it over the shoulders of a man who could not or would not make way  the man turned roundan old venerable handsome face with awfully sad eyes and a beard long and quite grey  he did not make the least complaint but slunk out of the way piteously shaking his shoulder  the sight of that indignity gave me a sickening feeling of disgust  i shouted out to the cursed lackey to hold his hand and forbade him ever in my presence to strike old or young more but everybody is doing it  the whip is in everybodys hands the pashas running footman as he goes bustling through the bazaar the doctors attendant as he soberly threads the crowd on his mare the negro slave who is riding by himself the most insolent of all strikes and slashes about without mercy and you never hear a single complaint  how to describe the beauty of the streets to youthe fantastic splendour the variety of the houses and archways and hanging roofs and balconies and porches the delightful accidents of light and shade which chequer them  the noise the bustle the brilliancy of the crowd the interminable vast bazaars with their barbaric splendour  there is a fortune to be made for painters in cairo and materials for a whole academy of them  i never saw such a variety of architecture of life of picturesqueness of brilliant colour and light and shade  there is a picture in every street and at every bazaar stall  some of these our celebrated watercolour painter mr lewis has produced with admirable truth and exceeding minuteness and beauty but there is room for a hundred to follow him and should any artist by some rare occurrence read this who has leisure and wants to break new ground let him take heart and try a winter in cairo where there is the finest climate and the best subjects for his pencil  a series of studies of negroes alone would form a picturebook delightfully grotesque  mounting my donkey today i took a ride to the desolate noble old buildings outside the city known as the tombs of the caliphs  every one of these edifices with their domes and courts and minarets is strange and beautiful  in one of them there was an encampment of negro slaves newly arrived some scores of them were huddled against the sunny wall two or three of their masters lounged about the court or lay smoking upon carpets  there was one of these fellows a straightnosed ebony faced abyssinian with an expression of such sinister goodhumour in his handsome face as would form a perfect type of villany  he sat leering at me over his carpet as i endeavoured to get a sketch of that incarnate rascality  give me some money said the fellow  i know what you are about  you will sell my picture for money when you get back to europe let me have some of it now but the very rude and humble designer was quite unable to depict such a consummation and perfection of roguery so flung him a cigar which he began to smoke grinning at the giver  i requested the interpreter to inform him by way of assurance of my disinterestedness that his face was a great deal too ugly to be popular in europe and that was the particular reason why i had selected it  then one of his companions got up and showed us his black cattle the male slaves were chiefly lads and the women young well formed and abominably hideous  the dealer pulled her blanket off one of them and bade her stand up which she did with a great deal of shuddering modesty  she was coal black her lips were the size of sausages her eyes large and goodhumoured the hair or wool on this young persons head was curled and greased into a thousand filthy little ringlets  she was evidently the beauty of the flock  they are not unhappy  they look to being bought as many a spinster looks to an establishment in england once in a family they are kindly treated and well clothed and fatten and are the merriest people of the whole community  these were of a much more savage sort than the slaves i had seen in the horrible market at constantinople where i recollect the following young creature2 indeed it is a very fair likeness of her whilst i was looking at her and forming pathetic conjectures regarding her fatesmiling very goodhumouredly and bidding the interpreter ask me to buy her for twenty pounds  from these tombs of the caliphs the desert is before you  it comes up to the walls of the city and stops at some gardens which spring up all of a sudden at its edge  you can see the first station house on the suez road and so from distancepoint to point could ride thither alone without a guide  asinus trotted gallantly into this desert for the space of a quarter of an hour  there we were taking care to keep our back to the city walls in the real actual desert  mounds upon mounds of sand stretching away as far as the eye can see until the dreary prospect fades away in the yellow horizon  i had formed a finer idea of it out of eothen  perhaps in a simoom it may look more awful  the only adventure that befell in this romantic place was that asinuss legs went deep into a hole  whereupon his rider went over his head and bit the sand and measured his length there and upon this hint rose up and rode home again  no doubt one should have gone out for a couple of days marchas it was the desert did not seem to me sublime only uncomfortable  very soon after this perilous adventure the sun likewise dipped into the sand but not to rise therefrom so quickly as i had done and i saw this daily phenomenon of sunset with pleasure for i was engaged at that hour to dine with our old friend j who has established himself here in the most complete oriental fashion  you remember j and what a dandy he was the faultlessness of his boots and cravats the brilliancy of his waistcoats and kidgloves we have seen his splendour in regent street in the tuileries or on the toledo  my first object on arriving here was to find out his house which he has taken far away from the haunts of european civilisation in the arab quarter  it is situated in a cool shady narrow alley so narrow that it was with great difficulty his highness ibrahim pasha happening to pass at the same moment that my little procession of two donkeys mounted by self and valetdeplace with the two donkeyboys our attendants could range ourselves along the wall and leave room for the august cavalcade  his highness having rushed on with an affable and goodhumoured salute to our imposing party we made js quarters and in the first place entered a broad covered court or porch where a swarthy tawny attendant dressed in blue with white turban keeps a perpetual watch  servants in the east lie about all the doors it appears and you clap your hands as they do in the dear old arabian nights to summon them  this servant disappeared through a narrow wicket which he closed after him and went into the inner chambers to ask if his lord would receive us  he came back presently and rising up from my donkey i confided him to his attendant lads more sharp arch and wicked than these donkeyboys dont walk the pave of paris or london and passed the mysterious outer door  first we came into a broad open court with a covered gallery running along one side of it  a camel was reclining on the grass there near him was a gazelle to glad j with his dark blue eye and a numerous brood of hens and chickens who furnish his liberal table  on the opposite side of the covered gallery rose up the walls of his long queer manywindowed manygalleried house there were wooden lattices to those arched windows through the diamonds of one of which i saw two of the most beautiful enormous ogling black eyes in the world looking down upon the interesting stranger  pigeons were flapping and hopping and fluttering and cooing about  happy pigeons you are no doubt fed with crumbs from the hennetipped fingers of zuleika  all this court cheerful in the sunshine cheerful with the astonishing brilliancy of the eyes peering out from the latticebars was as mouldy ancient and ruinousas any gentlemans house in ireland let us say  the paint was peeling off the rickety old carved galleries the arabesques over the windows were chipped and wornthe ancientness of the place rendered it doubly picturesque  i have detained you a long time in the outer court  why the deuce was zuleika there with the beautiful black eyes  hence we passed into a large apartment where there was a fountain and another domestic made his appearance taking me in charge and relieving the tawny porter of the gate  this fellow was clad in blue too with a red sash and a grey beard  he conducted me into a great hall where there was a great large saracenic oriel window he seated me on a divan and stalking off for a moment returned with a long pipe and a brass chafingdish  he blew the coal for the pipe which he motioned me to smoke and left me there with a respectful bow  this delay this mystery of servants that outer court with the camels gazelles and other beautifuleyed things affected me prodigiously all the time he was staying away and while i was examining the strange apartment and its contents my respect and awe for the owner increased vastly  as you will be glad to know how an oriental nobleman such as j undoubtedly is is lodged and garnished let me describe the contents of this hall of audience  it is about forty feet long and eighteen or twenty high  all the ceiling is carved gilt painted and embroidered with arabesques and choice sentences of eastern writing  some mameluke aga or bey whom mehemet ali invited to breakfast and massacred was the proprietor of this mansion once  it has grown dingier but perhaps handsomer since his time  opposite the divan is a great baywindow with a divan likewise round the niche  it looks out upon a garden about the size of fountain court temple surrounded by the tall houses of the quarter  the garden is full of green  a great palmtree springs up in the midst with plentiful shrubberies and a talking fountain  the room beside the divan is furnished with one deal table value five shillings four wooden chairs value six shillings and a couple of mats and carpets  the table and chairs are luxuries imported from europe  the regular oriental dinner is put upon copper trays which are laid upon low stools  hence j effendis house may be said to be much more sumptuously furnished than those of the beys and agas his neighbours  when these things had been examined at leisure j appeared  could it be the exquisite of the europa and the trois freres  a man in a long yellow gown with a long beard somewhat tinged with grey with his head shaved and wearing on it first a white wadded cotton nightcap second a red tarbooshmade his appearance and welcomed me cordially  it was some time as the americans say before i could realise the semillant j of old times  he shuffled off his outer slippers before he curled up on the divan beside me  he clapped his hands and languidly called mustapha mustapha came with more lights pipes and coffee and then we fell to talking about london and i gave him the last news of the comrades in that dear city  as we talked his oriental coolness and languor gave way to british cordiality he was the most amusing companion of the club once more  he has adapted himself outwardly however to the oriental life when he goes abroad he rides a grey horse with red housings and has two servants to walk beside him  he wears a very handsome grave costume of dark blue consisting of an embroidered jacket and gaiters and a pair of trousers which would make a set of dresses for an english family  his beard curls nobly over his chest his damascus scimitar on his thigh  his red cap gives him a venerable and beylike appearance  there is no gewgaw or parade about him as in some of your dandified young agas  i should say that he is a majorgeneral of engineers or a grave officer of state  we and the turkified european who found us at dinner sat smoking in solemn divan  his dinners were excellent they were cooked by a regular egyptian female cook  we had delicate cucumbers stuffed with forcedmeats yellow smoking pilaffs the pride of the oriental cuisine kid and fowls a laboukir and a la pyramide  a number of little savoury plates of legumes of the vegetablemarrow sort  kibobs with an excellent sauce of plums and piquant herbs  we ended the repast with ruby pomegranates pulled to pieces deliciously cool and pleasant  for the meats we certainly ate them with the infidel knife and fork but for the fruit we put our hands into the dish and flicked them into our mouths in what cannot but be the true oriental manner  i asked for lamb and pistachionuts and cream tarts au poivre but js cook did not furnish us with either of those historic dishes  and for drink we had water freshened in the porous little pots of grey clay at whose spout every traveller in the east has sucked delighted  also it must be confessed we drank certain sherbets prepared by the two great rivals hadji hodson and bass beythe bitterest and most delicious of draughts o divine hodson a camels load of thy beer came from beyrout to jerusalem while we were there  how shall i ever forget the joy inspired by one of those foaming cool flasks  we dont know the luxury of thirst in english climes  sedentary men in cities at least have seldom ascertained it but when they travel our countrymen guard against it well  the road between cairo and suez is jonche with sodawater corks  tom thumb and his brothers might track their way across the desert by those landmarks  cairo is magnificently picturesque  it is fine to have palmtrees in your gardens and ride about on a camel but after all i was anxious to know what were the particular excitements of eastern life which detained j who is a townbred man from his natural pleasures and occupations in london where his family dont hear from him where his room is still kept ready at home and his name is on the list of his club and where his neglected sisters tremble to think that their frederick is going about with a great beard and a crooked sword dressed up like an odious turk  in a lark such a costume may be very well but home london a razor your sister to make tea a pair of moderate christian breeches in lieu of those enormous turkish shulwars are vastly more convenient in the long run  what was it that kept him away from these decent and accustomed delights  it couldnt be the black eyes in the balconyupon his honour she was only the black cook who has done the pilaff and stuffed the cucumbers  no it was an indulgence of laziness such as europeans englishmen at least dont know how to enjoy  here he lives like a languid lotuseatera dreamy hazy lazy tobaccofied life  he was away from evening parties he said  he neednt wear white kid gloves or starched neckcloths or read a newspaper  and even this life at cairo was too civilised for him  englishmen passed through old acquaintances would call  the great pleasure of pleasures was life in the desertunder the tents with still more nothing to do than in cairo now smoking now cantering on arabs and no crowd to jostle you solemn contemplations of the stars at night as the camels were picketed and the fires and the pipes were lighted  the nightscene in the city is very striking for its vastness and loneliness  everybody has gone to rest long before ten oclock there are no lights in the enormous buildings only the stars blazing above with their astonishing brilliancy in the blue peaceful sky  your guides carry a couple of little lanterns which redouble the darkness in the solitary echoing street  mysterious people are curled up and sleeping in the porches  a patrol of soldiers passes and hails you  there is a light yet in one mosque where some devotees are at prayers all night and you hear the queerest nasal music proceeding from those pious believers  as you pass the madhouse there is one poor fellow still talking to the moonno sleep for him  he howls and sings there all the nightquite cheerfully however  he has not lost his vanity with his reason  he is a prince in spite of the bars and the straw   what to say about those famous edifices which has not been better said elsewherebut you will not believe that we visited them unless i bring some token from them  here is one 2  that whitecapped lad skipped up the stones with a jug of water in his hand to refresh weary climbers and squatting himself down on the summit was designed as you see  the vast flat landscape stretches behind him the great winding river the purple city with forts and domes and spires the green fields and palm groves and speckled villages the plains still covered with shining inundationsthe landscape stretches far far away until it is lost and mingled in the golden horizon  it is poor work this landscapepainting in print  shelleys two sonnets are the best views that i know of the pyramidsbetter than the reality for a man may lay down the book and in quiet fancy conjure up a picture out of these magnificent words which shant be disturbed by any pettinesses or mean realitiessuch as the swarms of howling beggars who jostle you about the actual place and scream in your ears incessantly and hang on your skirts and bawl for money  the ride to the pyramids is one of the pleasantest possible  in the fall of the year though the sky is almost cloudless above you the sun is not too hot to bear and the landscape refreshed by the subsiding inundations delightfully green and cheerful  we made up a party of some halfdozen from the hotel a lady the kind soda water provider for whose hospitality the most grateful compliments are hereby offered being of the company bent like the rest upon going to the summit of cheops  those who were cautious and wise took a brace of donkeys  at least five times during the route did my animals fall with me causing me to repeat the desert experiment over again but with more success  the space between a moderate pair of legs and the ground is not many inches  by eschewing stirrups the donkey could fall and the rider alight on the ground with the greatest ease and grace  almost everybody was down and up again in the course of the day  we passed through the ezbekieh and by the suburbs of the town where the gardenhouses of the egyptian noblesse are situated to old cairo where a ferryboat took the whole party across the nile with that noise and bawling volubility in which the arab people seem to be so unlike the grave and silent turks and so took our course for some eight or ten miles over the devious tract which the still outlying waters obliged us to pursue  the pyramids were in sight the whole way  one or two thin silvery clouds were hovering over them and casting delicate rosy shadows upon the grand simple old piles  along the track we saw a score of pleasant pictures of eastern life the pashas horses and slaves stood caparisoned at his door at the gate of one countryhouse i am sorry to say the beys gig was in waitinga most unromantic chariot the husbandmen were coming into the city with their strings of donkeys and their loads as they arrived they stopped and sucked at the fountain  a column of redcapped troops passed to drill with slouched gait white uniforms and glittering bayonets  then we had the pictures at the quay  the ferryboat and the redsailed riverboat getting under way and bound up the stream  there was the grain market and the huts on the opposite side and that beautiful woman with silver armlets and a face the colour of gold which the nosebag having been luckily removed beamed solemnly on us europeans like a great yellow harvest moon  the bunches of purpling dates were pending from the branches grey cranes or herons were flying over the cool shining lakes that the rivers overflow had left behind water was gurgling through the courses by the rude locks and barriers formed there and overflowing this patch of ground whilst the neighbouring field was fast budding into the more brilliant fresh green  single dromedaries were stepping along their riders lolling on their hunches low sailboats were lying in the canals now we crossed an old marble bridge now we went one by one over a ridge of slippery earth now we floundered through a small lake of mud  at last at about halfamile off the pyramid we came to a piece of water some twoscore yards broad where a regiment of halfnaked arabs seizing upon each individual of the party bore us off on their shoulders to the laughter of all and the great perplexity of several who every moment expected to be pitched into one of the many holes with which the treacherous lake abounded  it was nothing but joking and laughter bullying of guides shouting for interpreters quarrelling about sixpences  we were acting a farce with the pyramids for the scene  there they rose up enormous under our eyes and the most absurd trivial things were going on under their shadow  the sublime had disappeared vast as they were  do you remember how gulliver lost his awe of the tremendous brobdingnag ladies  every traveller must go through all sorts of chaffering and bargaining and paltry experiences at this spot  you look up the tremendous steps with a score of savage ruffians bellowing round you you hear faint cheers and cries high up and catch sight of little reptiles crawling upwards or having achieved the summit they come hopping and bouncing down again from degree to degreethe cheers and cries swell louder and more disagreeable presently the little jumping thing no bigger than an insect a moment ago bounces down upon you expanded into a panting major of bengal cavalry  he drives off the arabs with an oathwipes his red shining face with his yellow handkerchief drops puffing on the sand in a shady corner where cold fowl and hard eggs are awaiting him and the next minute you see his nose plunged in a foaming beaker of brandy and sodawater  he can say now and for ever he has been up the pyramid  there is nothing sublime in it  you cast your eye once more up that staggering perspective of a zigzag line which ends at the summit and wish you were up thereand down again  forwardsup with you  it must be done  six arabs are behind you who wont let you escape if you would  the importunity of these ruffians is a ludicrous annoyance to which a traveller must submit  for two miles before you reach the pyramids they seize on you and never cease howling  five or six of them pounce upon one victim and never leave him until they have carried him up and down  sometimes they conspire to run a man up the huge stair and bring him halfkilled and fainting to the top  always a couple of brutes insist upon impelling you sternwards from whom the only means to release yourself is to kick out vigorously and unmercifully when the arabs will possibly retreat  the ascent is not the least romantic or difficult or sublime  you walk up a great broken staircase of which some of the steps are four feet high  its not hard only a little high you see no better view from the top than you behold from the bottom only a little more river and sand and ricefield  you jump down the big steps at your leisure but your meditations you must keep for aftertimesthe cursed shrieking of the arabs prevents all thought or leisure   and this is all you have to tell about the pyramids  oh for shame  not a compliment to their age and size  not a big phrase not a rapture  do you mean to say that you had no feeling of respect and awe  try man and build up a monument of words as lofty as they arethey whom imber edax and aquilo impotens and the flight of ages have not been able to destroy   no  be that work for great geniuses great painters great poets  this quill was never made to take such flights it comes of the wing of a humble domestic bird who walks a common who talks a great deal and hisses sometimes who cant fly far or high and drops always very quickly and whose unromantic end is to be laid on a michaelmas or christmas table and there to be discussed for halfanhourlet us hope with some relish      another week saw us in the quarantine harbour at malta where seventeen days of prison and quiet were almost agreeable after the incessant sightseeing of the last two months  in the interval between the 23rd of august and the 27th of october we may boast of having seen more men and cities than most travellers have seen in such a time lisbon cadiz gibraltar malta athens smyrna constantinople jerusalem cairo  i shall have the carpetbag which has visited these places in company with its owner embroidered with their names as military flags are emblazoned and laid up in ordinary to be looked at in old age  with what a number of sights and picturesof novel sensations and lasting and delightful remembrances does a man furnish his mind after such a tour  you forget all the annoyances of travel but the pleasure remains with you through that kind provision of nature by which a man forgets being ill but thinks with joy of getting well and can remember all the minute circumstances of his convalescence  i forget what seasickness is now  though it occupies a woful portion of my journal  there was a time on board when the bitter ale was decidedly muddy and the cook of the ship deserting at constantinople it must be confessed his successor was for some time before he got his hand in  these sorrows have passed away with the soothing influence of time  the pleasures of the voyage remain let us hope as long as life will endure  it was but for a couple of days that those shining columns of the parthenon glowed under the blue sky there but the experience of a life could scarcely impress them more vividly  we saw cadiz only for an hour but the white buildings and the glorious blue sea how clear they are to the memorywith the tang of that gipsys guitar dancing in the marketplace in the midst of the fruit and the beggars and the sunshine  who can forget the bosphorus the brightest and fairest scene in all the world or the towering lines of gibraltar or the great piles of mafra as we rode into the tagus  as i write this and think back comes rhodes with its old towers and artillery and that wonderful atmosphere and that astonishing blue sea which environs the island  the arab riders go pacing over the plains of sharon in the rosy twilight just before sunrise and i can see the ghastly moab mountains with the dead sea gleaming before them from the mosque on the way towards bethany  the black gnarled trees of gethsemane lie at the foot of olivet and the yellow ramparts of the city rise up on the stony hills beyond  but the happiest and best of all the recollections perhaps are those of the hours passed at night on the deck when the stars were shining overhead and the hours were tolled at their time and your thoughts were fixed upon home far away  as the sun rose i once heard the priest from the minaret of constantinople crying out come to prayer with his shrill voice ringing through the clear air and saw at the same hour the arab prostrate himself and pray and the jew rabbi bending over his book and worshipping the maker of turk and jew  sitting at home in london and writing this last line of farewell those figures come back the clearest of all to the memory with the picture too of our ship sailing over the peaceful sabbath sea and our own prayers and services celebrated there  so each in his fashion and after his kind is bowing down and adoring the father who is equally above all  cavil not you brother or sister if your neighbours voice is not like yours only hope that his words are honest as far as they may be and his heart humble and thankful    footnotes  1  saint paul speaking from the areopagus and rebuking these superstitions away yet speaks tenderly to the people before him whose devotions he had marked quotes their poets to bring them to think of the god unknown whom they had ignorantly worshipped and says that the times of this ignorance god winked at but that now it was time to repent  no rebuke can surely be more gentle than this delivered by the upright apostle  2  thackerays drawing is shown at this point in the book  3  at derrynane beg for instance
