48402118	criticisms on the origin of species  the natural history review 1864  1  by thomas h huxley   in the course of the present year several foreign commentaries upon mr darwins great work have made their appearance those who have perused that remarkable chapter of the antiquity of man in which sir charles lyell draws a parallel between the development of species and that of languages will be glad to hear that one of the most eminent philologers of germany professor schleicher has independently published a most instructive and philosophical pamphlet an excellent notice of which is to be found in the reader for february 27th of this year supporting similar views with all the weight of his special knowledge and established authority as a linguist professor haeckel to whom schleicher addresses himself previously took occasion in his splendid monograph on the radiolaria 2 to express his high appreciation of and general concordance with mr darwins views  but the most elaborate criticisms of the origin of species which have appeared are two works of very widely different merit the one by professor kolliker the wellknown anatomist and histologist of wurzburg the other by m flourens perpetual secretary of the french academy of sciences  professor kollikers critical essay upon the darwinian theory is like all that proceeds from the pen of that thoughtful and accomplished writer worthy of the most careful consideration it comprises a brief but clear sketch of darwins views followed by an enumeration of the leading difficulties in the way of their acceptance difficulties which would appear to be insurmountable to professor kolliker inasmuch as he proposes to replace mr darwins theory by one which he terms the theory of heterogeneous generation we shall proceed to consider first the destructive and secondly the constructive portion of the essay  we regret to find ourselves compelled to dissent very widely from many of professor kollikers remarks and from none more thoroughly than from those in which he seeks to define what we may term the philosophical position of darwinism  darwin says professor kolliker is in the fullest sense of the word a teleologist he says quite distinctly first edition pp 199 200 that every particular in the structure of an animal has been created for its benefit and he regards the whole series of animal forms only from this point of view  and again  7 the teleological general conception adopted by darwin is a mistaken one  varieties arise irrespectively of the notion of purpose or of utility according to general laws of nature and may be either useful or hurtful or indifferent  the assumption that an organism exists only on account of some definite end in view and represents something more than the incorporation of a general idea or law implies a onesided conception of the universe assuredly every organ has and every organism fulfils its end but its purpose is not the condition of its existence every organism is also sufficiently perfect for the purpose it serves and in that at least it is useless to seek for a cause of its improvement  it is singular how differently one and the same book will impress different minds that which struck the present writer most forcibly on his first perusal of the origin of species was the conviction that teleology as commonly understood had received its deathblow at mr darwins hands for the teleological argument runs thus an organ or organism a is precisely fitted to perform a function or purpose b therefore it was specially constructed to perform that function in paleys famous illustration the adaptation of all the parts of the watch to the function or purpose of showing the time is held to be evidence that the watch was specially contrived to that end on the ground that the only cause we know of competent to produce such an effect as a watch which shall keep time is a contriving intelligence adapting the means directly to that end  suppose however that any one had been able to show that the watch had not been made directly by any person but that it was the result of the modification of another watch which kept time but poorly and that this again had proceeded from a structure which could hardly be called a watch at allseeing that it had no figures on the dial and the hands were rudimentary and that going back and back in time we came at last to a revolving barrel as the earliest traceable rudiment of the whole fabric and imagine that it had been possible to show that all these changes had resulted first from a tendency of the structure to vary indefinitely and secondly from something in the surrounding world which helped all variations in the direction of an accurate timekeeper and checked all those in other directions then it is obvious that the force of paleys argument would be gone for it would be demonstrated that an apparatus thoroughly well adapted to a particular purpose might be the result of a method of trial and error worked by unintelligent agents as well as of the direct application of the means appropriate to that end by an intelligent agent  now it appears to us that what we have here for illustrations sake supposed to be done with the watch is exactly what the establishment of darwins theory will do for the organic world for the notion that every organism has been created as it is and launched straight at a purpose mr darwin substitutes the conception of something which may fairly be termed a method of trial and error organisms vary incessantly of these variations the few meet with surrounding conditions which suit them and thrive the many are unsuited and become extinguished  according to teleology each organism is like a rifle bullet fired straight at a mark according to darwin organisms are like grapeshot of which one hits something and the rest fall wide  for the teleologist an organism exists because it was made for the conditions in which it is found for the darwinian an organism exists because out of many of its kind it is the only one which has been able to persist in the conditions in which it is found  teleology implies that the organs of every organism are perfect and cannot be improved the darwinian theory simply affirms that they work well enough to enable the organism to hold its own against such competitors as it has met with but admits the possibility of indefinite improvement but an example may bring into clearer light the profound opposition between the ordinary teleological and the darwinian conception  cats catch mice small birds and the like very well teleology tells us that they do so because they were expressly constructed for so doingthat they are perfect mousing apparatuses so perfect and so delicately adjusted that no one of their organs could be altered without the change involving the alteration of all the rest darwinism affirms on the contrary that there was no express construction concerned in the matter but that among the multitudinous variations of the feline stock many of which died out from want of power to resist opposing influences some the cats were better fitted to catch mice than others whence they throve and persisted in proportion to the advantage over their fellows thus offered to them  far from imagining that cats exist in order to catch mice well darwinism supposes that cats exist because they catch mice wellmousing being not the end but the condition of their existence and if the cat type has long persisted as we know it the interpretation of the fact upon darwinian principles would be not that the cats have remained invariable but that such varieties as have incessantly occurred have been on the whole less fitted to get on in the world than the existing stock  if we apprehend the spirit of the origin of species rightly then nothing can be more entirely and absolutely opposed to teleology as it is commonly understood than the darwinian theory so far from being a teleologist in the fullest sense of the word we would deny that he is a teleologist in the ordinary sense at all and we should say that apart from his merits as a naturalist he has rendered a most remarkable service to philosophical thought by enabling the student of nature to recognise to their fullest extent those adaptations to purpose which are so striking in the organic world and which teleology has done good service in keeping before our minds without being false to the fundamental principles of a scientific conception of the universe the apparently diverging teachings of the teleologist and of the morphologist are reconciled by the darwinian hypothesis  but leaving our own impressions of the origin of species and turning to those passages especially cited by professor kolliker we cannot admit that they bear the interpretation he puts upon them darwin if we read him rightly does not affirm that every detail in the structure of an animal has been created for its benefit his words are p 199  the foregoing remarks lead me to say a few words on the protest lately made by some naturalists against the utilitarian doctrine that every detail of structure has been produced for the good of its possessor they believe that very many structures have been created for beauty in the eyes of man or for mere variety this doctrine if true would be absolutely fatal to my theoryyet i fully admit that many structures are of no direct use to their possessor  and after sundry illustrations and qualifications he concludes p 200  hence every detail of structure in every living creature making some little allowance for the direct action of physical conditions may be viewed either as having been of special use to some ancestral form or as being now of special use to the descendants of this formeither directly or indirectly through the complex laws of growth  but it is one thing to say darwinically that every detail observed in an animals structure is of use to it or has been of use to its ancestors and quite another to affirm teleologically that every detail of an animals structure has been created for its benefit on the former hypothesis for example the teeth of the foetal balaena have a meaning on the latter none so far as we are aware there is not a phrase in the origin of species inconsistent with professor kollikers position that varieties arise irrespectively of the notion of purpose or of utility according to general laws of nature and may be either useful or hurtful or indifferent  on the contrary mr darwin writes summary of chap v  our ignorance of the laws of variation is profound not in one case out of a hundred can we pretend to assign any reason why this or that part varies more or less from the same part in the parents the external conditions of life as climate and food etc seem to have induced some slight modifications habit in producing constitutional differences and use in strengthening and disuse in weakening and diminishing organs seem to have been more potent in their effects  and finally as if to prevent all possible misconception mr darwin concludes his chapter on variation with these pregnant words  whatever the cause may be of each slight difference in the offspring from their parentsand a cause for each must existit is the steady accumulation through natural selection of such differences when beneficial to the individual that gives rise to all the more important modifications of structure which the innumerable beings on the face of the earth are enabled to struggle with each other and the best adapted to survive  we have dwelt at length upon this subject because of its great general importance and because we believe that professor kollikers criticisms on this head are based upon a misapprehension of mr darwins viewssubstantially they appear to us to coincide with his own the other objections which professor kolliker enumerates and discusses are the following 3  1 no transitional forms between existing species are known and known varieties whether selected or spontaneous never go so far as to establish new species  to this professor kolliker appears to attach some weight he makes the suggestion that the shortfaced tumbler pigeon may be a pathological product  2 no transitional forms of animals are met with among the organic remains of earlier epochs  upon this professor kolliker remarks that the absence of transitional forms in the fossil world though not necessarily fatal to darwins views weakens his case  3 the struggle for existence does not take place  to this objection urged by pelzeln kolliker very justly attaches no weight  4 a tendency of organisms to give rise to useful varieties and a natural selection do not exist  the varieties which are found arise in consequence of manifold external influences and it is not obvious why they all or partially should be particularly useful each animal suffices for its own ends is perfect of its kind and needs no further development should however a variety be useful and even maintain itself there is no obvious reason why it should change any further the whole conception of the imperfection of organisms and the necessity of their becoming perfected is plainly the weakest side of darwins theory and a pis aller nothbehelf because darwin could think of no other principle by which to explain the metamorphoses which as i also believe have occurred  here again we must venture to dissent completely from professor kollikers conception of mr darwins hypothesis it appears to us to be one of the many peculiar merits of that hypothesis that it involves no belief in a necessary and continual progress of organisms  again mr darwin if we read him aright assumes no special tendency of organisms to give rise to useful varieties and knows nothing of needs of development or necessity of perfection what he says is in substance all organisms vary it is in the highest degree improbable that any given variety should have exactly the same relations to surrounding conditions as the parent stock in that case it is either better fitted when the variation may be called useful or worse fitted to cope with them if better it will tend to supplant the parent stock if worse it will tend to be extinguished by the parent stock  if as is hardly conceivable the new variety is so perfectly adapted to the conditions that no improvement upon it is possibleit will persist because though it does not cease to vary the varieties will be inferior to itself  if as is more probable the new variety is by no means perfectly adapted to its conditions but only fairly well adapted to them it will persist so long as none of the varieties which it throws off are better adapted than itself  on the other hand as soon as it varies in a useful way ie when the variation is such as to adapt it more perfectly to its conditions the fresh variety will tend to supplant the former  so far from a gradual progress towards perfection forming any necessary part of the darwinian creed it appears to us that it is perfectly consistent with indefinite persistence in one estate or with a gradual retrogression suppose for example a return of the glacial epoch and a spread of polar climatal conditions over the whole globe the operation of natural selection under these circumstances would tend on the whole to the weeding out of the higher organisms and the cherishing of the lower forms of life cryptogamic vegetation would have the advantage over phanerogamic hydrozoa over corals crustacea over insecta and amphipoda and isopoda over the higher crustacea cetaceans and seals over the primates the civilization of the esquimaux over that of the european  5 pelzeln has also objected that if the later organisms have proceeded from the earlier the whole developmental series from the simplest to the highest could not now exist in such a case the simpler organisms must have disappeared  to this professor kolliker replies with perfect justice that the conclusion drawn by pelzeln does not really follow from darwins premisses and that if we take the facts of palaeontology as they stand they rather support than oppose darwins theory  6 great weight must be attached to the objection brought forward by huxley otherwise a warm supporter of darwins hypothesis that we know of no varieties which are sterile with one another as is the rule among sharply distinguished animal forms  if darwin is right it must be demonstrated that forms may be produced by selection which like the present sharply distinguished animal forms are infertile when coupled with one another and this has not been done  the weight of this objection is obvious but our ignorance of the conditions of fertility and sterility the want of carefully conducted experiments extending over long series of years and the strange anomalies presented by the results of the crossfertilization of many plants should all as mr darwin has urged be taken into account in considering it  the seventh objection is that we have already discussed supra p 178  the eighth and last stands as follows  8 the developmental theory of darwin is not needed to enable us to understand the regular harmonious progress of the complete series of organic forms from the simpler to the more perfect  the existence of general laws of nature explains this harmony even if we assume that all beings have arisen separately and independent of one another darwin forgets that inorganic nature in which there can be no thought of genetic connexion of forms exhibits the same regular plan the same harmony as the organic world and that to cite only one example there is as much a natural system of minerals as of plants and animals  we do not feel quite sure that we seize professor kollikers meaning here but he appears to suggest that the observation of the general order and harmony which pervade inorganic nature would lead us to anticipate a similar order and harmony in the organic world and this is no doubt true but it by no means follows that the particular order and harmony observed among them should be that which we see surely the stripes of dun horses and the teeth of the foetal balaena are not explained by the existence of general laws of nature mr darwin endeavours to explain the exact order of organic nature which exists not the mere fact that there is some order  and with regard to the existence of a natural system of minerals the obvious reply is that there may be a natural classification of any objectsof stones on a seabeach or of works of art a natural classification being simply an assemblage of objects in groups so as to express their most important and fundamental resemblances and differences no doubt mr darwin believes that those resemblances and differences upon which our natural systems or classifications of animals and plants are based are resemblances and differences which have been produced genetically but we can discover no reason for supposing that he denies the existence of natural classifications of other kinds  and after all is it quite so certain that a genetic relation may not underlie the classification of minerals the inorganic world has not always been what we see it it has certainly had its metamorphoses and very probably a long entwickelungsgeschichte out of a nebular blastema who knows how far that amount of likeness among sets of minerals in virtue of which they are now grouped into families and orders may not be the expression of the common conditions to which that particular patch of nebulous fog which may have been constituted by their atoms and of which they may be in the strictest sense the descendants was subjected  it will be obvious from what has preceded that we do not agree with professor kolliker in thinking the objections which he brings forward so weighty as to be fatal to darwins view but even if the case were otherwise we should be unable to accept the theory of heterogeneous generation which is offered as a substitute that theory is thus stated  the fundamental conception of this hypothesis is that under the influence of a general law of development the germs of organisms produce others different from themselves this might happen 1 by the fecundated ova passing in the course of their development under particular circumstances into higher forms 2 by the primitive and later organisms producing other organisms without fecundation out of germs or eggs parthenogenesis  in favour of this hypothesis professor kolliker adduces the wellknown facts of agamogenesis or alternate generation the extreme dissimilarity of the males and females of many animals and of the males females and neuters of those insects which live in colonies and he defines its relations to the darwinian theory as follows  it is obvious that my hypothesis is apparently very similar to darwins inasmuch as i also consider that the various forms of animals have proceeded directly from one another my hypothesis of the creation of organisms by heterogeneous generation however is distinguished very essentially from darwins by the entire absence of the principle of useful variations and their natural selection and my fundamental conception is this that a great plan of development lies at the foundation of the origin of the whole organic world impelling the simpler forms to more and more complex developments how this law operates what influences determine the development of the eggs and germs and impel them to assume constantly new forms i naturally cannot pretend to say but i can at least adduce the great analogy of the alternation of generations if a bipinnaria a brachialaria a pluteus is competent to produce the echinoderm which is so widely different from it if a hydroid polype can produce the higher medusa if the vermiform trematode nurse can develop within itself the very unlike cercaria it will not appear impossible that the egg or ciliated embryo of a sponge for once under special conditions might become a hydroid polype or the embryo of a medusa an echinoderm  it is obvious from these extracts that professor kollikers hypothesis is based upon the supposed existence of a close analogy between the phenomena of agamogenesis and the production of new species from preexisting ones but is the analogy a real one we think that it is not and by the hypothesis cannot be  for what are the phenomena of agamogenesis stated generally an impregnated egg develops into an asexual form a this gives rise asexually to a second form or forms b more or less different from a b may multiply asexually again in the simpler cases however it does not but acquiring sexual characters produces impregnated eggs from whence a once more arises  no case of agamogenesis is known in which when a differs widely from b it is itself capable of sexual propagation no case whatever is known in which the progeny of b by sexual generation is other than a reproduction of a  but if this be a true statement of the nature of the process of agamogenesis how can it enable us to comprehend the production of new species from already existing ones let us suppose hyaenas to have preceded dogs and to have produced the latter in this way then the hyena will represent a and the dog b the first difficulty that presents itself is that the hyena must be asexual or the process will be wholly without analogy in the world of agamogenesis but passing over this difficulty and supposing a male and female dog to be produced at the same time from the hyaena stock the progeny of the pair if the analogy of the simpler kinds of agamogenesis 4 is to be followed should be a litter not of puppies but of young hyenas for the agamogenetic series is always as we have seen a b a b etc whereas for the production of a new species the series must be a b b b etc the production of new species or genera is the extreme permanent divergence from the primitive stock all known agamogenetic processes on the other hand end in a complete return to the primitive stock how then is the production of new species to be rendered intelligible by the analogy of agamogenesis  the other alternative put by professor kollikerthe passage of fecundated ova in the course of their development into higher formswould if it occurred be merely an extreme case of variation in the darwinian sense greater in degree than but perfectly similar in kind to that which occurred when the wellknown ancon ram was developed from an ordinary ewes ovum indeed we have always thought that mr darwin has unnecessarily hampered himself by adhering so strictly to his favourite natura non facit saltum we greatly suspect that she does make considerable jumps in the way of variation now and then and that these saltations give rise to some of the gaps which appear to exist in the series of known forms  strongly and freely as we have ventured to disagree with professor kolliker we have always done so with regret and we trust without violating that respect which is due not only to his scientific eminence and to the careful study which he has devoted to the subject but to the perfect fairness of his argumentation and the generous appreciation of the worth of mr darwins labours which he always displays it would be satisfactory to be able to say as much for m flourens  but the perpetual secretary of the french academy of sciences deals with mr darwin as the first napoleon would have treated an ideologue and while displaying a painful weakness of logic and shallowness of information assumes a tone of authority which always touches upon the ludicrous and sometimes passes the limits of good breeding  for example p 56  m darwin continue aucune distinction absolue na ete et ne pout etre etablie entre les especes et les varietes je vous ai deja dit que vous vous trompiez une distinction absolue separe les varietes davec les especes  je vous ai deja dit moi m le secretaire perpetuel de lacademie des sciences et vous  qui netes rien pas meme academicien  what do you mean by asserting the contrary being devoid of the blessings of an academy in england we are unaccustomed to see our ablest men treated in this fashion even by a perpetual secretary  or again considering that if there is any one quality of mr darwins work to which friends and foes have alike borne witness it is his candour and fairness in admitting and discussing objections what is to be thought of m flourens assertion that  m darwin ne cite que les auteurs qui partagent ses opinions p 40  once more p 65  enfin louvrage de m darwin a paru on ne peut quetre frappe du talent de lauteur mais que didees obscures que didees fausses quel jargon metaphysique jete mal a propos dans lhistoire naturelle qui tombe dans le galimatias des quelle sort des idees claires des idees justes quel langage pretentieux et vide quelles personifications pueriles et surannees o lucidite o solidite de lesprit francais que devenezvous  obscure ideas metaphysical jargon pretentious and empty language puerile and superannuated personifications mr darwin has many and hot opponents on this side of the channel and in germany but we do not recollect to have found precisely these sins in the long catalogue of those hitherto laid to his charge it is worth while therefore to examine into these discoveries effected solely by the aid of the lucidity and solidity of the mind of m flourens  according to m flourens mr darwins great error is that he has personified nature p 10 and further that he has  imagined a natural selection he imagines afterwards that this power of selection pouvoir dlire which he gives to nature is similar to the power of man these two suppositions admitted nothing stops him he plays with nature as he likes and makes her do all he pleases p 6  and this is the way m flourens extinguishes natural selection  voyons donc encore une fois ce quil peut y avoir de fonde dans ce quon nomme election naturelle  lelection naturelle nest sous un autre nom que la nature pour un etre organise la nature nest que lorganisation ni plus ni moins  il faudra donc aussi personnifier lorganisation et dire que lorganisation choisit lorganisation lelection naturelle est cette forme substantielle dont on jouait autrefois avec tant de facilite aristote disait que si lart de batir etait dans le bois cet art agirait comme la nature a la place de lart de batir m darwin met lelection naturelle et cest tout un lun nest pas plus chimerique que lautre p31  and this is really all that m flourens can make of natural selection we have given the original in fear lest a translation should be regarded as a travesty but with the original before the reader we may try to analyse the passage for an organized being nature is only organization neither more nor less  organized beings then have absolutely no relation to inorganic nature a plant does not depend on soil or sunshine climate depth in the ocean height above it the quantity of saline matters in water have no influence upon animal life the substitution of carbonic acid for oxygen in our atmosphere would hurt nobody that these are absurdities no one should know better than m flourens but they are logical deductions from the assertion just quoted and from the further statement that natural selection means only that organization chooses and selects organization  for if it be once admitted what no sane man denies that the chances of life of any given organism are increased by certain conditions a and diminished by their opposites b then it is mathematically certain that any change of conditions in the direction of a will exercise a selective influence in favour of that organism tending to its increase and multiplication while any change in the direction of b will exercise a selective influence against that organism tending to its decrease and extinction  or on the other hand conditions remaining the same let a given organism vary and no one doubts that they do vary in two directions into one form a better fitted to cope with these conditions than the original stock and a second b less well adapted to them then it is no less certain that the conditions in question must exercise a selective influence in favour of a and against  b so that a will tend to predominance and b to extirpation  that m flourens should be unable to perceive the logical necessity of these simple arguments which lie at the foundation of all mr darwins reasoning that he should confound an irrefragable deduction from the observed relations of organisms to the conditions which lie around them with a metaphysical forme substantielle or a chimerical personification of the powers of nature would be incredible were it not that other passages of his work leave no room for doubt upon the subject  on imagine une election naturelle que pour plus de menagement on me dit etre inconsciente sans sapercevoir que le contresens litteral est precisement la election inconsciente p 52  jai deja dit ce quil faut penser de lelection naturelle ou lelection naturelle nest rien ou cest la nature mais la nature douee delection mais la nature personnifiee derniere erreur du dernier siecle le xixe fait plus de personnifications p 53  m flourens cannot imagine an unconscious selectionit is for him a contradiction in terms did m flourens ever visit one of the prettiest wateringplaces of la belle france the baie darcachon if so he will probably have passed through the district of the landes and will have had an opportunity of observing the formation of dunes on a grand scale what are these dunes the winds and waves of the bay of biscay have not much consciousness and yet they have with great care selected from among an infinity of masses of silex of all shapes and sizes which have been submitted to their action all the grains of sand below a certain size and have heaped them by themselves over a great area this sand has been unconsciously selected from amidst the gravel in which it first lay with as much precision as if man had consciously selected it by the aid of a sieve physical geology is full of such selectionsof the picking out of the soft from the hard of the soluble from the insoluble of the fusible from the infusible by natural agencies to which we are certainly not in the habit of ascribing consciousness  but that which wind and sea are to a sandy beach the sum of influences which we term the conditions of existence is to living organisms the weak are sifted out from the strong a frosty night selects the hardy plants in a plantation from among the tender ones as effectually as if it were the wind and they the sand and pebbles of our illustration or on the other hand as if the intelligence of a gardener had been operative in cutting the weaker organisms down the thistle which has spread over the pampas to the destruction of native plants has been more effectually selected by the unconscious operation of natural conditions than if a thousand agriculturists had spent their time in sowing it  it is one of mr darwins many great services to biological science that he has demonstrated the significance of these facts he has shown thatgiven variation and given change of conditionsthe inevitable result is the exercise of such an influence upon organisms that one is helped and another is impeded one tends to predominate another to disappear and thus the living world bears within itself and is surrounded by impulses towards incessant change  but the truths just stated are as certain as any other physical laws quite independently of the truth or falsehood of the hypothesis which mr darwin has based upon them and that m flourens missing the substance and grasping at a shadow should be blind to the admirable exposition of them which mr darwin has given and see nothing there but a derniere erreur du dernier siecle a personification of natureleads us indeed to cry with him o lucidite o solidite de lesprit francais que devenezvous  m flourens has in fact utterly failed to comprehend the first principles of the doctrine which he assails so rudely his objections to details are of the old sort so battered and hackneyed on this side of the channel that not even a quarterly reviewer could be induced to pick them up for the purpose of pelting mr darwin over again we have cuvier and the mummies m roulin and the domesticated animals of america the difficulties presented by hybridism and by palaeontology darwinism a rifacciamento of de maillet and lamarck darwinism a system without a commencement and its author bound to believe in m pouchet etc etc how one knows it all by heart and with what relief one reads at p 65  je laisse m darwin  but we cannot leave m flourens without calling our readers attention to his wonderful tenth chapter de la preexistence des germes et de lepigenese which opens thus  spontaneous generation is only a chimaera this point established two hypotheses remain that of preexistence and that of epigenesis the one of these hypotheses has as little foundation as the other p 163  the doctrine of epigenesis is derived from harvey following by ocular inspection the development of the new being in the windsor does he saw each part appear successively and taking the moment of appearance for the moment of formation he imagined epigenesis p 165  on the contrary says m flourens p 167  the new being is formed at a stroke tout dun coup as a whole instantaneously it is not formed part by part and at different times it is formed at once at the single individual moment at which the conjunction of the male and female elements takes place  it will be observed that m flourens uses language which cannot be mistaken for him the labours of von baer of rathke of coste and their contemporaries and successors in germany france and england are nonexistent and as darwin imagina natural selection so harvey imagina that doctrine which gives him an even greater claim to the veneration of posterity than his better known discovery of the circulation of the blood  language such as that we have quoted is in fact so preposterous so utterly incompatible with anything but absolute ignorance of some of the best established facts that we should have passed it over in silence had it not appeared to afford some clue to m flourens unhesitating a priori repudiation of all forms of the doctrine of progressive modification of living beings he whose mind remains uninfluenced by an acquaintance with the phenomena of development must indeed lack one of the chief motives towards the endeavour to trace a genetic relation between the different existing forms of life those who are ignorant of geology find no difficulty in believing that the world was made as it is and the shepherd untutored in history sees no reason to regard the green mounds which indicate the site of a roman camp as aught but part and parcel of the primeval hillside so m flourens who believes that embryos are formed tout dun coup naturally finds no difficulty in conceiving that species came into existence in the same way    footnote 1 the natural history review 1864 1 ueber die darwinsche sch pfungstheorie ein vortrag von a k lliker leipzig 1864

of agamogenesis such as that exhibited by some trematoda and by the aphides the hyaena must produce asexually a brood of asexual dogs from which other sexless dogs must proceed at the end of a certain number of terms of the series the dogs would acquire sexes and generate young but these young would be not dogs but hyaenas in fact we have demonstrated in agamogenetic phenomena that inevitable recurrence to the original type which is asserted to be true of variations in general by mr darwins opponents and which if the assertion could be changed into a demonstration would in fact be fatal to his hypothesis
