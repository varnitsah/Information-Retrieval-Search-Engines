feet a pilgrim woebegone   lifes upward road i journeyed many a day   and hymning many a sad yet soothing lay beguild my wandering with the charms of song   lonely my heart and rugged was my way yet often pluckd i as i past along   the wild and simple flowers of poesy and as beseemd the wayward fancys child   entwind each random weed that pleasd mine eye accept the wreath beloved it is wild   and rudely garlanded yet scorn not thou the humble offering where the sad rue weaves mid gayer flowers its intermingled leaves   and i have twind the myrtle for thy brow     i have collected in this volume the productions of very distant periods the lyric pieces were written in earlier youth i now think the ode the most worthless species of composition as well as the most difficult and should never again attempt it even if my future pursuits were such as allowed leisure for poetry the poems addressed to the heart and the understanding are those of my maturer judgment the inscriptions will be found to differ from the greek simplicity of akensides in the point that generally concludes them the sonnets were written first or i would have adopted a different title and avoided the shackle of rhyme and the confinement to fourteen lines     contents   to mary wollstonecraft  3 the triumph of woman  7 poems on the slavetrade  29 sonnet 1  33        2  34        3  35        4  36        5

chapters of the first book of esdras    the triumph of woman      glad as the weary traveller tempesttost to reach secure at length his native coast who wandering long oer distant lands has sped the nightblast wildly howling round his head known all the woes of want and felt the storm of the bleak winter parch his shivering form the journey oer and every peril past beholds his little cottagehome at last and as he sees afar the smoke curl slow feels his full eyes with transport overflow so from the scene where death and anguish reign and vice and folly drench with blood the plain joyful i turn to sing how womans praise availd again jerusalem to raise calld forth the sanction of the despots nod and freed the nation bestbelovd of god     darius gives the feast to persias court awed by his will the obedient throng resort attending satraps swell the princes pride and vanquishd monarchs grace their conquerors side no more the warrior wears the garb of war sharps the strong steel or mounts the scythed car no more judaeas sons dejected go and hang the head and heave the sigh of woe from persias rugged hills descend the train from where orontes foams along the plain from where choaspes rolls his royal waves and india sends her sons submissive slaves thy daughters babylon to grace the feast weave the loose robe and paint the flowery vest with roseate wreaths they braid the glossy hair they tinge the cheek which nature formd so fair learn the soft step the soulsubduing glance melt in the song and swim adown the dance exalted on the monarchs golden throne in royal state the fair apame shone  her form of majesty her eyes of fire chill with respect or kindle with desire the admiring multitude her charms adore and own her worthy of the crown she wore     now on his couch reclind darius lay tird with the toilsome pleasures of the day without judaeas watchful sons await to guard the sleeping pageant of the state three youths were these of judahs royal race three youths whom nature dowerd with every grace to each the form of symmetry she gave and haughty genius cursd each favorite slave these filld the cup around the monarch kept servd as he spake and guarded whilst he slept     yet oft for salems hallowed towers laid low the sigh would heave the unbidden tear would flow and when the dull and wearying round of power allowed zorobabel one vacant hour he lovd on babylons high wall to roam and stretch the gaze towards his distant home or on euphrates willowy banks reclind hear the sad harp moan fitful to the wind     as now the perfumd lamps stream wide their light and social converse chears the livelong night thus spake zorobabel too long in vain for sion desolate her sons complain in anguish worn the joyless years lag slow and these proud conquerors mock their captives woe whilst cyrus triumphd here in victor state a brighter prospect cheard our exild fate our sacred walls again he bade us raise and to jehovah rear the pile of praise quickly these fond hopes faded from our eyes as the frail sun that gilds the wintry skies and spreads a moments radiance oer the plain soon hid by clouds that dim the scene again     opprest by artaxerxes jealous reign we vainly pleaded here and wept in vain now when darius chief of mild command bids joy and pleasure fill the festive land still shall we droop the head in sullen grief and sternly silent shun to seek relief what if amid the monarchs mirthful throng our harps should echo to the chearful song     fair is the occasion thus the one replied and now let all our tuneful skill be tried whilst the gay courtiers quaff the smiling bowl and wines strong fumes inspire the maddend soul where all around is merriment be mine to strike the lute and praise the power of wine     and whilst his friend replied in state alone lord of the earth darius fills the throne be yours the mighty power of wine to sing my lute shall sound the praise of persias king     to them zorobabel on themes like these seek ye the monarch of mankind to please to wine superior or to powers strong arms be mine to sing resistless womans charms to him victorious in the rival lays shall just darius give the meed of praise the purple robe his honord frame shall fold the beverage sparkle in his cup of gold a golden couch support his bed of rest the chain of honor grace his favord breast his the soft turban his the cars array oer babylons high wall to wheel its way and for his wisdom seated on the throne for the kings cousin shall the bard be known     intent they meditate the future lay and watch impatient for the dawn of day the morn rose clear and shrill were heard the flute the cornet sackbut dulcimer and lute to babylons gay streets the throng resort swarm thro the gates and fill the festive court high on his throne darius towerd in pride the fair apame gracd the sovereigns side and now she smild and now with mimic frown placed on her brow the monarchs sacred crown in transport oer her faultless form he bends loves every look and every act commends    and now darius bids the herald call judaeas bard to grace the thronging hall hushd is each soundthe attending crowd are mute the hebrew lightly strikes the chearful lute      when the traveller on his way   who has toild the livelong day   feels around on every side   the chilly mists of eventide   fatigued and faint his wearied mind   recurs to all he leaves behind   he thinks upon the welltrimmd hearth   the evening hour of social mirth   and her who at departing day   weeps for her husband far away   oh give to him the flowing bowl   bid it renovate his soul   then shall sorrow sink to sleep   and he who wept no more shall weep   for his careclouded brow shall clear and his glad eye shall sparkle thro the tear      when the poor man heartopprest   betakes him to his evening rest   and worn with labour thinks in sorrow   of the labor of tomorrow   when sadly musing on his lot   he hies him to his joyless cot   and loathes to meet his children there   the rivals for his scanty fare   oh give to him the flowing bowl   bid it renovate his soul   the generous juice with magic power   shall cheat with happiness the hour   and with each warm affection fill the heart by want and wretchedness made chill      when at the dim close of day   the captive loves alone to stray   along the haunts recluse and rude   of sorrow and of solitude   when he sits with moveless eye   to mark the lingering radiance die   and lets distemperd fancy roam   amid the ruins of his home   oh give to him the flowing bowl   bid it renovate his soul   the bowl shall better thoughts bestow   and lull to rest his wakeful woe   and joy shall bless the evening hour and make the captive fortunes conqueror      when the wearying cares of state   oppress the monarch with their weight   when from his pomp retird alone   he feels the duties of the throne   feels that the multitude below   depend on him for weal or woe   when his powerful will may bless   a realm with peace and happiness   or with desolating breath   breathe ruin round and woe and death   oh give to him the flowing bowl   bid it humanize his soul   he shall not feel the empires weight   he shall not feel the cares of state   the bowl shall each dark thought beguile and nations live and prosper from his smile     husht was the lute the hebrew ceasd the song long peals of plaudits echoed from the throng each tongue the liberal words of praise repaid on every cheek a smile applauding playd the rival bard advanced he struck the string and pourd the loftier song to persias king    why should the wearying cares of state   oppress the monarch with their weight   alike to him if peace shall bless   the multitude with happiness alike to him if frenzied war   careers triumphant on the embattled plain   and rolling on oer myriads slain with gore and wounds shall clog his scythed car what tho the tempest rage no sound   of the deep thunder shakes his distant throne and the red flash that spreads destruction round   reflects a glorious splendour on the crown    where is the man who with ennobling pride beholds not his own nature where is he   who but with deep amazement awe allied must muse the mysteries of the human mind     the miniature of deity for man the vernal clouds descending     shower down their fertilizing rain for man the ripend harvest bending   waves with soft murmur oer the plenteous plain     he spreads the sail on high   the rude gale wafts him oer the main   for him the winds of heaven subservient blow   earth teems for him for him the waters flow he thinks and wills and acts a deity below  where is the king who with elating pride   sees not this manthis godlike man his slave mean are the mighty by the monarchs side   alike the wife alike the brave   with timid step and pale advance   and tremble at the royal glance   suspended millions watch his breath whose smile is happiness whose frown is death  why goes the peasant from that little cot where peace and love have blest his humble life   in vain his agonizing wife   with tears bedews her husbands face and clasps him in a long and last embrace   in vain his children round his bosom creep   and weep to see their mother weep fettering their father with their little arms   what are to him the wars alarms   what are to him the distant foes   he at the earliest dawn of day     to daily labor went his way     and when he saw the sun decline     he sat in peace beneath his vine   the king commands the peasant goes   from all he lovd on earth he flies and for his monarch toils and fights and bleeds and dies    what tho yon citys castled wall     casts oer the darkend plain its crested shade   what tho their priests in earnest terror call     on all their host of gods to aid   vain is the bulwark vain the tower     in vain her gallant youths expose     their breasts a bulwark to the foes   in vain at that tremendous hour   claspd in the savage soldiers reeking arms     shrieks to tame heaven the violated maid   by the rude hand of ruin scatterd round their mossgrown towers shall spread the desart ground     low shall the mouldering palace lie   amid the princely halls the grass wave high and thro the shatterd roof descend the inclement sky      gay oer the embattled plain     moves yonder warrior train   their banners wanton on the morning gale     full on their bucklers beams the rising ray     their glittering helmets flash a brighter day   the shout of war rings echoing oer the vale   far reaches as the aching eye can strain     the splendid horror of their wide array     ah not in vain expectant oer     their glorious pomp the vultures soar     amid the conquerors palace high     shall sound the song of victory   long after journeying oer the plain     the traveller shall with startled eye see their white bones then blanched by many a winter sky    lord of the earth we will not raise   the temple to thy bounded praise   for thee no victim need expire   for thee no altar blaze with hallowed fire   the burning city flames for thee   thine altar is the field of victory     thy sacred majesty to bless   man a selfofferd victim freely flies     to thee he sacrifices happiness   and peace and loves endearing ties to thee a slave he lives to thee a slave he dies   husht was the lute the hebrew ceasd to sing the shout rushd forthfor ever live the king loud was the uproar as when romes decree pronouncd achaia once again was free assembled greece enrapt with fond belief heard the false boon and blessd the villain chief each breast with

already doomd the prize  silent they saw zorobabel advance quick on apame shot his timid glance with downward eye he pausd a moment mute and with light finger touchd the softer lute apame knew the hebrews grateful cause and bent her head and sweetly smild applause    why is the warriors cheek so red   why downward droops his musing head   why that slow step that faint advance   that keen yet quickretreating glance   that crested head in war towerd high   no backward glance disgracd that eye   no flushing fear that cheek oerspread   when stern he strode oer heaps of dead   strange tumult now his bosom moves   the warrior fears because he loves    why does the youth delight to rove   amid the dark and lonely grove   why in the throng where all are gay     his wandering eye with meaning fraught     sits he alone in silent thought   silent he sits for far away   his passiond soul delights to stray   recluse he roves and strives to shun all humankind because he loves but one    yes king of persia thou art blest     but not because the sparkling bowl     to rapture lifts thy wakend soul 1   but not because of power possest   not that the nations dread thy nod   and princes reverence thee their earthly god   even on a monarchs solitude   care the black spectre will intrude   the bowl brief pleasure can bestow   the purple cannot shield from woe   but king of persia thou

distemperd glows with statelier stature loftier now he rose heavenward he gazd regardless of the throng and pourd with awful voice sublimer song    ancient of days eternal truth one hymn one holier strain the bard shall raise to thee thee powerful thee benevolent thee just friend father all in all the vines rich blood the monarchs might and womans conquering charms these shall we praise alone oh

which we think was a long s transferred to the modern edition by mistake gutenberg proofreading  footnote 2 this expression is from owen felltham    poems  on the  slave trade   i am innocent of this blood see ye to it   preface  when first the abolition of the slavetrade was agitated in england the friends of humanity endeavoured by two means to accomplish itto destroy the trade immediately by the interference of government or by the disuse of westindian productions a slow but certain method for a while government held the language of justice and individuals with enthusiasm banished sugar from their tables this enthusiasm soon cooled the majority of those who had made this sacrifice i prostitute the word but they thought it a sacrifice persuaded themselves that parliament would do all and that individual efforts were no longer necessary thus ended the one attempt and the duplicity with which mr wilberforce has been amused and the slavemerchants satisfied has now effectually destroyed the other  there are yet two other methods remaining by which this traffic will probably be abolished by the introduction of eastindian or maple sugar or by the just and general rebellion of the negroes by the vindictive justice of the africans or by the civilized christians finding it their interest to be humane  to these past and present prospects the following poems occasionally allude to the english custom of exciting wars upon the slave coast that they may purchase prisoners and to the punishment sometimes inflicted upon a negro for murder of which hector st john was an eyewitness    sonnet i  hold your mad hands for ever on your plain   must the gorged vulture clog his beak with blood   for ever must your nigers tainted flood roll to the ravenous shark his banquet slain hold your mad hands what daemon prompts to rear   the arm of slaughter on your savage shore   can hellsprung glory claim the feast of gore with laurels waterd by the widows tear wreathing his helmet crown lift high the spear   and like the desolating whirlwinds sweep   plunge ye yon bark of anguish in the deep for the pale fiend coldhearted commerce there breathes his goldgenderd pestilence afar and calls to share the prey his kindred daemon war    sonnet ii  why dost thou beat thy breast and rend thine hair   and to the deaf sea pour thy frantic cries   before the gale the laden vessel flies the heavens allfavoring smile the breeze is fair hark to the clamors of the exulting crew   hark how their thunders mock the patient skies   why dost thou shriek and strain thy redswoln eyes as the white sail dim lessens from thy view go pine in want and anguish and despair   there is no mercy found in humankind go widow to thy grave and rest thee there   but may the god of justice bid the wind whelm that curst bark beneath the mountain wave and bless with liberty and death the slave    sonnet iii  oh he is worn with toil the big drops run   down his dark cheek holdhold thy merciless hand   pale tyrant for beneath thy hard command oerwearied nature sinks the scorching sun as pityless as proud prosperity   darts on him his full beams gasping he lies   arraigning with his looks the patient skies while that inhuman trader lifts on high   the mangling scourge oh ye who at your ease   sip the bloodsweetend beverage thoughts like these haply ye scorn i thank thee gracious god   that i do feel upon my cheek the glow of indignation when beneath the rod   a sable brother writhes in silent woe    sonnet iv  tis night the mercenary tyrants sleep   as undisturbd as justice but no more   the wretched slave as on his native shore rests on his reedy couch he wakes to weep tho thro the toil and anguish of the day   no tear escapd him not one suffering groan   beneath the twisted thong he weeps alone in bitterness thinking that far away tho the gay negroes join the midnight song   tho merriment resounds on nigers shore she whom he loves far from the chearful throng   stands sad and gazes from her lowly door with dim grown eye silent and woebegone   and weeps for him who will return no more    sonnet v  did then the bold slave rear at last the sword   of vengeance drenchd he deep its thirsty blade in the cold bosom of his tyrant lord   oh who shall blame him thro the midnight shade still oer his torturd memory rushd the thought   of every past delight his native grove   friendships best joys and liberty and love all lost for ever then remembrance wrought his soul to madness round his restless bed   freedoms pale spectre stalkd with a stern smile   pointing the wounds of slavery the while she shook her chains and hung her sullen head no more on heaven he calls with fruitless breath but sweetens with revenge the draught of death    sonnet vi  high in the air exposd the slave is hung   to all the birds of heaven their living food he groans not tho awaked by that fierce sun   new torturers live to drink their parent blood he groans not tho the gorging vulture tear   the quivering fibre hither gaze o ye   who tore this man from peace and liberty gaze hither ye who weigh with scrupulous care the right and prudent for beyond the grave   there is another world and call to mind   ere your decrees proclaim to all mankind murder is legalized that there the slave before the eternal thundertongued shall plead against the deep damnation of your deed    to the genius of africa    o thou who from the mountains height   rollst down thy clouds with all their weight of waters to old niles majestic tide   or oer the dark sepulchral plain recallest thy palmyras ancient pride   amid whose desolated domes   secure the savage chacal roams where from the fragments of the hallowd fane the arabs rear their miserable homes  hear genius hear thy childrens cry   not always shouldst thou love to brood   stern oer the desert solitude where seas of sand toss their hot surges high   nor genius should the midnight song detain thee in some milder mood   the palmy plains among where gambia to the torches light flows radiant thro the awakend night  ah linger not to hear the song genius avenge thy childrens wrong the daemon commerce on your shore   pours all the horrors of his train and hark where from the field of gore   howls the hyena oer the slain lo where the flaming village fires the skies avenging power awakearise  arise thy childrens wrong redress ah heed the mothers wretchedness when in the hot infectious air   oer her sick babe she bows opprest ah hear her when the christians tear   the drooping infant from her breast   whelmd in the waters he shall rest hear thou the wretched mothers cries avenging power awake arise    by the rank infected air   that taints those dungeons of despair   by those who there imprisond die   where the black herd promiscuous lie   by the scourges blackend oer   and stiff and hard with human gore   by every groan of deep distress   by every curse of wretchedness   by all the train of crimes that flow   from the hopelessness of woe   by every drop of blood bespilt   by africs wrongs and europes guilt   awake arise avenge  and thou hast heard and oer their bloodfed plains swept thine avenging hurricanes and bade thy storms with whirlwind roar dash their proud navies on the shore and where their armies claimd the fight witherd the warriors might and oer the unholy host with baneful breath there genius thou hast breathd the gales of death  so perish still the robbers of mankind what tho from justice bound and blind inhuman power has snatchd the sword   what tho thro many an ignominious age   that fiend with desolating rage the tide of carnage pourd justice shall yet unclose her eyes terrific yet in wrath arise and trample on the tyrants breast and make oppresion groan opprest    to my own miniature picture taken at two years of age  and i was once like this that glowing cheek was mine those pleasuresparkling eyes that brow smooth as the level lake when not a breeze dies oer the sleeping surface twenty years have wrought strange alteration of the friends who once so dearly prized this miniature and loved it for its likeness some are gone to their last home and some estranged in heart beholding me with quickaverted glance pass on the other side but still these hues remain unalterd and these features wear the look of infancy and innocence i search myself in vain and find no trace of what i was those lightlyarching lines dark and oerhanging now and that mild face settled in these strong lineamentsthere were who formd high hopes and flattering ones of thee young robert for thine eye was quick to speak each opening feeling should they not have known when the rich rainbow on the morning cloud reflects its radiant dies the husbandman beholds the ominous glory sad and fears impending storms they augurd happily for thou didst love each wild and wonderous tale of faery fiction and thine infant tongue lispd with delight the godlike deeds of greece and rising rome therefore they deemd forsooth that thou shouldst tread preferments pleasant path illjudging ones they let thy little feet stray in the pleasant paths of poesy and when thou shouldst have prest amid the crowd there didst thou love to linger out the day loitering beneath the laurels barren shade spirit of spenser was the wanderer wrong this little picture was for ornament designd to shine amid the motley mob of fashion and of follyis it not more honourd by this solitary song    the paupers funeral  what and not one to heave the pious sigh not one whose sorrowswoln and aching eye for social scenes for lifes endearments fled shall drop a tear and dwell upon the dead poor wretched outcast i will weep for thee and sorrow for forlorn humanity yes i will weep but not that thou art come to the stern sabbath of the silent tomb for squalid want and the black scorpion care heartwithering fiends shall never enter there i sorrow for the ills thy life has known as thro the worlds long pilgrimage alone haunted by poverty and woebegone unloved unfriended thou didst journey on thy youth in ignorance and labour past and thine old age all barrenness and blast hard was thy fate which while it doomd to woe denied thee wisdom to support the blow and robbd of all its energy thy mind ere yet it cast thee on thy fellowkind abject of thought the victim of distress to wander in the worlds wide wilderness  poor outcast sleep in peace the wintry storm blows bleak no more on thine unshelterd form thy woes are past thou restest in the tomb i pauseand ponder on the days to come    ode  written on the first of january 1794  come melancholy moralizercome gather with me the dark and wintry wreath     with me engarland now     the sepulchre of time  come moralizer to the funeral song i pour the dirge of the departed days     for well the funeral song     befits this solemn hour  but hark even now the merry bells ring round with clamorous joy to welcome in this day     this consecrated day     to mirth and indolence  mortal whilst fortune with benignant hand fills to the brim thy cup of happiness     whilst her unclouded sun     illumes thy summer day  canst thou rejoicerejoice that time flies fast that night shall shadow soon thy summer sun     that swift the stream of years     rolls to eternity  if thou hast wealth to gratify each wish if power be thine remember what thou art     remember thou art man     and death thine heritage  hast thou known love does beautys better sun cheer thy fond heart with no capricious smile     her eye all eloquence     her voice all harmony  oh state of happiness hark how the gale moans deep and hollow oer the leafless grove     winter is dark and cold     where now the charms of spring  sayst thou that fancy paints the future scene in hues too sombrous that the darkstold maid     with stern and frowning front     appals the shuddering soul  and wouldst thou bid me court her faery form when as she sports her in some happier mood     her manycolourd robes     dance varying to the sun  ah vainly does the pilgrim whose long road leads oer the barren mountains stormvext height     with anxious gaze survey     the fruitful faroff vale  oh

are these dangers to those i have past when the dark billows roard to the roar of the blast when we workd at the pumps worn with labour and weak and with dread still beheld the increase of the leak sometimes as we rose on the wave could our sight from the rocks of the shore catch the lighthouses light in vain to the beach to assist us they press we fire faster and faster our guns of distress

 theres an end of all troubles however at last and when i in the waggon of wounded was cast when my wounds with the chilly nightwind smarted sore and i thought of the friends i should never see more no hand to relievescarce a morsel of bread sick at heart i have envied the peace of the dead left to rot in a jail till by treaty set free old englands white cliffs with what joy did i see i had gaind enough glory some wounds but no good and was turnd on the public to shift how i could when i think what ive sufferd and where i am now i curse him who snared me away from the plough   john  when i was discharged i went home to my wife there in comfort to spend all the rest of my life my wife was industrious we earnd what we spent and tho little we had were with little content and whenever i listend and heard the wind roar i blessd god for my little snug cabin on shore at midnight they seizd me they draggd me away they wounded me sore when i would not obey and because for my country id venturd my life i was draggd like a thief from my home and my wife then the fair wind of fortune choppd round in my face and want at length drove me to guilt and disgrace but alls for the beston the worlds wide

hard labours youve past and think in plain troth youre two blockheads at last my lads where the deuce was the wit which god gave ye when you sold yourselves first to the army or navy by land and by sea hunting dangers to roam when you might have been hangd so much easier at home but youre now snug and settled and safe from foul weather so drink up your grog and be merry together      frederic  time night scene the woods   where shall i turn me whither shall i bend my weary way thus worn with toil and faint how thro the thorny mazes of this wood attain my distant dwelling that deep cry that rings along the forest seems to sound my parting knell it is the midnight howl of hungry monsters prowling for their prey again oh save mesave me gracious heaven i am not fit to die                      thou coward wretch why heaves thy trembling heart why shake thy limbs beneath their palsied burden is there ought so lovely in existence wouldst thou drain even to its dregs the bitter draught of life dash down the loathly bowl poor outcast slave stampd with the brand of vice and infamy why should the villain frederic shrink from death  death where the magic in that empty name that chills my inmost heart why at the thought starts the cold dew of fear on every limb there are no terrors to surround the grave when the calm mind collected in itself surveys that narrow house the ghastly train that haunt the midnight of delirious guilt then vanish in that home of endless rest all sorrows ceasewould i might slumber there  why then this panting of the fearful heart this miser love of life that dreads to lose its cherishd torment shall the diseased man yield up his members to the surgeons knife doubtful of succour but to ease his frame of fleshly anguish and the coward wretch whose ulcered soul can know no human help shrink from the best physicians certain aid oh it were better far to lay me down here on this cold damp earth till some wild beast seize on his willing victim                               if to die were all it were most sweet to rest my head on the cold clod and sleep the sleep of death but if the archangels trump at the last hour startle the ear of death and wake the soul to frenzydreams of infancy fit tales for garrulous beldames to affrighten babes i have been guilty yet my mind can bear the retrospect of guilt yet in the hour of deep contrition to the eternal look for mercy for the child of poverty and disinherited of happiness  what if i warrd upon the world the world had wrongd me first i had endurd the ills of hard injustice all this goodly earth was but to me one wild waste wilderness i had no share in natures patrimony blasted were all my morning hopes of youth dark disappointment followd on my ways care was my bosom inmate and keen want gnawd at my heart eternal one thou knowst how that poor heart even in the bitter hour of lewdest revelry has inly yearnd for peace            my father i will call on thee pour to thy mercy seat my earnest prayer and wait thy peace in bowedness of soul oh thoughts of comfort how the afflicted heart tired with the tempest of its passions rests on you with holy hope the hollow howl of yonder harmless tenant of the woods bursts not with terror on the soberd sense if i have sinnd against mankind on them be that past sin they made me what i was in these extremest climes can want no more urge to the deeds of darkness and at length here shall i rest what tho my hut be poor the rains descend not thro its humble roof would i were there again the night is cold and what if in my wanderings i should rouse the savage from his thicket                                hark the gun and lothe fire of safety i shall reach my little hut again again by toil force from the stubborn earth my sustenance and quickeard guilt will never start alarmd amid the wellearnd meal this felons garb will it not shield me from the winds of heaven and what could purple more oh strengthen me eternal one

thy banks the livelong hour away     when sportive childhood wantoned thro the day   joyd at the opening splendour of the morn   or as the twilight darkend heaved the sigh     thinking of distant home

went   xii  oer the path so well known still proceeded the maid   where the abbey rose dim on the sight thro the gateway she entered she felt not afraid yet the ruins were lonely and wild and their

appeareth in the shape of an harper sweetly singing and dallying and playing under the water  it is reported of one donica that after she was dead the devil walked in her body for the space of two years so that none suspected but that she was still alive for she did both speak and eat though very sparingly only she had a deep paleness on her countenance which was the only sign of death at

and slow and soon with strength recoverd reachd  yet never to donicas cheek   returnd the lively hue her cheeks were deathy white and wan   her lips a livid blue  her eyes so bright and black of yore   were now more black and bright and beamd strange lustre in her face   so deadly wan and white  the dog that gambold by her side   and lovd with her to stray now at his alterd mistress howld   and fled in fear away  yet did the faithful eberhard   not love the maid the less he gazd with sorrow but he gazd   with deeper tenderness  and when he found her health unharmd   he would not brook delay but pressd the not unwilling maid   to fix the bridal day  and when at length it came with joy   they haild the bridal day and onward to the house of god   they went their willing way  and as they at the altar stood   and heard the sacred rite the hallowed tapers dimly streamd   a pale sulphureous light  and as the youth with holy warmth   her hand in his did hold sudden he felt donicas hand   grow deadly damp and cold  and loudly did he shriek for lo   a spirit met his view and eberhard in the angel form   his own donica knew  that instant from her earthly frame   howling the daemon fled and at the side of eberhard   the livid form fell dead     rudiger  divers princes and noblemen being assembled in a beautiful and fair palace which was situate upon the river rhine they beheld a boat or small barge make toward the shore drawn by a swan in a silver chain the one end fastened about her neck the other to the vessel and in it an unknown soldier a man of a comely personage and graceful presence who stept upon the shore which done the boat guided by the swan left him and floated down the river this man fell afterward in league with a fair gentlewoman married her and by her had many children after some years the same swan came with the same barge into the same place the soldier entering into it was carried thence the way he came left wife children and family and was never seen amongst them after  now who can judge this to be other than one of those spirits that are named incubi says thomas heywood i have adopted his story but not his solution making the unknown soldier not an evil spirit but one who had purchased happiness of a malevolent being by the promised sacrifice of his firstborn child   rudiger  bright on the mountains heathy slope   the days last splendors shine and rich with many a radiant hue   gleam gayly on the rhine  and many a one from waldhursts walls   along the river strolld as ruffling oer the pleasant stream   the evening gales came cold  so as they strayd a swan they saw   sail stately up and strong and by a silver chain she drew   a little boat along  whose streamer to the gentle breeze   long floating fluttered light beneath whose crimson canopy   there lay reclind a knight  with arching crest and swelling breast   on saild the stately swan and lightly up the parting tide   the little boat came on  and onward to the shore they drew   and leapt to land the knight and down the stream the swandrawn boat   fell soon beyond the sight  was never a maid in waldhursts walls   might match with margaret her cheek was fair her eyes were dark   her silken locks like jet  and many a rich and noble youth   had strove to win the fair but never a rich or noble youth   could rival rudiger  at every tilt and turney he   still bore away the prize for knightly feats superior still   and knightly courtesies  his gallant feats his looks his love   soon won the willing fair and soon did margaret become   the wife of rudiger  like morning dreams of happiness   fast rolld the months away for he was kind and she was kind   and who so blest as they  yet rudiger would sometimes sit   absorbd in silent thought and his dark downward eye would seem   with anxious meaning fraught  but soon he raisd his looks again   and smild his cares eway and mid the hall of gaiety   was none like him so gay  and onward rolld the waining months   the hour appointed came and margaret her rudiger   haild with a fathers name  but silently did rudiger   the little infant see and darkly on the babe he gazd   and very sad was he  and when to bless the little babe   the holy father came to cleanse the stains of sin away   in christs redeeming name  then did the cheek of rudiger   assume a deathpale hue and on his clammy forehead stood   the cold convulsive dew  and faltering in his speech he bade   the priest the rites delay till he could to right health restord   enjoy the festive day  when oer the manytinted sky   he saw the day decline he called upon his margaret   to walk beside the rhine  and we will take the little babe   for soft the breeze that blows and the wild murmurs of the stream   will lull him to repose  so forth together did they go   the evening breeze was mild and rudiger upon his arm   did pillow the sweet child  and many a one from waldhursts walls   along the banks did roam but soon the evening wind came cold   and all betook them home  yet rudiger in silent mood   along the banks would roam nor aught could margaret prevail   to turn his footsteps home  oh turn theeturn thee rudiger   the rising mists behold the evening wind is damp and chill   the little babe is cold  now hush theehush thee margaret   the mists will do no harm and from the wind the little babe   lies sheltered on my arm  oh turn theeturn thee rudiger   why onward wilt thou roam the moon is up the night is cold   and we are far from home  he answered not for now he saw   a swan come sailing strong and by a silver chain she drew   a little boat along  to shore they came and to the boat   fast leapt he with the child and in leapt margaretbreathless now   and pale with fear and wild  with arching crest and swelling breast   on saild the stately swan and lightly down the rapid tide   the little boat went on  the fullorbd moon that beamd around   pale splendor thro the night cast through the crimson canopy   a dimdiscoloured light  and swiftly down the hurrying stream   in silence still they sail and the long streamer fluttering fast   flappd to the heavy gale  and he was mute in sullen thought   and she was mute with fear nor sound but of the parting tide   broke on the listening ear  the little babe began to cry   and waked his mothers care now give to me the little babe   for gods sake rudiger  now hush thee hush thee margaret   nor my poor heart distress i do but pay perforce the price   of former happiness  and hush thee too my little babe   thy cries so feeble cease lie still lie stilla little while   and thou shalt be at peace  so as he spake to land they drew   and swift he stept on shore and him behind did margaret   close follow evermore  it was a place all desolate   nor house nor tree was there and there a rocky mountain rose   barren and bleak and bare  and at its base a cavern yawnd   no eye its depth might view for in the moonbeam shining round   that darkness darker grew  cold horror crept thro margarets blood   her heart it pausd with fear when rudiger approachd the cave   and cried lo i am here  a deep sepulchral sound the cave   returnd lo i am here and black from out the cavern gloom   two giant arms appear  and rudiger approachd and held   the little infant nigh then margaret shriekd and gatherd then   new powers from agony  and round the baby fast and firm   her trembling arms she folds and with a strong convulsive grasp   the little infant holds  now help me jesus loud she cries   and loud on god she calls then from the grasp of rudiger   the little infant falls  and now he shriekd for now his frame   the huge black arms claspd round and draggd the wretched rudiger   adown the dark profound      hymn  to the  penates  remove far from me vanity and lies give me neither poverty nor riches feed me with food convenient for me  the words of agur    the title of the following poem will probably remind the reader of akensides hymn to the naiads but the manner in which i have treated the subject fortunately precludes comparison   hymn to the penates  yet one song more one high and solemn strain ere paean on thy temples ruined wall i hang the silent harp there may its strings when the rude tempest shakes the aged pile make melancholy music one song more penates hear me for to you i hymn the votive lay whether as sages deem ye dwell in the 1inmost heaven the 2counsellors of jove or if supreme of deities all things are yours and in your holy train jove proudly ranks and juno white armd queen  and wisest of immortals aweful maid athenian pallas venerable powers hearken your hymn of praise tho from your rites estranged and exiled from your altars long i have not ceased to love you household gods in many a long and melancholy hour of solitude and sorrow has my heart with earnest longings prayed to rest at length beside your hallowed hearthfor peace is there  yes i have loved you long i call on you yourselves to witness with what holy joy shunning the polished mob of human kind i have retired to watch your lonely fires and commune with myself delightful hours that gave mysterious pleasure made me know all the recesses of my wayward heart taught me to cherish with devoutest care its strange unworldly feelings taught me too the best of lessonsto respect myself  nor have i ever ceasd to reverence you domestic deities from the first dawn of reason thro the adventurous paths of youth even to this better day when on mine ear the uproar of contending nations sounds but like the passing windand wakes no pulse to tumult when a childfor still i love to dwell with fondness on my childish years even as that persian favorite would retire from the courts dangerous pageantry and pomp to gaze upon his shepherd garb and weep remembring humble happiness when first a little one i left my fathers home i can remember the first grief i felt and the first painful smile that cloathed my front with feelings not its own sadly at night i sat me down beside a strangers hearth and when the lingering hour of rest was come first wet with tears my pillow as i grew in years and knowledge and the course of time developed the young feelings of my heart when most i loved in solitude to rove amid the woodland gloom or where the rocks darkend old avons stream in the ivied cave recluse to sit and brood the future song yet not the less penates loved i then your altars not the less at evening hour delighted by the welltrimmd fire to sit absorbed in many a dear deceitful dream of visionary joys deceitful dreams not wholly vainfor painting purest joys they formd to fancys mould her votarys heart  by cherwells sedgey side and in the meads where isis in her calm clear stream reflects the willows bending boughs at earliest dawn in the noontide hour and when the nightmists rose i have remembered you and when the noise of loud intemperance on my lonely ear burst with loud tumult as recluse i sat pondering on loftiest themes of man redeemed from servitude and vice and wretchedness i blest you household gods because i loved your peaceful altars and serener rites nor did i cease to reverence you when driven amid the jarring crowd an unfit man to mingle with the world still still my heart sighed for your sanctuary and inly pined and loathing human converse i have strayed where oer the seabeach chilly howld the blast and gazd upon the world of waves and wished that i were far beyond the atlantic deep in woodland hauntsa sojourner with peace  not idly fabled they the bards inspired who peopled earth with deities they trod the wood with reverence where the dryads dwelt at days dim dawn or evenings misty hour they saw the oreads on their mountain haunts and felt their holy influence nor impure of thoughtor ever with polluted hands touched they without a prayer the naiads spring yet was their influence transient such brief awe inspiring as the thunders long loud peal strikes to the feeble spirit household gods not such your empire in your votaries breasts no momentary impulse ye awake nor fleeting like their local energies the deep devotion that your fanes impart o ye whom youth has wilderd on your way or vice with fairmaskd foulness or the lure of fame that calls ye to her crowded paths with follys rattle to your household gods return for not in vices gay abodes not in the unquiet unsafe halls of fame does happiness abide o ye who weep much for the many miseries of mankind more for their vices ye whose honest eyes frown on oppressionye whose honest hearts beat high when freedom sounds her dread tocsin o ye who quit the path of peaceful life crusading for mankinda spaniel race that lick the hand that beats them or tear all alike in frenzyto your household gods return for by their altars virtue dwells and happiness with her for by their fires tranquillity in no unsocial mood sits silent listening to the pattering shower for so 3suspicion sleep not at the gate of wisdomfalsehood shall not enter there  as on the height of some huge eminence reachd with long labour the wayfaring man pauses awhile and gazing oer the plain with many a sore step travelled turns him then serious to contemplate the onward road and calls to mind the comforts of his home and sighs that he has left them and resolves to stray no more i on my way of life muse thus penates and with firmest faith devote myself to you i will not quit to mingle with the mob your calm abodes where by the evening hearth contentment sits and hears the cricket chirp where love delights to dwell and on your altars lays his torch that burns with no extinguishable flame  hear me ye powers benignant there is one must be mine inmatefor i may not chuse but love him he is one whom many wrongs have sickend of the world there was a time when he would weep to hear of wickedness and wonder at the tale when for the opprest he felt a brothers pity to the oppressor a good mans honest anger his quick eye betrayd each rising feeling every thought leapt to his tongue when first among mankind he mingled by himself he judged of them and loved and trusted them to wisdom deaf and took them to his bosom falsehood met her unsuspecting victim fair of front and lovely as 4apegas sculptured form like that false image caught his warm embrace and gored his open breast the reptile race clung round his bosom and with viper folds encircling stung the fool who fostered them his mother was simplicity his sire benevolence in earlier days he bore his fathers name the world who injured him call him misanthropy i may not chuse but love him household gods for we were nurst in the same school                      penates some there are who say that not in the inmost heaven ye dwell gazing with eye remote on all the ways of man his guardian gods wiselier they deem a dearer interest to the human race links you yourselves the spirits of the dead no mortal eye may pierce the invisible world no light of human reason penetrate that depth where truth lies hid yet to this faith my heart with instant sympathy assents and i would judge all systems and all faiths by that best touchstone from whose test deceit shrinks like the archfiend at ithuriels spear and sophistrys gay glittering bubble bursts as at the spousals of the nereids son when that false 5 florimel by her prototype displayd in rivalry with all her charms dissolved away                   nor can the halls of heaven give to the human soul such kindred joy as hovering oer its earthly haunts it feels when with the breeze it wantons round the brow of one beloved on earth or when at night in dreams it comes and brings with it the days and joys that are no more or when perchance with power permitted to alleviate ill and fit the sufferer for the coming woe some strange presage the spirit breathes and fills the breast with ominous fear and disciplines for sorrow pours into the afflicted heart the balm of resignation and inspires with heavenly hope even as a child delights to visit day by day the favorite plant his hand has sown to mark its gradual growth and watch all anxious for the promised flower thus to the blessed spirit in innocence and pure affections like a little child sweet will it be to hover oer the friends beloved then sweetest if as duty prompts with earthly care we in their breasts have sown the seeds of truth and virtue holy flowers whose odour reacheth heaven                         when my sick heart sick 6 with hope long delayed than which no care presses the crushd heart heavier from itself seeks the best comfort often have i deemed that thou didst witness every inmost thought seward my dear dead friend for not in vain oh early summond in thy heavenly course was thy brief sojourn here me didst thou leave with strengthend step to follow the right path till we shall meet again meantime i soothe the deep regret of nature with belief my edmund that thine eyes celestial ken pervades me now marking no mean joy the movements of the heart that loved thee well  such feelings nature prompts and hence your rites domestic gods arose when for his son with ceaseless grief syrophanes bewaild mourning his age left childless and his wealth heapt for an alien he with fixed eye still on the imaged marble of the dead dwelt pampering sorrow thither from his wrath a safe asylum fled the offending slave and garlanded the statue and implored his young lost lord to save remembrance then softened the father and he loved to see the votive wreath renewed and the rich smoke curl from the costly censer slow and sweet from egypt soon the sorrowsoothing rites divulging spread before your 7 idol forms by every hearth the blinded pagan knelt pouring his prayers to these and offering there vain sacrifice or impious and sometimes with human blood your sanctuary defild till the first brutus tyrantconquering chief arose he first the impious rites put down he fitliest who for freedom lived and died the friend of humankind then did your feasts frequent recur and blameless and when came the solemn 8 festival whose happiest rites emblemd equality the holiest truth crownd with gay garlands were your statues seen to you the fragrant censer smokd to you the rich libation flowd vain sacrifice for nor the poppy wreath nor fruits nor wine ye ask penates nor the altar cleansd with many a mystic form ye ask the heart made pure and by domestic peace and love hallowed to you                  hearken your hymn of praise penates to your shrines i come for rest there only to be found often at eve amid my wanderings i have seen far off the lonely light that spake of comfort there it told my heart of many a joy of home and my poor heart was sad when i have gazed from some high eminence on goodly vales and cots and villages embowerd below the thought would rise that all to me was strange amid the scene so fair nor one small spot where my tird mind might rest and call it home there is a magic in that little word it is a mystic circle that surrounds comforts and virtues never known beyond the hallowed limit often has my heart ached for that quiet haven havend now i think of those in this worlds wilderness who wander on and find no home of rest till to the grave they go them poverty holloweyed fiend the child of wealth and power bad offspring of worse parents aye afflicts cankering with her foul mildews the chilld heart them want with scorpion scourge drives to the den of guiltthem slaughter with the price of death buys for her raven brood oh not on them god of eternal justice not on them let fall thy thunder                        household deities then only shall be happiness on earth when man shall feel your sacred power and love your tranquil joys then shall the city stand a huge void sepulchre and rising fair amid the ruins of the palace pile the olive grow there shall the tree of peace strike its roots deep and flourish this the state shall bless the race redeemed of man when wealth and power and all their hideous progeny shall sink annihilate and all mankind live in the equal brotherhood of love heartcalming hope and sure for hitherward tend all the tumults of the troubled world its woes its wisdom and its wickedness alike so he hath willd whose will is just  meantime all hoping and expecting all in patient faith to you domestic gods i come studious of other lore than song of my past
