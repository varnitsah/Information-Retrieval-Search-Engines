35806156	the carbonels  by charlotte m yonge    chapter one  french measure    for thy walls a pretty slight drollery   the second part of king henry iv  a bad lot  yes sir a thoroughly bad lot  you dont mean it  yes maam a bad lot is the uphill people  good for nothing and ungrateful  ive known them these thirtyyears and no one will do anything with them  the time was the summer of 1822  the place was a garden somewhat gone to waste with a gravel drive running round a great circle of periwinkles with a spotted aucuba in the middle  there was a low twostoried house with green shutters green venetian blinds and a rather shabby verandah painted in alternate stripes of light and darker green  in front stood a high gig with a tall old bony horse trying to munch the young untrimmed shoots of a lilac in front of him as he waited for the speaker a lawyer dressed as country attorneys were wont to dress in those days in a coat of invisible green where the green constantly became more visible brown trousers and under them drab gaiters  he was addressing a gentleman in a blue coat and nankeen trousers but evidently military and two ladies in white dresses narrow as to the skirts but full in the sleeves  one had a blue scarf over her shoulders and blue ribbons in her very large leghorn bonnet the other had the same in green and likewise a green veil  her bonnet was rather more trimmed the dress more embroidered the scarf of a richer broader material than the others and it was thus evident that she was the married sister but they were a good deal alike with the same wholesome smooth complexion brown eyes and hair in great shining rolls under their bonnet caps much the same pleasant expression and the same neat little feet in crossed sandalled shoes and white stockings showing out beneath their white tambourworked gowns  with the above verdict the lawyer made his parting bow and drove off along a somewhat rough road through two pasture fields  the first gate white and ornamental was held open for him by an old man in a short white smock and long leathern gaiters the second his own servant opened the third was held by half a dozen shockheaded children with their backs against it and hands held out but in vain he only smacked his drivingwhip over their heads and though he did not strike any of them they requited it with a prolonged yell which reached the ears of the trio in front of the house  im afraid it is not far from the truth said the green lady  oh no i am sure he is a horrid man said her blue sister  i would not believe him for a moment  only with a qualification rejoined the gentleman  but edmund couldnt you be sure that it is just what he would say whatever the people were  i am equally sure that the exaction of rents is not the way to see people at their best  come in come in  we have all our settling in to do and no time for you two to fight  edmund mary dorothea and sophia carbonel were second cousins who had always known one another in the house of the girls father a clergyman in a large country town  edmund had been in the army just in time for the final battles of the peninsular war and had since served with the army of occupation and in canada  he had always meant that mary should be his wife but the means were wanting to set up housekeeping until the death of an old uncle of his mothers made him heir to greenhow farm an estate bringing in about 500 pounds a year  mary and her next sister dora had in the meantime lost their parents and had been living with some relations in london where their much younger sister sophy was at school until edmund coming home looked over the farm decided that it would be a fit home for the sisters and retired from the army forthwith  thus then after a brief tour among the lakes they had taken up dora in london and here they were sophy was to join them when the holidays began  disorder reigned indeed within and hammers resounded nor was the passage easy among the packingcases that encumbered the narrow little vestibule whence the stairs ascended  under the verandah were the five sash windows of the three front rooms the door of course in the middle  each had a little shabby furniture to which the carbonels were adding and meant to add more the diningroom had already been papered with red flock in stripes the drawingroom with a very delicate white on which were traced in tender colouringbaskets of vine leaves and laburnums  dora gave a little scream  look  between the windows mary see the laburnums and grapes are hanging upward  stupid people exclaimed mary i see  happily it is only on that one piece but how edmund will be vexed  perhaps there is another piece unused  i am sure i hope there is  dont you know edmund fell in love with it at paris  it was his first provision for future housekeeping and it was lying laid up in lavender all these years till we were ready for it  it is only that one division which is a comfort  whats the matter and the master of the house came in  senseless beings  it must be covered directly  it is a desight to the whole room  here and he went out to the carpenter who was universal builder to the village and was laying down the stair carpet  here hewlett do you see what you have done  hewlett a large man with a smooth plump but honest face came in in his shirt sleeves apron and paper cap touched his forehead to the ladies stood and stared  cant you see sharply demanded the captain  hewlett scratched his head and gazed round  see here  how do grapes grow  or laburnums  an idea broke in on him  what they be topsyturvy he slowly observed after looking from the faulty breadth to the next  of course they are  find the rest of the paper  we must have a piece put on at once or the whole appearance of the room is spoilt said captain carbonel  it will make a delay but it must be done at once where is the piece left over  hewlett retreated to find it while the captain said something about stupid ass  presently his gruff voice was heard demanding dan i say wheres the remnant of that there fancy paper  dans answer did not rise into audible words but presently hewlett tramped back saying there aint none sir  i tell you there must be returned the captain in the same angry tones  and he proceeded to show that the number of pieces he had bought and the measure of which he had ascertained was such that there ought to have been halfapiece left over from papering the room the size of which he had exactly taken  hewlett could do nothing but stolidly repeat that there werent none left not enow to make a mouses nest  who did the papering  did you  daniel hewlett sir he did the most on it  my cousin sir  the captain fell upon daniel who had more words at command but was equally strong in denial of having any remnant  they had only skimped out enough he said just enough for the walls and it was a close fit anyhow  the captain loudly declared it impossible but mary ran out in the midst to suggest that mayhap the defect was in the french measure  each piece might not have been the true number of whatever they called them in that new revolutionary fashion  dan hewletts face cleared up  ay tis the french measure sure sir of course they cant do nothing true and straight  i be mortal sorry the ladies is disappointed but it baint no fault of mine sir  and look here edmund continued mary it will not spoil the room at all if mr hewlett will help move the tall bureau against it and well hang the death of general wolfe above it and then there wont be more than two bits of laburnum to be seen even if you are curious enough to get upon a chair to investigate  well it must be so returned captain carbonel but i hate the idea of makeshifts and having imperfections concealed  just like you edmund laughed dora  you will always seem to be looking right through at the upright sprays though all the solid weight of hume gibbon and rollin is in front of them  precisely said edmund  it is not well to feel that there is anything to be hidden  the chief part of the vexation is however he addedshutting the door and lowering his voicethat i am convinced that there must have been foul play somewhere  oh edmund french measure  nonsense  that does not account for at least a whole piece disappearing  he took out a pencil and went again into his calculations while his sisterinlaw indignantly exclaimed  it is all prejudice because that horrid attorney said all these poor people were a bad lot  hush hush said mrs carbonel rather frightened and  i advise you to think before you speak said captain carbonel quietly but sternly  still dora could not help saying as soon as she was alone with her sister i shall believe in the french measure  i like that slow dull man and i am sure he is honest  yes dear only pray dont say any more to edmund but let us get the bookcase placed as fast as we can and let him forget all about it    chapter two  the lie of the land    thank you pretty cow that gave   pleasant milk to soak my bread   every day and every night   warm and fresh and sweet and bright   j  taylor  darkness had descended before there had been time to do more than shake into the downstair rooms and bedrooms and be refreshed with the evening meal but with morning began the survey of the new home  the front part of the house had three living rooms with large sash windows almost to the ground shaded by the verandah  these were drawingroom diningroom and study the last taken out of the entry where was the staircase and there were three similar rooms above these had been added by the late owner to the original farmhouse with a fine oldfashioned kitchen that sent mary and dora into greater raptures than their cook  there were offices around a cool dairy where stood great red glazed pans of deliciouslooking cream and milk and a clean white wooden churn that dora longed to handle  the farmhouse rooms were between it and the new ones and there were a good many rooms above the redtiled roof rising much higher than that of the more modern part of the house  there was a narrow paling in front and then came the farmyard enclosed in barns cowhouses and cartsheds and a cottage where the bailiff master pucklechurch had taken up his abode having hitherto lived in the farmhouse  he was waiting to show captain carbonel over the farm  he was a grizzled stooping old fellow with a fine handsome sunburnt face bright shrewd dark eyes looking out between puckers a short white smockfrock and long gaiters  it was not their notion of a bailiff but the lawyer who was so chary of his praise had said that old master pucklechurch and his wife were absolutely trustworthy  they had managed the farm in the interregnum and brought him weekly accounts in their heads for neither could write with the most perfect regularity and minuteness  and his face did indeed bespeak confidence in his honesty as he touched his hat in answer to the greeting  the ladies however looked and smelt in some dismay for the centre of the yard was a mountain of manure and straw with a pucecoloured pond beside it  on the summit of the mountain a handsome ruddy cock with a splendid darkgreen arched tail clucked chuckled and scratched for his speckled rosecrowned hens a greenheaded curlytailed drake steered forth his fleet upon the lake of brown ducks and their yellow progeny and pigs of the plumpudding order rooted in the intermediate regions  the road which led to the cartsheds and to the house skirted round this unsavoury tract  oh edmund sighed mary  farmers wife mary said her husband smiling  it ought to be a perfect nosegay to you  im sure it is not wholesome she said looking really distressed and he dropped his teasing tone and said  of course it shall be remedied  i will see to it  a dismal screeching and cackling here attracted the attention of the sisters who started towards pucklechurchs cottage and the fowlhouse a very foul house by the by in front of which on a low wooden stool sat a tidy old woman betty pucklechurch in fact in a tall muslin cap spotted kerchief blue gown and coarse apron with a big girl before her holding the unfortunate hen whose cries had startled them  oh dont go near  she is killing it cried dora  no as the hen with a final squawk shook out her ruffled feathers and rushed away to tell her woes to her companions on the dunghill while the old woman jumped up smoothed down her apron and curtsied low  what were you doing asked mary still startled  only whipping her breast with nettles maam to teach her to sit close in her nest the plaguey thing and not be gadding after the rest  poor thing cried dora  but oh look look mary at the dear little chickens  they were in the greatest delight at the three broods of downy little chickens and one of ducklings whose parent hens were clucking in coops and in the kitchen they found a sickly one nursed in flannel in a basket and an orphaned lamb which staggered upon its disproportionate black legs at sight of betty  ay he be always after me she said  they terrify one terrible as if twas their mother till they can run with the rest  dora would have petted the lamb but it retreated from her behind bettys petticoats and she could only listen to marys questions about how much butter was made from how many cows milk and then be taken to see the two calves one of which betty pronounced to be but a staggering bob yet but george butcher would take he in a sennight which sounded so like senate that it set dora wondering what council was to pronounce on the fate of the poor infant bull  over his stall edmund found them after an inspection of the pigstyes and having much offended master pucklechurch by declaring that he would have them kept clean and the pigs no longer allowed to range about the yard  bless you sir the poor things would catch their death of cold and die was the answer to the one edict and to the other theyd never take to their victuals nor fat kindly without their range first  then let them have it in the homefield out there where i see plenty of geese  theyll spile every bit of grass sir was the growling objection and still worse was the suggestion which gradually rose into a command that the muckheap should be removed to the said homefield and never allowed to accumulate in such close proximity to the house  pucklechurch said little but his if it be your will sir sounded like a snarl and after ruminating for some time he brought outas if it were an answer to a question about the team of horses  well have to take on another boy let be a man if things is to be a that en a  let us then said the captain and joined his ladies with the old man depressed and grumbling inwardly  there was an orchard preparing to be beautiful with blossom and a considerable kitchen garden at the back and on the other side of the house bounded by an exceedingly dirty and berutted farm road over which the carriage had jolted the evening before  the extensive homefield in front was shut off from the approach by a belt of evergreens and sloped slightly upwards towards the hill which gave the parish its name  we will cut off a nice carriage road said mary as she looked at it  all in good time replied her husband not wishing further to shock poor master pucklechurch who had to conduct the party to the arable fieldsone of which was being ploughed by three fine sleek horses led by bill morris with his father at the shafts  in another their approach was greeted by hideous yells and shouts which made dora start  ay ay said pucklechurch he knows how to holler when he see me acoming and at the same time a blackspecked cloud of rooks rose up from the furrows the old man stamping towards the boy who ought to have been keeping them vituperating him in terms that it was as well not to hear  and it was such a tiny boy after all and in such a pair of huge boots with holes showing his bare toes  however they served him to run away from master pucklechurch into the furthest ditch and if the ladies had designs on him they had to be deferred  on the opposite side were more fields with crops in various stages one lovely with the growing wheat and barley another promising potatoes and another beans and beyond towards the river were meadows parted by broad hedgerows with paths between in which a few primroses and golden celandines looked up beneath the withy buds and the fluttering hazel catkins  then came the meadows in one of which fed the cows pretty buffandwhite creatures and in another field were hurdled the sheep among their dole of turnips sheep and turnips alike emitting an odour of the most unpleasant kind and the deep baas of the ewes and the thinner wail of the lambs made a huge mass of sounds while captain carbonel tried to talk to master buttermere the shepherd a silent crusty whitehaired old man in a green smock and grey old coat who growled out scarcely a word  so the tour of the property was made and old pucklechurch expressed his opinion  hell never make nothing of it he is too outlandish and full of his fancies and his madams a fine lady  pon my word and honour she was frought at that there muckheap  this pleasant augury was of course not known to the newcomers who found something so honest and worthy about the pucklechurches that they could not help liking them though mrs carbonel had another tussle with betty about fresh butter  it war no good to make it more than once a week  folk liked it tasty and meller and that the carbonels had by no means the same likings made her hold up her hands and agree with her husband that their failure was certain  these first few days were spent in the needful arrangements of house and furniture during which time captain carbonel came to the conclusion that no one could be more stupid or awkward than master hewlett but that he was an honest man and tried to do his best such as it was while his relation dan though cleverer was much more slippery and could not be depended upon  dora asked master hewlett what schools there were in the place and he made answer that the little ones went in to dame verdon but she didnt make much of it not since she had had the shaking palsy and she could not give the lads the stick  he thought of sending his biggest lad to school at poppleby next spring but twas a long way and his good woman didnt half like it not unless there was some one going the same way  betty pucklechurchs account amounted to much the same  dame verdon had had the school nigh about forty years  she had taught them all to read their testament all as stayed long enough for there was plenty for the children to do and folks said she wasnt up to hitting them as she used to be  farmer goodenough the churchwarden who came to see captain carbonel about the letting of a field which was mixed up with the greenhow property gave something of the like character  she is getting old certain sure but she is a deserving woman and she keeps off the parish  but can she teach the children  she can teach them all they need to know and keep the little ones out of mischief said the farmer perhaps beginning to be alarmed  no use to learn them no more  what do they want of it for working in the fields or milking the cows  they ought at least to know their duty to god and their neighbour said captain carbonel  is there no sunday school  no sirvery bluntly  i hear talk of such things at poppleby and the like he added but we dont want none of them here  the lot here are quite bad enough without maggots being put into their heads  captain carbonel did not wish to continue the subject  the farmers own accent did not greatly betoken acquaintance with schools of any sort  of course the wife and sister were amused as well as saddened by his imitative account of the farmers last speech but they meant to study the subject on their first sunday  they had learnt already that uphill priors was a daughter church to downhill priors and had only one service on a sunday alternate mornings and evenings  the vicar was the head of a house at oxford and only came to the parsonage in the summer the services were provided for by a curate living at downhill with the assistance of the master of a private school to whom the vicarage was let  when captain carbonel asked master pucklechurch about the time he answered well sir tis morning churching  so it will be halfpast ten or else eleven or else no time at all  what do you mean that there will be none  no sir  there will be churching sure enough but just as time may chance not to call it an hour  best way is to start as soon as you sights the parson acoming past the gate down there  then youre sure to be in time  bell strikes out as soon as they sees him beyond the priors lane  the carbonels in sunday trim with william the manservant and two maids their prayerbooks in white pockethandkerchiefs following in the rear set forth for the gate in the spring freshness  the grass in the fields was beginning to grow up the hedges were sprouting with tender greens and reds the polished stems of the celandine were opening to the sunshine in the banks with here and there a primrose  birds were singing all round and a lark overheadmost delightful pleasures to those so long shut up in a town  it was the side of a hill where the fields were cut out into most curious forms probably to suit the winding of a little brook or the shape of the ground and there were near the bottom signs of a mass of daffodils which filled the sisters with delight though daffodils were not then the fashion and were rather despised as yellow and scentless  as they came near the second gate they saw a black figure go by on an old white horse then they came out on a long ascending lane with deep ruts bordered by fresh soft turf on either sides with hawthorn hedges and at intervals dark yew trees  a cracked bell struck up by which they understood that the clergyman had come in sight and they came themselves out upon a village green where geese donkeys and boys in greenish smockfrocks seemed to be all mixed up together  thatched cottages stood round the green and a publichousethe fox and hounds  the sign consisted of a hunt elaborately cut out in tin huntsman dogs and fox rushing across from the inn on a high uplifted rod of iron fastened into a pole on the further side of the road whence the sound of the bell proceeded and whither the congregation in smockfrocks and black bonnets were making their way  following in this direction the carbonels much amused passed under the hunt went some distance further and found a green churchyard quite shut in by tall elm trees which from the road almost hid the tiny tumbledown church from whose wooden belfry the call proceeded it really seemed to be buried in the earth and the little side windows looked out into a ditch  there were two steps to go down into the deep porch and within there seemed to be small space between the roof and the top of the high square pew into which they were ushered by master hewlett who it seemed was the parish clerk  they saw little from it but on one side hung from the roof a huge panel with the royal arms painted in the reign of william and mary as the initials in the corners testified and with the lion licking his lips most comically on the other side was a great patch of green damp behind a gallery full of white smockfrocked men with their knees thrust through the rails in front  immediately before them rose the tall erection of pulpit the fusty old cushion and tassels each faded to a different tint overhanging so much that dora could not help thinking that a thump from an energetic preacher would send it down on edmunds head in a cloud of dust  there was the readingdesk below whence the edges of a ragged prayerbook protruded and above it presently appeared a very full but muchfrayed surplice and a thin worn face between white whiskers  the service was quietly and reverently read but not a response seemed to come from anywhere except from master hewletts powerful lungs somewhere in the rear and there was a certain murmur of chattering in the chancel followed by a resounding whack then master hewletts head was seen and his steps heard as he tramped along the aisle and climbed up the gallery stairs as the general thanksgiving began and there he shouted out the number of the psalm new version that is from brady and tate which every one had bound up with the prayerbook  then a bassoon brayed and a fiddle squealed and the psalm resounded with hearty goodwill and better tone than could have been expected  master hewlett stayed to assist in the second singing and the children who sat on low forms and on the chancel step profited by it to make their voices more audible than the commandments though the clergyman had not gone to the altar and once in the course of the sermon captain carbonel was impelled to stand up and look over the edge of the pew when he beheld a battle royal going on over a length of string between a boy in a blue petticoat and one in a fustian jacket  at the unwonted sight the fustianclad let go and blue petticoat tumbled over backwards kicking up a great pair of red legs grey socks and imperfect but elephantine boots and howling at the same time  the preacher stopped short the clerk had by this time worked his way down from the gallery and collaring both the antagonists hauled them out into the churchyard the triple stamping being heard on the pavement all the way  the sermon was resumed and read to its conclusion  it was a very good one but immensely beyond the capacity of the congregation and mary carbonel had a strong suspicion that she had heard it before  it was only on coming out that any notion could be gathered of the congregation  there were a good many men and big boys in smocks a few green but most of them beautifully white and embroidered their wearers had sat without books through the whole service and now came out with considerable trampling  the pews contained the young girls in gorgeous colours the old women and the better class of people but not many of them for the petit noblesse of uphill were very petit indeed in means and numbers but their bonnets were enormous and had red or purple bows standing upright on them and the farmers had drab coats and long gaiters  the old dames curtsied low the little girls stared and the boys peeped out from behind the slanting old headstones and grinned  some of them had been playing at marbles on the top of the one square old monument until routed by master hewlett on his coming out with the two combatants  captain carbonel had gone round to the vestry door to make acquaintance with the clergyman though farmer goodenough informed him in an audible whisper he aint the right one sir he be only schoolmaster  and when the two met at the door and the captain shook hands and said that they would be neighbours he was received with a certain hesitating smile  i should tell you sir that i am only taking occasional duty here assisting  i am mr atkins  i have a select private academy at the vicarage which the president of saint cyrils lets to me  he is here in the summer holidays  i understand  the curate lives at downhill said captain carbonel  at the priory in fact with his fathers family  yes it is rather an unfortunate state of affairs he said answering the captains countenance rather than his words but i have no responsibility  i merely assist in the sunday duty and indeed i advise you to have as little to do with the uphill people as possible  an idle goodfornothing set  any magistrate would tell you that theres no parish where they have so many up before them  no wonder said captain carbonel under his breath  a bad set repeated mr atkins pausing at the shed where his old grey horse was put up and there they parted  the captain and his wife and her sister walked to downhill two miles off across broad meadows a river and a pretty old bridge the next sunday morning found the church scantily filled but with more respectablelooking people and heard the same sermon over again so that mary was able to identify it with one in a published volume    chapter three  the turnip field    you ask me why the poor complain   and these have answered thee   southey  hullo molly hewlett whod ha thought of seeing you out here  it was in a wet turnip field and a row of women were stooping over it picking out the weeds  the one that was best off had great boots a huge weight to carry in themselves but most had them sadly torn and broken  their skirts of no particular colour were tucked up and they had either a very old mans coat or a smockfrock cut short or a small old woollen shawl which last left the blue and red arms bare on their heads were the oldest of bonnets or here and there a sunbonnet which looked more decent  one or two babies were waiting in the hedgeside in the charge of little girls  molly hewlett exclaimed another of the set straightening herself up why i thought your dan was working with master hewlett for they gobblealls which was what uphill made of carbonel  so he be but what is a poor woman to do when more than half his wage goes to the fox and hounds and she has five children to keep and my poor sister not able to do a turn  theres george hewlett grumbling and growling at him too and no one knows how long hell keep him on  what  george his cousin as was bound to keep him on  i dont know george is that particular himself and them new folks gobbleall as they call them are right down mean and come down on you if they misses one little mossle of parkisit and theres my poor sister to keepas is afflicted and cant do nothing  but she pays you handsome said betsy seddon and looks after the children besides  pays indeed  not half enough to keep her with all the trouble of helping her about  not that i grudges it but she wants things extry you see and dan he dont like it  but no doubt the ladies will take notice of her  i thought the lady kind enough interposed another woman  she noticed how lame our granny was with the rheumatics and told me to send up for broth  we wants somewhat bad enough returned another thin woman with her hand to her side  nobody never does nothing for no one here  nor we dont want no one to come worriting and terrifying cried the last of the group with fierce black eyes and rusty black hair sticking out beyond her mans beaver hat tied on with a yellow handkerchief always at one about church and school and meddling with everything the ribbon on ones bonnet and to the very pots on the fire  i knows what they be like in tydeby  and what do you get by it but old cast clothes and broth made of dishwashings  she enforced all this with more than one word not to be written  i know id be thankful for that murmured the thin woman who looked as if she had barely a petticoat on and could have had scarcely a breakfast  oh we all knows bessy mole is all for what she can get said the independent woman tossing her head  and had need to be returned molly hewlett in a scornful tone which made the poor woman in question stoop all the lower and pull her groundsel more diligently  the broth aint bad ventured she who had tried it  i shall see what i can get out of them added another  i baint proud and my poor childrens shoes is a shame to see  youll not get much said molly hewlett with a sniff  the captain as they calls him come down on my jem as was taking home a little bit of a chip for the fire and made him put it down as cross as could be  how now you lazy trolloping gossiping women  what are you after  farmer goodenough was upon them and the words he showered on them were not by any means good enough to be repeated here  he stormed at them for their idleness so furiously as to set off the babies in the hedge screaming and yelling  tirzah todd the gipsylooking woman whom he especially abused tossed her head and marched off in the midst growling fiercely to quiet her child and he sending a parting imprecation after her directed his violence upon poor bessy mole though all this time she had been creeping on shaking trembling and crying under the pelting of the storm but unluckily in her nervousness and blindness from tears she pulled up a young turnip and the farmer fell on her and rated her hotly for not being worth half her wage and doing him more harm than good with her carelessness  she had not a word to say for herself and went on shivering and trying to check her sobs while he shouted out that he only employed her from charity and she had better look out or he should turn her off at once  oh sir dont then came out with a burst of tears  my poor children  dont go whining about your children but let me see you do your work  however this last sentence was in a milder tone as if the fit of passion had exhausted itself and mr goodenough found his way back to the path that crossed the fields and went on  tirzah todd set her teeth clenched her fist and shook it after him while the other women as soon as he was out of sight began to console bessy mole who was crying bitterly and saying what would become of her poor children and her own poor father  never you mind bessy said molly hewlett every one knows as how old goodenoughs bark is worse than his bite  he runs out and its over put in betsy seddon  im sure i can hardly keep about any way sobbed the widow  my inside is all of a quake  i cant abide words  ten to one he dont give you another sixpence a week after all added nanny barton  he aint no call to run out at one said tirzah standing upright and flourishing her baby  id like to give him as good as he gave an old foulmouthed brute  look there  theres the ladies coming exclaimed nanny barton  i thought there was some reason why he stopped his jaw so soon exclaimed molly stooping down and pulling up weeds including turnips with undiscerning energy in which all the others followed her example except tirzah who sulkily retreated under the hedge with her baby while jem hewlett and lizzie seddon ran forward for better convenience of staring  it was a large field and the party were still a good way off but as it sloped downwards behind the women the farmer must have seen them a good deal before the weeders had done so  these be it remembered were days when both farmers and their labourers were a great deal rougher in their habits than we their grandchildren can remember them and there was besides the old poor law which left the amount of relief and of need to be fixed at the vestry meetings by the ratepayers themselves of each parish alone so that the poor were entirely dependent on the goodwill or judgment of their employers whose minds were divided between keeping down the wages and the rates and who had little of real principle or knowledge to guide them  it was possible to have recourse to the magistrates at the petty sessions who could give an order which would override the vestry but it was apt to be only the boldest and often the least deserving who could make out the best apparent cases for themselves that ventured on such a measure  the two ladies stopped and spoke to molly hewlett and nanny barton whom they had seen at their doors and who curtsied low and nanny as she saw mrs carbonels eyes fall on her boots put in  yes maam tis bitter hard work this cold damp weather and wears out ones shoes terble  these be an old pair of my mans and hurts my poor feet dreadful all over broken chilblains as they be and my fingers too she added spreading out some fingers the colour of beetroot with dirty rags rolled round two of them  dora shrank  and you can go on weeding with them  yes maam  what can us do when ones man gets but seven shillings a week  and ive had six children and buried three and her face looked ready for tears  well we will come and see you and try to find something to help you said mrs carbonel  where do you live  out beyond the church maama long way for a lady  oh we are good walkers  and please my lady now said molly coming to the front if you could give me an old bit of a pelisse or anything to make up for my boy there  hes getting big you see and he is terrible bad off for clothes  i dont know what is to be done for the lot of em  dora had recognised in the staring boy who had come up close him who had made the commotion in church and she ventured to say i remember him  dont you think if you or his father kept him with you in church he would behave better there  bless you miss his father is a sceptic  i cant go while ive got no clothesnothing better than this miss and i always was used to go decent and respectable  besides i couldnt nohow take he into the seat with me as master pucklechurch would say i was upsetting of his missus  well i hope to see him behave better next sunday  do you hear jem  the lady is quite shocked at your rumbustiousness but twas all joe saunderss fault maam a terrifying the poor children  his father will give him the stick that he will if he hears of it again  meantime mrs carbonel had turned to widow mole who after her first curtsey had been weeding away diligently and coughing  where do you live she asked  i dont think i have seen you before  no maam she said quietly  i live down the black hollow  you dont look well  have you been ill  you have a bad cough  it aint nothing maam thank you  i can keep about well enough  do you take anything for it  a little yarb tea at night sometimes maam  we will try and bring you some mixture for it said mrs carbonel and then she spoke to betsy seddon who for a wonder had no request on her tongue and asked her who the other woman was in the hedge with the baby  thats tirzah todd maam began mrs seddon but molly hewlett thrust her aside and went on being always the most ready with words she is reuben todds wife and i wouldnt wish to say no harm of her but she comes of a gipsy lot and hasnt never got into ways that us calls reverend though i wouldnt be saying no harm of a neighbour maam  no youd better not exclaimed a voice for tirzah was nearer or had better ears than mrs daniel hewlett had suspected though i maynt go hypercriting about and making tales of my neighbours as if you hadnt got a man what aint to be called sober twice a week  hush hush broke in mrs carbonel we dont want to hear all this i hope no one will tell us unkind things of our new neighbours for we want to be friends with all of you especially with that brighteyed baby  how old is it  she made it smile by nodding to it and tirzah was mollified enough to say four months maam but she have a tooth coming  whats her name  tirzah showed her pretty white teeth in a smile  well maam my husband he doth want to call her jane arter his mother cause tis a good short name but i calls her hoglah arter my sister as died  then she hasnt been christened  no  you see we couldnt agree nor get gossips and that there parson he be always in such a mighty hurry or id a had her halfbaptized hoglah and then reuben he couldnt hinder it  tirzah was getting quite confidential to mrs carbonel and dora meantime was talking to molly hewlett but here it occurred to the former that they must not waste the womens time and they wished them goodbye dora fearing however that there would be a quarrel between tirzah and molly  oh dear oh dear she sighed couldnt you make peace between those two she said they will fight it out  no i think the fear of the farmer and the need of finishing their work will avert the storm for the present at least said mary and i thought the more i said the worse accusations i should hear  but what people they are  i do begin to believe that attorney man that they are a bad lot  dont be disheartened dora no one has tried yet apparently to do anything for them  we must try to see them in their own homes  beginning with mrs seddon  she was quiet and civil and did not beg  neither did that thin little woman  i should like to give her a flannel petticoat  there is a look of want about her  but im most taken with the wild woman with the teeth and the eyes and the merry smile  i am sure there is fun in her  little enough fun poor things sighed mrs carbonel  she was more used to poor people  she had more resolution though less enthusiasm than her sister    chapter four  nobodys business    for the rector dont live on his living like other christian sort of   folkst  hood  the sisters found on coming home that a very handsome chestnut horse was being walked up and down before the front door and their manservant william informed them that it belonged to the clergyman  as they advanced to the verandah captain carbonel and his visitor came out to meet them and mr ashley selby was introduced  he looked more like a sportsman than a clergyman except for his black coat he had a happy healthy sunburnt face top boots and a ridingwhip in his hand and informed mrs carbonel that his father and mother would have the honour of calling on her in a day or two  they had an impression that he had come to reconnoitre and decide whether they were farmers or gentry  we have been trying to make acquaintance with some of your flock said mary  the last thing i would advise you to do he answered there are not a worse lot anywhere  desperate poachers  not a head of game safe from them  perhaps they may be improved  he shrugged his shoulders  see what my father has to say of them  is there much distress  there ought not to be for old dr fogram and my father send down a handsome sum for blankets and coals every christmas and uphill takes care to get its share  he laughed  no sinecure distributing  we have not been to see the school yet  a decrepit old crone poor old body  she will soon have to give in she cant even keep the children from pulling off her spectacles  and sunday school  well my father doesnt approve of cramming the poor children  i believe the methodists have something of the kind at downhill but there is no one to attend to one here and the place is quite free of dissent  cause and effect said captain carbonel drily  would you object if we tried to teach the poor children something asked mrs carbonel cautiously  oh no not at all  all the good ladies are taking it up i believe mrs grantley of poppleby is great at it and i see no harm in it but youll have to reckon with my father  he says there will soon be no ploughmen and my mother says there will be no more cooks or housemaids youd better write to old fogram hell back you up  mary had it on her lips to ask him about widow mole but he had turned to edmund to discuss the hunting and the shooting of the neighbourhood they discovered partly at this time and partly from other visitors that he was the younger son of the squire of downhill who had been made to take holy orders without any special fitness for it because there was a living likely soon to be ready for him and in the meantime he was living at home an amiable harmless young man but bred up so as to have no idea of the duties of his vocation and sharing freely in the sports of his family acting as if he believed like his father that they were the most important obligations of man and accepting the general household belief that only the methodistical could wish for more religious practice  be it understood that all this happened in the earlier years of the century and would be impossible under the revival of the church that has since taken place  no one now can hold more than one piece of preferment at a time so that parishes cannot be left unprovided  nor could ashley selby be ordained without a preparation and examination which would have given him a true idea of what he undertook or would have prevented his ordination  this however was at a time when the work of the church had grown very slack and when a better spirit was beginning to revive  the father of mary and dora had been a zealous and earnest man and both they and edmund had really serious ideas of duty and of the means of carrying them out  in london they had heard sermons which had widened and deepened their views but they had done no work as the relation with whom they lived thought it impossible and improper for young ladies there  thus they were exceedingly desirous of doing what they could to help the place where their lot was cast and they set forth to reconnoitre  first they found their way to the school which stood on the border of the village green a picturesque thatched cottage with a honeysuckle and two tall poplars outside  but strange sounds guided them on their way and the first thing they saw was a stout boy of four or five years old in petticoats bellowing loudly outside and trying to climb the wicket gate which was firmly secured by a rusty chain  mary tried to undo the gate speaking meanwhile to the urchin but he rushed away headlong back into the school and they heard him howling they bees acoming  a big girl in a checkered pinafore came out and made a curtsey assisting to undo the chain  what has he been doing asked dora  he be a mortial bad boy answered the girl  heve been getting at dame verdons sugar  and what is your name asked mrs carbonel  lizzie verdon maam  i helps grannie  grannie did seem in need of help  there she sat in a big wooden chair by the fire the very picture of an old dame with a black bonnet highcrowned and crescent shaped in front with a white muslin cap below a buff handkerchief crossed over her shoulders a dark shortsleeved gown long mittens covering her arms and a checkered apron a regular orthodox birchrod by her side and a black cat at her feet  but her head was shaking with palsy and she hardly seemed to understand what lizzie screamed into her ear that here was the ladies  but the door which they had shut in the face of their spaniel was thrust open  up went the cats back bristle went her tail her eyes shot sparks and she bounded to the top of her mistresss chair  dandy barked defiance all the children shouted or screamed and danced about and the old woman gasped and shook more  lizzie alone was almost equal to the occasion  she flew at the cat who was standing on tiptoe on the tall back of the chair with huge tail and eyes like green lamps swearing hissing and spitting and regardless of scratches caught him up by the scruff of his neck and disposed of him behind the staircase door while dora at the same moment secured dandy by the collar and rushing out put him over the garden gate and shut both that and the door  mary afraid that the old lady was going to have a fit went up to her with soothing apologies but the unwonted sight seemed to confuse her the more and she began crying  lizzie however came to the rescue  she evidently had all her wits about her  first she called out order children  dont you see the ladies  sit down jem hewlett or ill after you with the stick  then as the children ranged themselves she stamped at some to enforce her orders shook the rod at others and set up the smallest like so many ninepins handling them by the shoulder on one small bench interspersing the work with consolations to granny and explanations to the ladies who were about to defer their visit  granny now never you mind  tip is all right upstairs  benny you bad boy ill be at you  dont go please lady  bet what be doin to jim  never mind granny  susan pucklechurch youll read to the lady so pretty  about five children more tidily dressed than the others had a whole and sound form to themselves near the fire and the mistress  the other two benches were propped the one on two blocks of wood the other on two sound and two infirm legs and this was only balanced by a child at each end so that when one got up the whole tumbled down or flew up but the seat was very low and the catastrophe generally produced mirth  susan pucklechurch granddaughter to the old bailiff and his betty was evidently the show scholar  she be in her testament maam explained lizzie and accordingly a terribly thumbed and dilapidated new testament was put into the childs hand from which she proceeded to bawl out with long pauses between the words and spelling the longest a piece of the sermon on the mount selected because there were no names in it  it was a painful performance to reverent ears and as soon as practicable mrs carbonel stopped it with good child and a penny and asked what the others read  those who were not in the testament read the universal spellingbook provided at their own expense but not in much better condition and from this george hewlett son and heir to the carpenter and a very different person from his cousin jem read the history of the defence of that city where each trade offered its own commodity for the defence even to the cobbler who proposed to lay in a stock of good leatherlather  these and three little maidens who had picture spellingbooks not going beyond monosyllables were the aristocracy and sat apart shielded from the claws and teeth of their neighbours in consideration of paying fourpence instead of twopence a week  the boy was supposed to write large letters on a slate and the bigger girls did some needlework and not badlyindeed it was the best of their performances  the dame went on mumbling and shaking all the time and it was quite evident that she was entirely past the work and that lizzie was the real mistress indeed mrs carbonel was inclined to give her credit for a certain talent for teaching and keeping order when the sisters emerged from the close little oven of a place hardly knowing whether to laugh or cry but full of great designs  captain carbonel however to their disappointment advised them to wait to set anything on foot till dr fogram the president of saint cyrils came down in the summer holidays when counsel could be taken with him and there would be more knowledge of the subject  dora did not like this at all  she was sure that the son of mist as she was naughty enough to call the doctor would only hamper them and she was only half consoled by being told that there was no objection to her collecting a few of the children on sunday and trying to teach them and in the meantime acquaintance might be made with the mothers    chapter five  at home    now ive gone through all the village from end to end   save and except one more house   but i havent come to that and i hope i never shall   and thats the village poor house   t  hood  cottage visiting turned out to be a much chequered affair  one of the first places to which the sisters made their way was the widow moles they found it rather beyond the church down a lane where it was hidden behind an overgrown thorn hedge and they would scarcely have found it at all if a threeyearold child had not been clattering an old bit of metal against the bar put across to prevent his exit  he was curly and clean except with the days surface dirt but he only stared stolidly at the question whether mrs mole lived there  a tenyearold girl came out and answered the question  yes mother do live here but her be out at work  is that your grandfather as they caught sight of a very old man on a chair by the door in the sun  yes maam  will you come in and see him  he was a very old man with scanty white hair but he was very clean and neatly dressed in a white smock mended all over but beautifully worked over the breast and cuffs and long leather buskins  he was very civil too  he took off his old straw hat and rose slowly by the help of his stout stick though the first impulse of the visitors was to beg him not to move  he did not hear them but answered their gesture  i be so crippled up with the rheumatics you see maam and he put his knotted and contracted hand up to his ear  mrs carbonel shouted into his ear that she was sorry for him  she supposed his daughter was out at work  yes maam with farmer goodenougha charing today it is  washing screamed the little girl  she was off at five oclock this morning he went on  she do work hard my daughter bess and shes a good one to me and so is little liz here  thank the lord for them  and her husband is dead  yes maam  fell off a haystack three years ago and never spoke no more  we have always kept off the parish maam  this bit of a cottage was my poor wifes and she do want to leave it to the boy but she be but frail poor maid and if she gave in thered be nothing for it but to give up the place and go to the workhouse and theres such a lot there as i could not go and die among  he spoke it to the sympathising faces not as one begging and they found out that all was as he said  he had seen better days and held his head above the parish pay and so had his soninlaw but the early death of poor mole and the old mans crippled state had thrown the whole maintenance of the family on the poor young widow who was really working herself to death while repairs being impossible the cottage was almost falling down  oh what a place and what a dear old man cried the ladies as they went out  well we can do something here  ill come and read to him every week exclaimed dora  and i will knit him a warm jacket said mary and surely edmund could help them to prop up that wretched cottage  what a struggle their lives must have been and so patient and good where are we going now  i believe that is the workhouse behind the church said mary  that roughtiled roof  it has a bend in the middle like a broken back  i must sketch it said dora  why theres edmund getting over the churchyard stile  ay he cant keep long away from you madam mary  were you going to the workhouse said captain carbonel coming up and offering an arm to each lady as was the fashion in those days  we thought of it  all the poorest people are there of course  and the worst said the captain  no i will not have you go there it is not fit for you  for besides that he was very particular about his ladies and had no notion of letting them go to all the varieties of evil where they could hope to do good like the ladies of our days the workhouse was an utterly different place from the strictly disciplined union houses of the present poor law  each parish had its own and that of uphill had no master no order but was the refuge of all the disorderly disreputable people who could not get houses or pay their rent who lived in any kind of fashion on parish pay and what they could get and were under no restraint  while the captain was explaining to them what he had heard from farmer goodenough a sudden noise of shouting and laughing with volleys of evil words was heard near the fox and hounds  what is that asked dora of a tidy young woman coming her way  thats only the chaps at old sam she answered as if it was an ordinary sound  and on them exclaiming she explained  samson sanderson thats his name sir  he be what they calls noncompos and the young fellows at the fox and hounds they have their fun out of he  they do bait he shameful  violent shouts of foul words and riotous laughter could be distinguished so plainly that captain carbonel hastily thrust his wife and sister into the nearest cottage and marched into the group of rough men and boys who stood holloaing rude jokes and laughing at the furious oaths and abuse in intermittent gasps with which they were received  for shame his indignant voice broke in  are you not ashamed unmanly fellows to treat a poor weak lad in this way  there was a moments silence  then a great hulking drover called out bless you sir he likes it  the more shame for you exclaimed the captain to bait a poor innocent lad with horrid blasphemy and profanity  i tell you every one of you ought to be fined  the men began to sneak away from the indignant soldier  the poor idiot burst out crying and howling and the ostler came forward pulling his forelock and saying youll not be hard on em sir  tis all sport there sammy dont be afeared  gentleman means you no harm  captain carbonel held out some coppers saying there my poor lad theres something for you  only dont let me hear bad words again  sam muttered something and pulled his ragged hat forward as he shambled off into some back settlements of the publichouse while the ostler went on  tis just their game sir  none of em would hurt poor sam  theyd treat him the next minute sir  all in sport  strange sport said the captain to teach a poor helpless lad who ought to be as innocent as a babe that abominable blasphemy  he dont mean nought sir  alls one to he  all the worse in those who do know better i tell you and you may tell your master that if this goes on i shall certainly speak to the magistrates  there was no need to tell the landlord mr oldfellow  the captain was plainly enough to be heard through the window of the bar  the drovers had no notion that their amusement was sinful for it didnt hurt no one and in fact getting a rise out of softy sam was one of the great attractions of the fox and hounds so that mr oldfellow was of the same mind as dan hewlett who declared that they gobblealls was plaguey toads of methodys and wasnt to think to bully them about like his soldiers  they had another drink all round to recover from their fright when they treated softy sam but took care not to excite him to be noisy while the captain might be within earshot  the two ladies had meanwhile taken refuge in what proved to be no other than mrs daniel hewletts house a better one and less scantily provided with furniture than the widow moles but much less clean and neat  the door stood open and there was a tub full of soapsuds within  the captain gave a low whistle to intimate his presence and stood at the entrance  unwashed dinner things were on a round table a dresser in confusion against the wall on another moores almanack for some years past full of frightful catastrophes mixed with little french highlycoloured pictures of the blessed virgin  his wife and her sister were seated the one on a whole straw chair the other on a rickety one conversing with a very neat pale and pleasantlooking invalid young woman evidently little able to rise from her wooden armchair  molly hewlett in a coarse apron and a cap far back amid the rusty black tangles of her hair her arms just out of the washtub was in the midst of a voluble discourse into which the ladies would not break  you see maam she was in a right good situation but she was always unlucky and she had the misfortune to fall down the attic stairs with the baby in her arms  the baby was not hurt put in the invalid  not it the little toad but twas saving he as ricked her back somehow and made her a cripple for life as you see maam and she was six months in the hospital till the doctor he say as how he couldnt do nothing more for her so hewlett and me we took her in as she is my own sister you see and we couldnt let her go to the workhouse but she do want a little broth or a few extrys now and then maam more than we poor folks can give her  my mistress is very good and gives me a little pension put in the invalid while her sister looked daggers at her and mrs carbonel in obedience to her husbands signal took a hasty leave  there now  thats the way of you judith cried molly hewlett banging the door behind them  what should you go for to tell the ladies of that pitiful pay of yours but to spile all chance of their helping us nasty mean skinflints as they be  i couldnt go for to deceive them humbly replied judith meek but cowering under the coming storm  who asked you to deceive  only to hold your tongue for your own good and mine and my poor childrens that you just live upon  as if your trumpery pay was worth your board and all the trouble i has with you night and day but you must come in and hinder these new folk from coming down liberal with your methody ways and your pride  thats it your pride maam  oh im an unhappy woman between you and dan  i am  molly sank into a chair put her apron over her face and cried rocking herself to and fro while judith with tears in her eyes tried gentle consolations all in vain till molly remembered her washing and rose up moaning and lamenting  meantime mrs carbonel and her sister were exclaiming in pity that this was a dear good girl though edmund shook his head over her surroundings  i wonder how to make her more comfortable said dora  she seemed so much pleased when i promised to bring her something to read  i am afraid those hewletts prey on her said mary  and patronising her will prove a complicated affair said the captain  he wanted them to come home at once but on the way they met nanny barton who began with low curtsies a lamentable story about her girls having no clothes and she would certainly have extracted a shilling from miss carbonel if the captain had not been there  never accept stories told on the spur of the moment he said  then betsy seddon and tirzah todd came along together bending under heavy loads of broken branches for their fires  tirzah smiled as usual and showed her pretty teeth but the captain looked after her and said they have been tearing mr selbys woods to pieces  what can they do for firewood said his wife  let us look out the rules of your fathers coal store and shoe club he said    chapter six  the neighbourhood    through slush and squad   when roads was bad   but hallus stop at the vine and hop   tennyson  through all pucklechurchs objections and evident contempt for his fancies and those of young madam captain carbonel insisted on the clearance of the yard  he could not agree with the old man who made free to tell him that such as that there muckheap was just a bucket to a farmers wife if she was to be called a farmers wifewas that it  with some reflection captain carbonel decided that a bucket might mean a bouquet and answered maybe she might have too much of a good thing when i went down to farmer bells the other day they had a famous heap and i was struck with the sickly look of his wife and daughters  his missus were always a poor nesh ooman returned pucklechurch  and i dont mean mine to be like her if i can help it said the captain  but he did not reckon on the arrival of a prancing pair of horses with a smart open carriage containing two ladies and a gentleman in the most odorous part of the proceedings when he was obliged to clear the way from a halfloaded waggon to make room for them and what was quite as inconvenient to hurry up the back stairs to his dressingroom to take off his long gaiters blucher boots as half high ones were then called and old shooting coat and make himself presentable  in fact when he came into the room dora was amused at the perceptible look of surprised approval of the fine tall soldierly figure as he advanced to meet mr and mrs selby and their daughter the nearest neighbours who were of course in the regular course of instruction of the newcomers in the worthlessness and ingratitude of uphill and the impossibility of doing anything for the good of the place  mary was very glad that he interrupted the subject by saying merrily you caught me in the midst of my augean stable  i hope next time you are kind enough to visit us that the yard may be in a more respectable condition  mr selby observed that it was unpardonable not to have done the work beforehand and the captain answered on the contrary it was reserved as a fragrant bucket or bouquet for a farmers wife  whereat the visitors looked shocked and mary made haste to observe but we do hope to make a better road to the house through the fields  there is a great deal to be done first said dora who thought the observation rather weak  nothing else that was interesting took place on this occasion  mr selby asked the captain whether he hunted and gave him some information on the sport of all kinds in the neighbourhood  miss selby asked dora if she liked archery music and drawing  mrs selby wanted to recommend a housemaid and advised mrs carbonel against ever taking a servant from the neighbourhood  and then they all turned to talk of the evil doings of the parish thieves poachers idlers drunkards and to warn the carbonels once more against hoping to improve them  the horses could be heard pawing and jingling outside and as the ladies rose to take leave captain carbonel begged leave to hurry out and clear the coast  and it was well that he did so for he had to turn back a whole procession of cows coming in to be milked and sundry pigs behind them  the farm court was finished and never was so bad again the animals being kept from spending their day there except the poultry in which mary took great delight  soon came more visitors and it became a joke to the husband and sister that she always held out hopes of the future drive when they arrived bumped or mired by the long lane  marys approach as edmund called it had to be deferred till more needful work was done  the guests whom they best liked mr and mrs grantley the clergyman and his wife from the little town of poppleby gave an excellent and hopeful account of their rector dr fogram who was they said a really good man and very liberal  mrs grantley was interested in schools and poor people as it was easy to discover and mary and dora were soon talking eagerly to her and hearing what was done at poppleby but there were gentry and prosperous tradespeople there who could be made available as subscribers or teachers so that their situation was much more hopeful than that of the carbonels who had not the authority of the clergyman  poppleby was a much larger place than downhill on the post road to london  the mailcoach went through it and thence posthorses were hired and chaises from the george inn  the carbonels possessed a phaeton and a horse which could be used for driving or riding and thus captain carbonel took the two ladies to return the various calls that had been made upon them  they found the selbys not at home but were warmly welcomed by the grantleys and spent the whole afternoon with them and at doras earnest request were taken to see the schools  so different was the taste and feeling of those days that though poppleby church was a very fine old onein grand architecture such as in these days is considered one of the glories of the countryno one thought of going to look at it and the effect of mr grantleys excellent sermons had been the putting up of a new gallery right across the chancel arch  it had a fine tower and steeple and this dora thought of as a delightful subject for a sketch from the parsonage garden  she made great friends with lucy grantley the eldest daughter over their tastes in drawing as well as in the waverley novels and in poetry and was invited to spend a long day at poppleby and take a portrait of the steeple  after the calls had been made and returned began the dinnerparties elmour priory was so near greenhow that it would have been easy to walk there across the fields or to drive in the phaeton especially as the hours were much earlier and six or halfpast was held to be a late dinner hour but this would have been contrary to etiquette especially the first time with people who evidently thought much of style and the carbonels were not superior to such considerations which wereor were supposed to beof more importance in those days  so a chaise was ordered and they went in state and had a long dull evening chiefly enlivened by the miss selbys and dora playing on the piano  as they were going home all round by the road when they were near the top of the hill before they came to the fox and hounds the postilion first shouted and then came to a sudden stop  the captain putting his head out at the window saw by the faint light of a young moon going down in the remains of sunset that he was jumping off his horse growling and swearing but under his breath when the captain sprang out  a woman was lying across the road and had barely escaped being run over  mary and dora were both out in a moment  poor thing poor thing  is it a fit  she is quite insensible  a fit of a certain kind said the captain who was dragging her into the hedge while the postboy held the horses  go back mary dora  it is nanny barton said dora in horror  mary took down one of the carriage lamps and held it to the face  yes it is said she  cant we take her home or do anything  no no nonsense said edmund  dont come near dont touch her dont you see she is simply dead drunk  but we cant leave her here  the best thing to do  yes it is but we will stop at the fox and hounds if that will satisfy you and send some one out to see after her  they were obliged to be satisfied for the tones were authoritative and they had to accept his assurance that the woman was in no state for them to meddle with  she would come to no harm he said when he had put her on the bank and it was only to pacify them that he caused the postilion to stop at the publichouse whence roaring singing and shouts proceeded  the landlord came out supposing it was some new arrival and when captain carbonel jumped out and speaking severely desired that some one would go to look after the woman who was lying in the road and whom the horses had almost run over he answered as if he had been doing the most natural and correct thing in the world  yes sir i had just sent her home  they had been treating of her and she had had a drop too much  she wasnt in a proper state  proper state  no  i should think not  it is a regular shame and disgrace that you should encourage such goings on  wheres the womans husband  has no one got the humanity to come and take her home  oldfellow called gruffly to some of the troop who came reeling out to the door and told them it was time to be off and that some one you tirzah had best see to that there barton oman  captain carbonel wished to keep his ladies from the sight but they were watching eagerly and could not help seeing that it was tirzah todd more gipsylooking than ever who came out  not however walking as if intoxicated and quite able to comprehend captain carbonels brief explanation where to find her companion  ah poor nanny she said cheerfully  shes got no head  a drop is too much for her  the chaise door was shut and they went on dora and mary shocked infinitely and hardly able to speak of what they had seen  and they did not feel any happier when the next day as mary was feeding the chickens nanny came up to her curtseying and civil  please maam im much obliged to you for seeing to me last night  i just went in to see if my husband was there as was gone to poppleby with some sheep and they treated me maam  and that there tirzah and bet bracken they was asinging songs as it was a shame to hear so i ups and rebukes them and she flies at me like a catamount maam and then mr oldfellow he puts me out maam as was doing no harms as innocent as a lamb  well said mrs carbonel it was no place for any woman to be in and we were grieved i cannot tell you how much that you should be there you had better take care you know drunkenness is a really wicked sin in gods sight  only a little overtakenwent to see for my husband muttered nanny i didnt take nigh so much as that there tirzah todd that is there with bet bracken every night of her life to sing  never mind other people  their doing wrong doesnt make you right  only a drop argued nanny  and that there tirzah and bet  mary was resolved against hearing any more against tirzah and bet and actually shut herself into the granary till nanny was gone  and there she sat down on a sack of peas and fairly cried at the thought of the sin and ignorant unconsciousness of evil all round her  and then she prayed a little prayer for help and wisdom for these poor people and themselves  then she felt cheered up and hopeful    chapter seven  sunday school    she hastens to the sunday school  jane taylor  captain carbonel had written to the president of saint cyrils and at once obtained his willing consent to the ladies attempting to form a little sunday school  dr fogram said that he should come down himself on july 21 and should be very glad to take counsel with the carbonels on the state of uphill  he would be glad to assist if any outlay were needed  the sisters were in high spirits  the only place they could find for the purpose was the washhouse and laundry  once in five weeks two women in high white muslin caps and checked aprons of whom betsy seddon was one betty pucklechurch the other came to assist the maids in getting up the family linena tremendous piece of work  a tub was set on the saturday with ashes placed in a canvas bag on a frame above water was poured on it and ran through so as to be fitted for the operations which began at five oclock in the morning and absorbed all the women of the establishment and even old pucklechurch who was called on to turn the mangle  except during this formidable week the washhouse and laundry were empty and hither were invited the children  about twenty of all ages camethe boys in smocks the girls in print frocks and pinafores one in her mothers black bonnet others in coarse straw or sunbonnets all had shoes of some sort but few had stockings though the long frocks concealed the deficiencies and some wore stockinglegs without feet  they made very low bows or pulled their forelocks most grinned and looked sheepish and a very little one began to cry  it did not seem very promising but mary and dora began by asking all their names and saying they hoped to be better friends  they for the most part knew nothing with the exception of george hewletts two eldest bessie moles girls and one sharp boy of dan hewletts also the pucklechurch grandchildren but even these had very dim notions and nobody but the hewletts could tell a word of the catechism  to teach them the small commencement of doctrine comprised in the earliest pages of first truths was all that could be attempted as well as telling them a bible story to which the few intelligent ones listened with pleasure and johnnie hewlett showed that he had already heard itfrom aunt he said  he was a sickly quietlooking boy very different from his younger brother jem who had organised a revolt among the general multitude before long  none of these had enough civilisation to listen or be attentive for five minutes together and when mrs carbonel looked round on hearing a howl there was a pitched battle going on between jem and lizzie seddon over her little sister who had been bribed into coming with a lump of gingerbread which the boy was abstracting  he had been worked up enough even to lose his awe of the ladies and to kick and struggle when dora somewhat imprudently tried to turn him out  the disturbance was so great that the sisters were obliged to dismiss their pupils at least a quarter of an hour sooner than they had intended and without having tried to teach the short daily prayers that had been part of the programme  somewhat crestfallen they sped back to the house  did you ever see such a set of little savages cried dora  come there was a very fair proportion of hopeful ones was the reply  these hopeful ones made one class under dora while mary who had more patience and experience undertook the others who when once wakened proved very eager and interested in a degree new to those who are not the first lights in gross darkness  johnnie hewlett was the brightest among the children for though his weekdays were occupied in what his mother called keeping a few birds or more technically birdstarving he spent most of his spare time beside his sick aunt and had not only been taught by her to read but to think and to say his prayers  as dora gradually learnt both mary hewlett and judith grey had been children of a little smockfrock farmer and had not been entirely without breeding but molly had been the eldest and had looked after the babies and done much of the work of the farm till she plunged into an early and most foolish marriage with the neerdowell member of the old sawyers family and had been going deeper into the mire ever since  judith a good deal younger and always delicate had gone to the dame school when mrs verdon was rather less inefficient and at ten years old had been taken into service by an old retired servant who needed her chiefly as a companion and thence she had been passed on to a family where the ladies were very kind to the servants and the children brought them their books and their information of all kinds so that she had much cultivation religious and otherwise  when her accident had sent her home to the only surviving member of her family she hoped to be of use to her sister and the children but before long she found it almost hopeless  molly indeed was roughly kind to her but dan took no notice of her except to borrow her money and any attempt to interfere with the management of the children was resented  johnnie the eldest boy was fond of his aunt and soon became her best attendant when not out at the work that began at nine years old  he was willing that she should teach him and when the ladies came to see her she was full of stories of what he had told her  she said no word of the rudeness of the girls or the tyranny of jem as she sat helpless by the fire  when all were out these were pleasant peaceful visits to her and she was grateful for the books dora lent her and the needlework mrs carbonel gave her when she was well enough to do it molly was not unwilling that her sister should be a favrite as she called it more especially as jem was generally allowed to swallow any dainty brought by the ladies that was to his taste  old master redford widow moles father was another cheerful spot in the village  he was a thoroughly good devout person in a simple way and most grateful for doras coming to read to him  old pucklechurch once indeed said what maam ye be never agoing to read to that there thomas redford  why tis all one as singing psalms to a dead horse  in spite however of this hopeless augury doras voice did reach his ears  he had made good use of his scanty opportunities and had taught his family to be thoroughly conscientious  there was another daughter in service who from time to time sent him a little help but the transit of money was a difficulty in those days and the relief could not often come  one morning widow mole fainted away in the hayfield and hardly heard farmer goodenough abusing her finelady airs though she trembled and shook so much when she tried to go on that she was forced to let tirzah todd lead her home and the next morning she could not get up  she had been in such plight before and the shop trusted her knowing that she always strove to pay off her debts but the farmer rated her vehemently declaring that she had been good for nothing since the ladies had been putting fancies and megrims in her head and that he would not take her on again  probably he did not mean to fulfil his threat for as far as her strength allowed she was the best and most thorough worker of all his women and he had no desire to have the whole family on the rates but the ladies believed it and came home furious with indignation and even captain carbonel thought her justified in accepting the dismissal and as soon as kitchen physic had a little restored her she became washerwoman weeding woman and useful woman generally at greenhow farm  many a cup of tea and thick slice of breadandbutter were carried out to her after breakfast not to say threecornered remnant of pie or sandwich of cold meat at luncheon and though some was saved for granfer and the children still she began to look like another woman ere many weeks were over  betsy seddon and molly hewlett were much displeased and reproached her with having got the place by hypercriting about  nanny barton put on a white apron and brought out the big bible when she saw the ladies getting over the stile  the first time dora was much delighted the second mrs carbonel managed to see that the bible was open at one of the genealogies in the first book of chronicles and spied besides the dirtiest of all skirts under the apron  after that she did not much heed when nanny said she would come to church if her shoes were not so bad  tirzah todd laughed and showed her white teeth and merry eyes so pleasantly that no one could help liking to talk with her but alas old pucklechurch took care to let them know that she could be just as merry in a different way at the fox and hounds    chapter eight  marys approach    the chaise was stayed   but yet was not allowed   to drive up to the door lest all   should say that she was proud   cowper  dr fogram was true to his word and made his appearance at the long vacation  the carbonels to whom little eager sophia had been added a day or two previously first saw him at downhill church where he made a most dignified appearance in a very full surplice with his doctor of divinitys red hood over it  the clerk small greyhaired and consequential bustled up to open the pulpit door for him and he preached in a fine sonorous voice a very learned sermon that might have been meant for his undergraduates at oxford  it was the day for afternoon service at uphill so the sisters had to hurry away to eat their luncheon in haste and then to introduce sophy to the sunday school where she was to teach a class of small ones a matter of amazing importance and ecstasy  she was a damsel of thirteen in a white frock and cape a pink sash pink kerchief round her neck pink satin ribbons tying down her broad leghorn hat over her ears in what was called gipsy fashion  she had rosy cheeks blue goodnatured eyes and shining lightbrown curls all round her head  her appearance in the school was quite as memorable to the children as dr fograms could be to their elders and the little ones were so engaged in looking at her that they quite forgot to be naughty except that billy mole in curiosity to know what anything so glossy and shining could be pinched the end of her sash and left the grimy mark of his little hot hands on it which caused maitland the maid who had charge of her toilette to declare that such things always came of going among they nasty dirty little brats  dr fogram rode over on a plump shining black horse followed by a wellequipped groom  he dismounted and gave his horse to the man when he overtook the carbonel party on the way up the hill  captain carbonel i believe said he touching his hat almost a shovel  will you do me the honour to introduce me to the ladies and to them he uncovered with the grand formal politeness which even then was becoming rather oldfashioned and which they returned with curtsies sophias being fresh from the dancingmaster the most perfect of all  i understand said he that i am greatly indebted to you for pains taken with this unfortunate parish  we have been trying to do what we could said mrs carbonel to whom this was chiefly addressed  it is a great kindness he replied and i hope the people may show themselves sensible of your exertions but hitherto all endeavours for their benefit have been thrown away  dora could not help wondering what the exertions were  after the service he joined the family again and said that he thought the appearance of the poorand especially of the childrenand their behaviour much improved and he had no doubt it was owing to the gentle and beneficent influence of the ladies to whom he bowed  in fact the children had been much engaged in staring though whether he or sophy were the prime attraction might be doubtful  at any rate master pucklechurchs rod had only once descended  moreover two neat sunbonnets of lilac print adorned two heads and the frocks looked as if they were sometimes washed  captain carbonel said he hoped to have some conversation with the president about the parish and he responded that he hoped to do himself the honour of calling the next day  after which he mounted his horse and rode off  the three sisters waited and watched as if their whole fate depended on the mornings conference but nothing was seen of the president till after luncheon when he rode up attended by his groom as before  to their great disappointment he would talk of nothing but the beauty of the country and of the voices of lablache and sonntag or the like which he evidently considered the proper subjects for ladies and it was not till he had spent the quarter of an hour fit for a visit of ceremony on these topics that he asked captain carbonel to allow him a little conversation with him  they shut themselves into the captains little den which was something between a gunroom and a library with the rectory books going round two sides of the room edmunds sword pistols and spurs hanging over the mantelpiece and his guns shotbelts powderhorn and fishingrods on hooks on the wall  no noise was heard for more than an hour during which dora fumed mary cut off the dead roses and sophia was withheld from peeping  at last they came outthe horses had been brought to the doorthe president bowed to the ladies mounted and rode off while edmund came across the lawn and they all clustered round him  well said he we have fared better than we expected  dr fogram has long been regretting the state of the parish  why did he do nothing broke in dora  i suppose he has much on his hands and i am afraid my poor old uncle was a hindrance for he really seemed like a man who had got rid of an incubus when he found that we were willing to do what we could  then it seems that he was disappointed in ashley selby  he thought that being an inhabitant of the place the young man would be interested in the people and make his sisters useful  they exclaimed dora  they are such fine ladies who think about nothing but almacks are afraid of the dirt and of catching all sorts of disorders at the cottages  i can hardly get dora to be moderately civil to them said mary  yes said edmund parental influence has been strong  the mother fears for health the father for his game and the children have grown up to think poachers and their families almost beyond the pale of humanity  it has been too much for this young man who simply acquiesced in the way in which he was bred  however this will come to an end for the present holder of the family living has had a paralytic stroke and wants him to come and assist  i fully believe that he may do much better away from home habits especially under a good incumbent  and what is to happen to us inquired mary  dr fogram says that he will send us one of the fellows of his collegea young man full of zeal who is eager for parochial work and has been taking duty at a parish some miles from oxford  he thinks we shall be satisfied with the change  as if we were the people to be satisfied cried dora  just confess edmund that the old gentleman did not think the place worth attending to till educated gentlefolk came to live in it  say rather that he really did not know the deficiencies said the captain till they were brought before him  then he ought muttered dora  judge not whispered mary who was a reverent person  and the school resumed dora  was he aware of any deficiency there  he was very glad to hear that you had begun keeping school and will contribute to a better arrangement for the weekday school assist in pensioning off dame verdon if needful and in obtaining a better person  dora and sophy each gave a little caper and squeezed one anothers hands  he is quite disposed to be liberal continued edmund and i am sure we shall find him no impediment  i dont think the school is going on now said mary  lizzie verdon came for some broth and said granny was bad in bed  i asked whether she had had the doctor and she stared and said no but dame spurrell had got her some yarbs  for in those days the union doctor was not an institution  large tracts of country would contract with some apothecary to attend their sick but he was generally a busy man with his hands full of paying patients and there was nobody to keep him up to his work among the poor if he could have done it which he really could not  the poor themselves knew that it was in vain to apply to him or if he came once in a serious case to expect any attention and they preferred to depend on the woman clever in yarbs on the white witch or in favoured villages on the lady bountiful or the clergyman and his wife and in simple cases these latter were quite efficient keeping a family medicinechest and a book on household medicine  mrs carbonel had rooted out her mothers book replenished her chest and had cured two or three children who had been eating unripe apples and greatly benefited mole with infusions of jesuits bark in a large jug the same thing as quinine only more cumbrously and domestically prepared  but most of the uphill people had the surest confidence in dame spurrell and her remedies some of which were very curious for mrs carbonel found a child who had fits wearing in a bag a pinch of black hair from the cross on the back of a jackass and once when she objected to a dirty mark on the throat of susan pucklechurch she was told it was left by a rasher of bacon put on to cure a sore throat  the symptoms were sometimes curious as she now found when she went to inquire after dame verdon who lizzie informed her had her heart hanging by only one string and when that gave way she would not be here  for the present however she was in bed under a quilt made of coloured cloth scraps but however it might be with her heartstrings she did not seem likely to get up again  it was hay time and it appeared that no one did come to school in hay and harvest seasons so that there was time to consider what could be done  dr fogram was invited to dinner to hold consultation with the ladies whom the captain would not leave to any conclusion as to the schools  there were no such things as trained masters and mistresses in those days the national society had only been in existence eleven years and government had not taken up the matter at all  educated and religious people had however come to the conclusion that it would be well to help all the village children to know their faith and duty and to read their bibles and the good work of mrs hannah more and mrs trimmer were examples that had begun to be followed now that the one was in extreme old age and the other in her grave  the carbonel family had been bred up to such work and all of them knew a good deal more about it than the president whose studies had been chiefly in greek plays and whose tasks had been dealing with young men and the college estates his conscience as a clergyman was a good deal stirred by the condition of his parish and he was really thankful to those who would take up the matter as well as ready to assist with his purse  so it was settled that mrs carbonel should write about a widow at her old home who had once been a servant in the family  she was known to be a good religious person who could read and write and cast accounts quite well enough for any possibly advanced scholars as well as being a beautiful needlewoman  an old friend went to see her explain the situation to her and ascertain if she were willing to undertake the school for twenty pounds a year and what the children could pay  a cottage belonging to captain carbonel might have a room added to it to receive the scholars by the end of harvest by which time they might be got together and mrs verdon was to be induced to resign by a pension of halfacrown a week a sum then supposed to be ample and which indeed was so for her wants which were much less than in these days captain carbonel looked over the cottage and worked out an estimate of the cost with old hewlett whose notions of paper work were of the kind shown in his midsummer bill                              shillingspence  1 ooden barrer a oodnt soot        9    6  1 ooden barrer a ood soot          9    6   the result of the calculations conjectural and otherwise was this  mary look here  this is an expensive year and if we do the thing this year we must put off making the drive through the fieldsyour approach madam  mary came and looked at his figures  how will it be after harvest she said  harvest is an inappreciable quantity especially to novices he said if you believe farmer goodenough the finest weather will not save me from finding myself out of pocket  farmer goodenough is an old croaker after his kind said mary  it wont do to reckon thereupon  i must be secure of capital enough to fall back upon  think it over well mary and answer me tomorrow and you had better say nothing to your sisters till your own mind is made up  i own that i should be very glad of the road  it would save us and old major a good deal to say nothing of our friends bones  do you mean that you wish it edmund  i wish to leave it entirely to you  dora and sophy had gone across the fields a four miles walk to poppleby and were to be brought home in the evening and mary was left to wander about the old road and the fieldpath and meditate on the ruts and quagmires that would beset the way in the winter and shut them up from visiting perhaps even from church  besides there were appearances  there was an old gentleman a faraway connection of edmunds who had been in the navy and now lived at poppleby and went about collecting all the chatter to be heard in one house and retailing it all in another and he thought himself licensed to tell edmund and mary everything personal  one thing was  my dear fellow you should really put a check on your wifes methodistical ways  i didnt know she had any  i have been told on good authority that she has a meeting every sunday in the washhouse  edmund laughed  a dozen children for sunday school with the presidents full consent  it wont do edmund  youll find it wont do  why old selby told me she was a pretty creature only just like your good pious ladies running into all the dirtiest cottages  and to mary it was let me give you a hint my dear mrs carbonel  the duchess saw you in poppleby and asked who you were and she said she would like to visit you if you did not live in such a hole  i dont think i want her said mary  now my dear dont you be foolish  it would be so much to edmunds advantage  he was in the same regiment with lord henry and you might have the best society in the county if only you would make your new drive  why even lady hartman says she cant take her horses again through that lane or into the farm court  miss yates said it was quite disgusting  mary carbonel might laugh  she did not care for her own dignity but she did for edmunds and though she had been amused at lady hartmans four horses entangled in the narrow sweep and did not quite believe old captain caiger the lady herself had been very charming and mary did not like to cut her husband and sisters off from the pleasantest houses in the country  but the words love not the world came up into her mind and the battle ended by her saying to her husband  dont let us have the approach this year dear edmund  i dont want it to be marys reproach  you are quite sure  in spite of caiger  indeed i am though i am afraid it is asking you to give up something  not while i have my merry faces at home mary  and indeed little woman i am glad of your decision  it is right  i am so glad    chapter nine  the screen    there is no honesty in such dealingshakespeare  one day when sophy had been trusted to go out alone to carry a few veal cutlets from luncheon to judith she found the door on the latch but no one in the room downstairs the chair empty the fire out and all more dreary than usual only a voice from above called out please come up  sophy pleased with the adventure mounted the dark and rickety stairs and found herself in the open space above cut off from the stairs by a screen and containing a pressbed where judith lay covered by an elaborate patchwork quilt  there was a tiny dressingtable under the narrow lattice window and one chair also a big trunkbox with a waggonshaped lid such as servants used to have in those days covered with paper where big purple spots of paint concealed the old print of some story or newspaper  on the wall hung a few black profiles and all was very fairly neat whatever the room might be shut off by a wooden partition whence came a peculiar sour smell  oh it is miss sophia exclaimed judith  i beg your pardon maam i thought it was dame spurrell who said she would come and look in on me or i would not have troubled you to come up  i am glad i did judith i like to see where you live  only are you worse  no miss only as my back is sometimes and my sister and all the children are gone to the hiring fair so it was not handy to get me up  and this is your room said sophy looking about her  isnt it very cold  johnnie heats me a brick to keep me warm at night but my feet are always cold downstairs  it does not make much difference  oh dear  and you have a screen i see  oh  why that is our drawingroom paper  she sat transfixed at the recognition while judith observed quite innocently with a free conscience  yes miss my brotherinlaw brought it home and told me it was just a scrap that was left over and he was free to have though i said i did wonder the lady did not want to keep it in case of an accident happening  yes said sophy i dont think he had any business to have it for all one division of the paper is put on upside down  the laburnums point up instead of hanging down and i am sure mary would have altered it if she could  it was beautiful french paper that edmund brought home from paris and laid up for the furnishing their house  this of course mrs carbonel and dora would never have told poor judith but sophy was young and unguarded and apt to talk when she had better have held her tongue  i am sorry to hear it miss indeed i am  i am afraid one could not take it off the screen to put it back again where it did ought to be  sophy looked but it was manifestly impossible  spoiling the screen would not mend the wall of the drawingroom  perhaps molly might have another bit left she said only thinking of the triumph of carrying home the means of repairing the deficiency by her own unassisted sagacity  i will ask her miss  i am sure i never thought dan would go for to do such a thing mourned judith though even as she spoke there came back on her recollections of times when she had tried to be blind and deaf  but if mrs carbonel would let me pay for it miss i should be easier in my mind  i have a shilling though no doubt that is not the worth of it  and she began feeling for a little box under her pillow never mentioning that she had already paid dan a shilling for it  no no nonsense judith  of course my sister would not take it for the world but if any one could find another bit just to patch up the part above the bookcase it would be nice  i will do what in me lays miss sophy answered judith  so sophy took her leave and trotted home very proud of her discovery which she communicated in an eager voice as the phaeton drew up at the front door  oh edmund i have found the rest of the drawingroom paper  hush not so loud my dear said dora getting out of the back seat and edmund being busy in telling the groom to attend to something in the harness did not heed at first  did you know dora asked sophy in a lower voice being struck by something in her repressive manner  yes but i did not tell because edmund was so much vexed and it was of no use now  dora really hoped no one had heard as mary was busy with her parcels and she was too fond of judith not to wish to shield her family but it was too late  the captain came in with whats this about the drawingroom paper  sophy was delighted to pour out the history of her discovery and tell how it appeared on the screen that sheltered poor judith grey  exactly as i supposed said captain carbonel  i always believed that fellow was a thief  but it is not poor judiths fault exclaimed the sisters with one voice  she knew nothing about it  she wanted to pay the shilling for it said sophia  the captain laughed a little  and she is going to search for a bit to go up there continued the girl more vehemently and he laughed again  yes said mary if you only saw something of her you would be convinced that her whole character is very different from that of the rest of the family  dont you be taken in by plausibility said the captain  i know that fellow dan is a thief  i meant to tell his relation george that i wont allow him to be employed on the new schoolroom  i shall do so now  would it not be better to forget what happened so long ago  mary ventured to say  and suppose judith restores it added sophia  pshaw said the captain but mary followed him to the study and what she did with him there her sisters did not know but it resulted in his allowing that dan might have another trial with a sharp eye over him  so unused was uphill to the visits of ladies that when the piece of french paper was sold to judith no one had thought of her being sought out in her bedroom  molly came home with the children in the evening tired out but excitedfor all had had rather more beer than was good for them and the children a great many more sweets  jem and judy were quarrelling over a wooden horse covered with white spots but whose mane had already disappeared lizzie was sick cross and stupid polly had broken the string of her new yellow necklace and was crying about it and nobody had recollected the aunt except johnnie who presented her with a piece of thin gingerbread representing king george the fourth in white pink and gilt  molly herself was very tired though she said it was all very fine and she had seen a lot of people and the big sleeves they wore were quite a wonder  then she scolded polly with all her might for crying and never setting the tea nor boiling the kettle and after all it was johnnie who made up the fire fetched water and set the kettle boiling  they all wrangled together over their purchases and the sights they had seen or not seen while judith was glad to be out of the way of seeing though not of hearing  then the girls trailed themselves upstairs  judy slept with her aunt polly and lizzie had a kind of shakedown on a mattress of chaff or hulls as she called it by her side  judith always insisted on their prayers but they said they were much too tired tonight and could not say anything but matthew mark luke and john which was all they knew except the lords prayer judith had taught them this but they thought the repeating it a very difficult ceremony far too hard when they were tired  their mother went to bed soon afterwards taking jem with her and so did johnnie all being anxious to get what sleep they could before the dreaded moment of fathers return  publichouses were not obliged to close at any special time in those days and the homecoming especially on a fair day was apt to be a terrible affair  it was not till past one oclock that shouts broken bursts of singing and howls of quarrelling announced the breakup of the riotous party and presently the door bounced open and with oaths at the darkness though there was bright moonlight dan stumbled in and staggered upstairs overturning the unlucky screen upon polly as he did so cursing and swearing at them all and ordering his wife to get up and open the door which he was past finding  he did not attack judith though he almost fell over her bed and the two girls lay trembling not daring to lift off the screen till the door of the bedroom was shut on them and then came the only too wellknown sound of their mother scolding and crying and his swearing and beating her  they were only too much used to such disturbance and were asleep again before it was over but judith could only lie on shaking with terror not personalbut at the awful words she heard and praying that they might not be visited on that unhappy household but that god would forgive  it was not till the next day when the house was tolerably quiet and molly rather fretful and grumbling had helped judith down to her place by the fire that she ventured the question molly you have not a bit more of that pretty wallpaper you gave me for my screen  did it get broke last night in dans drunken tantrums  not more than i can mend but little miss sophia she says that the paper in the greenhow drawingroom is quite spoilt for want of a piece to cover up a bit that was put on wrong  my patience  and how did miss sophia come to know anything about it  she came up to see me and bring those cutlets that you are warming up now  bless me  well dan will be vexed said molly  such mean folk as they are apeeping and aprying after everything  they knows how to look after whatever they chooses to say is their own and the captain he made a row before about that there trumpery yard or two of paper that was the parkisit of them that hung it  miss sophy says it spoilt the room  spilt it  theyve little to vex em that is terrified about that  but have you got the bit molly  i never had it  dan kept it in the outhouse  he may have a scrap left that he used to make caps for the christmas boys when he used the rest to paper mrs hunters closet with down at downhill  your piece was left over of that and may be there was halfayard more but he locks that there workshop of his so as one cant get in to get a bit of shavings to light the fire  so you must ask him  i am sure i dare not do it  hes that angry if one does but look into his shop  i must try and get it said judith  not now i wouldnt entreated molly  what is it to the ladies  and father he will be fit to tear the place down if he hears of it  them gobblealls is set again him already and tis just taking away our bread to say a bit more about it to them folks  george hewlett is particular enough already without having a work about this  poor judith she felt as if she could never be at peace with her conscience while she had those yellow laburnums in sight in her room and she did not see how restitution and confession could injure her brotherinlaw but her code of right and wrong was very different from that of either husband or wife  molly went on maundering about the hardship of having taken in a poor helpless thing and having stood between her and the workhouse only that she should turn a viper and a spy and take her poor childrens bread out of their mouths forgetting that jem was at the very moment eating up the piece of applepie that had come with the cutlets  judith tried to get her thoughts together and decided that however much she might dread dans anger and care for his interest and family peace it was her duty to do her best to recover whatever remnant was possible of his booty  so when he came home to dinner she ventured to ask him if he had a piece left of that paper of her screen  why he asked turning on her as if he hoped to make more of whatever he had  she told him timidly and it was as she had feared  he began abusing her violently for letting spies up into her room and turning against him that let her have her houseroom and worriting them all with her hypocritical ways  he could tell her there was nothing between her and the workhouse and all was interspersed with oaths terrible to hear  molly began taking her part and declaring that judith could not help it if little miss would come into her room but dan who had qualified last nights revel with another mug of ale was quite past all reason and declared that judith called the girl up on purpose to bring him into trouble and that nothing but harm had ever come of her canting methody ways and he had a good mind to kick her out at once to the workhouse and would do so if she brought them gobblealls down on him again there had been nothing but plague ever since they came into the parish and he wouldnt have them come pollprying about his house  no he wouldnt  judith knew this was a vain threat for he was always out of the house when they came and she also knew that he was the last man to give up the small payment that she was in the habit of making quarterly or what was begged from her besides so she was not afraid of any such measure but she was much shaken and felt quite ill afterwards and molly did not stint her blame and lamentations  nothing happened in consequence except that from that time forward dans incipient dislike to they gobblealls was increased and they could do nothing which he did not find fault with though his wife grumbling at them all the time was quite willing to get everything possible out of them    chapter ten  innovations    timotheus placed on high   among the tuneful choir   with flying fingers touched the lyre   dryden  on the first of october the new beginning was to be made  the new curate mr harford arrived and spent his first few days at greenhow while looking out for a lodging at downhill for he was to be shared between the two parishes as before and mr atkins still undertook to assist on sundays  mr harford looked very young almost a boy and was small and thin but not in the least delicate  he had only worked off his superfluous flesh in study and parish cares at oxford and he was likely to do the same in his new home  he looked on it as likely to be his residence for a long time for as the president had already told mrs carbonel he was engaged to a young lady whose father would not consent to her marriage till he had a living worth 500 pounds a year and there were a good many fellows senior to him  he seemed to have no fears of any amount of work and the first thing he thought of was how to arrange for uphill to have two services on sunday as he thought could be contrived by giving the downhill people who mostly lived near the church their second service in the evening instead of the morning and as mr atkins would thus have more to do he gave up to that gentleman the addition to his stipend which the president had offered to himself  the boon was great to the greenhow family who had often been hindered by weather from getting to downhill moreover he had plans for one service and sermon in the week and for a cottage lecture at a distant hamlet  also in the first fortnight of his stay he had called at every house alike in downhill and uphill to the great surprise of some of the families who had not in the memory of man seen a parson cross their threshold  some did not like it such as old dame verdon who though she could hardly get out of bed was very sore about the new school and when her friends came to see her told them wonderful stories which she had picked upor lizzie had from some hawkerthat the gentlefolks thought there were too many children for the rates and taxes and they were going to get them all into the school and make an end of them sometimes she said it was by giving of them all the cowpox as dame spurrell called vaccination as the fashion was in those parts sometimes it was by sending them all out to botany bay  and as mrs carbonel had prevailed on the new gardeners wife to have her baby vaccinated and george hewletts and mrs moles children had been thence treated by her own hands this was believed the more although none of the children were visibly the worse for it after the first few days but some of the women and almost all the children believed the story and many of the little ones were in fits of terror about the school so that there was a falling off even with the sunday school  the new school was only an additional room to a goodsized cottage with a couple of windows and a brick floor fitted with forms without backs but which had at least good firm legs to stand upon pegs for the cloaks and headgear round the walls and a single desk likely to be quite sufficient for the superior few who were to learn writing and summing  the stock obtained from the society for promoting christian knowledge consisted of a dozen copies of mrs trimmers abridgment of the old testament the same number of the ladys work on the new testament a packet of little paper books of the sermon on the mount the parables and the miracles and another packet of little books where the alphabet led the way upwards from ba bo etcetera to our cat can kill a rat can she not  also the broken catechism and sellons abridgment of instruction on the catechism  there were a housewife full of needles some brass thimbles and a roll of calico provided and this was the apparatus with which most village schools would commence  mrs thorpe arrived with her two little girls the neatest of creatures still wearing her weeds as indeed widows engaged in any business used to do for life as a sort of protection  under her crape borders showed the smoothest of hair and her apron was spotlessly white  the two little girls were patterns with short cut hair spotted blue frocks and checkered pinafores in the week lilac frocks on sundays white capes on that same day and bonnets of coarse straw tied down with green ribbon over little bonnet caps with plain net frilling the only attempt at luxury apparent in their dress  their names were jane and mary and they looked very pretty and demure though there was a little mischief in marys eyes  nothing could look nicer or more promising in the eyes of the sisters when they took her to her cottage nor could any one be better pleased than she to work under her own young ladies and to have so peaceful a home for her little daughters  she was introduced to her future scholars on sunday in the washhouse and very shy and awkward did they look nor were the numbers as large as usual  mr harford came to open the school on monday morning and the ladies met him there  the room was in beautiful order and presently the younger moles the george hewletts the seddons the pucklechurch grandchildren and about halfadozen more dropped in but no one else appeared and these stood handling their pennies and looking sheepish  mr harford after looking out to see whether any one else was coming addressed them in words a little too fine for their comprehension and then read a few prayers after which he and mrs carbonel went away taking the unwilling sophy to her lessons but leaving dora to follow when she had heard the names called over and inaugurated the work and their journey was enlivened by meeting a child with flying hair and ragged garments rushing headlong so as to have only just time to turn off short over a gap in a field where some men who were ploughing called out run little one run shell catch thee with a great shouting laugh and at the same moment appeared with a big stick in her hand nancy morris in full chase her cap on the back of her head and looking not much less wild than her offspring  however she drew up at the sight of the clergyman and the lady pulled her cap forward and her apron to the middle curtsied low and in a voice of conscious merit though out of breath explained that she was arter elizabeth who was that terrifying and contrary that she would not go to school  mr harford not quite accustomed to the popular use of the verb to terrify began to ask what the child had done to alarm her mother so much and nancy understanding him as little said tis all along of dame verdon maam  she be for to say that the new governess will beat them and send them off to minsterham as sure as theyre alive and i told bet not to believe no such stuff but her wont listen to i  mr harford was the more mystified  why should she send them to minsterham  and what was the child afraid of  mrs carbonel had more notion  minsterham was the assize town and going thither was a polite form of mentioning the being before a court of justice  elizabeth need have no fears of a prison she said  she is a silly child to be frightened but when she sees that the other children like school and that nothing happens to them she will know better  dont beat her it will only frighten her more  if it is your will maam ill let her off but ill give her the stick another time as sure as she is alive the little toad  hopeful said the lady and gentleman to each other as soon as she was out of sight and they could laugh  it was indeed uphill work in every sense that was before mrs thorpe but the effect was visible in much improvement in the general demeanour of the children  a chair was found for her where she sat among them at church and prevented the outrageous misconduct that the ladies had been unable effectively to check and the superior readers were gradually acquiring a very cheap form of prayerbook with only matins and evensong and the collects besides the psalms  but that the children sat on the chancel steps and that kneeling in church was unknown to them never occurred as an irreverence to any of the party though as mr harford read the antecommunion service from the altar instead of disrobing himself of his surplice in the pulpit just before the sermon he had to walk through the whole school making those in his way stand up to let him pass  the singers on the establishment of a double service began to absent themselves at least once on a sunday so mr harford and the ladies tried to arrange for the singing of the children instead  he had no knowledge of music which was then thought a rather doubtful accomplishment for a young man and mrs thorpe had if possible less so all that could be done was for dora to train the children by ear and she found that their thin shrill notes were held as painful by all save a few doting mothers her sisters and herself  the captain laughed at her and finally promised her a grinding organ  it came it could play four tunes and all the singers were naturally offended  but on the first sunday there was a great catastrophe for when once set on it would not stop but went on playing its four tunes long after the old hundredth was finished  mr harford waited to begin the prayer for king george till it had finished hoping that it would stop if not at the end of the second tune at least at the fourth but behold it started off with the old hundredth again upon which captain carbonel emerged from his pew and with the help of master pucklechurch bore it out into the churchyard where it continued to play till after the service when there was time to check its pertinacity by adjustment of the machinery  at its best the singerseven george hewlettwere much hurt and the compromise was made that it never should uplift its voice when they were present in full force with bass flute and viol but should only draw forth its four tunes when there were only the children to need the accompaniment  even then dan hewlett who unluckily had the best voice of all swore that he would never come to church again while they had that there horgin to buzz away like a big bumbledore and he kept his word  you see maam he has his feelings said molly  he would fain have made all his family join in the secession but johnnie would not be kept away from sunday school and molly had heard rumours of penny clubs and of prizes at christmas so though the other children were very irregular she kept them on after a fashion    chapter eleven  an unprofitable crop    my mother bids me bind my hairold ballad  oh mary mary what is to be done about the hair cried sophy one sunday after church  isnt it dreadful said dora  those fearful curlpapers sticking out with rolls of old newspapers  i told them it was not fit to be seen last sunday but there were even elizabeth and jane hewlett in them today  yes said mary they said that mothers aunt was coming to tea so she had curled them before they came out  i told them i would excuse it for this once but that i should send any one home who came such a figure on sunday  elizabeth and jane be it observed were george hewletts daughters the most civilised if the dullestwitted of the flock  polly betsy and judy were the children of dan hewlett  as a rule all the old women of the parish were called betty all the middleaged lizzie and the girls elizabeth  it is worse on weekdays said dora  one would think it was a collection of little porcupines  and so dirty began sophy but she was hushed up for edmund was seen approaching and mary never allowed him to be worried with the small fretting details of school life  it was a time when it was the fashion for young ladies up to their teens to have their hair curled in ringlets round their heads or on their shoulders  sophys hair curled naturally and had been turned up ever since she had come to live at home in the dignity of fourteen but she and both her sisters wore falls of drooping ringlets in front and in marys case these had been used to be curled in paper at night though she would as soon have been seen thus decorated by day as in her nightcap  but there was scarcely another matron in the parish who did not think a fringe of curlpaper the proper mode of disposing of her locks when in morning desabille unless she were elderly and wore a front which could be taken off and put on with the best cap  maidservants wore short curls or smooth folds round sidecombs under net caps and this was the usual trim of the superior kind of women the working women wore thick muslin white caps under which it was to be hoped their hair was cut short though often it straggled out in unseemly elflocks  married women did not go bareheaded not even the younger ladies except in the evening when like their maiden sisters they wore coils of their back hair round huge upright ornamental combs on the summit of their heads  but the childrens heads were deservedly pain and grief to the carbonel senses and mary was impelled to go and make a speech in school desiring that no more curlpapers should appear there on sundays and recommending that all hair should be kept short as her own and her sisters had been till the fit age for the turning up was attained she called up susan pucklechurch and rachel mole who had nice smooth hair neatly parted in the middle and declared them to be examples of the way that heads ought to appear  that afternoon the women stood out at their gates  so the lady told you to take pattern by widdy moles child did her said nanny barton loud enough for all her neighbours to hear  ay mother by rachel mole and susie pucklechurch  as if id go out of my way to follow after a mean creeper and low thing like widow mole exclaimed mrs barton  she knows which way her bread is buttered  amaking favourites exclaimed nancy morris  getting in to work in the garding away from farmer goodenough as her man had worked for for years ay and his before un chimed in nanny barton  and if you could see the platefuls and cupfuls as the ladies carries out to her added betsy seddon  my word and honour  no wonder she is getting lively enough just to bust some day  thats the way she comes over them said nanny barton  thats what them gentlefolks likes and bessy mole she knows it observed nancy morris at which they all laughed shrilly  as though id take pattern by her exclaimed nanny barton  id liefer take pattern by softy sam or goodenoughs old scarecrow  whatevers that demanded tirzah coming out of the fox and hounds what have they been after now  just the ladys been a preachin down at that there school how that she dont want no curlpapers there and that all the poor childrens heads is to be clipped like boys and setting up that there rachel moles bowldish of a poll to set the fashion  there  as i telled you said tirzah  thats the way gentry always goes on if they gets their way  they just hates to see a curl or a bit of ribbon added betsy seddon  or to see one have a bit of pleasure added nancy morris pucklechurches and mole they never durst send their poor children to the fair  and to hear the lady run out agin me for just having a drop of beer exclaimed nanny barton  nothing warnt bad enough for me  as if she hadnt her wine and all the rest of it and a poor woman maynt touch one draught if it is ever so  well you know nan youd had a bit more than enough said tirzah  well and what call to that was hern or yourn cried nancy facing upon her  a pretty job i had to get you home that night said tirzah and they all laughed  and you wouldnt be here now if tom postboy hadnt pulled up his horses in time  and was it for her to cast up to me if i was a bit overtaken demanded nanny  it may be supposed that after such a conversation as this there was not much chance of the bowldish setting the fashion  there was not the same illtemper and jealousy of susan pucklechurch being held up as an example for her family were the natural hangerson of greenhow and were besides always neater and better dressed than the others but mrs mole was even poorer than themselves and had worked with them even while keeping herself to herself a great offence in their eyes thus nobody was inclined to follow the clipped fashion except one or two meeker women who had scarcely seen that their girls hair was getting beyond bounds  it is to be remembered that seventy years ago long hair could hardly be kept in respectable trim by busy mothers working in the fields and with much less power of getting brushes and combs than at present so that the crops were almost the only means of securing cleanliness and tidiness and were worn also by all the little daughters of such gentry as did not care for fashion nor for making them sleep on a ring of lumps as big as walnuts  so that mrs carbonel and her sisters really wished for what was wholesome and proper when they tried to make the children conform to their rules if the women could only have seen it so instead of resenting the interference  sunday brought george hewletts two girls with their hair fastened up in womanly guise and their cousins becurled as before but there was nothing particularly untidy and mary held her peace  however the war was not over and one day when after a short absence dora and sophy went into the school they found five or six girls bristling with twists of old newspapers and others in a still more objectionable condition with wild unkempt hair about their necks and the halfdozen really neat ones were on the form around mrs thorpe who proceeded to tell dora that she was quite in despair the more she spoke to the girls about tidy heads the worse they were and she was really afraid to let her own children or the clean ones sit near the dirty ones  doras spirit was roused  very well she said mrs carbonel and i will not be disobeyed  come here lizzie barton  your head is disgraceful  lend me your scissors mrs thorpe  lizzie barton began to cry with her knuckles in her eyes and would not stir but dora was resolute  one child made a rush for the door but dora desired sophy to stand by the door and bar the passage and called mrs thorpe to hold lizzie barton who certainly was a spectacle with halfadozen horns twisted out of old advertisement papers but the rest of her hair flying in disgusting elflocks  she was cowed however into standing quiet till her appendages had been sheared off by the determined scissors  there i am sure you must be much more comfortable dora assured her  get your mother to wash your head and you will look so nice tomorrow  now then betsy hewlett  betsy cried but submitted but the next victim sally french howled and fought and said mammy would not have it done  but dora sternly answered then she should keep your head fit to be seen  and mrs thorpe held down her hands with whispers of now my dear dont  and so it went on through nineteen girls the boys sniggering all the time  some cried and struggled but latterly they felt it was their fate and resisted no longer  even mary cox who had a curly head by nature stood still to be clipped  doras hands were in a dreadful state and her mind began to quail a little but having once started she felt bound to go on and complete her work and when she finally dismissed the school there was a very undesirable heap of locks brown black and carroty interspersed with curlpapers on the floor  the girls looked to her mind far better and mrs thorpe a little doubtful gave her a basin of water to wash her hands  home the two sisters went their spirits rising as they laughed over their great achievement and looked forward to amusing mary with the account of the various behaviour of the victims  so they burst upon her as she was planting bulbs in the garden and edmund helping her by measuring distances  oh mary such fun cried sophy  we have been cutting all the childrens hair  what do you mean sophy  they had their heads worse than ever said dora so i took mrs thorpes scissors and clipped them all round  my dear dora i wish you had not been so hasty mary was gently saying but edmund was standing up looking quite judicial  did you get their parents permission he demanded  no of course i never should  then what right had you to meddle with the children  they were quite horrid  my hands  theyll never recover said dora spreading out her fingers  very likely but the children were not your slaves  you have a perfect right to forbid them to enter your school except on certain conditions but not to tyrannise over them when there  you have done more harm than you will undo in a hurry  i am afraid so murmured mary  dora had a temper and answered angrily well im sure i did it for the best  i dont approve of opinionative young ladies said edmund who was really from old habit quite like an elder brother  oh dora sighed mary dont  dora felt impelled to argue the matter out on the spot but something in marys look withheld her  she went away stepping high and feeling stately and proud but when she had walked up and down her own room a few times her better sense began to revive and she saw that she had acted in anger and selfwill quite as much as from a sense of propriety and she threw herself on her bed and shed some bitter tears  they would have been still more bitter if she could have heard the exclamations of the mothers over their gates that evening  well to be sure that a young lady should have treated my poor like that  her father says says he ill have the law of she  my jenny she come home looking like a poor mad woman  whatever has thee been arter says i  tis the lady says she  lady  she ought to be ashamed on herself amaking such betties of the poor children  ah didnt i tell you gibed tirzah what would come of making up to the gentlefolk with their soft words and such  they only want to have their will of you just like the blackamoors  youll not find me a sending my liz and nan cried mrs morris no not if her was to offer me a hundred goulden guineas  i dont let my gal go to be made into a guy was the general sentiment and mrs verdon in her bed intensified it by warning her neighbours that the cropping their heads was a preparation for sending them out to them foreign parts where they has slaves  and on sunday there were only ten of the female pupils at school and poor dora and sophia both cried all church time  they thought their hasty measures had condemned their poor girls to be heathens and goodfornothings for ever and ever  tirzah todd laughed at them all  the todds had gipsy connections todd himself was hardly ever visible  he was never chargeable to the parish but he never did regular work except at hay and harvest times or when he was cutting copsewood  then old pucklechurchs brother master pucklechurch of downhill who always managed the copse cutting used to hire him and they and another man lived in a kind of wigwam made of chips and cut down the seven years growth of underwood dividing it into peasticks from the tops and splitting the thicker parts to be woven into hurdles or made into hoops for barrels  they had a little fire but their wives brought them their food and little hoglah now quite well only with a scarred neck delighted to toddle about among the chips and cry out pitty pitty at the primroses  copse cutting over joe todd haunted fairs and drove cattle home or did anything he could pick up  he lived in a mud hovel which he and tirzah had built for themselves on the border land and where they kept a tall thin smoothhaired dog with a grey coat a white waistcoat a long nose and tail and blue eyes which gave him a peculiarly sinister expression of countenance and he had a habit of leaping up and planting his fore feet on the gate growling so that dora and sophy were very much afraid of him and no one except mr harford had ever attempted to effect an entrance into the cottage  it was pretty well understood that joe todd and his lurcher carried on a business as poachers and tirzah going about with clothespegs rush baskets birch brooms and in their season with blackberries whortleberries or plovers eggs was able to dispose of their game to the poulterers at minsterham with whom she had an understanding  her smiling black eyes white teeth and merry looks caused a great deal of business to be done through her and servants were not unwilling to carry in her stories about rabbits knocked down unawares by a stick and pheasants or partridges killed by chance in reaping  indeed she had a little trade in dripping and other scraps with sundry of these servants which rendered them the more disposed to receive her    chapter twelve  prizes    miss jenny and polly   had each a new dolly   with rosy red cheeks and blue eyes   dressed in ribbons and gauze   and they quarrelled because   the dolls were not both of a size   the daisy  nobody offered a hundred golden guineas to bring elizabeth and anne morris to school nevertheless they appeared there at the end of the second week  they were heartily tired of home where there was washing to be done and their eldest sister patty banged them about and they had no peace from the great heavy baby  besides there had been a talk of prizes at christmas and they werent going to let them moles and pucklechurches get the whole of them  moreover others were going back so why should not they  yes nanny bartons children did terrify her so she had no peace and betsy seddons janie had torn her frock as there was no bearing and even the dan hewletts were going back  little judy had cried to go and her aunt judith had trimmed up the heads of her sisters for dora carbonel had not been a firstrate haircutter and it was nearly the same with every one except the desperate truant ben shales and the cobblers little curly girl who was sent all the way to downhill to miss minifers genteel academy where she learnt beadwork and very little besides  the affair seemed to have done less harm than captain carbonel had expected yet on the other hand the motives that brought most of the scholars back were not any real desire for improvement but rather the desire of being interested and the hope of rewards  it would take a long time to make the generality of the people regard they gobblealls as anything but curious kind of creatures to be humoured for the sake of what could be got out of them  of the positive love of god and their neighbour and the strong sense of duty that actuated them few of the uphill inhabitants had the least notion  it would be much to say that if these motives were always present with edmund and mary it was so in the same degree with dora and sophy but to them the school children were the great interest occupation and delight and their real affection and sympathy so far as they understood were having their effect  they were hard at work at those same prizes which filled almost as much of their minds as they could those of the expectant recipients and occupied their fingers a good deal  and after all what would the modern scholar think of those same prizes  the prime ones of all the bible and prayerbook were of course in themselves as precious then as now but each was bound in the very plainest of darkbrown calf though to tell the truth far stronger than their successors and with the leaves much better sewn in  there was only one of each of these for susan pucklechurch and johnnie hewlett who were by far the foremost scholars in the sunday school  then followed two new testaments and two psalters equally brown for the next degree  sophy had begged for stories but none were to be had within the appointed sum except hannah mores cheap repository tracts really interesting but sent forth without wrappers in their native black and white  then there was a manufacture by the busy fingers frocks made of remnants of linsey and print of sunbonnets of pink or blue spotted calico of pinafores and round capes the least of all these being the list tippet made of the listing of flannel sewn on either in rays upon a lining or in continued rows from the neck leaving rather the effect of a shell  there were pincushions housewives and workbags too and pictured pockethandkerchiefs and sophy would not be denied a few worsted balls for the very small boys and sixpennyworth of wooden dolls for the lesser girls creatures with painted faces and rolls of linen for arms nailed on to bodies that ended in a point but all deficiencies were concealed by the gay print petticoats which she constructed and as neither toys nor the means of buying them were plentiful these would be grand rewards  the christmastree had not yet begun to spring in england magic lanterns were tiny things only seen in private and even such festivities as the tea had not dawned on the scholastic mind  so on the afternoon of christmas day all the children were assembled in school before mr harford the ladies and the schoolmistress while the table was loaded with books and garments and beside it stood a great flasket brimming over with substantial currant buns gazed on eagerly by the little things some of whom had even had a scanty christmas dinner such a spectacle had never been seen before in uphill and their hungry eyes devoured it beforehand  mr harford made them a short speech about goodness steadiness and diligence and then the distribution began with the two prime sunday scholars and went on in due order of merit through all degrees down to the mites who had the painted dolls and figured handkerchiefs with aesops fables in pink or in purple and then followed the distribution of buns stout plum buns no small treat to these ever hungry children some of whom were nibbling them before they were out of school while others more praiseworthy kept them to share with our baby at home  johnnie hewlett received a bible his sister polly a warm cape lizzie a petticoat little judy a doll but on the very last sunday jem always a black sheep had been detected in kicking jenny morris at church over a screw of peppermint drops which they had clubbed together to purchase from goody spurrell  the scent and jennys sobs had betrayed them in the thick of the combat and in the face of so recent and so flagrant a misdemeanour neither combatant could be allowed a prize though the buns were presented to them through marys softness of heart  these stayed the tears for the moment but a fresh shower was pumped up by jem for the sympathetic reception of his mother  it was a shame it was but they ladies always had a spite at the poor little lad  he should have some nice bullseyes to make up to him that he should what call had they to be at him when it was all along of that there nasty little jenny  nevertheless at the gate she shared her wrath with jennys mother what call had they to want to make the poor children to be like parsons at church  jem shouldnt be there no more she could tell them  then nanny barton chimed in  and look what they did give  just a twopennyhalfpenny handkercher that her tom would be ashamed to wear  he wasnt for it was thick and warm and had been chosen because his poor little neck looked so blue  but molly went on  ladies did ought to know what became em to give  there was my lady duchess she gave em all scarlet cloaks and stuff frocks as there was some warmth in that was worth havinggiven to all alike  no talk of prizes for what id not demean myself to pick up out of the gutter  and look at mine proceeded molly  my johnnies got a bible as if there wasnt another in the house let alone judiths  his father he did say hed pawn it but johnnie he cried and judith made a work and hid it for him  but his father he says he wouldnt have johnnie made religious not for nothingjudith shes quite bad enough  oh our pollyshe got a little skimping cape what dont come down to her poor little elbows  if i went for to be a lady id be ashamed to give the like of that  happily every one did not receive the gifts in this spirit  there was much rejoicing over the testament frock and psalter of the little moles and their grandfather observed well you did ought to be good children there were no such encouragements when i was young  except your big old bible granfer put in bessy  that was give me by our old parson when me and your granny was married ay he did catechise we in church when we was children but we never got nothing for it  only the knowing it father and that you have sent on to us put in the widow  ay and thats the thing said the old man very gravely    chapter thirteen  against the grain    and shall the heirs of sinful blood   find joy unmixed in charity   keble  these first beginnings were really hard work and there was a great amount of unpopularity to be encountered for the people of uphill were so utterly unused to kindness that they could not believe that anything was done for them from disinterested motives  captain carbonel took great trouble to set up a coal club persuading the president of saint cyrils and the neighbouring landowners to subscribe and the farmers to fetch the coal on the plea that to have fuel on low terms would save the woods and hedges from destruction  tirzah especially and halfadozen women besides were to be met with great faggots of limbs of trees on their backs from mr selbys woods and the keepers were held to wink at it for in truth the want of fuel was terrible  mr selby talked of withholding his yearly contribution of blankets because the people were so ungrateful  as if it would do them any good to make them colder cried dora  so at last it was arranged that one of the barns should be filled with coal and captain carbonel and mr harford with old pucklechurch were to see it served out at sixpence a bushel every monday morning  and then pucklechurch reported that the people said depend on it the captain made a good thing of it  so when he divided one of his fields into allotment gardens for those who had portions too scanty for the growth of their potatoes though he let them off at a rate which brought in rent below the price of land in the parish the men were ready enough to hire them but they followed dan hewletts lead in believing that that gobbleall knowed what he was about and made a good thing of it while the farmers like mr goodenough were much displeased declaring that the allotments would only serve as an excuse for pilfering  truly whatever good was attempted in uphill had to be done against the stream for nobody seemed to be on the side of the carbonels except mr harford and a few of the poor such as the old pucklechurches widow mole and her father the george hewletts and poor judith grey besides all the better children who were easily won  it made the more difficulty that though captain carbonel was a patient man in deed did not set his expectations too high and bore in fact with an amazing amount of disappointment and misunderstanding yet he was not patient in word and was apt to speak very sharply when indignant with cruelty shuffling or what was more unlucky with stupidity  the men used to declare that he swore at them which was perfectly untrue for a profane word never crossed his lips but when he was very angry he spoke in a tone that perhaps might excuse them for thinking that his reproofs were flavoured as had been the abuse to which they were only too well accustomed  the tormentors of poor softy sam always slunk out of reach at the most distant report of the approach of the captain the curate or the ladies but the men never understood their objections to the sport that had hitherto been freely afforded by the idiot and had a general idea that the gentlefolk disliked whatever afforded them amusement  george hewlett indeed knew better but then he had never joined in baiting softy sam and indeed had more than once sheltered him from his enemies and given him a bit of food  but george in his own line was dull and unapt to learn or the whole adventure of the greenhow drawingroom paper would never have happened  he might have had it put up wrongly for that was wholly the defect of his perceptions but dan would not have been able to secure his unlawful gains  in fact dan had traded on his cousins honest straightforward blindness and stupidity a good many times already  captain carbonel stormed at george when he failed to understand directions or cut a bit of wood to waste but without loss of confidence and before long master hewlett came to accept it as the captains way and to trust him as a really kind and liberal employer and unluckily he did not always heed the rating so loudly given or rather he did not set his mind to comprehend what lay a little out of his usual beat and thus gave additional provocation though still captain carbonel bore with him and would not have rejected him in favour of the far smarter carpenter at downhill on any of these provocations  dan who was a much sharper fellow could have helped a great deal but his back was up at the first word and he would do nothing but sulk moreover george himself detected him doing away with some wood out of that which was to make farmer goodenoughs farm gates under colour that it was a remnant only fit for firewood  having already announced that he would never again employ his cousin after another of these peculations he kept to his word and in spite of mollys tears and abuse and dans deeper objurgations he persisted  daniel tried to get work at downhill but all the time declared that them gobblealls was at the bottom of it having a spite at him  just at this time captain carbonel was driving the phaeton with his wife in it home from elchester when just as they were passing todds house a terrible scream was heard  shrieks that did not mean naughtiness but agony and a flame was visible within the door  in one moment the captain was over the wicket past the lurcher dragging with him his great old military cloak which had been over marys knees another second and he had wrapped little hoglah in it from top to toe stifling the flames by throwing her down and holding her tight while her mother came flying in from the garden and mary throwing the reins of the horse to the servant hurried in  tirzah was screaming and sobbing  my child  my dear  oh hoggie hoggie  is she dead  oh  no no i think not said the captain  and indeed no sooner did he begin to unroll her than cries broke out very sufficient answer as to the childs being alive and as her mother vehemently clasped her they grew more agonising  let me see how much she is burnt said mrs carbonel  you had better not squeeze her  it makes it worse  the childs poor little neck and bosom proved to have been sadly burnt her mother had been heating the oven and had gone out to fetch fresh faggots when the little one trying in babyfashion to imitate the proceedings had set her pinafore on fire  many more children were thus destroyed than now when they do not wear so much cotton nor such long frocks and pinafores  poor little hoglah screamed and moaned terribly and the thought of her being unbaptised came with a shock across mrs carbonel  however she did not think the injuries looked fatal and speaking gently to soothe the mother as she saw the preparations for baking she said i think we can give her a little ease my dear my dear  tirzah was sobbing screaming and calling on her dear child quite helpless at the moment while mary took the moaning child  captain carbonel with his own knife finding it more effective than the blunt old knife on the table cut off the remains of the little garments which had become tinder and then handed his wife the flour in a sort of scoop and as she sprinkled it over the burnt surface the shrieks and moans abated and gradually died away the child muttered nice nice and another word or two which her mother understood as asking for something to drink  beer to marys dismay was the only thing at hand but after a sup of that the little things black eyes closed and she said something of mammy and bye bye  the great old cradle stood by still used though the child was three years old and mrs carbonel laid her carefully in it  i think she will get well said she to the mother only you must not let the flour be disturbed on any account  she had arranged handkerchiefs her own and a red one of tirzahs to cover the dressing  i will send you some milk and dont let the coverings be disturbed  let her lie only give her milk when she wants it and i will come to see her tomorrow  tirzah was sobbing quietly now but she got out a choked question as to whether the child could get well  oh yes no fear of that if you let the flour alone as mrs carbonel tells you said the captain  oh oh if it wasnt for you the mother began  but edmund wanted to get his wife away before there was a scene and cut it short with there there  well come again  only let her alone and dont meddle with the flour  tirzah did what no native of uphill would have thought of  she clasped mrs carbonels hand threw herself on her knees and kissed it  thank god not me said mary much moved  but you will give her to god now and let her be baptised  i think she will live but it ought to be as gods child  when the curate came in a little later to hear how the child was tirzah allowed him to baptize her privately  it might partly have been the dread of missing the burial service but far more because in this present mood she was ready to do anything for madam  even when the neighbours thronged in and mrs spurrell wanted to take the child up pull off the flour and anoint her with oil and spirit she would not hear of it  they as saved her shall have their will of her said she  saved her  shell sleep herself off to death  whats the good of simple stuff like that with no sting nor bite in it said nanny barton  ay said mrs spurrell this ile as my greataunt gave me as they said was a white witch with all her charrums is right sovereign  why i did jenny trumans sally with it when her arm was burnt  ay and you could hear her holler all over the place said tirzah and sheve no use of her arm poor maid  no you shant touch my child no how  tirzah kept her word and mrs carbonel came every day and doctored the child and sophy brought her a doll which kept her peaceful for hours the lurcher never barked at them but seemed to understand their mission  and a wonderful old gipsy grandmother of tirzahs with eyes like needles and cheeks like brown leather came and muttered charms over the child and believed her cure was owing to them but she left a most beautiful basket white and purple for a present to the lady    chapter fourteen  an offer rejected    oft in lifes stillest shade reclining   in desolation unrepining   without a hope on earth to find   a mirror in an answering mind   meek souls there are who little deem   their daily strife an angels theme   keble  in the spring dora was invited to spend a few weeks with an old family friend in london where there were daughters who had always been her holiday friends and with whom she exchanged letters on big square pages of paper filled to the very utmost with small delicate handwriting crossed over so that they looked like chequerwork and going into all the flaps and round the seal  they did not come above once in a month or six weeks and contained descriptions of what the damsels had seen thought heard read or felt so that they were often really worth the eightpence that had to be paid on their reception  edmund who had business in london took his sisterinlaw there driving old major to the crossroads where they met the stagecoach  he went outside on the boxseat and she in the dull and closepacked interior where four persons and one small child had to make the best of their quarters for the six hours that the journey lasted  tired headachy and dusty with march dust at last dora emerged and was very glad to rattle through the london streets in a hackney coach to mr elwoods tall house where there was a warm welcome ready for her  but we need not hear of the pictures she saw nor the music she heard nor the plays she enjoyed nor the parties she went to during that thorough holidaythough perhaps some would not call it a holiday since the morning was spent in lessons in music drawing and italian in practising these same lessons and in reading history aloudthe reading of some lighter book being an evening pleasure when the family were alone  dora would not have enjoyed it half so much if it had not been for the times of real solid thought and interest  her friends too had some poems still in manuscript lent to them which made an immense impression on the young souls and which they all learnt and discussed on sundays trying to enter into their meaning and insensibly getting moulded by them  they were the poems that dora knew a few years later as the christian year  they made her homework still dearer to her and she had never let her interest fade among all her pleasures but she was accumulating little gifts for the children for betty pucklechurch widow mole judith grey and the rest  one day when some intimate friends of the elwoods were spending the day with them something was said about doras home and one of the visitors exclaimed uphilluphill near popplebyis that the place  yes  then i wonder whether you can tell me anything about our dear old nursery maid judith grey  judith grey  oh yes  she is the very nicest person in all uphill cried dora  is it your father that gives her a pension  yes  you know it was while carrying little selina downstairs that she put her foot into the string of jamess hummingtop and tumbled down all the stone stairs  she managed to save selinadear old judybut she hurt her back most dreadfully and she cant ever be well again so papa gives her an allowance  she writes cheerfully but we should like to hear more about her  we all were so fond of her  indeed i dont wonder  she is so good and patient  such a dear thing  mary and i call her the bright spot in our parish  she lives with a sister i think  is she nice  dora had her opportunity and she painted dan hewlett and his household in no flattering colours  molly was a slattern and dan was a thief and the children ate up judiths dainties and they all preyed upon her it was a perfectly horrid life for a good welltrained highprincipled person to lead  in fact she poured out all the indignant accusations that she and mary had been wont to make between themselves or to edmund and she sent caroline and anne barnard home greatly shocked at what she had told them of their dear judys surroundings  mrs barnard came the next day and begged to hear miss carbonels account  dora was a little more moderate than she had been to the young ladies but any way it was sad enough and mrs barnard gave hopes that something should be done  all the family sent little presents of books or articles of dress and dora promised to write and let her know of their reception  it was one of the great pleasures of the return to spread them out before judith and to tell of her sight of the dear young ladies and their mother and how tall and what a fine girl little miss selina had become  but she did not seem quite so happy when she perceived that dora had disclosed a good deal of her circumstances and observed that her sister was always a good sister to her  which dora took leave to doubt especially when she recognised miss barnards pretty gift of a blue turnover all on one side upon young pollys dirty shoulders judith waited and hoped and gave up hope and found fault with the barnards before she heard anything but at last she did  the barnards old housekeeper with whom judith had lived had married their head gardener  he had died and she was settled in a cottage in the park where she would be very happy to receive judith and make her comfortable  the place was only thirty miles off and if she consented mrs barnard would pay a visit she had been asked to make to the duchess and take judith back in the easy carriage so as to spare her all fatigue  dora and sophy were in a state of transport and wanted to rush off at once with the good news but mary withheld them  she thought it might be too much for so frail an invalid and insisted on going with them and telling judith herself  nor would she go till after sophys morning studies were over and they had had luncheons which bytheby was not an early dinner but a slender meal of cold meat cake or bread and cheese of which edmund never partook at all  she devised this delay on purpose to wear down the excitement and dora had begun to say how they should miss judith only it was all for her good  molly was out as the sisters hoped tossing the meadow hay and judith sat alone by the fire  mary told her very gently of the scheme and she kept on saying thank you maam while the tears came into her eyes mrs carbonel gave her mrs barnards letter to read but the tears came so thick and fast that she could not see it at first nor indeed fully grasp the meaning while two pairs of eyes were devouring her countenance as she read  mrs carbonel guessed how it was and saw that the transports which dora and sophy expected were not by any means near so she gently said we will leave you to read the letter and come again tomorrow to hear what you think  thank you maam thank you said poor judith as well as she could among her tears  how stupid she is cried sophy as they emerged into the road  i dont believe she could read mrs barnards letter said dora  no not for tears said mary  do you think she could have understood you added sophy  oh yes she understood well enough  but how could she be so dull as not to be delighted said sophy  so ungrateful too added dora  my dear dora  it was the embarrassment of her gratitude that touched me so much exclaimed mary  do you really think she will not be enchanted to get away from that dismal hole and live with honest people asked sophy  my dears i think you have quite forgotten that mrs dan hewlett is her sister  nobody would think so said dora  if she could only take johnnie and judy away with her said sophy before their father has spoiled them  you cant think she would refuse such an offer added dora  to be with a good nice woman and at peace among her friends  it really would be quite wicked in her to refuse  nevertheless mary withstood all the entreaties of her sisters to go with her to hear judiths decision  edmund heard them persuading her and in his peremptory manner desired them to desist  so they hovered about the garden and homefield waiting for news  but the news was not what they expected  mrs carbonel found judith very tearful but resolute  i could not do it maam  i am sorry sorry to the heart to seem ungrateful for her kindness but indeed i could not do it  i cannot leave my sister and the children  you would be so much more comfortableso much better looked after  yes maam i know that  mrs gregg is one of the best of women and so kind  it is very good of her to be willing to take me in but  you need not be afraid of the journey  mrs barnard will come for you  oh yes maam i know but theres my sister maam and her children i could not leave them  i was afraid they did not know how to take care of you and that your brotherinlaw was rough with you  my sister have been much better of late since you have been here maam and the poor children maam i can do something for them  i see that john and judy seem to respond to your care but is it right to give up all your comfort and peace and even your health for so little as you are enabled to do for them  it would be better if there were some appreciation of your care or some attention paid  molly is generally good to me  yes she is maam and poor little johnnie there aint nothing he would not do for me  im greatly obliged to mrs barnard and the dear young ladies  i would dearly like to see them again but molly is my sister and my sister is my sister and i cant feel it right to leave her  i honour you judith  it is a right feeling  but when they neglect you and prey upon you can it be incumbent on you to give up all for their sakes  i dont know maam but my poor sister she has a hard life and i think her husband would be worse to her if i went away  i couldnt have no comfort in thinking of them if i did  do they know of this  have they been persuading you  no maam i did not say a word  molly was out and i wanted to think it out without being worried and terrified  quite right judith  i am glad they do not know said mary who had learned that terrified did not mean frightened but tormented  i can well believe you have decided in true unselfishness and in the fear of god  but if you see reason to change your mind let me know in the course of the week  dora and sophy were really quite angry at judiths refusal especially dora who had taken all the trouble of representing her condition to the barnards  i should call it ungrateful she said only i believe it is pure weakness and folly  those people have been bullying her and tormenting her out of consenting  you are wrong dora said her sister they know nothing about it this is all her own doing  and said edmund if you were older dora you would know how to appreciate a very noble act of selfdenial  dora did not at all like edmund to talk of her being older but what he had said gave her something to think about and she began to reverence the feeling that made judith grey choose the rough and ungenial life with the hewletts to comfort and sympathy with her friends  mrs carbonel and judith were mistaken in thinking the transaction could pass unknown to the rest of the family  polly was near at hand but had hidden herself on the lads approach for fear of being called to account for not being at school and she reported to her mother that madam gobbleall had been ever so long with aunt atrying to persuade her to go away and live with them fine folks as she was in service with  molly had a certain real affection for her sister but to both her and dan the removal would be like the loss of the goose that laid the golden eggs and there is no saying what poor judith had to go through molly came and cried torrents of tears taking it for granted that judith meant to go and must be frightened out of it  it was of no use to declare that she had refused the lady  molly was so much in the habit of semideception that she could not believe the assurance and to hear her lamentations over her dear sister for whom no one could do like a bloodrelation and her horror at the idea of strangers being preferred to herself one would have thoughtas indeed she believed herselfthat she was judiths most devoted and indefatigable nurse and to think of them gobblealls being so sly such snakes in the grass as to try to get her away unknownst  she would not have them prying about her house again  dan declared it was all the cunning of them for fear judith should become chargeable to the parish and there her fine friends would die or give her up or she would just be thrown on the parish and passed on to a strange workhouse and then she would see what she got by leaving her kin  it was just like their sly tricks  in point of fact if judith had become chargeable to the parish dans remarks would have been equally true of uphill whence she would have been handed to the place where her father had lived and it was the object of every place to dispose of all superfluous paupers  but dan and molly wished her to imagine them willing to keep her freely in case of a failure of the supplies  poor thing  they really thought that their opposition had induced her to drop the idea and that it was for their own ease or the good of the rates that the carbonel ladies had tried to persuade her to leave them molly did not forbid the ladies the housethere was too much to be made out of the pickings from their presentsso judith did not lose the cheerfulness and comfort they brought her but dan laid up the proposal in his mind as another cause of hatred and illwill to captain carbonel    chapter fifteen  scales of justice    thou hast appointed justices of peace to call poor men before them   for matters they were not able to answershakespeare  when the parable of the wheat and the tares was spoken the blessed and only wise foresaw the extreme difficulty of rooting out the tares without injuring the wheat when the work is done by the ignorant or hasty hands of the servants  so it was at uphill  captain carbonel was made a county magistrate and thus had more power in his hands and his most earnest wish and prayer was to use it for the good of the parish  but things were very difficult  at the vestry the farmers agreed with him that barton and morris ought not to have additional parish relief great strong men as they were who had both refused extra hours of labour offered by farmers of a kind they did not like and now demanded help on the score of their large families  in fact it had become the custom to demand relief for every fresh child that was born and the men were often idle in consequence  there were men with many children who had never come on the parish because they were trustworthy and sober and their wives were thrifty  each magistrate could point to several of these and each knew how the small and struggling ratepayers were oppressed  nor could it be fair that these men should be maintained in idleness or dawdling at the expense of the hardworking small shopkeepers  every gentleman on the bench who had weakly yielded before and had given an order to whoever tramped over to ask for it was very glad to have some one who would speak out and take the burthen of unpopularity so the order was not given and barton and morris walked home disappointed but not till they had each taken a pint or two of beer at the blue lion on their way home uttering many curses on that there gobbleall  captain carbonel did not hear those same curses but as he rode home he saw the two men stagger out of the blue lion refreshed not only by their own pints but by those of sympathisers  and the sight did not make him sorry for what he had done knowing well that george hewlett cox the cobbler and mrs holly the widow with a small shop were almost borne down with the rates and not seeing why they should toil that billy and nanny barton should lounge and drink  billy barton however did more  he joined an expedition which dan hewlett was already organising with joe todd as much for revenge as profit to have a night of poaching in mr selbys woods in which there were a number of fine pheasants not so many as at present where preserves are strictly kept but poaching was more profitable in some ways since in those days poulterers were not allowed to sell game openly but gave a higher price to men who could contrive to convey it to them and then sold it at a great profit to pretentious people who had no friends to give it to them but who wanted to show it at their dinnerparties  tirzah todd as usual was the means of disposing of most of these gains  her lively ways made poulterers and servants inclined to further her dealings  she was a great deal too sharp to carry any save her lawful wares to greenhow farm but in the last year since the carbonels had come especially since the captain had been a magistrate the trade had been less prosperous and required more caution  once captain carbonel had found a wire for a hare in his hedge and had made it known that he should prosecute any one whom he caught out  he was no eager sportsman himself but he had a respect for the law  the poachers arranged a raid upon the selby woods in which joe todd dan hewlett and billy barton all took part  the first of these was too sharp to be caught by the keepers  he had all the litheness and cunning of his gipsy blood and was actually safe in the branches of a tree overhead while dan having put his foot into a rabbithole was seized by one keeper with his gun and a bag of spoil and billy barton in his bewilderment ran straight into the arms of another with a pheasants tail poking up his short smockfrock as it stuck out of his pocket  of course mr selby could not commit for an offence against himself so hewlett and barton were hauled off to captain carbonel while their wives begged to see madam and they were conducted to the verandah for the justice business was going on in the large kitchen  no doubt they expected though nanny had read no novels that the magistrate would sit enthroned in the most public place in the house that the women would weep that the ladies with softened hearts would throw themselves before him like queen philippa at calais and beg off the victims  of what could should or ought to be done they had no notion and of course they were both in terrible distress nanny crying passionately into her apron and protestingwhenever she could get voice between her sobs that if the good lady would get the good gentleman to forgive him this timehe would never never do so no more  while molly hewlett who had some remnants of old respectability about her was trying her utmost to induce mrs carbonel to intercede  it was the first time  he was led to it  it was for sport  he had never done it before  to be sure madam would not let em be hard on poor judiths brother  no hewlettno nor any greyhad ever been in prison before  he was just drove to it because that there george would give him no work  she and her poor children would have to come to the workhouse and poor judith  nanny too began to cry out about her poor children and the parish  meanwhile mrs carbonel had been trying to get in a word to make them understand that the matter did not rest with the captain and that he had no choice at all in the question but to commit them to gaol to take their trial  he had no power to let them off and she could do nothing though she was sincerely sorry for the wives but they neither heard nor tried to hear and as the cart was driven up by master pucklechurch the keeper and the constable cox to the back door for the handcuffed prisoners weeping and wailing of the loudest arose and the women darted round to embrace their husbands evidently expecting mrs carbonel to assure them that she would charge herself with the support of their families while they were in prison  she was so much distressed and so pitiful that she was just going to do something of the kind but her husbands gesture stopped her  billy barton howled more loudly than his wife and as he could not raise his hands to his face presented a terrible spectacle though the captain declared there were no tears to be seen  dan stood grim stolid and impassive and if he spoke at all it was in a muttered oath at the noise his wife was making  it was a great relief when the cart was driven off followed by the two women and captain carbonel exclaimed  poor creatures  that barton is a fool but mr dan is something worse  oh those poor women  why would you not let me speak edmund and promise that they should not starve  the parish will take care of that mary you need not be afraid  it sounds so hardhearted said dora and sophy to each other  but edmund did not prevent nor wish to prevent their going to see judith nor taking with them much more solid food than she was in the habit of eating  thick sandwiches and lumps of cold pudding were likewise conveyed to the barton children at school so that probably they fared much better than was their usual habit  judith said she was sorry that dan should go for to do such a thing but she was less indignant than dora expected and she cried though more quietly than her sister when he was sentenced to three months imprisonment  it was to be said for molly hewlett that enough of her old training remained about her to keep her a sober woman but captain carbonel saw nanny barton reeling out of the blue lion on the day of the conviction much the worse for the treatings she had enjoyed by way of consolation  if george hewlett had any strong feelings about his brothers disaster he did not communicate them he went about his work just as usual and whistled as much as ever  but he took johnnie who was only eleven years old into his workshop and gave him eighteenpence a week for doing what he could and he turned out handy diligent and trustworthy so as to be fully worth the money and thus to stay on when his father came out of prison  dan was much the same man as when he went into gaol save that his hatred to captain carbonel had increased    chapter sixteen  linchpins    and leave them laughing ho  ho horobin goodfellow  notice was sent from the bishop of the diocese that he was about to hold a confirmation at poppleby in six weeks time  this was matter of rejoicing to mr harford who had mourned over the very few communicants  before he came the celebrations had been only three times a year and were attended by most of the aged paupers  to the joy of the carbonels the feast was monthly after his coming but the first time the aged people were there and all lingered george hewlett the clerk said when the curate looked to him for information  the alms sir  they be waiting for the money in the plate  why that is to be reserved for sick and distressed  mr selby he always give it out to them and so did mr jones afore him sir  they be all expecting of it  mr harford thought that it might be best not to disappoint the old people suddenly so he stood at the vestry door counting heads and numbering among them two whom he had already been somewhat startled to see present themselves namely dame spurrell whom he had heard abusing her neighbour with a torrent of foul words and who pretended to be a witch and tom jarrold whom hewlett had described to him as the wickedest old chap in the parish  he took counsel with the churchwardens farmers goodenough and rawson who both agreed that they were a bad lot who didnt deserve nothing but it helped to keep down the rates  then he talked to captain carbonel who being a reverent man was dismayed at what he heard  just paying the old souls for coming in no fit state he said  then you advise me to change the system  you have no other choice returned the soldier  read out your standing orders and preach if you will explaining the matter  this mr harford did but not by any means all the persons concerned were present and he afterwards went round among them explaining that though they were to be helped in any distress and the alms would be kept for the purpose it was profane to give them out as a sort of payment to those who partook  old redford widow moles father was the only person who seemed to enter into the scruples  yes sir he said it went agin me to sim to be paid for coming to the lords table and i wouldnt neer ha done it but a shilling is a shilling to my poor daughter and when i could get to church it was hard on her to miss the chance  the next celebration was only attended by the carbonels old mrs rawson and redford nor at the next ensuing whitsuntide were the numbers much increased  in spite of all that mr harford could preach and say in private the main body of the parishioners would not listen to the invitation  and the disaffected grumbled among themselves that he kept the money for himself and no one would never see the colour of it  there really were only thirteen communicants in the parish when these had seceded  and mr harford looked to the confirmation to bring more intelligent and devout worshippers though the time for preparation was short  he found that most people had been confirmed at minsterham cathedral and there were reminiscences of great holidays few and far between and no difficulty was made as to the young people up to twenty years old being nominated for confirmation  there was some disappointment that it should be only at poppleby as furnishing so much less of a days pleasure and when it was found that mr harford expected the candidates at regular classes and private lectures there were objections  farm lads could not be spared maids in farmhouses still less  what should parson want to be always at em said mrs goodenough old mr jones he never made no work with them  however she had two daughters to be confirmed and the reigning lizzie was allowed to go as an escort to them  the elder lads who were really grown men would not come at all and could never be found they wouldnt be catechiznot they  the sunday scholars male and female came pretty well but not in large numbers and the age fixed for confirmation was fifteen so that those who were fresh from teaching were not many  sophia carbonel was a candidate and very much in earnest but mr harford preferred giving her books to read and questions to answer in private as with most of the others he had to begin at the very beginning  the misses goodenough knew almost nothingfar less than susan pucklechurch and rachel mole who were the gems of the female class as was johnnie hewlett of that of the youths the brightest of these was however in some respects fred allen of the general shop  he had been at school at downhill and could really read and write better than johnnie and far better than any one else for the chief scholars only made what betty pucklechurch called a sad hackering job of un and most scarcely knew a letter having forgotten whatever they might have learnt at dame verdons before they went out birdstarving  fred allen began by answering when asked what was done in confirmation taking all your godfathers and godmothers sins upon you and becoming liable to be balloted for the militia  it was a startling view and as far as mr harford could make out it was shared by most of the candidates but then they had very little notion of what sin meant as if they had a general idea it was plain that they did not seriously expect to suffer for their sponsors sins after confirmation or that the sponsors suffered for theirs previously  the curate taught questioned explained and exhorted  fred allen knew little but his wits were sharper and he took in mr harfords instructions more readily and remembered them better while apparently most of the other minds were and remained a blank  only he could not refrain from causing horselaughs outside and making grins at every opportunity  but with much anxiety and after many exhortations mr harford gave out his tickets  the girls were to be conveyedthe most of themin the greenhow waggon driven by old pucklechurch the boys to walk  mr goodenough would drive his daughters and sophia in her white dress and cap nobody wore a veil then would be with her sisters and brother in the chariot with posthorses  captain carbonel and mr harford went outside on the box  they had passed downhill and were getting on as well as their horses could through the muddy ground at the bottom freshly stirred up by a previous wet day  before them was a steep short ascent but at the bottom of this there was a sudden stop  the captain put his head in at the window and said only the cartno harm and strode on following mr harford while the ladies craned their heads out and dora exclaiming an accident ran after him and mary only just withheld sophy in consideration of her white dress on the postboys assurance with a scarcely suppressed grin no harm done maam  only they lads  for what the two gentlemen and the amused postboy had seen was this the squadron of boys had overtaken the cart full of girls when just as the waggon had come to the pitch of the hill all the load of maidens were seen tumbling out at the back and as the horses of the chariot halted the girls screams mingled with the horselaughter of the boys was plainly to be heard  only susan pucklechurch sitting on the front seat with her father remained in her place  the girls were giggling and helping one another up nearly all unhurt but some very angry and bessy linwood was scolding violently pucklechurch likewise in his most growling voice ye young goodfornoughts  ill lay the cart whip about your idle mischievous backs while the party of boys were still laughing and one voice was heard to shout rubbish shot here  a peal of laughter followed but was cut short by bessy linwoods heres parson youll catch it  then at the top of her voice sir tis them boys  theyve bin and pulled out the linchpins and shot us all down into the mud  is this so said the captain sternly while silence came down on the party except for the sobs of jenny hewlett who had gone into a dirty pool and whom rachel mole and betsy seddon were brushing down vigorously  quite true sir returned pucklechurch  they young dogs got behind and played the poor maids this trick  who did demanded mr harford  bessy linwood spoke up and said it was all on em but she saw fred allen at it  no doubt the fun of the thing had been too much for the boys in their holiday mood of thoughtlessness and they stood looking sheepish but mr harford was very stern and sharp with them  lads do you think that if you could play such a trick you can be in a fit state to take solemn vows upon you  no one spoke up except fred allen  we didnt do em no harm he said  no harm  to disturb all good thoughts in their minds and your own and drive out all serious impressions by this mischievous trick  now will any one come forward and say he is sorry  mr harford waited but no one stirred  he bade the girls get in again and pucklechurch drive them on  he waited again but no one spoke indeed allen and another big youth were seen making for a gap in the hedge  will no one say he is sorry for what was an idle trick but very wrong when you ought to be thinking how you would be giving yourselves up to god  they stood like stocks and captain carbonel said has no one the grace to regret a very improper and thoughtless action  still no one moved  then said the clergyman there is no choice left to me  it would be profanation to take persons in such a mood to make vows and kneel to receive gods grace which they evidently make light of  whoever will not come and apologise must go home  there was no movement among the white round frocks  boys are like sheep what one does the others do and few are to be found to stand alone  mr harford looked anxiously at johnnie hewlett and one or two more from whom he expected better things but they only looked down with their hands in their pockets and sullen faces and captain carbonel held up his watch to show that they should all be too late  there was nothing to be done but to return to their seats and urge the postboy to hurry on  the bells of poppleby church might ring merrily but the heart of the curate was very heavy with the questionswhether this misfortune could be owing to his not having impressed the lads enough while preparing them or to his having been too hasty and peremptory in his indignation  captain carbonel said they were such intolerable louts that to disappoint them was all the better and they would know how to present themselves more seriously another time but mr harford much doubted whether they would ever present themselves again  it would just be mockery for them to make the vow said the captain  ah they miss the grace said the curate  harriet allen was crying all through the time of the confirmation when she perceived that her brothers head was not among the boys  indeed the only male candidate from uphill was will cox who had gone with his cousins from downhill  most of the boys were glad to have got off making the vow for in spite of all mr harfords teaching there were some who still believed that they would take all their godparents sins upon them or at any rate that they should feel more bound to take heed to their ways  johnnie hewlett indeed was sorry when he went home to his aunt and had to tell her why he had not been confirmed after all  oh johnnie johnnie you didnt go for to upset the maids  i  no  i was at the bottom of the hill with harry coles  then why couldnt you have said so  he hung his head and twisted his hands  oh johnnie what was it  was it only the going along with the others  still he made no reply but judith saw in his face that this was the reason  oh my boy  to think that you did not feel that gods blessing and grace were worth standing out for against a lot of idle chaps and now you wont be able to take the sacrament  father never would let i returned the boy  oh my dear dear lad dont you know that you might have got strength and would get strength to stand up for yourself and do what you ought oh dear  my hope is gone she cried bitterly and though johnnie got away from the sight her distress really found its way into his heart while he said very little except there there auntie never mind maybe ill try again next time  you promise me john hewlett even if im not here to see  yes i promise aunt said he glad to have silenced her regrets and hoping the fulfilment was a good way off  the parishioners especially those who had only sons and not daughters were very angry  they did not value confirmation greatly but that the curate after making such a work with the poor lads as never was should have presumed to reject them made them furious  mr allen even threatened to write to dr fogram but as he did not know how to address a letter to what he called oxford college he contented himself with walking off with his belongings to downhill church every sundaythat is when they went anywhere    chapter seventeen  progress or no progress    for some cry quick and some cry slow   but while the hills remain   uphill too slow will need the whip   downhill too quick the chain   tennyson  several years had passed away and marys approach had never been made though the lane had been improved and worn a good deal smoother and the duchess and other grandees had found their way along it  there were other expenses and other interests  dora was married  a fellowsoldier of captain carbonels had come on a visit and had carried the bright young sister off to malta  she was a terrible loss to all the parish and it would have been worse if sophia had not grown up to take her place and to be the great helper in the school and parish as well as the storyteller and playmate the ever ready aunt sophy of the little children  and these years had made the farm and garden look much prettier and neater altogether  the garden was full of flowers and roses climbed up the verandah and the homefield beyond looked quite parklike with iron railings between so that the pretty gentle alderney cows could be plainly seen  the skimmilk afforded by those same cows went in great part to the delicate children in the village though mrs carbonel had every year to fight a battle for it with master pucklechurch and his wife who considered the whole of it as the right of the calves and little pigs and would hardly allow that the little human bartons or morrises were more worth rearing  there had been a visitation of measles through the villagevery bad in the cottages and at greenhow the three little children had all been very ill the second dora died and the elder one little mary remained exceedingly delicate screaming herself ill on any alarm or agitation and needing the most anxious care  the cottagers had learnt to look to greenhow and the gobblealls as the safe resource in time of any distress whether of a child having eaten too many blackberries or of a man being helpless from rhumatiz a girl needing a recommendation to a service or please sir i wants to know if it is allowed for a man to kill my father which was the startling preface to george trumans complaint of a publichouse row in which his father had got a black eye  still there was less fighting among the men and much less among the women since nanny barton and betsy seddon had lodged counteraccusations after a great quarrel over the well when nanny had called betsy among other choice epithets a sneaking hypercriting old cat of a goody and betsy had returned the compliment by terming nanny a drunken trapesing goodfornothing jade as had no call to good water  on which nanny had torn out a large bunch of betsys hair and betsy had used her claws to make long scratches on nannys cheeks the scars of which were cherished for the magistrates  it was expected in the village that betsy would get off being that she and her husband worked for captain gobbleall and nanny was known when a bit overtaken to have sauced miss sophy  nevertheless they were equally fined with the choice of three weeks imprisonment and to every ones surprise the fines were produced  betsy thought it very hard that she should be fined when she worked in the captains fields and she lamented still more when he insisted on the family removing to a vacant cottage of his own between two of his fields  it was in better condition had more garden and a lower rent and her husband who was a quiet man never quarrelling unless she made him much rejoiced  she have too much tongue he said and she had to keep the peace for the captain declared that after the next uproar in his fields he should give her no more work there  and though she declared it was not her but they women who would not let her alone things certainly became much quieter  for captain carbonel was an active magistrate busy in all the county improvements and preserving as much order in the two parishes as was possible where there was no rural police only the constable cobbler cox who was said to be more skeered of the rogues than the rogues was of he and at downhill appleton the thatcher who was generally to be found enjoying himself at the selby arms  still fewer cases came up to the bench than in former times and uphill hardly furnished one conviction in a quarter  the doctors at the infirmary said that they knew an uphill person by the tidier clothing  this was chiefly owing to the weekly club of which the women were very glad  it is just as if it was given they said when the clothes came in halfyearly and decent garments encouraged more attendance at church  there was no doubt that uphill was more orderly but who could tell what was the amount of real improvement in the peoples hearts and souls  that first confirmation had only produced two additional communicants sophia carbonel and susan pucklechurch who was in training in the greenhow nursery  not one of the others came to the holy feast  their parents for the most part said they were too young and as these parents never came themselves the matter seemed hopeless unless some deeper religious feeling could be infused by diligent care  in one case where there was a terrible illness and a slow recovery of george truman he became strongly impressed and so did his wife a very nice meek woman who had been in a good service  they both came to the holy communion the month after the man was out again but he did not keep it up  sir if you knew what the talk was like out in the fields you would not wish it he said  which gave mr harford much to think about  the next confirmation three years later collected nearly the same number of boys and girls and mr harford walked with the boys himself and sent mrs thorpe with the girls so that there was no such scandal as before  the only lad who presented himself from among those rejected of the former year was johnnie hewlett  he was by this time older than any of the other candidates and he had learnt in a measure to stand alone though it was chiefly his promise to his aunt that brought him now  he still worked with his cousin george hewlett and was a good deal trusted and made useful  his father had however drifted farther and farther away since george had absolutely refused to employ him again in his business  you never know where you are with such as he said george and with good reason but dan laid it all to they gobblealls and their spite it was so far true that it was the depredations at greenhow farm that first convinced george that dan was an absolute pilferer though he had before suspected it and tried to shut his eyes to the doubt  dan being a really clever workman far brighterwitted than george had lived upon chance jobs at downhill or poppleby together with a good deal of underhand poaching which he kept as much as possible from the knowledge of his family never being sure what molly might not tell her sister nor what judith might disclose to the ladies  polly had made a miserable marriage and jenny was in service at a publichouse jem a big idle lad whom no one employed if it could be helped judy was still at home and a comfort to her aunt  it was his aunt that chiefly induced john to live at home though he could easily have lodged away and have been nearer to the workshop  his father had let him alone and not interfered with his sunday school going as long as he was a mere boy till this second time when at eighteen and grown to mans stature he was going up as a candidate with the younger ones  then the father swore he was not going to have his son make a tomfool of hisself to please that there parson  i have promised said john  promised  whatparson or ladies or any sneaks that come meddling where no one wants em  twere not parson said john  then twas one of they gobbleallswith an oath  that aint of no account  twerent again said john  no more was to be got out of him than twerent and i shall keep my word  he was too big to be beaten a tall strong wellmade youth and dan was obliged to let him alone and only swear at him for turning his back on his old father and being no better than a methody  in point of fact molly and the two younger children were chiefly supported by johns earnings and judiths pension for whatever dan earned at downhill or picked up in his various fashions was pretty sure to be swallowed either by the blue lion or by the fox and hounds judith was entirely in bed upstairs and the kitchen had lost all the little semblance of smartness it once had  while molly might have been taken for sixty years old instead of fortyfive though that was not unusual among the hardworking women who got aged and dried up with weather in the fields and with toil and care at homeeven when they had kindly sober husbands  judiths room was a place of peace and order so kept by the help of little judy and of john both of whom loved her heartily and felt as if she were a mother to them  she had brought home to them all the good that they knew  she had always made them say their prayers by her as children and john continued to do so still for old sakes sake if for no other reason  they had always repeated to her what they had heard at school and byandby the text and substance of the sermons as far as they could and she told them her own thoughts freely and earnestly thoughts that came partly from the readings of mrs carbonel and mr harford with her but far more than she knew from her own study of the bible backed by her earnest spiritual mind which grew deeper and deeper as her earthly sufferings increased  of course she had tried to do the same with her sister and the other children but none of them would endure it  molly always had something to do elsewhere and said what was all very well for a sick woman like judith could not be expected in one who had such a lot of trouble that she did not know which way to look  poor thing  neither judith nor mr harford could persuade her that there was a way to look which would have lightened all these troubles but john had learnt how to stand alone and he did so not only by presenting himself for confirmation but by becoming a communicant  not another lad did so but his cousin george and his wife had begun at last under the influence of mr harfords sermons and so had a few more in the parish  john in his cousins workshop was shielded from a good deal of the evil talk and jesting that went on among his fellows in the fields  he took after george in being grave and quiet and he loved no company better than his invalid aunts but to be a steady and religious youth was a more difficult matter in those days than at present for harmless outlets for youthful spirits had not been devised and to avoid mischief it was almost needful to abstain from almost all the company and pleasures of a country lad    chapter eighteen  the threshingmachine    when lawless mobs insult the court   that man shall be my toast   if breaking windows be the sport   who bravely breaks the most   cowper  captain carbonel had made his farming answer better than his friends or still more the farmers had predicted  he had gone to the markets and talked with the farmers and not shown off any airs though as they said he was a gentleman so known by his honest straightforward dealing  nor had he been tempted to launch out into experiments and improvements beyond what he could properly afford though he kept everything in good order and used new methods according to the soil of his farm  master pucklechurch growled at first and foretold that nothing would come of thicken a that the mangled weazel as he called the mangel wurzel would not grow and that the cows would never eat that there red clover as they calls apollyon but when the mangel swelled into splendid crimson root and the cows throve upon the bright fields of trifolium he was as proud as any one and he showed off the sleek sides of the kine and the big misshapen roots of the beet with the utmost satisfaction  equal grumbling heralded the introduction of a threshingmachine which captain carbonel purchased after long consideration  the beat of the flail on barn floors was a regular winter sound at uphill as in all the country round but to get all the corn threshed and winnowed by a curious revolving fan with four canvas sails was a troublesome affair making farmers behindhand in coming to the market  and as soon as he could afford the venture the captain obtained a machine to be worked by horsepower for steam had hardly been brought as yet into use even for sea traffic and the first railway was only opened late in 1830 the time of the accession of william the fourth  the farm people with old pucklechurch at their head looked at the operations of the machine with some distrust but this gradually became wonder and admiration on the part of the greenhow labourers for threshing with the flail was very hard work for the shoulders and back and captain carbonel took care to find employment for the men in winter time so that his men did not join in the complaint of barton and morris that there wouldnt be nothing for a poor chap to get his bread by in the winter  in truth the machine and its work were a perfect show to the neighbourhood for the first harvest or two when seddon was to be seen sitting aloft enthroned over a mist of dust driving the horse that went round and round turning the flails that beat out corn from the ears in the sheaves with which pucklechurch and truman fed the interior  all greenhow was proud of its mr machy as the little mary called it thinking perhaps that it was a wonderful live creature  the neighbourhood remained quiet even when george the fourth died and there was much hope and rejoicing over the accession of his brother who was reported to be the friend of the people and to mean to make changes in their favour  poor old george hewlett was however much exercised on the first sunday when in the prayers for the king mr harford inadvertently said george instead of william and george hewlett the clerk held it to be praying for the dead which he supposed to be an act forbidden  there was of course an election for the new parliament but it did not greatly affect uphill as nobody had any votes except captain carbonel the farmers and the landlord of the fox and hounds and the place was too far from minsterham for any one to share in the election news except dan hewlett and joe todd who tramped over thither to hear the speeches swell the riotous multitude and partake of all the beer to which both sides freely treated all comers  they came home full of news and reported in the bar of the fox and hounds that there were to be grand doings in this new parliament the people wasnt going to stand it no longer not if the right gentlemen got in but there would be an end of they machines as made horses do mens work and take the bread from their poor children  beer would be ever so much cheaper and every poor man would have a fat pig in his sty  that is if mr bramdean as was the peoples friend got in  why he was the one as our captain gobbleall was agin observed cox who had come in to hear the news  to be sure he was gobbleall is hand and glove with all the tyrums hant he got a machine said dan in an oracular manner  no one will never tell me as how our captain aint a friend o the people returned seddon  dont he get coals reasonable for us and didnt he head the petition for your pig jim and draw it up too  ay but what right had he to say my missus shouldnt take it out of the parish said jim parsons  wed a made a couple of pounds more if shed been free to go her rounds as betty blake did  ay thats the way of em  they grudges us everything what they dont give themselves said dan and little of that too  no one understood the spirit which desired to make people independent and raise them above indiscriminate beggary and todd said with a grim laugh they would not see us make a little purse for ourselves not if they can help it  seddon feebly said the ladies was free enough with their gifts  they had never had no one before to help the women folk and the children  pigs wash  much good may it do em said dan so contemptuously that seddon durst not utter another word in the general laugh though he carried home a little can of milk every day and he and others well knew the store that their wives set by the assistance of their little ones  they knew it well enough though they were afraid to maintain the cause of the gobblealls before such an orator as dan and nothing worse than these grumblings took place all harvest time where the whole families were fully employed the men each taking a portion of the field while their wives and children aided in the reaping and binding and earned sums amongst them which would pay the quarters rent buy the pig and provide huge boots for the father if for no others of the family  the farmers provided substantial luncheons and suppers for the toilers in the field and when all was over and the last load carried amid joyful shouts there was a great harvest supper at each farm where songs were sung dances were danced and there was often a most unlimited quantity of beer swallowed  no one had then thought of harvest thanksgivings but at greenhow there was as usual the farm supper but with only ale enough for good and not for harm the ladies came to hear the songs in the great farm kitchen and the party had to break up at nine oclock  the women especially mrs mole were glad but the men even the steady ones did not like having only half an evening of it and such a mean sup of beer  it really was excellent strong beerfar better than the farmers brewbut that did not matter to the discontented who instead of letting themselves be taken home by their wives adjourned to the fox and hounds and there sat over their pint cups replenished from time to time while they discussed the captains meanness and listened to a dirty old newspaper which told of the doings of jack swing who was going about in wiltshire raising mobs threatening farmers and squires and destroying machines  there was much excitement among the gentry about reform but apparently the poor cared not about it  to the uphill mind wiltshire was as strange and distant a country as australia and this made little impression so that as the days went on everybody went to their usual work and there was no alarm  oh no said mrs carbonel the people here have far too much good sense to want to molest their best friends  they quite admire our threshingmachine and see what a saving of labour it is  however it was thought right to raise a body of yeomanry for the defence of the country in case the disaffection should become more serious and the assistance of captain carbonel at the county town was urgently requested to organise the members of it  he left home for a few days without the least anxiety  and mr harford too went on the monday to attend a college meeting at oxford and would not return till he had visited his patient ladylove  the selbys were away spending the autumn at cheltenham    chapter nineteen  a night journey    and he must post without delay   along the bridge and through the dale   and by the church and oer the down   wordsworth  john hewlett had finished his days work and come home in the dusk of an october evening  he found the house hung all over with the family linen taken in to shelter from a shower but not before it had become damp enough to need to be put by the fire before it could be ironed or folded  his mother was moaning over it and there was no place to sit down  he did not wonder that jem had taken his hunch of bread and gone away with it nor that his father was not at home but he took off his boots at the back door as his aunt never liked his coming into her room in themthough they were nothing to what he would have worn had he worked in the fieldsand then climbed up the stairs  judith was sitting up in bed with her teapot teacup and a piece of stale loaf laid out on a tray before her and little judy beside her drinking out of a cracked mug  judiths eyes had a strange look of fright in them but there was an air of relief when she saw johnnie  well aunt is that all you have got for tea  poor mother has been hindered but never mind that returned judith in a quick agitated tone  judy my dear drink up your tea and run down to help mother theres a dear  you havent brought nothing johnnie judy lingered to ask  no not i  ive worked too late to go to shop said johnnie  go down my dear as i told you said judith with a little unwonted tone of impatience which made the youth certain that she had something important to tell him and as soon as the little girl began clumping down the stairs she held out her hand and said in the lowest of voices come near johnnie that you may hear  he came near she put out her hand to pull him on his knees so that his ear might be close to her and whispered jack swing is coming to greenhow tomorrow  the captain away  how do you know  a man came and talked with your father in the back gardenjust under this window  mother had run up to shop for a bit of soap but they thought she might come in any minute and so went out at the back door so that i heard them all the better  they never thought of that  well  they mean to come on greenhow ask for money and arms break up the machine and burn the ricks if they dont get what they want  father said they might be sure of the downhill men and most of em here for they all hate that there machine that is to starve poor folk in winter time and those that were not of that way would be afraid to hold back or they would show them the reason why  and the captain away  it is enough to be the death of madam and the little ones  thats just what i thought  oh johnnie dear cant you help to save them and hinder it  master wouldnt go along with such doings said john  i wouldnt answer for george  hes a steady man and would do no harm if hes let alone but hes a mortal fearsome one  no john theres no help for it but that you should get over in time to fetch the captain and let him take away the ladies or stand up for them  hell know what to be at  but will it get father into trouble asked john  not among so many  hes sharp enough  the captain if he were only at home would see how to get them away  anyway think of the poor ladies and the little children  john stood for a minute or two by the window thinking while judith sat up in her bed gazing at him with eager anxious eyes and at last he turned back and would have spoken aloud but that she raised her hand to caution him  he knelt down again beside her and said no aunt i couldnt rest to think of all those rough brutes of chaps from we dont know where coming and playing their rigs and bullying the ladies with no one to help  there was a lady frightened to death with themmaster was reading it out in the paper  yes ill go and fetch the captain home to take care of them  where is he  miss sophy told me he was at the hotel at minsterham with a lot of them  have you ever been there johnnie  yes  once i went with master in the cart when he wanted a bit of mahogany wood for mrs goodenoughs chairs  it is a long way said johnnie looking wistfully at the darkening window but ill do it please god  yes  please god and he will help you  youve had your tea  no well drink up thisit is cold enoughand take this hunch of bread i am afraid theres nothing better to be had  and heres sixpence in case you want a bit of food  ive got ninepence of my own said john feeling in his pocket and though most of his pay went to his mother for his washing and board he always kept a little back every week  there then youd best be off my dear lad  keep out of sight you know as long as you are in the village  johnnie bobbed his head and his aunt threw her arms round his neck and kissed him as she had not done since he was in petticoats and then she murmured god bless you my darling lad and take care of you  johnnie did not feel the prayer needless for in spite of his eighteen year he had all a country lads dislike of being out alone in the dark and to this was added the sense that it was a time when evilminded people might be about who would certainly assault and stop him if they guessed his errand  to meet his father would make it certain that he would be seized abused beaten and turned back with the reproach of being an unnatural sonturning against his father  of this however there was little chance as dan hewlett was pretty certain to be either in the fox and hounds or in the blue lion collecting partisans  and johnnie getting out through the back door then by the untidy garden and over the wall of the empty pigstye cut out into a stubble field he was not afraid of his mother missing him till bedtime as it was the wont of the youthsespecially of those who had comfortless homesto wander about in parties in the evening batfowling sometimes but often in an aimless sort of way doing little bits of mischief and seeking diversion which they seldom found unless there was any solitary figure to be shouted at and startled  his father was not likely to come in till after he was turned out of the publichouse so john strode all unseen across the field and through the gateway into the next  he did think of the possibilities of bringing arrest and prosecution upon his father but this did not greatly trouble him for at this early period no regular measures of defence had been taken against the rioters and as they went about disguised and did not as a rule threaten life they generally escaped scotfree  and the idea of a rude mob terrifying mrs carbonel to death was terrible to him  even since the day when she had stood before him in the sunday school at the washhouse at greenhow she had been his notion of all that was lovely and angelic in womanhood  she had said many a kind word to him over his work and little miss mary had come and watched him with intense interest eager chatter and many questions when he was mending the gate  he was obliged to go down to the bridge at downhill so as to cross the river but there were lights in the houses and a sound of singing in the blue lion which made him get into the fields behind as soon as possible though by this time it was quite dark so that he had to guide himself as well as he could by the lights in the windows  this led to a great many wanderings and stumbles since he did not know every field with its gates and gaps as well as he knew uphill so that he lost a good deal of time by blundering about looking for a lighter space in the hedge which might or might not lead into the next field  he made his way up to the opening  it proved to be a gap but lately mended and he ran a couple of thorns deep into his hand before he tumbled over into a ditch  this was a grass field and he heard the coughings of an old sheep and the suppressed baaings of the others finding himself presently outside their fold  he guided himself along by the hurdles and came to deep ruts in stiff clay but these led to a gate and that into a narrow and muddy lane  this he knew would bring him back to the high road and that was comparatively plain sailing  still there was poppleby to go through though not for several miles which he tramped along quietly enough not meeting any one but beginning to hear the sounds of the nightloving animals  owls flew about with their hootings and snappings startling him a good deal as much from some notions of bad luck as from wonder at first if it were a human shout  then the lights of poppleby were welcome to his eyes and as they were chiefly in the upper windows he thought the town must be safe to walk through without fear of being met and stopped gaslamps hardly existed then and poppleby was all dark except for the big lamps over the publichouse doors and this was well for johnnie for just as he was about to pass the blue lion the door was thrown open and a whole party came swaggering and staggering out singing at the tops of their voices  johnnie had time to throw himself into a garden behind a hedge and heard them pass by holloaing rather than singing out    down down with they machines   that takes the poor folks bread  there was something too about friends to the people and foes beware but what startled johnny the most was that he knew his fathers voice in the shout and for one moment saw the light of a lantern fall across a face that could belong to no one else but his father  it could hardly be told whether as he lay trembling there the sight made him the more dislike his expedition or the sound of those cries the more anxious to bring protection to his friends at greenhow  anyway he had given his word to his aunt and he must go through with it and he fancied that he could get to minsterham before the keepers of late hours were shut up for the night and might return again to see how things were going and get excused by his cousin  not till the shouts had died away in the distance did he venture out and plodded once more into the darkness under overhanging trees meeting nothing except one carriage whose bright lamps came on like two fiery eyes glowing more and more as they came nearer and the black shadow of horses driver and close carriage rushed by and left him again deciding that it must be the doctors chariot  then came another long long spell so long that he thought it must be near morning and was surprised to hear behind him in the frosty air the church clock at poppleby striking far too many strokes and what he hoped had been one turned into either eleven or twelve  he hoped it was twelve  there were the branching roads and it was far too dark to read the signpost so that he could only take the one that seemed to him the most likely but when he had gone what might be any distance on the road it seemed to get narrower and rougher than he expected and then came an opening as if on to a common such as he was sure did not exist on the way to minsterham  he must have got upon the elchester road and there was nothing for it but to turn back  however there was a pale brightness showing in the sky and the moon came up an old moon without very much light in her but she was a great comfort to him and told him how the night was going  on and on and then there was a sound of trampling of horses and of wheels coming nearer great light eyes growing larger and larger and the mailcoach flashed and thundered by with the four horses and presently faraway he could hear the guards horn announcing the approach to a wayside inn where the horses were changed but by the time johnnie had made his weary way up to the place it was faraway on the road indeed he saw the lamps flash as it went up wearyfoot hill but all the inn was silent again by that time even at the stables and the hotel was a dark mass against the skythe only light in it the moon reflected from the windows  a dog barked as he went past but he kept far upon the other side of the road and was reassured by hearing the rattling of a chain  wearyfoot hill  yes it was wearyfoot to him as he dragged up it  he could not remember whether it was four or five miles from minsterham there was a milestone standing on the bank and he tried to read it but the moon would not reveal more than the large initial letters of l for london and m for minsterham and he sat down at last and leaned against the stone trying to trace out the figure above minsterham with his fingers  behold though four and five were both ringing in his head he must have fallen asleep for he felt quite cold and stiff the moon was much higher in the sky the stars were paler and there was a mist all round he rose up ashamed and shook himself colder and more uncomfortable than before but feeling it was a new day and that were it four miles or five he was now near minsterham  he said his morning prayers as he tramped along stamping to warm his feet and recollected that aunt judith would be lying awake praying for him  he found that when the first discomfort of awakening had passed off he really was the better for his short sleep and marched on more vigorously presently hearing a cock begin to crow and birds to twitter  dawn was beginning presently a lark sprang up and began to send down a wonderful cheerful song that quite raised johnnies spirits then over the quiet misty fields came the deep note of the great minsterham clock pealing out what was only a half hour but john knew that it would be much louder in his ears next time it spoke  a waggon lumbered by and then a labourer or two going to their work but john kept out of their way not wanting to be asked questions there began to be red in the eastern mist the clock sounded again and from the slope of the hill the spires of the churches in the town seemed to be rising out of a great lake of woolly mist  the clock went through all the four quarters then solemnly told out five strokesjohnnies weary night journey was over    chapter twenty  the royal hotel    o haste to aid ere aid be vain   scott  though johnnies journey was over his troubles were not at an end when he came to the first houses the way seemed still to lengthen out before him and everything appeared to be still asleep though the daylight was coming in as brightly as a foggy morning allowed  nor did he know his way he had only driven to a timberyard once with his cousin and dined with him at a little publichouse close by and had no more than a dim recollection of shops which looked quite different now with all their shutters up  only a milkcart coming in with full tins seemed to give a sign that people would want their breakfast some time or other and next appeared a very black sweep with his cart and two miserable little barefooted boys running beside it as black as the silhouette over mrs thorpes chimney  halfpast five struck and charwomen began to come out of side alleys bakers shops to take down their shutters  johnnie ventured to ask one of the apprentice boys doing so the way to the royal george hotel  dye want to bespeak the best apartments was all the answer he got as the lad stopped his whistling and looked superciliously at johnnies battered dusty working dress and old straw hat  he found he should only be laughed at and walked on renewing his question when he saw a goodnaturedlooking woman in a black bonnet and stout canvas apron apparently going out for a days washing  is it the royal or the king george tavern as you mean my son she asked him  oh the royalthe one where the gentlemen goes said johnnie  ive got a message for one of em  bless you my lad they wont never let you in at this time of morning said the woman  its very particular returned john  i came off at night to tell him  she looked at him curiously  and what might it be young man  some one taken very bad no doubt  nonot that said john and she looked so kind he could not help telling  but he have got a machine and jack swing is coming and if he dont come home to see to the poor ladies  bless me and who may it be  captain carbonelout at uphill  never heard tell of the place  its out beyond poppleby  my  and youve comed all that way tonight  the ladies are very good  hes a right good gentleman  all one to the poor as to the rich  i say  you are a good young man to be sure  id go with you and get to the speech of lavinia bull the chambermaid what i know right well but if im not at mrs hurds by six oclock shell be flying at me like a wild cat  mercy on me there it goes six  well if that fine dandy boots as is puffed up like a peacock wont heed you ask for lavinia bull and say mrs callendar sent you and he will call her fast enough  john thanked her and was going off at once but she called out bless the boy hes off without even hearing where to go  just opposite the city cross as they calls it  it was not much like a cross to johnnies mind being a sort of tower all arches and pinnacles and mouldered statues getting smaller up to the spiring top but he knew it and saw the hotel opposite with all its blinds down nothing like astir yet except that some one was about under the great open doorway leading into a yard half entrance to the hotel  he could see a man brushing a shoe and went up with please sir but he was met by get off you young vagabond we want none of your sort here  please sir i have a message for miss bull he hesitated  she aint down  get off i say  we dont have no idle lads here  its very particularfrom mrs callendar  old witch  have she been burning any ones shirt fronts  i say jem you see if lavinia is in the kitchen and tell her old callendar has been burning holes in her stockings or collars and has sent a young scarecrow to tell her  john opened his mouth to say it was no such thing but the under shoeblack who was a sort of slave to boots made an ugly face at him and was gone turning coach wheels across the yard  in another minute lavinia a nice brisk looking young woman had come up with well young man what has mrs callendar been after now  please maam nothing but she said as how i was to ask for you  its for captain carbonel maam a message from uphillthats his home  captain carbonelthats number seven she said consulting a slate that hung near the bar  he was to be called at eight oclock  wont that do  oh no no maam implored john thinking that the captain was taking his rest away from home  its very particular and i have come all night with it  you have got to call number five for the high flier at halfpast six she said turning to boots  could not you take up word at the same time  catch me running errands for a jackanapes like that said boots with a contemptuous shrug turning away and brushing at his shoe  never mind him said goodnatured lavinia  what shall i say young man  oh thank you miss  say that john hewlett have brought him a message from uphill  jack owlet  oh my  hoo hoo exclaimed the blacking boy as soon as lavinia had disappeared up the stairs dancing about with his hands on his hips  look here tomto a boy with a pail who had just come inhere be an owlets just flown in out of the mud  hoo hoo  where did you get that ere patch on your back  where you never got none responded the other boy  mother stitched it for him  ay sitting under a hedge with her pot hung up on three sticks and a hedgepig in it added the younger boots  come own up young gipsy yer come to get a tanner out of number seven with your tales  im no gipsy growled john but  come come called out boots none of your row  and you you impudent tramp dont ye be larking about here making the lads idle get out of the yard with ye or i call the master to you  the landlord might probably have been far more civil but poor johnnie did not know this and could only move off to the entrance of the court so that when lavinia in another moment appeared and asked where he was boots answered  how should i tell  he was up to mischief with the boys and i bade him be off  well number seven is ever so much put about and he said he would be down in a jiffy  so there  lavinia held up her skirts and began in her white stockings to pick her way across the yard while boots sneered and began brushing his shoe and whistling as if quite undisturbed and in another moment captain carbonel did appear coming down the stairs very fast all unshaven and with a few clothes hastily thrown on and quite ran after lavinia passing her as she pointed out beyond the entrance where john was disconsolately leaning against the wall with his hands in his pockets feeling how utterly weary and hungry he was and with uneasy thoughts about his father coming over him  oh there you are john hewlett  what is it  no one ill exclaimed the captain  no sir butcoming nearer and lowering his voicejack swing sir  jack swing  we had notice of him out at delafield  john shook his head and looked down  what  do you know anything my boy  here come intell me  please sir theyve laid it out to come to greenhow this very day as is to break the machine and get the guns and money  the captain started as well he might but still demanded how do you know  john held his head down most unwilling to answer  look here my lad youve done well coming to warn me but i must be certain of your news before acting on it  we were to ride off to delafield today and i must know if this is only a rumour  aunt heard them said john between his teeth  she heard them planning it for tomorrowthats todayand she laid it on me to let you know to save the ladies from being fraught  your aunt heard it  through the window in the back garden  they planned to get all the chaps at downhill and all and go at the machine  the villains  who did  no ill not ask that my lad said the captain knowing only too well who it must have been you have acted nobly and i am for ever obliged to you  come in and have some breakfast while i dress and report this and see what is to be done you are sure there is time  they was to go about at dinnertime to get the folks john squeezed out of his mouth much against his will  then theres time  thank you with all my heart john  ill see you again  hereto a barmaid who had appeared on the scenegive this young man a hearty good breakfast and a cup of alewill youand ill be down again presently  stay till i come hewlett and ill see you again and how you are to get home  why it is twenty miles  were you walking all night  only i went to sleep a bit of the time when i was trying to make out the milestone i dont rightly know how long it was said john so much ashamed of his nap that the captain laughed and said  never mind johnnie you are here in the very nick of time eat your breakfast and ill see you again  the goodnatured barmaid let john have a wash at the pump with a bit of yellow soap and the round towel and he was able to eat his breakfast with a willa corner of cold pie and a glass of strong ale such a breakfast as he had never seen though it was only the leavings of yesterdays luncheon  everybody was too busy just then to pay him any attention and he had time to hear all the noises and bells seem to run into one dull sound and to be nodding in his chair before he was called by a waiter withha youngster there look alive the gentlemen wants you  now that sleep had once begun upon him assisted by the ale john looked some degrees less alive though far more respectable than on his first arrival  he was ushered into the coffeeroom where three or four gentlemen sat at one table all in blue and silver with the captain and as he pulled his forelock and bobbed his head the elder of thema dignified looking man with grey hair and whiskers and a silverlaced uniform saidso my lad you are come to warn captain carbonel of an intended attack on his property  yes sir john mumbled looking more and more of a lout for he had thought the captain would just go home alone to defend his wife and his machine and was dismayed at finding the matter taken up in this way dreading lest he should have brought every one into trouble and be viewed as an informer  what evidence have you of such intentions  john looked into his hat and shuffled on his foot and captain carbonel who knew that sir harry hartman the old gentleman was persuaded that delafield was the place to protect was in an agony lest john should be too awkward and too anxious to shield his family to convince him  he ventured to translate the words into how do you know  his voice somehow made john feel that he must speak and he said aunt heard it  whats that  who is aunt said sir harry in a tone as if deciding that it was gossip but this put john rather more on his mettle and he said my aunt judith grey sir  how did she hear  through the window  she heard them laying it out  she is bedridden put in the captain but a clever sensible woman  whom did she hear or see  she couldnt see nobody sir  it was a strange voice john was trying to save the truth  oh and what did she hear  they was planning to go round the place and call up the menthats today said john  are you sure it was today  did she tell you she heard it  yes sir  and john bethought him there was a great row going on at the fox and hounds and when i came past poppleby a whole lot of them come out singing down with the machines  thats more like it if it was not a mere drunken uproar said sir harry  i suppose you did not know any of the voices said one of the other gentlemen  john could hold his tongue this time  and you came all this way by night twenty miles and odd to warn captain carbonel on your aunts information said sir harry thoughtfully  are you sure that she could hear distinctly  one can hear in her room talk in our garden as well as if it was in the room replied john  well you are a good lad well intentioned said sir harry  heres halfacrown to pay your journey back  we will consider what is to be done  john had rather not have taken the halfcrown but he did not know how to say so so he pulled his forelock and accepted it  captain carbonel came out of the coffeeroom with him and called to the hostler to let him lie down and rest for a couple of hours when the red rover would change horses there and then call him and pay for his journey back to poppleby  so john lay down on clean straw and slept too much tired out to put thoughts together and unaware of the discussion among the gentlemen for sir harry hartman was persuaded that it was delafield that needed protection and was inclined to make little of john hewletts warning thinking that it rested on the authority of a sick nervous woman and that there was no distinct evidence but that of the young man who would not speak out and only went by hearsay  captain carbonel who was of course in an agony to get home and defend his property but was firmly bound by his notions of discipline argued that the lad was the son of the most disaffected man in the parish and that his silence was testimony to the likelihood that his father was consulting with the ringleader  the invalid woman he knew to be sensible and prudent and most unlikely either to mistake what she heard or to send her nephew on such a night journey without urgent cause and he asked permission to go himself if the troop were wanted elsewhere to defend his home  finally just as the debate was warming between the officers a farmer came in from delafield and assured them that all was quiet there  so the horses were brought out and there was much jingling of equipments and johnnie awoke with a start of dismay he had never thought of such doings  he had only thought of captain carbonels riding home never of bringing down what seemed to him a whole army on his father    chapter twenty one  jack swing    richard of england thou hast slain jack straw   but thou hast left unquenched the vital spark   that set jack straw on fire   sir h  taylor  nobody knew who jack swing was  most likely he really was more than one person or rather an impersonal being worked up as a sort of shadowy puppet to act in the cause of future reform  there were hot spirits abroad who knew that much was amiss on many points and who burned to set them right and there were others who were simply envious and jealous of all that had power or authority and wanted to put these down for their own profit  they thought that the way to get their cause attended to was to make the other party afraid of the people and they did not know or understand that those who delayed to grant their wishes only desired patience and to do the work in the best and wisest way  all that they demanded and more too has since been given to the people but gradually as was expedient and without tumult or disturbance  so there was a desire to frighten the gentry by showing the strength of the people in anticipation of the reform bill to be proposed the next year  it would not have made much difference to the country people for no one would have a vote whose rent did not amount to ten pounds a year and they would not have cared much about it if they had not been told that if it was passed every man would have a fat pig in his sty and be able to drink his daily quart of beer moreover that the noblemen and gentlemen were resolved on keeping them out of their rights making bread dear and depriving them of their wages by setting up machines to do all the work  this last came near home and stirred up the minds that would have cared for little else  just as four hundred years before jack straw was an imaginary champion whose name inflamed the people to rise so now jack swing or whoever it was who acted in that name sent messages round that such and such a place should be attacked at such and such a time  there was always some one in the town who could be fired with the idea that inciting riot and revolt was patriotism and that a good cause could be served by evil methods who cast aside such warnings as rebellion is like the sin of witchcraft or the powers that be are ordained of god  besides the infection spread and to hear what jack swing was doing elsewhere encouraged others not to be behindhand with their neighbours  so the mandate had gone out and there were a few at elchester ready to arrange for a rising at uphill and downhill  dan hewlett was known to them in the publichouse and he had an especial spite at captain carbonel beginning from his knowledge of the tacit detection of his abstraction of the paper at greenhow going through his dismissal from working there aggravated by the endeavour to remove judith embittered by the convictions as a poacher and perhaps brought to a height by the influence over his eldest son  he hated the captain enough to be willing to direct the attack upon greenhow especially as it was known that the master was absent and engaged in summoning the yeomanry to ride down the poor chaps as it was said who only wanted bread for their childrens mouths  there were men both at uphill and downhill and even at poppleby who were quite willing to listen  the poppleby folk some of them believed that riot was the only way to get reform more of the villagers thought it was the only way of getting rid of the machines the object of mysterious dread for the future and more still chiefly neerdowells and great idle lads were ready for any mischief that might be going and full of curiosity and delight at what jack swing might be about to do  these youths some of them at work and some not dispersed the news through the village and fields that there was to be a great rising of the peoples friends and that gobblealls machine was to be somewhere  all were to meet at the randygosupposed to mean rendezvousat the crossroad and as for those who did not it would be the worse for them and worse than all for them that told clacking women who might carry the tale up to greenhow  the summons was indeed not given till the men were well out of reach of their clacking women but at work in the fields and then a party begannot to marchthey could not have done that to save their lives but to tramp out of poppleby shouting to any one whom they saw in the fields to come with them and stand up for the peoples rights  at downhill their numbers increased by all the noisy fellows and some who fancied great good was to be gained somehow though some wiser wives called out to them not to get into a row nor let themselves be drawn into what they would be sorry for  at the fox and hounds they tarried and demanded a glass of beer all round which mr oldfellow was really afraid to refuse  he was a timid man half on their side half on that of the gentry and he saw there were enough of them to sack his cellars if he demurred  there too amid much laughter they all disguised themselves some blackening their faces with soot others whitening them with chalk and some putting on the womens cloaks bonnets or aprons  then they collected uphill men  we are come for your good said jack swing or the man who passed for him wearing a long punchlike nose  we are come to help you and wheres the mean coward that wont come along with us in his own cause there will be no living for poor folks if those newfangled machines be allowed to go on and them parliament folk vote out all that makes for the people  down with them i say  up with reform and down with all the fools and cowards who wont stand up for themselves  all this garnished with foul words and abuse and roared out from the top of the horseblock was addressed to the crowd that began to gather  dan hewlett with a horrid white face was going about persuading the men and so were others  bless you we dont want to do no harm to the ladies nor the children  we only wants to do away with them toady machines as they wants to do all the work instead of mens hands as the almighty meant and is in scripture  this was the plea to the better disposed like tom seddon who held out youll not hurt madam nor the little ones  sheve been a kind lady and the captain hes a good master i will say that and i dont want to hurt em  nobody wants to hurt them only to do away with they machines  i tell you what was george trumans answer them machines are the captains none of yours nor mine and i wont go for to damage em no  i wont have my face blacked nor whited im an honest man and not ashamed to show it  so i be going to my work  and off he went to his days work at farmer goodenoughs and the others hissed him and hooted him but did him no harm  nobody made such a noise as softy sam and together this frightened jem gibbs out of following him though he much wished to do so  will mole as soon as he heard any sounds ran away headlong down towards the meadows and hid himself in the long rushes  cox the constable thought discretion the better part of valour and long before the rabble rout appeared set off to carry a pair of shoes home to mrs pearson at the lone farm  master hewlett the carpenter looked in vain for john his apprentice and growled and grumbled that he did not appear then on perceiving the uproar decided that he was gone after that there father of hisn  he wouldnt have thought it of jack  no he wouldnt but sure enough it was bred in the bone of him  master hewlett went on with his planing and when the troop now amounting to about thirty grown men besides a huge rabble of boys and girls came along and dan shouted to him to come and stand up for the rights of the people and down with that there tyrum gobbleall and his machine to grind down the poor he answered  machine aint nothing to me  i minds my own business and thou beest a fool dan not to mind thine  and wheres that lad of thine  a trapesing after mischief just like all idle fellows  he baint a labourer and has no feeling for them as is said dan we wants your axe though george  not he  i dares you to touch him said george hewlett in his unmoved way smoothing off a long curled shaving which fell on the ground there thats the worth of you all and your jack swing  swing ye will dan if you dont take the better care  some one made a move as if to seize the axe but george made one step and lifted quietly the stout bit of timber he had been planing and it was plain that a whole armoury of carpenters tools was on his side the bench  come along said dan hes a coward and meanspirited cur  us shant do nothing with he  so on they went all the kindnesses and benefits from greenhow forgotten and nothing remembered at the moment but grievances mostly past but more looked forward to as possible  the women did remember  judith grey was in an agony praying as she lay for mrs carbonel and the children  widow mole knew nothing but was weeding the paths at greenhow betsy seddon and molly barnes were crying piteously at thought of madam and her little girl as might be fraught to death by them there rascals  but no one knew what to do  some stayed at home in fear for their husbands but a good many followed in the wake of the men to see what would happen and to come in for a little excitementwhether it were fright pity or indignation  pon my word and honour said lizzy morris that there will be summat to talk on    chapter twenty two  great mary and little mary    wholl plough their fields  wholl do their drudgery for them  and   work like horses to give them the harvestsouthey  mrs carbonel having seen her two little ones laid down for their midday nap was sitting down to write a note to her husband while sophia was gone to give her lesson at the school when there came a tap to the drawingroom window and looking up she saw tirzah todds brown face and her finger making signs to her  she felt displeased and rose up saying why tirzah if you want me you had better come to the back door  lady you must come out this way  tis jack swing acoming maam yes he iswith a whole lot of mischievous folks to break the machine and burn the ricks and what not  hush dont ye hear em a hollering atop of the hill  they be gathering at the fox and hounds and i just couldnt abear that you and the dear little children should be scared like and the captain away  so as mrs carbonels lips moved in thanks and alarm if you would come with me lady and take the children and come out this way through the garden where you wouldnt meet none of em ill take you down the short way to farmer pearsons or wherever you liked where you wouldnt hear nothing till tis over  oh tirzah  you are very good  a fright would be a most fearful shock and might be quite fatal to my little mary  but oh my sister and the servants and the pucklechurches i cant leave them  my hoggie was at home with the baby and i sent her off to see miss sophy at the school and tell her to come up to pearsons  but the pucklechurches  nobody will hurt them  nobody means to hurt you said tirzah i knows that  my man wouldnt ha gone with them but so as they promised faithful not to lay a finger on you so you give em the money and the guns but men dont think of the dear little gal as is so nesh so i thought id warn you to have her out of the way  bless my heart theyll be coming  that was nigher  mrs carbonels mind went through many thoughts in those few moments she could not bear to desert her husbands property and people in this stress and yet she knew that to expose her tender little girl to the terrors of a violent mob would be fatal  and she decided on accepting tirzahs offer of safety and shelter  she ran upstairs put on her bonnet took her husbands most essential papers out of his desk and pocketed them together with some sovereigns and banknotes then quietly went into the nursery where she desired rachel mole to put on her bonnet take up the baby and follow her and herself was putting on little marys small straw hat and cape telling her that she was coming with mamma for a walk to see mrs pearsons old turkey cock when mrs pucklechurch burst in with two or three maids behind her  oh maam jack swings coming and all the rabble rout  what ever shall we do was the gasping screaming cry  only be quiet  theres nothing for any one to fear  if they do harm it is to things not people  i only go away for the sake of this child no mary dear nobody will hurt you  you are going for a nice early walk with mamma and baby and rachel  youto the maidsmay follow if you will feel safer so but i do not believe there is any real danger to you  betty pucklechurch please tell your husband that i do beg him not to resist  it would be of no use his master would not wish it only if he will take care that the poor cattle and horses come to no harm  he have gone to drive em off already to longacre said betty  i telld he hed better stand by masters goods but he be a man for his cows he be  quite right of him said mrs carbonel  have you babys bottle rachel  now mary dear heres your piece of seed cake  the shouts and singing sounded alarmingly as if approaching by this time and little mary listened and said funny mens singing  it was very loud as the fugitives gained the verandah where tirzah waited with an angry light in her black eyes  oh wont i give it to joe todd she cried for turning against the best friend hoglah ever hador me either  mary carrying her little mary and trying to keep a smile that might reassure her followed tirzah across the orchard on the opposite side of the house  they had to scramble through a gap in the hedge tirzah went over first breaking it down further then the baby was put into her arms and rachel came next receiving mary from her mother who was telling her how funny it was to get over poor papas fence all among the apple trees and here was don jumping after them  don the clumber spaniel wanted a bit of marys cake and this and her mothers jump down from the hedge and over the ditch happily distracted her attention and made her laugh while the three maids were screaming that here were the rascals hundreds of them acoming up the drive they saw them over the apple trees when on the top of the hedge and heard their horrid shouts  oh the nasty villains with black faces and all  mrs carbonel dreaded these cries almost as much as the mob itself for her delicate child and went on talking to her and saying all the nursery rhymes that would come into her head walking as fast as she could without making her pace felt though the little maidalbeit small and thin for five years oldwas a heavy weight to carry for some distance over a rough stubble field for unaccustomed arms  tirzah had the baby who happily was too young to be even disturbed in his noontide sleep and rachel mole had tarried with the other maids unable to resist her curiosity to see what was doing at the farm since they were out of reach  the fugitives reached a stile which gave entrance to a rough pathway through a copse and it was only here when her mother sat down on the trunk of a tree taking breath with a sense of safety that little mary began to cry and sob  oh we are lost in the wood  please please mamma get out of it  let us go home  no indeed mary we arent lost  see heres the path  we are going to see mrs pearsons pussy cat and her turkey  i dont want to  oh the wolves will come and eat us up and she clung round her mother in real terror  wolves  no indeed  there are no wolves in england darling here or anywhere  rachel said the wolves would come if i went in here  then rachel was very silly  no there are no wolves  no mary only see the little rabbit  come along take hold of my hand we will soon get out  never mind god is taking care of us  come we will say our hymn as we go on  the mother said her verse and mary tried to follow in a voice quivering with sobs  those imaginary wolves were a far greater alarm and trouble to her than the real riot at her fathers farm  she clung round her mothers gown and there was no pacifying her but by taking her up in arms  let me take her maam said tirzah todd making over the sleeping edmund to his mother  come little lady ill carry you so nice  no no  go away ugly woman cried mary ungratefully flapping at her with her hands in terror at the brown face and big black eyes  oh naughty naughty mary sighed the mother when tirzah is so good and wants to help you  dont be a naughty child  but the word naughty provoked such a fit of crying that there was nothing for it but for mrs carbonel to pick the child up and struggle on as best she could soothing her terror at the narrow paths and the unknown way and the mysterious alarm of the woodlands as well perhaps as the undefined sense of other peoples dread and agitation however the crying was quiet now and the sounds of tumult at the farm were stifled by the trees so that after a timewhich seemed terribly longthe party emerged into an open meadow whence they could see the gate leading to the high road and beyond that the roof of mrs pearsons house  but something else was to be seen far up the road  there was the flash of the sun from helmets  the yeomanry were coming  theres papa cried mrs carbonel  papa in his pretty silver dress run on run on mary and see him  mary was let down still drawing long sobs as she half ran half toddled on allowing herself to be pulled by tirzah todds free hand while her mother sped on to the gate just in time for the astonished greeting of one of the little troop  mrs carbonel  what  and the next moment her husband was off his horse and by her side with anxious inquiries  yes yes dear edmund  we are all safe  good tirzah came to warn us make haste  they are at the farm  we shall be at mrs pearsons she pointing to tirzah sent to fetch sophy from school  shell be there  here are the children all safe  papa papa cried little mary feeling his silverlaced collar and stroking his face as he kissed her  and from that time she was comforted though he had to leave her again at once  she had felt a fathers arm  tirzah todd exclaimed captain carbonel i shall never forget what you have done for us  never  tirzah curtsied but said youll be good to my man sir  it was but a moments halt ere captain carbonel rode on to overtake the rest of the troop who on hearing that the outrage was really taking place were riding on rapidly  mrs carbonel had not far to go before reaching the hospitable farm where mrs pearson came out to receive her with many a dear dear and dear heart and entreaty that she and the dear children would make themselves at home  but sophy was not there and had not been heard of and mrs carbonel in her anxiety could not rest on the sofa in the parlour after she had persuaded little mary into eating her longdelayed dinner of some mutton hastily minced for her and had seen her safely asleep and cuddling a kitten  mrs pearson was only too happy to have the baby to occupy her longdisused wicker cradle and tirzah had rushed off to the scene of action as soon as she had seen the lady safely housed    chapter twenty three  the machine    in bursts of outrage spread your judgment wide   and to your wrath cry out be thou our guide   wordsworth  sophy was endeavouring to make the children remember who joseph was and thinking them unusually stupid idle and talkative when without ceremony the door was banged open and in tramped hoglah todd with the baby in her arms her sunbonnet on her neck and her black hair sticking wildly out  please maam she began jack swing is up abreaking the machine and mother says you are to go to farmer pearsons to be safe out of the way  hoggie todd began mrs thorpe thats not the way to come into school but she could not finish for voices broke out above the regulation school hush yes yes father said and our jem said and it ended in jack swings acoming to break up the machine  only one or two said mother said as how it was a shame and theyd get into trouble  your mother sent you said sophy to hoglah  yes maam  shes gone up herself to tell madam and take she to pearsons and her said youd better go there back ways or else stay here with governess till twas quieted down  hark  they are holloaing  strange sounds were in fact to be heard and the children losing all sense of discipline made a rush to snatch hats and bonnets and poured out in a throng tumbling over one another hoglah among the foremost mrs thorpe much terrified began to clasp her hands and say oh dear oh dear the wicked ungrateful men that they should do such things oh  miss sophy you will stay here wont you  no i must go and see after my sister and the children said sophy already at the door  but theyll be at mr pearsons  the girl said so  oh stay maam dont venture  pray pray  but sophy had the door open and with i cant  thank you no i cant  there were the confused sounds of howling and singing on the top of the hill  betsy seddon at her cottage door called out dont go up there miss its no place for the likes of you but sophy only answered my sister and dashed on  she could get into a field of edmunds by scrambling over a difficult gate and impelled by the sight of some roughlooking men slouching along she got over itshe hardly knew howand after crossing it came upon all the cows pigs and horses with pucklechurch presiding over them  he too said doant ye go up there miss sophy  them mischievous chaps will be after them pigs fools as they be so i brought the poor dumb things out of the way of them and youd better be shut of it too miss  but my sister master pucklechurch  i must see to her  shell be safe enow miss  they dont lift a hand to folks as ive heard but ill do my duty by the beastises  he certainly seemed more bent on his duty to the beastises than that to his wife or his masters wife and yet when sophy proved deaf to all his persuasions he muttered wilful must to water and wilful must drink  but ah yon beastises be safe enow poor dumb things so ill een go after the maid to see as her runs into no harm  she be a fine spirity maid whatsomeer  so on he plodded in the rear of sophy who with eager foot had crossed the sloping homefield and gained the straw yard all deserted now except by the fowls  the red game cock was scratching and crowing there as if the rabble rout were not plainly to be seen straggling along the drive  still there was time for sophy to fly to the house where at the door she met mrs pucklechurch  bless my soul and honour miss sophy  you here  the mistress shes gone with the children to mr pearsons and youll be in time to catch her up if you look sharp enough  i shall not run away  some one ought to try to protect my brothers property  now dont ee dont ee miss sophy  youll do no good with that lot and only get hurt yourself  but sophy was not to be persuaded  she went manfully out to the gate and shut it in the face of the disguised men who came swaggering up towards it  whats your business here she demanded in her young clear voice  come young woman said a man in a false nose and a green smockfrock but whose voice had a town sound in it and whose legs and feet were those of no rustic clear out of the way or it will be the worse for you  what have you to do here on my brothers ground again asked sophy standing there in her straw bonnet and pink cotton frock  we dont want to do nothing missand that voice she knew for dan hewlettsbut to have down that newfangled machine as takes away the work from the poor  what work of yours did it ever take away dan hewlett said she look here it makes bread cheaper  she had thought before of the chain of arguments but they would not come in the face of the emergency and besides she felt that her voice would not carry her words beyond the three or four men who were close to the gate  she might as well have spoken to the raging sea when as the gate was shaken she went on with a fresh start i call it most cowardly and ungrateful  at that moment she was seized from behind by two great brawny arms and borne backward struggling helplessly like a lamb in a bears embrace she saw that not only was the gate burst in but that the throng were pressing in from the garden side and she was not released until she was set down in mrs pucklechurchs kitchen and a gruff voice said rather as if to a little child bide where you be and no one will go for to hurt you  it was a huge figure with a womans bonnet stuck upright over his chalked face and a red cloak covering his smockfrock and he was gone the next moment while mrs pucklechurch screaming and sobbing clutched at sophy and held her tight with now dont miss sophy dont ye  bide still i say  but edmunds machine  his things and all gasped sophy still struggling  bless you miss you cant do nothing with the likes of them the born rascals you would may be get a stone yourself and what would the master say to that  oh what are they doing now as a wild hurrah arose and all sorts of confused noises  mrs pucklechurch had locked the door on her prisoner but she was equally curious and anxious for her old man so with one accord they hurried up the stairs together and looked out at an upper window whence they could only see a wild crowd of hats smockfrocks and womens clothes gathering about a heap where the poor machine used to stand and whence a cloud of smoke began to rise followed by a jet of flame fed no doubt by the quantity of straw and chaff lying about sophy and betty both shrieked and exclaimed but bettys mind was chiefly full of her old man and she saw his straw hat at last  he was standing in front of the verandah before the front door and as they threw the window open they heard his gruff voice  not i  be off with you  i baint agoing to give my masters property to a lot of rapscallion thieves and robbers like you as should know better  then came the answer we dont want none of his property  only his guns and his money for the cause of the people  and big sticks were brandished and the throng thickened  oh dont ye hurt he screamed betty  he that never did you no harm dont ye  oh dan hewlett  ohoh  then throw us out the guns old woman called up the blackfaced figure and well let him be  if you do shouted pucklechurchand then there was a rush in on him and they could see no more for he must have backed under the verandah betty made a dash for the front stairs to come to his help sophy after her but before they could even tumble to the bottom there was a change in the cries  the soldiers the soldiers  ohhoohoohoo  there was a scamper and a scurry a trampling of horses  the two trembling hands getting in each others way unfastened the door which was not even locked and beheld pucklechurch gathering himself up with a bleeding head a cloud of smoke and flame and helmets and silver lace glancing through it there had been no need to read the riot act the enemy were tearing along all ways over the fields except a few whom the horsemen had intercepted  dan hewlett and the blackfaced leader without his long nose were two the other three wereamong the loudest poor softy sam who had been yelling wildlybig lads or young men one from downhill the others nearer home howling and sobbing and praying to be let go captain carbonels first thought was whether pucklechurch was hurt but the old man was standing up scratching his head and betty hovering over him  then his eyes fell on his sisterinlaw and he exclaimed  you here sophy  your sister is very anxious  but the fire was by this time getting ahead and no one could attend to anything else  the prisoners were put into the servants hall and locked in the horses were tied up at a safe distance the poor things rearing with alarm at the flame the men were under sir harry hartman and captain carbonels orders made to form a line from the pond and hand on the pails and buckets that were available but these were not very many though the numbers of helpers were increased by the maids who had crept back from the orchard and by the shepherd and some even of the mob conscious that they had been only lookers on and hadnt done no harm  it was a dry season and the flames spread catching the big barn and then seeming to fly in great flakes like a devouring winged thing to the pucklechurches thatch  betty and her husband flew to fling out their more valued possessions and were just in time to save them but thence the fire just as the water in the nearest pond was drying up caught a hold on the dairy and the old thatched part of the farmhouse bellowings were heard from the captives that they would be burnt alive and some one it was never known who let them out for no sign of them appeared when all was over though their prison was untouched by the fire  for even at that moment the poppleby fireengine galloped up the road and was hailed with shouts of joy  it had a hose long enough to reach down to the brook in the meadow and the hissing bursts of water poured down did at last check the flames before they had done much harm to the more modern portion of the house though all the furniture was lying tumbled about in heaps on the lawnmarys piano with the babys cradle full of crockery on the top of it and edmunds writing desk in the middle of a washing stand all upside down  the first thing edmund did when the smoke wreaths alone were lingering about was to send his groom down to the cellar with a jug in his hand to bring up some beer which he proceeded to hand in the best breakfastcups to all and sundry of the helpers including sir harry hartman sophy helping in the distribution with all her might  miss carbonel i think said sir harry courteously as she gave him the cup  were you the garrison  sophy laughed  yes sir except old pucklechurch and his wife  then i may congratulate you on being the bravest woman in uphill said the old gentleman raising his hat  it was getting dark and they had to consider what was next to be done captain carbonel was anxious about his wife and children and sir harry was urging him to bring them to his house while mr grantley from poppleby who had come up on the alarm urged the same upon him  it ended in a guard being told off consisting of cox the constable of uphill who had emerged from no one knew where the downhill constable and the shepherd with one of the yeomen who were to be entertained by pucklechurch and the cook and prevent any mischief being done to the scattered furniture before morning  the pucklechurches and mrs mole with barton were doing their best to bring in and attend to the live stock all of which had been saved by pucklechurchs care  then they rode off together sophy and the housemaid having already started across the fields bearing whatever necessary baggage they could collect or carry for mrs carbonel and the little ones  mrs carbonel was at the door when her husband rode up having only just managed to hush off her little mary to sleep and left her and the baby with rachel mole to watch over them  poor thing she had been in a terrible state of anxiety and terror for all these hours so much the worse because of the need of keeping her little girl from being agitated by seeing her alarm or hearing the cries exclamations and fragments of news that mrs pearson and her daughters were rushing about with  when she saw him first and sophy a moment afterwards she sprang up to him as he dismounted and greeted him with a burst of sobs and thankful tears  why mary mary whats this  one would think i had been in a general engagement  you a soldiers wife  no nobodys a hair the worse here is sir harry hartman wondering at you  to hear of the presence of a stranger startled mrs carbonel into recovering herself with i beg your pardon and her pretty courtesy with the tears still on her face while the old gentleman kindly spoke of the grievous afternoon she had had and all the time mr and mrs pearson were entreating him to do them the honour to come in and drink a glass of winefor cake and wine were then considered to be the thing to offer guests in a farmhouse  sir harry aware of what farmhouse port was apt to be begged for a glass of homebrewed ale instead but came in readily hoping to persuade mrs carbonel to send for the poppleby postchaise and let him take her and her children home  she was afraid however to disturb little mary and mrs pearson reckoned on housing them for the night besides which his park was too faroff  so it was settled that sophy for whom there really was no room should go to poppleby parsonage with mr grantley for the night and she and sir harry only tarried to talk over the matter and come to an understanding of the whole as far as might be  who warned you asked the captain  the last person i should expecttirzah todd good woman said mrs carbonel  she came and called me and helped me over the hedges  and hoglah came after me said sophy and told me to come here only i could not  you were the heroine of the whole miss carbonel said sir harry  oh dont say so i didnt do any good at all said sophy becoming much ashamed of her attempt at haranguing  old pucklechurch was the one for he saved all the dear cows and horses and was nearly letting himself be killed in the defence  but oh all the rest of them  to think of them treating us so after everything  most likely they were compelled said gentle mrs carbonel  they will hear of it again said sir harry  could you identify them miss carbonel  a good many said sophy though they had their faces chalkedthat horrid dan hewlett for one  there can be no doubt of him for he was one of the prisoners that got away said captain carbonel in a repressive manner  he has always been a mischievous fellow but the remarkable thing is that it was his son who came to summon us this morningjohn hewlett a very good steady lad  bytheby has any one seen him  i sent him home by the elchester coach  i wonder what has become of him    chapter twenty four  misjudged    that weary deserts we may tread   a dreary labyrinth may thread   through dark ways underground be led   archbishop trench  poor johnnie was not very happy at that moment  he had descended from the coach at poppleby and set out to walk to downhill wondering how he should be received at his cousins workshop  everything seemed strangely quiet as he crossed the fields where he had wandered last night but there were now and then faroff echoes of voices and shouts he avoided the village of downhill and made his way towards the little street and common of uphill but not a creature could he see except todds donkey and a few geese  the workshop was shut up no one was about either there or at the house he considered a moment whether to try to see what was doing at greenhow or to go and tell his aunt how he had fared and that he knew the captain must be at home by this time  he was glad he had decided on the latter for the cottage door stood open and judith was sitting up in bed her eyes wide open and her breath panting with anxiety and terror  oh johnnie my dear  there you are  oh they are all gone  the ladies the dear ladies and the little babies she gasped and fell back almost fainting  the captain is there by this time and the soldiers never you fear said john  here youd better take this trying to drop out some of the cordial he knew she took in her attacks  the soldiers  your fatheryour poor father she gasped again and she was so ill that john dreadfully frightened could only hold her up on one arm and press the cordial to her lips with the other hand  it was an overdose but that hardly mattered and before very long just as she was beginning to quiet down there approached a fresh sound of screaming and his mother burst into the house  oh my poor man  my poor dan she cried  they have got him  the soldiers have got him and as john was laying down his aunt to come and hear she rushed up the stairs with and it is all your doing you unnatural goodfornothing varmint  that was what you were after all night you and your aunt the adder that i have warmed at my bosom  turning against your own poor father to set them bloodyminded soldiers on him and now hell be taken and hanged and i shall be a poor miserable widow woman all along of you  this was poured forth as fast as the words would come out of mollys mouth but before they had all streamed forth judith was choking in a hysterical fit so like a convulsion that johnnie could only cry aunt aunt  mother look  and molly herself was frightened and began to say there there while she helped him to hold her sister and little judy flew off half in terror and half in search of help crying out that aunt was in a fit  help of a certain sort camea good deal more of it than was wantedand the room was crowded up and there were a good many poor dears there nows and proposals of burnt feathers and vinegar but mrs spurrell who was reckoned the most skilled in illness came at last put the others out especially as they wanted to see about their husbands teas and brought a sort of quiet in which judith lay exhausted but shuddering now and then and molly sobbed by the fire john gathered from the exclamations that the carbonel family were safe somewhere that miss sophy had gone on like the woman preacher at downhill that greenhow had been on fire but nobody was hurt though the soldiers had ridden in upon them so as was a shame to see and had got poor dan and ned fell and all sure locked up  john was shocked at this for he had not meant to do more than send captain carbonel home to protect his family and had not realised all the consequences  in a few minutes more however his father himself tramped in and the first thing he did was to fall on the lad in a fury grasping him by the collar with horrible abuse of him for an unnatural informer turning against his own father and dealing a storm of heavy blows on him with a great stick  down clattered mrs spurrell asking if he wished to kill his sisterinlaw  a good thing tooa traitor in ones house he burst out with more raging words and fresh blows on poor john who never cried out through all but his mother rushed down the next moment crying out that she would not have her son mauled and beaten and laying fast hold of the stick  it was turning into a fight between husband and wife and mrs spurrell who had more of her senses about her than any one else called out off with you john hewlett  ill tackle em  poor johnnie had no choice but to obey her  bruised worn out hungry uncertain of everything and miserable about his aunt he could only wander slowly away feeling himself a traitor  he found his way to the workshop and had just thrown himself down in the woodshed when he heard his masters voice calling out  whos there  me  johnny  fathers in a mortal rage with me for telling the captain but i never thought as how all the soldiers would come  and a very good thing they did to put a stop to such doings as never was said mrs hewletts voice  bless me the dear children and the ladies might have been burnt in their beds  come in johnnie and have a bit of supper said george hewlett  and tell us all about it said his wife  well give you a shakedown for the night if you cant go home  john was thankful and mrs hewlett set before him a good meal of bread cheese cold bacon and beer but he was too dull and dejected as well as much too tired to be able to talk and scarcely could remember all that had happened  he knew it was not manners to put his head down on his arms on the table but he really could not hold it up and he had dozed off almost with the food in his mouth  poor chap  hes fair worn out said the elder george  make his bed ready mother  and when it was ready the younger george absolutely kicked him into being awake enough to tumble into it  even then his sleep was for a good while tossing dreamy and restless but byandby it grew sounder and he lay so still in the morning that his kind hostess hindered her boys from disturbing him  he had not long been awake and had only said his prayers and washed at the pump when horses feet were heard and cousin george called to him to come out and speak to the captain  he came with hair wringing wet and shy awkward looks  my lad said the captain i cannot tell you how much i thank you for your bravery and spirit the night before last  you did me and mine a benefit that i shall always remember though i feel it would just be insulting you to offer you any present reward  nor indeed could it be sufficient for what you have done  thank you sir mumbled john hardly knowing what he or the captain said  and added captain carbonel your father got away  if he is taken what you have done for us may be remembered in his favour  again john managed to say thank you sir  and the captain rode off to offer the like thanks to tirzah todd but her cottage was shut up the donkey gone and she with her husband and hoglah out on a broomselling expedition  he was not clear of the riot and she did not want him to hear her thanked  they must have gone away with their gipsy kin for they never came back while the carbonels were in england and only a sovereign could be left for them with mr harford who promised to stand tirzahs friend if any opening for assisting her offered  dan had been told that rioters generally got off without difficulty  it was not easy to trace them and their safety was in numbers and their semidisguise and jack swing or the man with the nose had escaped on various similar occasions wearing a different disguise at each place it had not come into their calculations that they had gone so far as to rouse the spirit of the landowners who had at first dealt gently with the disturbances but who now felt that strong measures must be taken to prevent the mischief from going further  he thought himself safe when he had once got away from the strongroom at greenhow and he was slouching about his garden when cox the constable backed by two stout men came with a warrant from sir harry hartman for the apprehension of daniel hewlett for peacebreaking and arson  he began to argue that it was not he more than any one else and he hadnt set fire to nothing but he was told that he must reserve his defence for his trial and the handcuffs were put on and he was carried off in a cart just as john was hurrying up the lane having got leave from his master to see how his aunt was before beginning work  molly had seen her husband taken to prison before and she did not realise that this was a much more serious affair than were his poaching misdemeanours so that she was not so much overpowered as might have been expected and as he was taken by the wellknown constable instead of the soldiers she did not treat it as johns fault  besides she was really afraid of as she said upsetting judith by another outcry so she only moaned in a low miserable voice about what was to become of her and her poor children though after all what with the parish judiths help and johns earnings she would be no worse off than was common with her  jem was supposed to keep himself and only judy was really on her hands  she would hardly let her son go up and see judith  now youll be terrifying of her and shell be upset again and holler and go into a fit  however he took off his boots and went up softly  judith was all alone lying still but he had never seen her look half so ill though she opened her eyes and smiled when the creaking stair announced him and when he bent over her she said dear lad you baint hurt  oh no not at all  and the dear ladies are safe  yes tirzah todd came and took them away  thank god  but you are bad auntie  oh never mind  alls right  youve done your duty and i can only thank god for my good lad  her voice grew faint her eyes closed and john was obliged to go away but the look of peace stayed with him    chapter twenty five  judith    and of our scholars let us learn   our own forgotten lore   keble  little mary carbonel was not the worse for all the agitations from which indeed she had been so carefully shielded but her mother was sadly broken down by all she had undergone and likewise by mortification at the whole conduct of the uphill people  after all the years that she and her husband and sisters had striven for them it was very hard to find that so very few would exert themselves for their protection and that so many would even turn against them  it was hard to make allowance for the bewilderment of slow minds for sheer cowardice and for the instinct of going along with ones own class of people  she and sophy prayed that they might forgive the people but it was impossible just then not to feel that there was a good deal to forgive and captain caiger was always telling them that all their trouble came in trying to help the goodfornothing people  they had moved into the george hotel at elchester  it was a good large inn such as used to exist in coaching days where travellers stopped for meals and sometimes spent a night and the rooms were so comfortable that they were glad to stay there while captain carbonel could go backwards and forwards to make arrangements about the repair of greenhow  of course when he came to look the place over with a builder from elchester it turned out that a great deal more was needed than simply rebuilding what had been burnt and he was in difficulties about the cost when an offer came which he was glad to accept  the seven ionian islands had been put under the protection of england since they had been set free from the turkish dominion and the governor sir thomas maitland king tom as he was often called was very active in building making roads and improving them in every way possible  he wanted an english officer to superintend his doings in the little isle of santa maura and being acquainted with major sandford doras husband the proposal was made that captain carbonel should undertake the work for two or three years bringing out of course his family with a handsome salary  it was a most opportune offer giving him the means of renewing greenhow of a visit to the sister and of restoring his wifes health which had been much tried by her childs death little marys delicate state and the alarm of the riots  so it was gladly accepted and the departure was to take place as soon as the trials were over for a special commission had been appointed to try the rioters and poor sophy was much distressed at having so evidently recognised dan hewlett when she found that rioting and arson that is burning made a capital offence so that it was a matter of life and death  but there was another to whom this same discovery made a great differencenamely dan hewlett himself  when he found that his life was at stake he declared himself willing to turn kings evidence if his pardon were secured to him and this was really important as he was able to identify jack swing who really was the chief mischiefmaker being a young clerk whose head had been turned by foolish notions about liberty for the people and who really acted more generously and with less personal spite than most of his unhappy followers  however dan was content to purchase his own life by denouncing the leader whom he had followed and he was promised safety after the trial should be over until which time he must remain in prison at minsterham  captain carbonel had consulted george hewlett when arranging the ruins at greenhow as to what had best be done for john whose services he could not forget  george considered for a night and the next day said  well sir i beg your pardon but the best thing as could be done with that there john would be to put him somewhere to learn the cabinetmaking  he is a right sharp clever hand and knows pretty well all i can teach him and he would get on famous if he had the chance and it baint so comfortable for him here  some of em owes him a grudge for bringing the soldiers down on em and calls him an informer and it will be all the worserer for him when his father comes homethe scamp that he is  im ready to wish my name wasnt the same  wuss shame by far than to be strung up to turn agin him as he was hand and glove with  i am quite of your opinion hewlett and i fully think john would be best out of the way poor fellow  i will inquire for a good master for him  thank you sir  i would have had the boy up to sleep at my place but he wont leave his poor aunt  he be the chief comfort she has poor thing  but she wont be here long anyway and if ever there was a good woman tis judith grey  it was quite true  mr harford who had come home on saturday walked over to poppleby partly for the sake of saying that judith was certainly near the close of her trials and that it was her great wish to see one of the dear ladies again though she durst not ask one of them to come into dans house  indeed mr harford had only drawn the expression of her desire out of her with difficulty  mrs carbonel was not well enough for a trying interview so it was sophy who drove from elchester with her brotherinlaw grave and thoughtful and only wishing to avoid everybody for she could not yet forget how no one had shown any gratitude nor desire to shield those who had been so long their friends  the poppleby doctor had been sent to see judith and had pronounced that the old disease had made fatal progress accelerated by the hysterical convulsions caused by the night and day of suspense and anxiety and the attack on her nephew as well as the whole of dans conduct  he did not think that she could last many more days  so sophy arrived at the wellknown cottage and was met at the door by molly with her apron to her eyes and a great deal to say about her poor sister and it wasnt her wish but mr harford who was on the watch began to answer her so as to keep her from going upstairs with the visitors  little judy now a nice neat girl of fourteen was sitting by her but rose to go away when the lady came in  judith was leaning against pillows and the pink flush in her cheeks and her smile of greeting prevented sophy from seeing how ill and wasted she looked thin and weak as were the fingers that lay on the coverlet  why judith you look much better than i expected  you will soon be as well as ever  judith only smiled and said thank you maam  i hope mrs carbonel is better  yes  she is getting better now and she is very sorry not to come and see you but perhaps she may be able before we go away  and little miss mary maam  she has been quite another creature since we have been at popplebynot at all fretty and almost rosy  i am glad  and you are going away maam  yes off to a beautiful island in the mediterranean sea close to all the places where saint paul preached  you know dora is at malta where he was shipwrecked  yes maam i like to know it  you will give my duty to her miss sophy and thank heroh so muchand judith clasped her handsfor all she and you and mrs carbonel have been to me  you seemed to bring the light back to me just as my faith was growing slack and dull  yes i will tell her judith  i dont like leaving you but it wont seem long till we come back and we will send you those beautiful maltese oranges  judith smiled that beautiful smile again  ah miss sophy you have been very good and helped me ever so much but my time is nearly over and i shall not want even you and madam where i am going  i shall see his face she murmured and lifted up her hands  sophy was rather frightened and felt as if she had done wrong in talking of oranges  she did not know what to say and only got out something about johnnie and a comfort  yes that he is miss sophy and little judy too  the boy he is that shy and quiet no one would believe the blessed things he says and reads to me at night  he be a blessing and so be judy all owing to the sunday school  oh to you judith  you made him good before we had him though mary and dora did help said sophy with rising tears  and oh  i am so thankful she said clasping her hands for what the captain is doing for the boy  he deserves it i am sure said sophy  it will keep him easier to the right way and it would be harder for him when i am gone and his father come home  and mr harford he says he will find a good place for judy  she is a good girl a right good girl  that she is  and maybe mrs carbonel and you when you come home would be good to my poor sister  sheve been a good sister to me she has with it all but it has all been against her and she would be a different woman if she could  please remember her  we will we will if we can  then judith went on to beg sophy to write to her former mistress mrs barnard with all her thanks for past kindness  that seemed to exhaust her a good deal and she lay back just saying faintly if you would read me a little bit miss  the prayerbook lay nearest and sophy read lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace as well as she could amid the choking tears she felt as if she were lifted into some higher air but judith lay so white and still that she durst not do more than say goodbye dear judith  she was going to say i will come and see you again but something withheld her  she thought judiths lips said up there she bent down kissed the cheek now quite white and crept down passing molly at the turn  two days later mr harford came to say that judith was gone  her last communion with johnnie and with george hewlett had been given to her the day before and she had not spoken afterwards only her face had been strangely bright  the carbonels could only feel that her remnant of life had been shortened by all she had undergone for their sakes and edmund and sophy both stood as mourners at her grave sophy feeling that her life had been more of a deepening realising lesson than anything that had gone before making her feel more than had ever come yet into her experience what this life is compared with eternal life    chapter twenty six  the golden chains    a form unseen is pulling us behind   threads turn to cords and cords to cables strong   till habit hath become as destiny   which drives us on and shakes her scourge on high   isaac williams  captain carbonel lost no time after judith greys funeral in sending john hewlett to his new master mr jones  the place was the carbonels old home in a county faraway from uphill  george had wished the lad to go to a cabinetmaker whom he knew at minsterham but he was convinced by the captains advice to let him be quite away from the assizes which would not only be pain and shame to him but would mark his name with the brand of the same kind as that of an informer  this mr jones was wellknown to the carbonel family as an excellent mana churchwarden and sure to care for the welfare spiritual as well as bodily of those commended to him  and it happened not unfortunately for john that in the captains handwriting his rather uncommon name was read as newlett and for some time after he arrived he never found out the mistake and was rather glad of it when he did so since no one connected him with the rickburner who gave evidence against his leader  dan himself came home to find that he was held in more utter disgrace than for all his former disreputable conduct which only passed for goodfellowship  if he had been hanged or even transported he would only have been poor dan hewlett and his wife would have had all the pity due to widowhood but everybody fought shy of him and the big lads hooted at him  he could not get work judiths pension had failed and they lived scantily on what farmer goodenough allowed molly to earn as an old hand to be kept off the parish  little judith was apprenticed to mrs pearson according to the old fashion which bound out pauper girls as apprentices to service and which had one happy effect namely that they could not drift foolishly from one situation to another though in bad hands they sometimes had much to suffer  but mrs pearson was a kind conscientious mistress and judy was a good girl so that all went well  dan slouched about snared rabbits and hares and drank up the proceeds thereof at little publichouses where he was not known or where the company was past caring about his doings  at last he was knocked down in the dark by the mailcoach and brought home in a cart slowly dying  mr harford came to see him and found his recollections of old times reviving when he had been dame verdons best scholar  i could beat old george any day at his book  and then i was church singer and had the solos he said evidently thinking sadly of his better days  and my wife she was that tidyonly she did put too much on her back  the screen which judith had of late years kept with the panel with the laburnums on the back side had by accident been now turned so that he saw them and when mr harford came the next day he broke out  them flowers  them flowers sir  mr harford could not understand  them golden chains sir  they was at the bottom of it  mr harford understood still less  they talk of devils chains sir and how they drags a man down  them was a link sure enough  that paper there sir i keeps seeing it at night by the rushlight and they gets to look just like chains  then mr harford understood that he meant the laburnums on the paper golden chains as they are often called  i was working with george he said before them carbonels came and when there was a piece of the parlour paper left over i took it for a parkisit  i didnt let george know he always seemed too particular twas more than i had reckoned on and one bit i papered mrs browns room at downhill with and one bit that was left my wife put on the screen  then when the captain made a work about it i thought it was mean and shabby in him and i never could lay my mind to him or his after thatspecial after miss sophy came and spied it out  i went agen em more and more and all they wanted for the place and it riled me the more that my lad should be took up with them and his aunt  and so the illwill of it went on with me worse and worserer  molly i say take the devils chains away  theyve got a hold of me  that was his delirious cry  mr harford prayed with him and for him but never could tell how much was remorse and how much might be repentance  he was quieter as his strength failed and his wife said he made a beautiful end and that she was sure the holy name of the saviour was on his lips and mr harford trusted that she was right with the charity that hopeth all things    chapter twenty seven  missed and mourned    nor deem the irrevocable past   as wholly wasted wholly vain   longfellow  be they gobblealls not coming home asked nanny barton as she stood at her gate while some of her neighbours came slowly out of church about two years later  my man he did ask shepherd tomkins said betsy seddon and all the answer he got was you dont desarve it not you  as if my man had gone out with that there rabble rout  and im sure mine only went up to see what they were after and helped to put out the fire beside  ay said cox behind her but not till the soldiers were come  time they did come said seddon  rain comes through the roof and that there lawyer brent wont have nothing done to it till the captain comes home  yes added morris and when i spoke to him about my windows as got blown in he said cottages were no end of expense and we hadnt treated them so as they would wish to come back nohow  think of their bearing malice cried nanny barton  i dont believe as how they does responded the other nanny  they have sent the coals and the blankets all the same  bear malice said mrs truman who had just walked up  no no  why parson harford have said over and over again when he gave a shilling or so or a meat order to help a poor lady that was ill that twas by madams wish  and governess thorpe she has the bag of babylinen and half a pound of tea for any call said mrs spurrell  but one looks for the friendly word and the time of day sighed betsy seddon  the poor children they dont half like their school without the ladies to look in said mrs truman  it is quite a job to get them there without miss sophy to tell them stories  i cant get mine to go at all on sundays said nanny morris  and added betsy seddon im right sure my poor bob would never have listed for a soldier if the captain had been at home to make master pucklechurch see the rights of things and not turn him off all on a suddent  master pucklechurch he dont believe they are never coming back said widow mole who had just come that way as an evening walk with her children  he says little miss and madam too have their health so much better out there that they wont like to come home  and yet they have made the place like a picture  i was up there to help sue pucklechurch clean it up and tis just a pleasure to see all the new outhouses and sheds as you might live in yourself and well off too  and that it should all be for them pucklechurches sighed seddon  i heerd tell said mrs truman that lawyer brent was to come and live in the house and that was why they are making it so nice  on this there arose a general wail of lamentation and even of indignation  nobody loved lawyer brent who was a hard if a just man anxious for his employers good but inclined in spite of all cautions to grind the tenants  to hear of his coming to greenhow was dismal news to all concerned and there was such a buzz of doleful inquiries that mr harford stopped on his way home to ask what was the matter  oh no he said when he heard  captain and mrs carbonel are coming home in the spring only they wished to travel slowly so as to see something of foreign parts  you need not be afraid  we shall have them back again and i hope nobody will be as foolish as before  i am sure they have quite forgiven  and on a fine spring day the bells were ringing at the church and everybody stood out at the cottage doors curtseying and bowing with delight and welcome and mrs carbonel and miss sophia and miss mary looking rosy healthy and substantial and even little master edmund was laughing and nodding and looking full of joy  while the captain walked up with mr harford and greeted every one with kindly hearty words  no one could doubt that they were glad to be at home again and after all that had come and gone that they felt that these were their own people whom they loved    chapter twenty eight  conclusion    the work be thine the fruit thy childrens partkeble  look at uphill priors in the year 1880  here are the mothers coming out of the mothers meeting  they look in their neat hats and jackets better on this weekday than any one would have done on sunday sixty years ago  they are many of them the granddaughters or grandsons wives of the inhabitants in those old times but they have not the worn haggard faces that their parents had when far younger except one or two poor things who have drunken husbands  miss carbonel young miss carbonel and the vicars wife have been working with them and reading to them things that the bettys and nannys of those days would not have understood or cared for  the whitehaired lady who stops her donkeychaise to exchange some affectionate kindly words and give out a parcel or twoshe is miss sophia and those elderly women who cluster round for a greeting they are her old scholars  those black eyes are hoglahs that neat woman is judy  yes she has lived among them and worked among them all her life never forgetting that no good work can be done without drudgery she has her girls friendly society class still in her own little house though she has dropped most of her regular outofdoor work of late years  for the vicarthere is a vicar nowand his daughters teach constantly in the schools  the children are swarming out now orderly and nice even superior in appearance to some of the mothers they run up to and as to learning the whole parish can read and write and the younger ones can send out a letter that would be no disgrace to a lady or a gentleman  there is a machine with its long tail of spikes coughing along as it blows off the steam at farmer goodenoughs  no one dreams of meddling with it to do any harm  wages are better food is cheaper and there are comforts in the house of every one tolerably thrifty that the grandmothers look at as novelties  john and george hewlett carpenters and builders have a handsome shop and large workshop in the street  all this has come in the way of gradual change brought about not by rioting but by the force of opinion and the action of those in authority  but how have people been fitted to make a good use of these thingsnot to waste them but to use them as gods good gifts  there has been a quiet influence at work ever since they gobblealls came up the roughness of the lanes and marys approach was given up  captain edmund and mary his wife lie in their quiet graves but the work they didby justice by kindness by teaching by examplehas gone on growing and miss sophia looks at it and is thankful as she still gives her best in love and experience to the young generation who are with her and look up to her for help and counsel  the church is beautiful now not only to look at nor merely in the wellperformed music of the services but in the number and devotion of the worshippers and communicants  of course all is not perfect in the placenever never will it be so in this world but the boys and youths can and often are saved from a fit of thoughtless heathenism by their clubs and their guilds and the better families are mostly communicants blots there are and the vicar sometimes desponds when some fresh evil crops up but miss sophia always tells him to hope and that    the many prayers the holy tears the nurture in the word   have not in vain ascended up before the gracious lord  finis
