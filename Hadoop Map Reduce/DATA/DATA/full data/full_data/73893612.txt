73893612	sailors knots  by ww jacobs   1909    odd man out   the night watchman pursed up his lips and shook his head  friendship he said decidedly is a deloosion and a snare  ive ad more friendships in my life than most peopleowing to being took a fancy to for some reason or otherand they nearly all came to a sudden ending  illustration friendship he said decidedly is a deloosion and a snare  i remember one man who used to think i couldnt do wrong everything i did was right to im and now if i pass im in the street he makes a face as if hed got a hair in is mouth  all because i told im the truth one day when he was thinking of getting married  being a bit uneasylike in his mind he asked me ow supposing i was a gal his looks would strike me  it was an orkard question and i told him that he ad got a good art and that no man could ave a better pal  i said he ad got a good temper and was free with is money  o course that didnt satisfy im and at last he told me to take a good look at im and tell him wot i thought of is looks  there was no getting out of it and at last i ad to tell him plain that everybody ad diffrent ideas about looks that looks wasnt everything and that andsome is as andsome does  even then e wasnt satisfied and at last i told im speaking as a pal to a pal that if i was a gal and he came along trying to court me i should go to the police about it  i remember two young fellers that was shipmates with me some years ago and they was such outandout pals that everybody called em the siamese twins  they always shipped together and shared lodgings together when they was ashore and ted denver would no more ave thought of going out without charlie brice than charlie brice would ave thought of going out without im  they shared their baccy and their money and everything else and its my opinion that if they ad only ad one pair o boots between em theyd ave hopped along in one each  they ad been like it for years and they kept it up when they left the sea and got berths ashore  anybody knowing them would ha thought that nothing but death could part em but it happened otherwise  there was a gal in it of course  a gal that ted denver got into conversation with on top of a bus owing to her steadying erself by putting her hand on is shoulder as she passed im  bright lively sort o gal she seemed and afore ted knew where he was they was talking away as though they ad known each other for years  charlie didnt seem to care much for it at fust but he didnt raise no objection and when the gal got up to go he stopped the bus for er by poking the driver in the back and they all got off together  ted went fust to break her fall in case the bus started off too sudden and charlie elped her down behind by catching hold of a lace collar she was wearing  when she turned to speak to im about it she knocked the conductors hat off with er umbrella and there was so much unpleasantness that by the time they ad got to the pavement she told charlie that she never wanted to see his silly fat face agin  it aint fat ses ted speaking up for im its the shape of it  and it aint silly ses charlie speaking very quick mind that  its a bit o real lace ses the gal twisting her ead round to look at the collar it cost me one and twothree only last night  one an wot  ses charlie who not being a married man didnt understand er  one shilling ses the gal two pennies and three farthings  dye understand that  yes ses charlie  hes cleverer than he looks ses the gal turning to ted  i spose youre right and it is the shape after all  ted walked along one side of er and charlie the other till they came to the corner of the road where she lived and then ted and er stood there talking till charlie got sick and tired of it and kept tugging at teds coat for im to come away  im coming ses ted at last  i spose you wont be this way tomorrow night  he ses turning to the gal  i might if i thought there was no chance of seeing you she ses tossing her ead  you neednt be alarmed ses charlie shoving in his oar were going to a musicall tomorrow night  oh go to your blessed musicall ses the gal to ted i dont want you  she turned round and amost ran up the road with ted follering er and begging of er not to be so hasty and afore they parted she told im that er name was  emma white and promised to meet im there the next night at seven  o course mr charlie brice turned up alongside o ted the next night and at fust emma said she was going straight off ome agin  she did go part o the way and then when she found that ted wouldnt send his mate off she came back and womanlike said as ow she wasnt going to go ome just to please charlie brice  she wouldnt speak a word to im and when they all went to the musicall together she sat with her face turned away from im and her elbow sticking in is chest  doing that and watching the performance at the same time gave er a stiff neck and she got in such a temper over it she wouldnt hardly speak to ted and when charliemeaning welltold er to rub it with a bit o muttonfat she nearly went off her ead  who asked you to come with us she ses as soon as she could speak ow dare you force yourself where you aint wanted  ted wants me ses charlie  weve been together for years ses ted  youll like charlie when you get used to imeverybody does  not me ses emma with a shiver  it gives me the fair creeps to look at him  youll ave to choose between us  if he comes i shant which is it to be  neither of em answered er but the next night they both turned up as usual and emma white stood there looking at em and nearly crying with temper  ow would you like it if i brought another young lady with me  she ses to ted  it wouldnt make no difference to me ses ted  any friend o yours is welcome  emma stood looking at em and then she patted er eyes with a pocket ankercher and began to look more cheerful  you aint the only one that has got a dear friend she says looking at im and wiping er lips with the ankercher  ive got one and if charlie brice dont promise to stay at ome tomorrow night ill bring her with me  bring er and welcome ses ted  i shant stay at ome for fifty dear friends ses charlie  have it your own way ses emma  if you come sophy jennings comes thats all  she was as good as er word too and next night when they turned up they found emma and er friend waiting for them  charlie thought it was the friends mother at fust but he found out arterwards that she was a widderwoman  she had ad two husbands and both of em ad passed away with a smile on their face  she seemed to take a fancy to charlie the moment she set eyes on im and two or three times theyd ave lost ted and emma if it hadnt been for im  illustration when they turned up they found emma and er friend waiting for them  they did lose em the next night and charlie brice ad mrs jennings all alone to himself for over a couple of hours walking up and down the commercial road talking about the weather charles saying ow wet and cold it was and thinking praps they ad better go off ome afore she got a chill  he complained to ted about it when e got ome and ted promised as it shouldnt appen agin  he said that im and emma ad been so busy talking about getting married that he ad forgotten to keep an eye on him  married ses charlie very upset  married  and wots to become o me  come and lodge with us ses ted  they shook hands on it but ted said they ad both better keep it to themselves a bit and wait until emma ad got more used to charlie afore they told her  ted let er get used to im for three days more afore he broke the news to er and the way she went on was alarming  she went on for over ten minutes without taking breath and she was just going to start again when mrs jennings stopped her  hes all right she ses  you leave im alone  im not touching im ses emma very scornful  you leave im alone ses mrs jennings taking hold of charlies arm i dont say things about your young man  charlie brice started as if he ad been shot and twice he opened is mouth to speak and show mrs jennings er mistake but wot with trying to find is voice in the fust place and then finding words to use it with in the second he didnt say anything  he just walked along gasping with is mouth open like a fish  dont take no notice of er charlie ses mrs jennings  ii dont mind wot she ses ses pore charlie but youre making a great  shes quicktempered is emma ses mrs jennings  but there so am i  wot you might call a generous temper but quick  charlie went cold all over  treat me well and i treat other people well ses mrs jennings  i cant say fairer than that can i  charlie said nobody could and then e walked along with her hanging on to is arm arf wondering whether it would be wrong to shove er under a bus that was passing and arf wondering whether e could do it if it wasnt  as for emma saying she wont ave you for a lodger ses mrs jennings let er wait till shes asked  shell wait a long time if i ave my say  charlie didnt answer her  he walked along with is mouth shut his idea being that the least said the soonest mended  even emma asked im at last whether he ad lost is tongue and said it was curious ow different love took different people  he talked fast enough going ome with ted though and pretty near lost is temper with im when ted asked im why he didnt tell mrs jennings straight that she ad made a mistake  she knows well enough he says grinding is teeth she was just trying it on  thats ow it is widders get married agin  youll ave to choose between going out with me or emma ted  i cant face mrs jennings again  i didnt think anybody could ave parted us like that  ted said it was all nonsense but it was no good and the next night he went off alone and came back very cross saying that mrs jennings ad been with em all the time and when e spoke to emma about it she said it was just tit for tat and reminded im ow she had ad to put up with charlie  for four nights running e went out for walks with emma holding one of is arms and mrs jennings the other  its miserable for you all alone ere by yourself charlie he ses why not come  she cant marry you against your will  besides i miss you  charlie shook ands with im but e said e wouldnt walk out with mrs jennings for a fortune  and all that ted could say made no difference he stayed indoors of an evening reading the paper or going for little walks by imseif until at last ted came ome one evening smiling all over his face and told im they had both been making fools of themselves for nothing  mrs jennings is going to be married he ses

was going and to stick to it  why dont you behave yourself ses emma at last  were all right ses charlie you look arter your own young man  we can look arter ourselves  speak for yourself ses mrs jennings very sharp  charlie laughed and the more mrs jennings showed er dislike for is nonsense the more he gave way to it  even ted thought it was going too far and tried to interfere when he put his arm round mrs jenningss waist and made er dance to a pianoorgan but there was no stopping im and at last mrs jennings said she had ad enough of it and told emma she was going off ome  illustration

the pavement he pretended to think she ad dropped em but do wot he would e couldnt frighten er into staying away and is share of musicalls and bus rides and things like that was more than e cared to
