79083047	ships company  by ww jacobs    illustration i tell you i am as innercent as a newborn babe   skilled assistance   the nightwatchman who had left his seat on the jetty to answer the gatebell came back with disgust written on a countenance only too well designed to express it  if shes been up ere once in the last week to know whether the isilviai is up shes been four or five times he growled  hes forty seven if hes a day is left leg is shorter than is right and he talks with a stutter  when shes with im youd think as butter wouldnt melt in er mouth but the way she talked to me just now youd think i was paid apurpose to wait on her  i asked er at last wot she thought i was here for and she said she didnt know and nobody else neither  and afore she went off she told the potman from the albion wot was listening that i was known all over wapping as the sleeping beauty  she aint the fust ive ad words with not by a lot  theyre all the same they all start in a nice kind soapy sort o way and as soon as they dont get wot they want fly into a temper and ask me who i think i am  i told one woman once not to be silly and i shall never forget it as long as i livenever  for all i know shes wearing a bit o my air in a locket to this day and very likely boasting that i gave it to her  talking of her reminds me of another woman  there was a capn pinner used to trade between ere and hull on a schooner named the snipe  nice little craft she was and e was a very nice feller  many and manys the pint weve ad together turn and turnabout and the ony time we ever ad a cross word was when somebody hid his clay pipe in my beer and e was foolish enough to think id done it  he ad a nice little cottage e told me about near hull and is wifes father a man of pretty near seventy lived with em  welloff the old man was and as she was his only daughter they looked to ave all his money when hed gorn  their only fear was that e might marry agin and judging from wot e used to tell me about the old man i thought it more than likely  if it wasnt for my missis hed ha been married over and over agin he ses one day  hes like a child playing with gunpowder  ow would it be to let im burn hisself a bit i ses  if you was to see some o the gunpowder he wants to play with you wouldnt talk like that ses the capn  youd know better  the ony thing is to keep em apart and my pore missis is wore to a shadder a doing of it  it was just about a month arter that that he brought the old man up to london with im  they ad some stuff to put out at smiths wharf tother side of the river afore they came to us and though they was ony there four or five days it was long enough for that old man to get into trouble  the skipper told me about it ten minutes arter they was made snug in the inner berth ere  he walked up and down like a man with a raging toothache and arter follering im up and down the wharf till i was tired out i discovered that is fatherinlaw ad got imself mixed up with a widderwoman ninety years old and weighing twenty stun  arter he ad cooled down a bit and i ad given im a few little pats on the shoulder e made it fortyeight years old and fourteen stun  hes getting ready to go and meet her now he ses and wot my missisll say to me i dont know  his fatherinlaw came up on deck as e spoke and began to brush imself all over with a clothesbrush  nicelooking little man e was with blue eyes and a little white beard cut to a point and dressed up in a serge suit with brass buttons and a white yachting cap  his real name was mr finch but the skipper called im uncle dick and he took such a fancy to me that in five minutes i was calling im uncle dick too  time i was moving he ses by and by  ive got an appintment  oh who with ses the skipper pretending not to know  friend o mine in the army ses the old man with a wink at me  so long  he went off as spry as a boy and as soon as hed gorn the skipper started walking backards and forards agin and raving  lets ope as hes ony amusing imself i ses  wait till you see er ses the skipper then you wont talk foolishness  as it appened she came back with uncle dick that evening to see im safe and i see at once wot sort of a woman it was  she adnt been on the wharf five minutes afore youd ha thought it belonged to er and when she went and sat on the schooner it seemed to be about arf its size  she called the skipper tom and sat there as cool as you please holding uncle dicks and and patting it  i took the skipper round to the bulls head arter she ad gorn and i wouldnt let im say a word until he had ad two pints  he felt better then and some o the words e used surprised me  wots to be done he ses at last  you see ow it is bill  cant you get im away i ses  who is she and wots er name  her name ses the skipper her name is jane maria elizabeth muffit and she lives over at rotherhithe  shes very likely married already i ses  her usband died ten years ago ses the skipper passed away in is sleep  overlaid i should say  he sat there smoking and i sat there thinking  twice e spoke to me and i held my and up and said hsh then i turned to im all of a sudden and pinched his arm so hard he nearly dropped is beer  is uncle dick a nervous man i ses  nervous is no name for it he ses staring  very good then i ses  ill send er husband to frighten im  the skipper looked at me very strange  yes he ses  yes  yes  frighten im out of is boots and make him give er up i ses  or better still get im to run away and go into hiding for a time  that ud be best in case e found out  found out wot ses the skipper  found out it wasnt er husband i ses  bill ses the skipper very earnest this is the fust beer ive ad today and i wish i could say the same for you  i didnt take im at fast but when i did i gave a laugh that brought in two more customers to see wot was the matter  then i took im by the armarter a little troubleand taking im back to the wharf explained my meaning to im  i know the very man i ses  he comes into a publicouse down my way sometimes  artful arry hes called and for arfaquid say hed frighten uncle dick arf to death  hes big and ugly and picks up a living by selling meerschaum pipes hes found to small men wot dont want em  wonderful gift o the gab hes got  we went acrost to the albion to talk it over  theres several bars there and the landlady always keeps cottonwool in er ears not aving been brought up to the public line  the skipper told me all e knew about mrs muffit and we arranged that artful arry should come down at seven oclock next night if so be as i could find im in time  i got up early the next arternoon and as it appened he came into the duke of edinburgh five minutes arter i got there  nasty temper e was in too  hed just found a meerschaum pipe as usual and the very fust man e tried to sell it to said that it was the one e lost last christmas and gave im a punch in the jaw for it  hes a thief thats wot he is ses arry and i ate thiefs  ows a honest tradesman to make a living when theres people like that about  i stood im arf a pint and though it hurt im awful to drink it he said ed ave another just to see if he could bear the pain  arter he had ad three e began for to take a more cheerful view o life and told me about a chap that spent three weeks in the london orsepittle for calling im a liar  treat me fair he ses and ill treat other people fair  i never broke my word without a good reason for it and thats more than everybody can say  if i told you the praise ive ad from some people you wouldnt believe it  i let im go on till he ad talked imself into a good temper and then i told im of the little job i ad got for im  he listened quiet till i ad finished and then he shook is ead  it aint in my line he ses  theres arf a quid anging to it i ses  arry shook his ead agin  taint enough mate he ses  if you was to make it a quid i wont say as i mightnt think of it  i ad told the skipper that it might cost im a quid so i knew ow far i could go and at last arter arry ad got as far as the door three times i gave way  and ill ave it now he ses to prevent mistakes  no arry i ses very firm  besides it aint my money you see  you mean to say you dont trust me e ses firing up  id trust you with untold gold i ses but not with a real quid youre too fond of a joke arry  we ad another long argyment about it and i had to tell im plain at last that when i wanted to smell is fist id say so  you turn up at the wharf at five minutes to seven i ses and ill give you ten bob of it arter youve done your business ill give you the other  come along quiet and youll see me waiting at the gate for you  he gave way arter a time and fust going ome for a cup o tea i went on to the wharf to tell the skipper ow things stood  it couldnt ave appened better he ses  uncle dick is sure to be aboard at that time cos es going acrost the water at eight oclock to pay er a visit  and all the handsll be away  ive made sure of that  he gave me the money for artful arry in two arfsuverins and then we went over to the albion for a quiet glass and a pipe and to wait for seven oclock  i left im there at ten minutes to and at five minutes to punctual to the minute i see arry coming along swinging a thick stick with a knob on the end of it  wheres the arf thickun he ses looking round to see that the coast was clear  i gave it to im and arter biting it in three places and saying it was a bit short in weight he dropped it in is weskitpocket and said e was ready  i left im there for a minute while i went and ad a look round  the deck of the snipe was empty but i could ear uncle dick down in the cabin singing and arter listening for a few seconds to make sure that it was singing i went back and beckoned to arry  hes down in the cabin i ses pointing  dont overdo it arry and at the same time dont underdo it as you might say  i know just wot you want ses arry and if youd got the art of a man in you youd make it two quids  he climbed on board and stood listening for a moment at the companion and then e went down while i went off outside the gate so as to be out of earshot in case uncle dick called for me  i knew that i should ear all about wot went on arterwardsand i did  artful arry went down the companionladder very quiet and then stood at the foot of it looking at uncle dick  he looked im up and down and all over and then e gave a fierce loud cough  goodevening he ses  goodevening ses uncle dick staring at im  did you want to see anybody  i did ses arry  i do  and when i see im im going to put my arms round im and twist is neck then im

ses uncle dick putting his and in his pocket in a great urry to please him and pulling out some silver  arry said e would and then he stood on one side to let im pass and even put the knobby stick under im to help im up the companionladder  uncle dick passed me two minutes arterwards without a word and set off down the road as fast as is little legs ud carry im  i watched im out o sight and then i went on board the schooner to see how arry ad got on  arry i ses when he ad finished youre a masterpiece  i know i am he ses  wot about that other arfquid  here it is i ses giving it to im

wheres the skipper  sitting in the albion i ses arf choking  go and tell im its five quid ses arry  i dont mean five more ony four  some people would ha made it five but i like to deal square and honest  i run over for the skipper in a state of mind that dont bear thinking of and he came back with me arf crazy  when we got to the cabin we found the door was locked and arter the skipper ad told artful wot hed do to im if he didnt open it he ad to go on deck and talk to im through the skylight  if you aint off of my ship in two twos he ses ill fetch a policeman  you go and fetch four pounds ses arry thats wot im waiting for not a policeman  didnt the watchman tell you  the bargain was for one pound ses the skipper ardly able to speak  well you tell that to the policeman ses artful arry

watchman got ses arry  his lodger lost is purse the other day  id got two and ninepence as it appened and then there was more trouble because the skipper wouldnt give im the money till he ad gone and e wouldnt go till he ad got it  the skipper gave way at last and as soon as he ad got it arry ses now op off and borrer the rest and look slippy about it  i put one hand over the skippers mouth fust and then finding that was no good i put the other  it was no good wasting bad langwidge on arry  i pacified the skipper at last and arter arry ad swore true ed go when ed got the money the skipper rushed round to try and raise it its a difficult job at the best o times and i sat there on the skylight shivering and wondering whether the skipper or mrs muffit would turn up fust  hours seemed to pass away and then i see the wicket in the gate open and the skipper come through  he jumped on deck without a word and then going over to the skylight anded down the money to arry  righto ses arry  it ony shows you wot you can do by trying  he unlocked the door and came up on deck looking at us very careful and playing with is stick  youve got your money ses the skipper now go as quick as you can  arry smiled and nodded at him  then he stepped on to the wharf and was just moving to the gate with us follering when the wicket opened and in came mrs muffit and uncle dick  there he is ses uncle dick  thats the man  mrs muffit walked up to im and my art amost stopped beating  her face was the colour of beetroot with temper and you could ave heard her breath fifty yards away  ho she says planting erself in front of artful arry so youre the man that ses youre my usband are you  thats all right ses arry its all a mistake  mistake ses mrs muffit  mistake o bills ses arry pointing to me  i told im i thought e was wrong but e would ave it  ive got a bad memory so i left it to im  ho ses mrs muffit taking a deep breath  ho  i thought as much wot ave you got to say for yourselfeh  she turned on me like a wild cat with her ands in front of her  ive been scratched once in my life and i wasnt going to be agin so fixing my eyes on er i just stepped back a bit ready for er  so long as i kept my eye fixed on ers she couldnt do anything  i knew that unfortunately i stepped back just a inch too far and next moment i went over backards in twelve foot of water  arter all praps it was the best thing that could have appened to me it stopped her talking  it aint the fust time ive ad a wet jacket but as for the skipper and pore uncle dickwot married hertheyve been in hot water ever since
