65406866	records of a                            family of engineers                                       by                            robert louis stevenson              picture decorative graphic

introduction the surname of stevenson   from the thirteenth century onwards the name under the various disguises of stevinstoun stevensoun stevensonne stenesone and stewinsoune spread across scotland from the mouth of the firth of forth to the mouth of the firth of clyde  four times at least it occurs as a placename  there is a parish of stevenston in cunningham a second place of the name in the barony of bothwell in lanark a third on lyne above drochil castle the fourth on the tyne near traprain law stevenson of stevenson co lanark swore fealty to edward i in 1296 and the last of that family died after the restoration  stevensons of hirdmanshiels in midlothian rode in the bishops’ raid of aberlady served as jurors stood bail for neighbours—hunter of polwood for instance—and became extinct about the same period or possibly earlier a stevenson of luthrie and another of pitroddie make their bows give their names and vanish  and by the year 1700 it does not appear that any acre of scots land was vested in any stevenson 2a  here is so far a melancholy picture of backward progress and a family posting towards extinction  but the law however administered and i am bound to aver that in scotland ‘it couldna weel be waur’ acts as a kind of dredge and with dispassionate impartiality brings up into the light of day and shows us for a moment in the jurybox or on the gallows the creeping things of the past  by these broken glimpses we are able to trace the existence of many other and more inglorious stevensons picking a private way through the brawl that makes scots history  they were members of parliament for peebles stirling pittenweem kilrenny and inverurie  we find them burgesses of edinburgh indwellers in biggar perth and dalkeith  thomas was the forester of newbattle park gavin was a baker john a maltman francis a chirurgeon and ‘schir william’ a priest  in the feuds of humes and heatleys cunninghams montgomeries mures ogilvies and turnbulls we find them inconspicuously involved and apparently getting rather better than they gave  schir william reverend gentleman was cruellie slaughtered on the links of kincraig in 1582 james ‘in the milltown of roberton’ murdered in 1590 archibald ‘in gallowfarren’ killed with shots of pistols and hagbuts in 1608  three violent deaths in about seventy years against which we can only put the case of thomas servant to hume of cowden knowes who was arraigned with his two young masters for the death of the bastard of mellerstanes in 1569  john ‘in dalkeith’ stood sentry without holyrood while the banded lords were despatching rizzio within  william at the ringing of perth bell ran before gowrie house ‘with ane sword and entering to the yearde saw george craiggingilt with ane twahandit sword and utheris nychtbouris at quilk time james boig cryit ower ane wynds “awa hame ye will all be hangit”’—a piece of advice which william took and immediately ‘depairtit’  john got a maid with child to him in biggar and seemingly deserted her she was hanged on the castle hill for infanticide june 1614 and martin elder in dalkeith eternally disgraced the name by signing witness in a witch trial 1661  these are two of our black sheep 3a  under the restoration one stevenson was a bailie in edinburgh and another the lessee of the canonmills  there were at the same period two physicians of the name in edinburgh one of whom dr archibald appears to have been a famous man in his day and generation the court had continual need of him it was he who reported for instance on the state of rumbold and he was for some time in the enjoyment of a pension of a thousand pounds scots about eighty pounds sterling at a time when five hundred pounds is described as ‘an opulent future’  i do not know if i should be glad or sorry that he failed to keep favour but on 6th january 1682 rather a cheerless new year’s present his pension was expunged 4a  there need be no doubt at least of my exultation at the fact that he was knighted and recorded arms  not quite so genteel but still in public life hugh was underclerk to the privy council and liked being so extremely  i gather this from his conduct in september 1681 when with all the lords and their servants he took the woful and souldestroying test swearing it ‘word by word upon his knees’  and behold it was in vain for hugh was turned out of his small post in 1684 4b  sir archibald and hugh were both plainly inclined to be trimmers but there was one witness of the name of stevenson who held high the banner of the covenant—john ‘landlabourer 4c in the parish of daily in carrick’ that ‘eminently pious man’  he seems to have been a poor sickly soul and shows himself disabled with scrofula and prostrate and groaning aloud with fever but the enthusiasm of the martyr burned high within him  ‘i was made to take joyfully the spoiling of my goods and with pleasure for his name’s sake wandered in deserts and in mountains in dens and caves of the earth  i lay four months in the coldest season of the year in a haystack in my father’s garden and a whole february in the open fields not far from camragen and this i did without the least prejudice from the night air one night when lying in the fields near to the carrickmiln i was all covered with snow in the morning  many nights have i lain with pleasure in the churchyard of old daily and made a grave my pillow frequently have i resorted to the old walls about the glen near to camragen and there sweetly rested’  the visible band of god protected and directed him  dragoons were turned aside from the bramblebush where he lay hidden  miracles were performed for his behoof  ‘i got a horse and a woman to carry the child and came to the same mountain where i wandered by the mist before it is commonly known by the name of kellsrhins when we came to go up the mountain there came on a great rain which we thought was the occasion of the child’s weeping and she wept so bitterly that all we could do could not divert her from it so that she was ready to burst  when we got to the top of the mountain where the lord had been formerly kind to my soul in prayer i looked round me for a stone and espying one i went and brought it when the woman with me saw me set down the stone she smiled and asked what i was going to do with it  i told her i was going to set it up as my ebenezer because hitherto and in that place the lord had formerly helped and i hoped would yet help  the rain still continuing the child weeping bitterly i went to prayer and no sooner did i cry to god but the child gave over weeping and when we got up from prayer the rain was pouring down on every side but in the way where we were to go there fell not one drop the place not rained on was as big as an ordinary avenue’ and so great a saint was the natural butt of satan’s persecutions  ‘i retired to the fields for secret prayer about midnight  when i went to pray i was much straitened and could not get one request but “lord pity” “lord help” this i came over frequently at length the terror of satan fell on me in a high degree and all i could say even then was—“lord help”  i continued in the duty for some time notwithstanding of this terror  at length i got up to my feet and the terror still increased then the enemy took me by the armpits and seemed to lift me up by my arms  i saw a loch just before me and i concluded he designed to throw me there by force and had he got leave to do so it might have brought a great reproach upon religion 7a  but it was otherwise ordered and the cause of piety escaped that danger 7b  on the whole the stevensons may be described as decent reputable folk following honest trades—millers maltsters and doctors playing the character parts in the waverley novels with propriety if without distinction and to an orphan looking about him in the world for a potential ancestry offering a plain and quite unadorned refuge equally free from shame and glory  john the landlabourer is the one living and memorable figure and he alas cannot possibly be more near than a collateral  it was on august 12 1678 that he heard mr john welsh on the craigdowhill and ‘took the heavens earth and sun in the firmament that was shining on us as also the ambassador who made the offer and the clerk who raised the psalms to witness that i did give myself away to the lord in a personal and perpetual covenant never to be forgotten’ and already in 1675 the birth of my direct ascendant was registered in glasgow  so that i have been pursuing ancestors too far down and john the landlabourer is debarred me and i must relinquish from the trophies of my house his rare soulstrengthening and comforting cordial  it is the same case with the edinburgh bailie and the miller of the canonmills worthy man and with that public character hugh the underclerk and more than all with sir archibald the physician who recorded arms  and i am reduced to a family of inconspicuous maltsters in what was then the clean and handsome little city on the clyde  the name has a certain air of being norse  but the story of scottish nomenclature is confounded by a continual process of translation and halftranslation from the gaelic which in olden days may have been sometimes reversed  roy becomes reid gow smith  a great highland clan uses the name of robertson a sept in appin that of livingstone maclean in glencoe answers to johnstone at lockerby  and we find such hybrids as macalexander for macallister  there is but one rule to be deduced that however uncompromisingly saxon a name may appear you can never be sure it does not designate a celt  my greatgrandfather wrote the name stevenson but pronounced it steenson after the fashion of the immortal minstrel in redgauntlet and this elision of a medial consonant appears a gaelic process and curiously enough i have come across no less than two gaelic forms john macstophane cordinerius in crossraguel 1573 and william m’steen in dunskeith co ross 1605 stevenson steenson macstophane m’steen which is the original which the translation  or were these separate creations of the patronymic some english some gaelic  the curiously compact territory in which we find them seated—ayr lanark peebles stirling perth fife and the lothians—would seem to forbid the supposition 9a  ‘stevenson—or according to tradition of one of the proscribed of the clan macgregor who was born among the willows or in a hillside sheeppen—“son of my love” a heraldic bar sinister but history reveals a reason for the birth among the willows far other than the sinister aspect of the name’ these are the dark words of mr cosmo innes but history or tradition being interrogated tells a somewhat tangled tale the heir of macgregor of glenorchy murdered about 1858 by the argyll campbells appears to have been the original ‘son of my love’ and his more loyal clansmen took the name to fight under  it may be supposed the story of their resistance became popular and the name in some sort identified with the idea of opposition to the campbells  twice afterwards on some renewed aggression in 1502 and 1552 we find the macgregors again banding themselves into a sept of ‘sons of my love’ and when the great disaster fell on them in 1603 the whole original legend reappears and we have the heir of alaster of glenstrae born ‘among the willows’ of a fugitive mother and the more loyal clansmen again rallying under the name of stevenson  a story would not be told so often unless it had some base in fact nor if there were no bond at all between the red macgregors and the stevensons would that extraneous and somewhat uncouth name be so much repeated in the legends of the children of the mist  but i am enabled by my very lively and obliging correspondent mr george a macgregor stevenson of new york to give an actual instance his grandfather greatgrandfather greatgreatgrandfather and greatgreatgreatgrandfather all used the names of macgregor and stevenson as occasion served being perhaps macgregor by night and stevenson by day  the greatgreatgreatgrandfather was a mighty man of his hands marched with the clan in the ‘fortyfive and returned with spolia opima in the shape of a sword which he had wrested from an officer in the retreat and which is in the possession of my correspondent to this day  his greatgrandson the grandfather of my correspondent being converted to methodism by some wayside preacher discarded in a moment his name his old nature and his political principles and with the zeal of a proselyte sealed his adherence to the protestant succession by baptising his next son george  this george became the publisher and editor of the wesleyan times  his children were brought up in ignorance of their highland pedigree and my correspondent was puzzled to overhear his father speak of him as a true macgregor and amazed to find in rummaging about that peaceful and pious house the sword of the hanoverian officer  after he was grown up and was better informed of his descent ‘i frequently asked my father’ he writes ‘why he did not use the name of macgregor his replies were significant and give a picture of the man “it isn’t a good methodist name  you can use it but it will do you no good”  yet the old gentleman by way of pleasantry used to announce himself to friends as “colonel macgregor”’  here then are certain macgregors habitually using the name of stevenson and at last under the influence of methodism adopting it entirely  doubtless a proscribed clan could not be particular they took a name as a man takes an umbrella against a shower as rob roy took campbell and his son took drummond  but this case is different stevenson was not taken and left—it was consistently adhered to  it does not in the least follow that all stevensons are of the clan alpin but it does follow that some may be  and i cannot conceal from myself the possibility that james stevenson in glasgow my first authentic ancestor may have had a highland alias upon his conscience and a claymore in his back parlour  to one more tradition i may allude that we are somehow descended from a french barbersurgeon who came to st andrews in the service of one of the cardinal beatons  no details were added  but the very name of france was so detested in my family for three generations that i am tempted to suppose there may be something in it 12a     chapter i domestic annals   it is believed that in 1665 james stevenson in nether carsewell parish of neilston county of renfrew and presumably a tenant farmer married one jean keir and in 1675 without doubt there was born to these two a son robert possibly a maltster in glasgow  in 1710 robert married for a second time elizabeth cumming and there was born to them in 1720 another robert certainly a maltster in glasgow  in 1742 robert the second married margaret fulton margret she called herself by whom he had ten children among whom were hugh born february 1749 and alan born june 1752  with these two brothers my story begins  their deaths were simultaneous their lives unusually brief and full  tradition whispered me in childhood they were the owners of an islet near st kitts and it is certain they had risen to be at the head of considerable interests in the west indies which hugh managed abroad and alan at home at an age when others are still curveting a clerk’s stool  my kinsman mr stevenson of stirling has heard his father mention that there had been ‘something romantic’ about alan’s marriage and alas he has forgotten what  it was early at least  his wife was jean daughter of david lillie a builder in glasgow and several times ‘deacon of the wrights’ the date of the marriage has not reached me but on 8th june 1772 when robert the only child of the union was born the husband and father had scarce passed or had not yet attained his twentieth year  here was a youth making haste to give hostages to fortune  but this early scene of prosperity in love and business was on the point of closing  there hung in the house of this young family and successively in those of my grandfather and father an oil painting of a ship of many tons burthen  doubtless the brothers had an interest in the vessel i was told she had belonged to them outright and the picture was preserved through years of hardship and remains to this day in the possession of the family the only memorial of my greatgrandsire alan  it was on this ship that he sailed on his last adventure summoned to the west indies by hugh  an agent had proved unfaithful on a serious scale and it used to be told me in my childhood how the brothers pursued him from one island to another in an open boat were exposed to the pernicious dews of the tropics and simultaneously struck down  the dates and places of their deaths now before me would seem to indicate a more scattered and prolonged pursuit hugh on the 16th april 1774 in tobago within sight of trinidad alan so late as 26th may and so far away as ‘santt kittes’ in the leeward islands—both says the family bible ‘of a fiver’  the death of hugh was probably announced by alan in a letter to which we may refer the details of the open boat and the dew  thus at least in something like the course of post both were called away the one twentyfive the other twentytwo their brief generation became extinct their shortlived house fell with them and ‘in these lawless parts and lawless times’—the words are my grandfather’s—their property was stolen or became involved  many years later i understand some small recovery to have been made but at the moment almost the whole means of the family seem to have perished with the young merchants  on the 27th april eleven days after hugh stevenson twentynine before alan died david lillie the deacon of the wrights so that mother and son were orphaned in one month  thus from a few scraps of paper bearing little beyond dates we construct the outlines of the tragedy that shadowed the cradle of robert stevenson  jean lillie was a young woman of strong sense well fitted to contend with poverty and of a pious disposition which it is like that these misfortunes heated  like so many other widowed scotswomen she vowed her son should wag his head in a pulpit but her means were inadequate to her ambition  a charity school and some time under a mr m’intyre ‘a famous linguist’ were all she could afford in the way of education to the wouldbe minister  he learned no greek in one place he mentions that the orations of cicero were his highest book in latin in another that he had ‘delighted’ in virgil and horace but his delight could never have been scholarly  this appears to have been the whole of his training previous to an event which changed his own destiny and moulded that of his descendants—the second marriage of his mother  there was a merchantburgess of edinburgh of the name of thomas smith the smith pedigree has been traced a little more particularly than the stevensons’ with a similar dearth of illustrious names  one character seems to have appeared indeed for a moment at the wings of history a skipper of dundee who smuggled over some jacobite bigwig at the time of the ‘fifteen and was afterwards drowned in dundee harbour while going on board his ship  with this exception the generations of the smiths present no conceivable interest even to a descendant and thomas of edinburgh was the first to issue from respectable obscurity  his father a skipper out of broughty ferry was drowned at sea while thomas was still young  he seems to have owned a ship or two—whalers i suppose or coasters—and to have been a member of the dundee trinity house whatever that implies  on his death the widow remained in broughty and the son came to push his future in edinburgh  there is a story told of him in the family which i repeat here because i shall have to tell later on a similar but more perfectly authenticated experience of his stepson robert stevenson  word reached thomas that his mother was unwell and he prepared to leave for broughty on the morrow  it was between two and three in the morning and the early northern daylight was already clear when he awoke and beheld the curtains at the bedfoot drawn aside and his mother appear in the interval smile upon him for a moment and then vanish  the sequel is stereotype he took the time by his watch and arrived at broughty to learn it was the very moment of her death  the incident is at least curious in having happened to such a person—as the tale is being told of him  in all else he appears as a man ardent passionate practical designed for affairs and prospering in them far beyond the average  he founded a solid business in lamps and oils and was the sole proprietor of a concern called the greenside company’s works—‘a multifarious concern it was’ writes my cousin professor swan ‘of tinsmiths coppersmiths brassfounders blacksmiths and japanners’  he was also it seems a shipowner and underwriter  he built himself ‘a land’—nos 1 and 2 baxter’s place then no such unfashionable neighbourhood—and died leaving his only son in easy circumstances and giving to his three surviving daughters portions of five thousand pounds and upwards  there is no standard of success in life but in one of its meanings this is to succeed  in what we know of his opinions he makes a figure highly characteristic of the time  a high tory and patriot a captain—so i find it in my notes—of edinburgh spearmen and on duty in the castle during the muir and palmer troubles he bequeathed to his descendants a bloodless sword and a somewhat violent tradition both long preserved  the judge who sat on muir and palmer the famous braxfield let fall from the bench the obiter dictum—‘i never liked the french all my days but now i hate them’  if thomas smith the edinburgh spearman were in court he must have been tempted to applaud  the people of that land were his abhorrence he loathed buonaparte like antichrist  towards the end he fell into a kind of dotage his family must entertain him with games of tin soldiers which he took a childish pleasure to array and overset but those who played with him must be upon their guard for if his side which was always that of the english against the french should chance to be defeated there would be trouble in baxter’s place  for these opinions he may almost be said to have suffered  baptised and brought up in the church of scotland he had upon some conscientious scruple joined the communion of the baptists  like other nonconformists these were inclined to the liberal side in politics and at least in the beginning regarded buonaparte as a deliverer  from the time of his joining the spearmen thomas smith became in consequence a bugbear to his brethren in the faith   ‘they that take the sword shall perish with the sword’ they told him they gave him ‘no rest’ ‘his position became intolerable’ it was plain he must choose between his political and his religious tenets and in the last years of his life about 1812 he returned to the church of his fathers  august 1786 was the date of his chief advancement when having designed a system of oil lights to take the place of the primitive coal fires before in use he was dubbed engineer to the newlyformed board of northern lighthouses  not only were his fortunes bettered by the appointment but he was introduced to a new and wider field for the exercise of his abilities and a new way of life highly agreeable to his active constitution  he seems to have rejoiced in the long journeys and to have combined them with the practice of field sports  ‘a tall stout man coming ashore with his gun over his arm’—so he was described to my father—the only description that has come down to me by a lightkeeper old in the service  nor did this change come alone  on the 9th july of the same year thomas smith had been left for the second time a widower as he was still but thirtythree years old prospering in his affairs newly advanced in the world and encumbered at the time with a family of children five in number it was natural that he should entertain the notion of another wife  expeditious in business he was no less so in his choice and it was not later than june 1787—for my grandfather is described as still in his fifteenth year—that he married the widow of alan stevenson  the perilous experiment of bringing together two families for once succeeded  mr smith’s two eldest daughters jean and janet fervent in piety unwearied in kind deeds were well qualified both to appreciate and to attract the stepmother and her son on the other hand seems to have found immediate favour in the eyes of mr smith  it is perhaps easy to exaggerate the readymade resemblances the tired woman must have done much to fashion girls who were under ten the man lusty and opinionated must have stamped a strong impression on the boy of fifteen but the cleavage of the family was too marked the identity of character and interest produced between the two men on the one hand and the three women on the other was too complete to have been the result of influence alone  particular bonds of union must have preexisted on each side and there is no doubt that the man and the boy met with common ambitions and a common bent to the practice of that which had not so long before acquired the name of civil engineering  for the profession which is now so thronged famous and influential was then a thing of yesterday  my grandfather had an anecdote of smeaton probably learned from john clerk of eldin their common friend  smeaton was asked by the duke of argyll to visit the west highland coast for a professional purpose  he refused appalled it seems by the rough travelling  ‘you can recommend some other fit person’ asked the duke ‘no’ said smeaton ‘i’m sorry i can’t’  ‘what’ cried the duke ‘a profession with only one man in it  pray who taught you’  ‘why’ said smeaton ‘i believe i may say i was selftaught an’t please your grace’ smeaton at the date of thomas smith’s third marriage was yet living and as the one had grown to the new profession from his place at the instrumentmaker’s the other was beginning to enter it by the way of his trade  the engineer of today is confronted with a library of acquired results tables and formulae to the value of folios full have been calculated and recorded and the student finds everywhere in front of him the footprints of the pioneers  in the eighteenth century the field was largely unexplored the engineer must read with his own eyes the face of nature he arose a volunteer from the workshop or the mill to undertake works which were at once inventions and adventures  it was not a science then—it was a living art and it visibly grew under the eyes and between the hands of its practitioners  the charm of such an occupation was strongly felt by stepfather and stepson  it chanced that thomas smith was a reformer the superiority of his proposed lamp and reflectors over open fires of coal secured his appointment and no sooner had he set his hand to the task than the interest of that employment mastered him  the vacant stage on which he was to act and where all had yet to be created—the greatness of the difficulties the smallness of the means intrusted him—would rouse a man of his disposition like a call to battle  the lad introduced by marriage under his roof was of a character to sympathise the public usefulness of the service would appeal to his judgment the perpetual need for fresh expedients stimulate his ingenuity  and there was another attraction which in the younger man at least appealed to and perhaps first aroused a profound and enduring sentiment of romance i mean the attraction of the life  the seas into which his labours carried the new engineer were still scarce charted the coasts still dark his way on shore was often far beyond the convenience of any road the isles in which he must sojourn were still partly savage  he must toss much in boats he must often adventure on horseback by the dubious bridletrack through unfrequented wildernesses he must sometimes plant his lighthouse in the very camp of wreckers and he was continually enforced to the vicissitudes of outdoor life  the joy of my grandfather in this career was strong as the love of woman  it lasted him through youth and manhood it burned strong in age and at the approach of death his last yearning was to renew these loved experiences  what he felt himself he continued to attribute to all around him  and to this supposed sentiment in others i find him continually almost pathetically appealing often in vain  snared by these interests the boy seems to have become almost at once the eager confidant and adviser of his new connection the church if he had ever entertained the prospect very warmly faded from his view and at the age of nineteen i find him already in a post of some authority superintending the construction of the lighthouse on the isle of little cumbrae in the firth of clyde  the change of aim seems to have caused or been accompanied by a change of character  it sounds absurd to couple the name of my grandfather with the word indolence but the lad who had been destined from the cradle to the church and who had attained the age of fifteen without acquiring more than a moderate knowledge of latin was at least no unusual student  and from the day of his charge at little cumbrae he steps before us what he remained until the end a man of the most zealous industry greedy of occupation greedy of knowledge a stern husband of time a reader a writer unflagging in his task of selfimprovement  thenceforward his summers were spent directing works and ruling workmen now in uninhabited now in halfsavage islands his winters were set apart first at the andersonian institution then at the university of edinburgh to improve himself in mathematics chemistry natural history agriculture moral philosophy and logic a bearded student—although no doubt scrupulously shaved  i find one reference to his years in class which will have a meaning for all who have studied in scottish universities  he mentions a recommendation made by the professor of logic  ‘the highschool men’ he writes ‘and bearded men like myself were all attention’  if my grandfather were throughout life a thought too studious of the art of getting on much must be forgiven to the bearded and belated student who looked across with a sense of difference at ‘the highschool men’  here was a gulf to be crossed but already he could feel that he had made a beginning and that must have been a proud hour when he devoted his earliest earnings to the repayment of the charitable foundation in which he had received the rudiments of knowledge  in yet another way he followed the example of his fatherinlaw and from 1794 to 1807 when the affairs of the bell rock made it necessary for him to resign he served in different corps of volunteers  in the last of these he rose to a position of distinction no less than captain of the grenadier company and his colonel in accepting his resignation entreated he would do them ‘the favour of continuing as an honorary member of a corps which has been so much indebted for your zeal and exertions’  to very pious women the men of the house are apt to appear worldly  the wife as she puts on her new bonnet before church is apt to sigh over that assiduity which enabled her husband to pay the milliner’s bill  and in the household of the smiths and stevensons the women were not only extremely pious but the men were in reality a trifle worldly  religious they both were conscious like all scots of the fragility and unreality of that scene in which we play our uncomprehended parts like all scots realising daily and hourly the sense of another will than ours and a perpetual direction in the affairs of life  but the current of their endeavours flowed in a more obvious channel  they had got on so far to get on further was their next ambition—to gather wealth to rise in society to leave their descendants higher than themselves to be in some sense among the founders of families  scott was in the same town nourishing similar dreams  but in the eyes of the women these dreams would be foolish and idolatrous  i have before me some volumes of old letters addressed to mrs smith and the two girls her favourites which depict in a strong light their characters and the society in which they moved      ‘my very dear and much esteemed friend’ writes one correspondent     ‘this day being the anniversary of our acquaintance i feel inclined     to address you but where shall i find words to express the fealings     of a graitful heart first to the lord who graiciously inclined you     on this day last year to notice an afflicted strainger providentially     cast in your way far from any earthly friend     methinks i shall     hear him say unto you “inasmuch as ye shewed kindness to my     afflicted handmaiden ye did it unto me”’  this is to jean but the same afflicted lady wrote indifferently to jean to janet and to ms smith whom she calls ‘my edinburgh mother’  it is plain the three were as one person moving to acts of kindness like the graces inarmed  too much stress must not be laid on the style of this correspondence clarinda survived not far away and may have met the ladies on the calton hill and many of the writers appear underneath the conventions of the period to be genuinely moved  but what unpleasantly strikes a reader is that these devout unfortunates found a revenue in their devotion  it is everywhere the same tale on the side of the softhearted ladies substantial acts of help on the side of the correspondents affection italics texts ecstasies and imperfect spelling  when a midwife is recommended not at all for proficiency in her important art but because she has ‘a sister whom i the correspondent esteem and respect and who is a spiritual daughter of my hond father in the gosple’ the mask seems to be torn off and the wages of godliness appear too openly  capacity is a secondary matter in a midwife temper in a servant affection in a daughter and the repetition of a shibboleth fulfils the law  common decency is at times forgot in the same page with the most sanctified advice and aspiration thus i am introduced to a correspondent who appears to have been at the time the housekeeper at invermay and who writes to condole with my grandmother in a season of distress  for nearly half a sheet she keeps to the point with an excellent discretion in language then suddenly breaks out      ‘it was fully my intention to have left this at martinmass but the     lord fixes the bounds of our habitation  i have had more need of     patience in my situation here than in any other partly from the very     violent unsteady deceitful temper of the mistress of the family     and also from the state of the house  it was in a train of repair     when i came here two years ago and is still in confusion  there is     above six thousand pounds’ worth of furniture come from london to be     put up when the rooms are completely finished and then woe be to     the person who is housekeeper at invermay’  and by the tail of the document which is torn i see she goes on to ask the bereaved family to seek her a new place  it is extraordinary that people should have been so deceived in so careless an impostor that a few sprinkled ‘god willings’ should have blinded them to the essence of this venomous letter and that they should have been at the pains to bind it in with others many of them highly touching in their memorial of harrowing days  but the good ladies were without guile and without suspicion they were victims marked for the axe and the religious impostors snuffed up the wind as they drew near  i have referred above to my grandmother it was no slip of the pen for by an extraordinary arrangement in which it is hard not to suspect the managing hand of a mother jean smith became the wife of robert stevenson  mrs smith had failed in her design to make her son a minister and she saw him daily more immersed in business and worldly ambition  one thing remained that she might do she might secure for him a godly wife that great means of sanctification and she had two under her hand trained by herself her dear friends and daughters both in law and love—jean and janet  jean’s complexion was extremely pale janet’s was florid my grandmother’s nose was straight my greataunt’s aquiline but by the sound of the voice not even a son was able to distinguish one from other  the marriage of a man of twentyseven and a girl of twenty who have lived for twelve years as brother and sister is difficult to conceive  it took place however and thus in 1799 the family was still further cemented by the union of a representative of the male or worldly element with one of the female and devout  this essential difference remained unbridged yet never diminished the strength of their relation  my grandfather pursued his design of advancing in the world with some measure of success rose to distinction in his calling grew to be the familiar of members of parliament judges of the court of session and ‘landed gentlemen’ learned a ready address had a flow of interesting conversation and when he was referred to as ‘a highly respectable bourgeois’ resented the description  my grandmother remained to the end devout and unambitious occupied with her bible her children and her house easily shocked and associating largely with a clique of godly parasites  i do not know if she called in the midwife already referred to but the principle on which that lady was recommended she accepted fully  the cook was a godly woman the butcher a christian man and the table suffered  the scene has been often described to me of my grandfather sawing with darkened countenance at some indissoluble joint—‘preserve me my dear what kind of a reedy stringy beast is this’—of the joint removed the pudding substituted and uncovered and of my grandmother’s anxious glance and hasty deprecatory comment ‘just mismanaged’  yet with the invincible obstinacy of soft natures she would adhere to the godly woman and the christian man or find others of the same kidney to replace them  one of her confidants had once a narrow escape an unwieldy old woman she had fallen from an outside stair in a close of the old town and my grandmother rejoiced to communicate the providential circumstance that a baker had been passing underneath with his bread upon his head  ‘i would like to know what kind of providence the baker thought it’ cried my grandfather  but the sally must have been unique  in all else that i have heard or read of him so far from criticising he was doing his utmost to honour and even to emulate his wife’s pronounced opinions  in the only letter which has come to my hand of thomas smith’s i find him informing his wife that he was ‘in time for afternoon church’ similar assurances or cognate excuses abound in the correspondence of robert stevenson and it is comical and pretty to see the two generations paying the same court to a female piety more highly strung thomas smith to the mother of robert stevenson—robert stevenson to the daughter of thomas smith  and if for once my grandfather suffered himself to be hurried by his sense of humour and justice into that remark about the case of providence and the baker i should be sorry for any of his children who should have stumbled into the same attitude of criticism  in the apocalyptic style of the housekeeper of invermay woe be to that person  but there was no fear husband and sons all entertained for the pious tender soul the same chivalrous and moved affection  i have spoken with one who remembered her and who had been the intimate and equal of her sons and i found this witness had been struck as i had been with a sense of disproportion between the warmth of the adoration felt and the nature of the woman whether as described or observed  she diligently read and marked her bible she was a tender nurse she had a sense of humour under strong control she talked and found some amusement at her or rather at her husband’s dinnerparties  it is conceivable that even my grandmother was amenable to the seductions of dress at least i find her husband inquiring anxiously about ‘the gowns from glasgow’ and very careful to describe the toilet of the princess charlotte whom he had seen in church ‘in a pelisse and bonnet of the same colour of cloth as the boys’ dress jackets trimmed with blue satin ribbons the hat or bonnet mr spittal said was a parisian slouch and had a plume of three white feathers’  but all this leaves a blank impression and it is rather by reading backward in these old musty letters which have moved me now to laughter and now to impatience that i glean occasional glimpses of how she seemed to her contemporaries and trace at work in her queer world of godly and grateful parasites a mobile and responsive nature  fashion moulds us and particularly women deeper than we sometimes think but a little while ago and in some circles women stood or fell by the degree of their appreciation of old pictures in the early years of the century and surely with more reason a character like that of my grandmother warmed charmed and subdued like a strain of music the hearts of the men of her own household  and there is little doubt that mrs smith as she looked on at the domestic life of her son and her stepdaughter and numbered the heads in their increasing nursery must have breathed fervent thanks to her creator  yet this was to be a family unusually tried it was not for nothing that one of the godly women saluted miss janet smith as ‘a veteran in affliction’ and they were all before middle life experienced in that form of service  by the 1st of january 1808 besides a pair of stillborn twins children had been born and still survived to the young couple  by the 11th two were gone by the 28th a third had followed and the two others were still in danger  in the letters of a former nurserymaid—i give her name jean mitchell honoris causa—we are enabled to feel even at this distance of time some of the bitterness of that month of bereavement      ‘i have this day received’ she writes to miss janet ‘the melancholy     news of my dear babys’ deaths  my heart is like to break for my dear     mrs stevenson  o may she be supported on this trying occasion  i     hope her other three babys will be spared to her  o miss smith did     i think when i parted from my sweet babys that i never was to see     them more’  ‘i received’ she begins her next ‘the mournful news of     my dear jessie’s death  i also received the hair of my three sweet     babys which i will preserve as dear to their memorys and as a token     of mr and mrs stevenson’s friendship and esteem  at my leisure     hours when the children are in bed they occupy all my thoughts i     dream of them  about two weeks ago i dreamed that my sweet little     jessie came running to me in her usual way and i took her in my     arms  o my dear babys were mortal eyes permitted to see them in     heaven we would not repine nor grieve for their loss’  by the 29th of february the reverend john campbell a man of obvious sense and human value but hateful to the present biographer because he wrote so many letters and conveyed so little information summed up this first period of affliction in a letter to miss smith ‘your dear sister but a little while ago had a full nursery and the dear blooming creatures sitting around her table filled her breast with hope that one day they should fill active stations in society and become an ornament in the church below  but ah’  near a hundred years ago these little creatures ceased to be and for not much less a period the tears have been dried  and to this day looking in these stitched sheaves of letters we hear the sound of many softhearted women sobbing for the lost  never was such a massacre of the innocents teething and chincough and scarlet fever and smallpox ran the round and little lillies and smiths and stevensons fell like moths about a candle and nearly all the sympathetic correspondents deplore and recall the little losses of their own  ‘it is impossible to describe the heavnly looks of the dear babe the three last days of his life’ writes mrs laurie to mrs smith  ‘never—never my dear aunt could i wish to eface the rememberance of this dear child  never never my dear aunt’ and so soon the memory of the dead and the dust of the survivors are buried in one grave  there was another death in 1812 it passes almost unremarked a single funeral seemed but a small event to these ‘veterans in affliction’ and by 1816 the nursery was full again  seven little hopefuls enlivened the house some were growing up to the elder girl my grandfather already wrote notes in current hand at the tail of his letters to his wife and to the elder boys he had begun to print with laborious care sheets of childish gossip and pedantic applications  here for instance under date of 26th may 1816 is part of a mythological account of london with a moral for the three gentlemen ‘messieurs alan robert and james stevenson’ to whom the document is addressed      ‘there are many prisons here like bridewell for like other large     towns there are many bad men here as well as many good men  the     natives of london are in general not so tall and strong as the people     of edinburgh because they have not so much pure air and instead of     taking porridge they eat cakes made with sugar and plums  here you     have thousands of carts to draw timber thousands of coaches to take     you to all parts of the town and thousands of boats to sail on the     river thames  but you must have money to pay otherwise you can get     nothing  now the way to get money is become clever men and men of     education by being good scholars’  from the same absence he writes to his wife on a sunday      ‘it is now about eight o’clock with me and i imagine you to be busy     with the young folks hearing the questions anglicé catechism     and indulging the boys with a chapter from the large bible with     their interrogations and your answers in the soundest doctrine  i     hope james is getting his verse as usual and that mary is not     forgetting her little hymn  while jeannie will be reading     wotherspoon or some other suitable and instructive book i presume     our friend aunt mary will have just arrived with the news of a     throng kirk a crowded church and a great sermon  you may mention     with my compliments to my mother that i was at st paul’s today     and attended a very excellent service with mr james lawrie  the     text was “examine and see that ye be in the faith”’  a twinkle of humour lights up this evocation of the distant scene—the humour of happy men and happy homes  yet it is penned upon the threshold of fresh sorrow  james and mary—he of the verse and she of the hymn—did not much more than survive to welcome their returning father  on the 25th one of the godly women writes to janet      ‘my dearest beloved madam when i last parted from you you was so     affected with your affliction you or i could think of nothing     else  but on saturday when i went to inquire after your health how     was i startled to hear that dear james was gone  ah what is this     my dear benefactors doing so much good to many to the lord     suddenly to be deprived of their most valued comforts  i was thrown     into great perplexity could do nothing but murmur why these things     were done to such a family  i could not rest but at midnight     whether spoken or not it was presented to my mind—“those whom ye     deplore are walking with me in white”  i conclude from this the lord     saying to sweet mrs stevenson “i gave them to be brought up for me     well done good and faithful they are fully prepared and now i must     present them to my father and your father to my god and your god”’  it would be hard to lay on flattery with a more sure and daring hand  i quote it as a model of a letter of condolence be sure it would console very different perhaps quite as welcome is this from a lighthouse inspector to my grandfather      ‘in reading your letter the trickling tear ran down ray cheeks in     silent sorrow for your departed dear ones my sweet little friends     well do i remember and you will call to mind their little innocent     and interesting stories  often have they come round me and taken me     by the hand but alas  i am no more destined to behold them’  the child who is taken becomes canonised and the looks of the homeliest babe seem in the retrospect ‘heavenly the three last days of his life’ but it appears that james and mary had indeed been children more than usually engaging a record was preserved a long while in the family of their remarks and ‘little innocent and interesting stories’ and the blow and the blank were the more sensible  early the next month robert stevenson must proceed upon his voyage of inspection part by land part by sea  he left his wife plunged in low spirits the thought of his loss and still more of her concern was continually present in his mind and he draws in his letters home an interesting picture of his family relations                        ‘windygates inn monday postmark july 16th      ‘my dearest jeannie—while the people of the inn are getting me a     little bit of something to eat i sit down to tell you that i had a     most excellent passage across the water and got to wemyss at     midday  i hope the children will be very good and that robert will     take a course with you to learn his latin lessons daily he may     however read english in company  let them have strawberries on     saturdays’                                                ‘westhaven 17th july      ‘i have been occupied today at the harbour of

tons  at the towns of     macduff banff and portsoy many of the houses are built of marble     and the rocks on this part of the coast or seaside are marble  but     my dear boys unless marble be

seen was a considerable amusement  but my dear     you are all much in my thoughts and many are the objects which     recall the recollection of our tender and engaging children we have     so recently lost  we must not however repine  i could not for a     moment wish any change of circumstances in their case and in every     comparative view of their state i see the lord’s goodness in     removing them from an evil world to an abode of bliss and i must     earnestly hope that you may be enabled to take such a view of this     affliction as to live in the happy prospect of our all meeting again     to part no more—and that under such considerations you are getting up     your spirits  i wish you would walk about and by all means go to     town and do not sit much at home’

  variety has a tendency to occupy the mind and to keep it from     brooding too much upon one subject  sensibility and tenderness are     certainly two of the most interesting and pleasing qualities of the     mind  these qualities are also none of the least of the many     endearingments of the female character  but if that kind of sympathy     and pleasing melancholy which is familiar to us under distress be     much indulged it becomes habitual and takes such a hold of the mind     as to absorb all the other affections and unfit us for the duties     and proper enjoyments of life  resignation sinks into a kind of     peevish discontent  i am far however from thinking there is the     least danger of this in your case my dear for you have been on all     occasions enabled to look upon the fortunes of this life as under the     direction of a higher power and have always preserved that propriety     and consistency of conduct in all circumstances which endears your     example to your family in particular and to your friends  i am     therefore my dear for you to go out much and to go to the house     upstairs he means to go upstairs in the house to visit the place     of the dead children and to put yourself in the way of the visits     of your friends  i wish you would call on the miss grays and it     would be a good thing upon a saturday to dine with my mother and     take meggy and all the family with you and let them have their     strawberries in town  the tickets of one of the oldfashioned     coaches would take you all up and if the evening were

at the inn captain wemyss accompanied me on     board and we sailed about eight last night  the wind at present     being rather a beating one i think i shall have an opportunity of     standing into

with     regret’  strange that after his long experience my grandfather should have learned so little of the attitude and even the dialect of the spirituallyminded that after fortyfour years in a most religious circle he could drop without sense of incongruity from a period of accepted phrases to ‘trust his wife was getting up her spirits’ or think to reassure her as to the character of captain wemyss by mentioning that he had read prayers on the deck of his frigate ‘agreeably to the articles of war’  yet there is no doubt—and it is one of the most agreeable features of the kindly series—that he was doing his best to please and there is little doubt that he succeeded  almost all my grandfather’s private letters have been destroyed  this correspondence has not only been preserved entire but stitched up in the same covers with the works of the godly women the reverend john campbell and the painful mrs ogle  i did not think to mention the good dame but she comes in usefully as an example  amongst the treasures of the ladies of my family her letters have been honoured with a volume to themselves  i read about a half of them myself then handed over the task to one of stauncher resolution with orders to communicate any fact that should be found to illuminate these pages  not one was found it was her only art to communicate by post secondrate sermons at secondhand and such i take it was the correspondence in which my grandmother delighted  if i am right that of robert stevenson with his quaint smack of the contemporary ‘sandford and merton’ his interest in the whole page of experience his perpetual quest and fine scent of all that seems romantic to a boy his needless pomp of language his excellent good sense his unfeigned unstained unwearied human kindliness would seem to her in a comparison dry and trivial and worldly  and if these letters were by an exception cherished and preserved it would be for one or both of two reasons—because they dealt with and were bittersweet reminders of a time of sorrow or because she was pleased perhaps touched by the writer’s guileless efforts to seem spirituallyminded  after this date there were two more births and two more deaths so that the number of the family remained unchanged in all five children survived to reach maturity and to outlive their parents     chapter ii the service of the northern lights   i   it were hard to imagine a contrast more sharply defined than that between the lives of the men and women of this family the one so chambered so centred in the affections and the sensibilities the other so active healthy and expeditious  from may to november thomas smith and robert stevenson were on the mail in the saddle or at sea and my grandfather in particular seems to have been possessed with a demon of activity in travel  in 1802 by direction of the northern lighthouse board he had visited the coast of england from st bees in cumberland and round by the scilly islands to some place undecipherable by me in all a distance of 2500 miles  in 1806 i find him starting ‘on a tour round the south coast of england from the humber to the severn’  peace was not long declared ere he found means to visit holland where he was in time to see in the navyyard at helvoetsluys ‘about twenty of bonaparte’s english flotilla lying in a state of decay the object of curiosity to englishmen’  by 1834 he seems to have been acquainted with the coast of france from dieppe to bordeaux and a main part of his duty as engineer to the board of northern lights was one round of dangerous and laborious travel  in 1786 when thomas smith first received the appointment the extended and formidable coast of scotland was lighted at a single point—the isle of may in the jaws of the firth of forth where on a tower already a hundred and fifty years old an open coalfire blazed in an iron chauffer  the whole archipelago thus nightly plunged in darkness was shunned by seagoing vessels and the favourite courses were north about shetland and west about st kilda  when the board met four new lights formed the extent of their intentions—kinnaird head in aberdeenshire at the eastern elbow of the coast north ronaldsay in orkney to keep the north and guide ships passing to the south’ard of shetland island glass on harris to mark the inner shore of the hebrides and illuminate the navigation of the minch and the mull of kintyre  these works were to be attempted against obstacles material and financial that might have staggered the most bold  smith had no ship at his command till 1791 the roads in those outlandish quarters where his business lay were scarce passable when they existed and the tower on the mull of kintyre stood eleven months unlighted while the apparatus toiled and foundered by the way among rocks and mosses  not only had towers to be built and apparatus transplanted the supply of oil must be maintained and the men fed in the same inaccessible and distant scenes a whole service with its routine and hierarchy had to be called out of nothing and a new trade that of lightkeeper to be taught recruited and organised  the funds of the board were at the first laughably inadequate  they embarked on their career on a loan of twelve hundred pounds and their income in 1789 after relief by a fresh act of parliament amounted to less than three hundred  it must be supposed that the thoughts of thomas smith in these early years were sometimes coloured with despair and since he built and lighted one tower after another and created and bequeathed to his successors the elements of an excellent administration it may be conceded that he was not after all an unfortunate choice for a first engineer  war added fresh complications  in 1794 smith came ‘very near to be taken’ by a french squadron  in 1813 robert stevenson was cruising about the neighbourhood of cape wrath in the immediate fear of commodore rogers  the men and especially the sailors of the lighthouse service must be protected by a medal and ticket from the brutal activity of the pressgang  and the zeal of volunteer patriots was at times embarrassing      ‘i set off on foot’ writes my grandfather ‘for marazion a town at     the head of mount’s bay where i was in hopes of getting a boat to     freight  i had just got that length and was making the necessary     inquiry when a young man accompanied by several idlelooking     fellows came up to me and in a hasty tone said “sir in the king’s     name i seize your person and papers”  to which i replied that i     should be glad to see his authority and know the reason of an     address so abrupt  he told me the want of time prevented his taking     regular steps but that it would be necessary for me to return to     penzance as i was suspected of being a french spy  i proposed to     submit my papers to the nearest justice of peace who was immediately     applied to and came to the inn where i was  he seemed to be greatly     agitated and quite at a loss how to proceed  the complaint     preferred against me was “that i had examined the longships     lighthouse with the most minute attention and was no less particular     in my inquiries at the keepers of the lighthouse regarding the sunk     rocks lying off the land’s end with the sets of the currents and     tides along the coast that i seemed particularly to regret the     situation of the rocks called the seven stones and the loss of a     beacon which the trinity board had caused to be fixed on the wolf     rock that i had taken notes of the bearings of several sunk rocks     and a drawing of the lighthouse and of cape cornwall  further that     i had refused the honour of lord edgecombe’s invitation to dinner     offering as an apology that i had some particular business on hand”’  my grandfather produced in answer his credentials and letter of credit but the justice after perusing them ‘very gravely observed that they were “musty bits of paper”’ and proposed to maintain the arrest  some more enlightened magistrates at penzance relieved him of suspicion and left him at liberty to pursue his journey—‘which i did with so much eagerness’ he adds ‘that i gave the two coal lights on the lizard only a very transient look’  lighthouse operations in scotland differed essentially in character from those in england  the english coast is in comparison a habitable homely place well supplied with towns the scottish presents hundreds of miles of savage islands and desolate moors  the parliamentary committee of 1834 profoundly ignorant of this distinction insisted with my grandfather that the work at the various stations should be let out on contract ‘in the neighbourhood’ where sheep and deer and gulls and cormorants and a few ragged gillies perhaps crouching in a beehive house made up the only neighbours  in such situations repairs and improvements could only be overtaken by collecting as my grandfather expressed it a few ‘lads’ placing them under charge of a foreman and despatching them about the coast as occasion served  the particular danger of these seas increased the difficulty  the course of the lighthouse tender lies amid ironbound coasts among tideraces the whirlpools of the pentland firth flocks of islands flocks of reefs many of them uncharted  the aid of steam was not yet  at first in random coasting sloop and afterwards in the cutter belonging to the service the engineer must ply and run amongst these multiplied dangers and sometimes late into the stormy autumn  for pages together my grandfather’s diary preserves a record of these rude experiences of hard winds and rough seas and of ‘the trysail and stormjib those old friends which i never like to see’  they do not tempt to quotation but it was the man’s element in which he lived and delighted to live and some specimen must be presented  on friday september 10th 1830 the regent lying in lerwick bay we have this entry ‘the gale increases with continued rain’  on the morrow saturday 11th the weather appeared to moderate and they put to sea only to be driven by evening into levenswick  there they lay ‘rolling much’ with both anchors ahead and the square yard on deck till the morning of saturday 18th saturday and sunday they were plying to the southward with a ‘strong breeze and a heavy sea’ and on sunday evening anchored in otterswick ‘monday 20th it blows so fresh that we have no communication with the shore  we see mr rome on the beach but we cannot communicate with him it blows “mere fire” as the sailors express it’  and for three days more the diary goes on with tales of davits unshipped high seas strong gales from the southward and the ship driven to refuge in kirkwall or deer sound  i have many a passage before me to transcribe in which my grandfather draws himself as a man of minute and anxious exactitude about details  it must not be forgotten that these voyages in the tender were the particular pleasure and reward of his existence that he had in him a reserve of romance which carried him delightedly over these hardships and perils that to him it was ‘great gain’ to be eight nights and seven days in the savage bay of levenswick—to read a book in the much agitated cabin—to go on deck and hear the gale scream in his ears and see the landscape dark with rain and the ship plunge at her two anchors—and to turn in at night and wake again at morning in his narrow berth to the glamorous and continued voices of the gale  his perils and escapes were beyond counting  i shall only refer to two the first because of the impression made upon himself the second from the incidental picture it presents of the north islanders  on the 9th october 1794 he took passage from orkney in the sloop elizabeth of stromness  she made a fair passage till within view of kinnaird head where as she was becalmed some three miles in the offing and wind seemed to threaten from the southeast the captain landed him to continue his journey more expeditiously ashore  a gale immediately followed and the elizabeth was driven back to orkney and lost with all hands  the second escape i have been in the habit of hearing related by an eyewitness my own father from the earliest days of childhood  on a september night the regent lay in the pentland firth in a fog and a violent and windless swell  it was still dark when they were alarmed by the sound of breakers and an anchor was immediately let go  the peep of dawn discovered them swinging in desperate proximity to the isle of swona 54a and the surf bursting close under their stern  there was in this place a hamlet of the inhabitants fisherfolk and wreckers their huts stood close about the head of the beach  all slept the doors were closed and there was no smoke and the anxious watchers on board ship seemed to contemplate a village of the dead  it was thought possible to launch a boat and tow the regent from her place of danger and with this view a signal of distress was made and a gun fired with a redhot poker from the galley  its detonation awoke the sleepers  door after door was opened and in the grey light of the morning fisher after fisher was seen to come forth yawning and stretching himself nightcap on head fisher after fisher i wrote and my pen tripped for it should rather stand wrecker after wrecker  there was no emotion no animation it scarce seemed any interest not a hand was raised but all callously awaited the harvest of the sea and their children stood by their side and waited also  to the end of his life my father remembered that amphitheatre of placid spectators on the beach and with a special and natural animosity the boys of his own age  but presently a light air sprang up and filled the sails and fainted and filled them again and little by little the regent fetched way against the swell and clawed off shore into the turbulent firth  the purpose of these voyages was to effect a landing on open beaches or among shelving rocks not for persons only but for coals and food and the fragile furniture of lightrooms  it was often impossible  in 1831 i find my grandfather ‘hovering for a week’ about the pentland skerries for a chance to land and it was almost always difficult  much knack and enterprise were early developed among the seamen of the service their management of boats is to this day a matter of admiration and i find my grandfather in his diary depicting the nature of their excellence in one happily descriptive phrase when he remarks that captain soutar had landed ‘the small stores and nine casks of oil with all the activity of a smuggler’  and it was one thing to land another to get on board again  i have here a passage from the diary where it seems to have been touchandgo  ‘i landed at tarbetness on the eastern side of the point in a mere gale or blast of wind from westsouthwest at 2 pm  it blew so fresh that the captain in a kind of despair went off to the ship leaving myself and the steward ashore  while i was in the lightroom i felt it shaking and waving not with the tremor of the bell rock but with the waving of a tree  this the lightkeepers seemed to be quite familiar to the principal keeper remarking that “it was very pleasant” perhaps meaning interesting or curious  the captain worked the vessel into smooth water with admirable dexterity and i got on board again about 6 pm from the other side of the point’  but not even the dexterity of soutar could prevail always and my grandfather must at times have been left in strange berths and with but rude provision  i may instance the case of my father who was stormbound three days upon an islet sleeping in the uncemented and unchimneyed houses of the islanders and subsisting on a diet of nettlesoup and lobsters  the name of soutar has twice escaped my pen and i feel i owe him a vignette  soutar first attracted notice as mate of a praam at the bell rock and rose gradually to be captain of the regent  he was active admirably skilled in his trade and a man incapable of fear  once in london he fell among a gang of confidencemen naturally deceived by his rusticity and his prodigious accent  they plied him with drink—a hopeless enterprise for soutar could not be made drunk they proposed cards and soutar would not play  at last one of them regarding him with a formidable countenance inquired if he were not frightened  ‘i’m no’ very easy fleyed’ replied the captain  and the rooks withdrew after some easier pigeon  so many perils shared and the partial familiarity of so many voyages had given this man a stronghold in my grandfather’s estimation and there is no doubt but he had the art to court and please him with much hypocritical skill  he usually dined on sundays in the cabin  he used to come down daily after dinner for a glass of port or whisky often in his full rig of sou’wester oilskins and long boots and i have often heard it described how insinuatingly he carried himself on these appearances artfully combining the extreme of deference with a blunt and seamanlike demeanour  my father and uncles with the devilish penetration of the boy were far from being deceived and my father indeed was favoured with an objectlesson not to be mistaken  he had crept one rainy night into an applebarrel on deck and from this place of ambush overheard soutar and a comrade conversing in their oilskins the smooth sycophant of the cabin had wholly disappeared and the boy listened with wonder to a vulgar and truculent ruffian  of soutar i may say tantum vidi having met him in the leith docks now more than thirty years ago when he abounded in the praises of my grandfather encouraged me in the most admirable manner to pursue his footprints and left impressed for ever on my memory the image of his own bardolphian nose he died not long after  the engineer was not only exposed to the hazards of the sea he must often ford his way by land to remote and scarce accessible places beyond reach of the mail or the postchaise beyond even the tracery of the bridlepath and guided by natives across bog and heather  up to 1807 my grandfather seems to have travelled much on horseback but he then gave up the idea—‘such’ he writes with characteristic emphasis and capital letters ‘is the plague of baiting’  he was a good pedestrian at the age of fiftyeight i find him covering seventeen miles over the moors of the mackay country in less than seven hours and that is not bad travelling for a scramble  the piece of country traversed was already a familiar track being that between loch eriboll and cape wrath and i think i can scarce do better than reproduce from the diary some traits of his first visit  the tender lay in loch eriboll by five in the morning they sat down to breakfast on board by six they were ashore—my grandfather mr slight an assistant and soutar of the jolly nose and had been taken in charge by two young gentlemen of the neighbourhood and a pair of gillies  about noon they reached the kyle of durness and passed the ferry  by halfpast three they were at cape wrath—not yet known by the emphatic abbreviation of ‘the cape’—and beheld upon all sides of them unfrequented shores an expanse of desert moor and the highpiled western ocean  the site of the tower was chosen  perhaps it is by inheritance of blood but i know few things more inspiriting than this location of a lighthouse in a designated space of heather and air through which the seabirds are still flying  by 9 pm the return journey had brought them again to the shores of the kyle  the night was dirty and as the sea was high and the ferryboat small soutar and mr stevenson were left on the far side while the rest of the party embarked and were received into the darkness  they made in fact a safe though an alarming passage but the ferryman refused to repeat the adventure and my grandfather and the captain long paced the beach impatient for their turn to pass and tormented with rising anxiety as to the fate of their companions  at length they sought the shelter of a shepherd’s house  ‘we had miserable upputting’ the diary continues ‘and on both sides of the ferry much anxiety of mind  our beds were clean straw and but for the circumstance of the boat i should have slept as soundly as ever i did after a walk through moss and mire of sixteen hours’  to go round the lights even today is to visit past centuries  the tide of tourists that flows yearly in scotland vulgarising all where it approaches is still defined by certain barriers  it will be long ere there is a hotel at sumburgh or a hydropathic at cape wrath it will be long ere any charàbanc laden with tourists shall drive up to barra head or monach the island of the monks  they are farther from london than st petersburg and except for the towers sounding and shining all night with fogbells and the radiance of the lightroom glittering by day with the trivial brightness of white paint these island and moorland stations seem inaccessible to the civilisation of today and even to the end of my grandfather’s career the isolation was far greater  there ran no post at all in the long island from the lighthouse on barra head a boat must be sent for letters as far as tobermory between sixty and seventy miles of open sea and the posts of shetland which had surprised sir walter scott in 1814 were still unimproved in 1833 when my grandfather reported on the subject  the group contained at the time a population of 30000 souls and enjoyed a trade which had increased in twenty years sevenfold to between three and four thousand tons  yet the mails were despatched and received by chance coasting vessels at the rate of a penny a letter six and eight weeks often elapsed between opportunities and when a mail was to be made up sometimes at a moment’s notice the bellman was sent hastily through the streets of lerwick between shetland and orkney only seventy miles apart there was ‘no trade communication whatever’  such was the state of affairs only sixty years ago with the three largest clusters of the scottish archipelago and fortyseven years earlier when thomas smith began his rounds or fortytwo when robert stevenson became conjoined with him in these excursions the barbarism was deep the people sunk in superstition the circumstances of their life perhaps unique in history  lerwick and kirkwall like guam or the bay of islands were but barbarous ports where whalers called to take up and to return experienced seamen  on the outlying islands the clergy lived isolated thinking other thoughts dwelling in a different country from their parishioners like missionaries in the south seas  my grandfather’s unrivalled treasury of anecdote was never written down it embellished his talk while he yet was and died with him when he died and such as have been preserved relate principally to the islands of ronaldsay and sanday two of the orkney group  these bordered on one of the waterhighways of civilisation a great fleet passed annually in their view and of the shipwrecks of the world they were the scene and cause of a proportion wholly incommensurable to their size  in one year 1798 my grandfather found the remains of no fewer than five vessels on the isle of sanday which is scarcely twelve miles long      ‘hardly a year passed’ he writes ‘without instances of this kind     for owing to the projecting points of this strangely formed island     the lowness and whiteness of its eastern shores and the wonderful     manner in which the scanty patches of land are intersected with lakes     and pools of water it becomes even in daylight a deception and     has often been fatally mistaken for an open sea  it had even become     proverbial with some of the inhabitants to observe that “if wrecks     were to happen they might as well be sent to the poor isle of sanday     as anywhere else”  on this and the neighbouring islands the     inhabitants had certainly had their share of wrecked goods for the     eye is presented with these melancholy remains in almost every form     for example although quarries are to be met with generally in these     islands and the stones are very suitable for building dykes     anglicé walls yet instances occur of the land being enclosed     even to a considerable extent with shiptimbers  the author has     actually seen a park anglicé meadow paled round chiefly with     cedarwood and mahogany from the wreck of a hondurasbuilt ship and     in one island after the wreck of a ship laden with wine the     inhabitants have been known to take claret to their barleymeal     porridge  on complaining to one of the pilots of the badness of his     boat’s sails he replied to the author with some degree of     pleasantry “had it been his will that you came na’ here wi’ your     lights we might ‘a’ had better sails to our boats and more o’ other     things”  it may further be mentioned that when some of lord dundas’s     farms are to be let in these islands a competition takes place for     the lease and it is bona fide understood that a much higher rent     is paid than the lands would otherwise give were it not for the     chance of making considerably by the agency and advantages attending     shipwrecks on the shores of the respective farms’  the people of north ronaldsay still spoke norse or rather mixed it with their english  the walls of their huts were built to a great thickness of rounded stones from the seabeach the roof flagged loaded with earth and perforated by a single hole for the escape of smoke  the grass grew beautifully green on the flat housetop where the family would assemble with their dogs and cats as on a pastoral lawn there were no windows and in my grandfather’s expression ‘there was really no demonstration of a house unless it were the diminutive door’  he once landed on ronaldsay with two friends  the inhabitants crowded and pressed so much upon the strangers that the bailiff or resident factor of the island blew with his oxhorn calling out to the natives to stand off and let the gentlemen come forward to the laird upon which one of the islanders as spokesman called out “god ha’e us man thou needsna mak’ sic a noise  it’s no’ every day we ha’e three hatted men on our isle”’  when the surveyor of taxes came for the first time perhaps to sanday and began in the king’s name to complain of the unconscionable swarms of dogs and to menace the inhabitants with taxation it chanced that my grandfather and his friend dr patrick neill were received by an old lady in a ronaldsay hut  her hut which was similar to the model described stood on a ness or point of land jutting into the sea  they were made welcome in the firelit cellar placed ‘in casey or strawworked chairs after the norwegian fashion with arms and a canopy overhead’ and given milk in a wooden dish  these hospitalities attended to the old lady turned at once to dr neill whom she took for the surveyor of taxes  ‘sir’ said she ‘gin ye’ll tell the king that i canna keep the ness free o’ the bangers sheep without twa hun’s and twa guid hun’s too he’ll pass me threa the tax on dugs’  this familiar confidence these traits of engaging simplicity are characters of a secluded people  mankind—and above all islanders—come very swiftly to a bearing and find very readily upon one convention or another a tolerable corporate life  the danger is to those from without who have not grown up from childhood in the islands but appear suddenly in that narrow horizon lifesized apparitions  for these no bond of humanity exists no feeling of kinship is awakened by their peril they will assist at a shipwreck like the fisherfolk of lunga as spectators and when the fatal scene is over and the beach strewn with dead bodies they will fence their fields with mahogany and after a decent grace sup claret to their porridge  it is not wickedness it is scarce evil it is only in its highest power the sense of isolation and the wise disinterestedness of feeble and poor races  think how many viking ships had sailed by these islands in the past how many vikings had landed and raised turmoil and broken up the barrows of the dead and carried off the wines of the living and blame them if you are able for that belief which may be called one of the parables of the devil’s gospel that a man rescued from the sea will prove the bane of his deliverer  it might be thought that my grandfather coming there unknown and upon an employment so hateful to the inhabitants must have run the hazard of his life  but this were to misunderstand  he came franked by the laird and the clergyman he was the king’s officer the work was ‘opened with prayer by the rev walter trail minister of the parish’ god and the king had decided it and the people of these pious islands bowed their heads  there landed indeed in north ronaldsay during the last decade of the eighteenth century a traveller whose life seems really to have been imperilled  a very little man of a swarthy complexion he came ashore exhausted and unshaved from a long boat passage and lay down to sleep in the home of the parish schoolmaster but he had been seen landing  the inhabitants had identified him for a pict as by some singular confusion of name they called the dark and dwarfish aboriginal people of the land  immediately the obscure ferment of a racehatred grown into a superstition began to work in their bosoms and they crowded about the house and the roomdoor with fearful whisperings  for some time the schoolmaster held them at bay and at last despatched a messenger to call my grandfather  he came he found the islanders beside themselves at this unwelcome resurrection of the dead and the detested he was shown as adminicular of testimony the traveller’s uncouth and thicksoled boots he argued and finding argument unavailing consented to enter the room and examine with his own eyes the sleeping pict  one glance was sufficient the man was now a missionary but he had been before that an edinburgh shopkeeper with whom my grandfather had dealt  he came forth again with this report and the folk of the island wholly relieved dispersed to their own houses  they were timid as sheep and ignorant as limpets that was all  but the lord deliver us from the tender mercies of a frightened flock  i will give two more instances of their superstition  when sir walter scott visited the stones of stennis my grandfather put in his pocket a hundredfoot line which he unfortunately lost      ‘some years afterwards’ he writes ‘one of my assistants on a visit     to the stones of stennis took shelter from a storm in a cottage close     by the lake and seeing a boxmeasuringline in the bole or sole of     the cottage window he asked the woman where she got this wellknown     professional appendage  she said “o sir ane of the bairns fand it     lang syne at the stanes and when drawing it out we took fright and     thinking it had belanged to the fairies we threw it into the bole     and it has layen there ever since”’  this is for the one the last shall be a sketch by the master hand of scott himself      ‘at the village of stromness on the orkney main island called     pomona lived in 1814 an aged dame called bessie millie who helped     out her subsistence by selling favourable winds to mariners  he was     a venturous master of a vessel who left the roadstead of stromness     without paying his offering to propitiate bessie millie  her fee was     extremely moderate being exactly sixpence for which she boiled her     kettle and gave the bark the advantage of her prayers for she     disclaimed all unlawful acts  the wind thus petitioned for was sure     she said to arrive though occasionally the mariners had to wait     some time for it  the woman’s dwelling and appearance were not     unbecoming her pretensions  her house which was on the brow of the     steep hill on which stromness is founded was only accessible by a     series of dirty and precipitous lanes and for exposure might have     been the abode of eolus himself in whose commodities the inhabitant     dealt  she herself was as she told us nearly one hundred years     old withered and dried up like a mummy  a claycoloured kerchief     folded round her neck corresponded in colour to her corpselike     complexion  two light blue eyes that gleamed with a lustre like that     of insanity an utterance of astonishing rapidity a nose and chin     that almost met together and a ghastly expression of cunning gave     her the effect of hecate  such was bessie millie to whom the     mariners paid a sort of tribute with a feeling between jest and     earnest’    ii   from about the beginning of the century up to 1807 robert stevenson was in partnership with thomas smith  in the lastnamed year the partnership was dissolved thomas smith returning to his business and my grandfather becoming sole engineer to the board of northern lights  i must try by excerpts from his diary and correspondence to convey to the reader some idea of the ardency and thoroughness with which he threw himself into the largest and least of his multifarious engagements in this service  but first i must say a word or two upon the life of lightkeepers and the temptations to which they are more particularly exposed  the lightkeeper occupies a position apart among men  in seatowers the complement has always been three since the deplorable business in the eddystone when one keeper died and the survivor signalling in vain for relief was compelled to live for days with the dead body  these usually pass their time by the pleasant human expedient of quarrelling and sometimes i am assured not one of the three is on speaking terms with any other  on shore stations which on the scottish coast are sometimes hardly less isolated the usual number is two a principal and an assistant  the principal is dissatisfied with the assistant or perhaps the assistant keeps pigeons and the principal wants the water from the roof  their wives and families are with them living cheek by jowl  the children quarrel jockie hits jimsie in the eye and the mothers make haste to mingle in the dissension  perhaps there is trouble about a broken dish perhaps mrs assistant is more highly born than mrs principal and gives herself airs and the men are drawn in and the servants presently follow  ‘church privileges have been denied the keeper’s and the assistant’s servants’ i read in one case and the eminently scots periphrasis means neither more nor less than excommunication ‘on account of the discordant and quarrelsome state of the families  the cause when inquired into proves to be tittletattle on both sides’  the tender comes round the foremen and artificers go from station to station the gossip flies through the whole system of the service and the stories disfigured and exaggerated return to their own birthplace with the returning tender  the english board was apparently shocked by the picture of these dissensions  ‘when the trinity house can’ i find my grandfather writing at beachy head in 1834 ‘they do not appoint two keepers they disagree so ill  a man who has a family is assisted by his family and in this way to my experience and present observation the business is very much neglected  one keeper is in my view a bad system  this day’s visit to an english lighthouse convinces me of this as the lightkeeper was walking on a staff with the gout and the business performed by one of his daughters a girl of thirteen or fourteen years of age’  this man received a hundred a year it shows a different reading of human nature perhaps typical of scotland and england that i find in my grandfather’s diary the following pregnant entry ‘the lightkeepers agreeing ill keep one another to their duty’  but the scottish system was not alone founded on this cynical opinion  the dignity and the comfort of the northern lightkeeper were both attended to  he had a uniform to ‘raise him in his own estimation and in that of his neighbour which is of consequence to a person of trust  the keepers’ my grandfather goes on in another place ‘are attended to in all the detail of accommodation in the best style as shipmasters and this is believed to have a sensible effect upon their conduct and to regulate their general habits as members of society’  he notes with the same dip of ink that ‘the brasses were not clean and the persons of the keepers not trig’ and thus we find him writing to a culprit ‘i have to complain that you are not cleanly in your person and that your manner of speech is ungentle and rather inclines to rudeness you must therefore take a different view of your duties as a lightkeeper’  a high ideal for the service appears in these expressions and will be more amply illustrated further on  but even the scottish lightkeeper was frail  during the unbroken solitude of the winter months when inspection is scarce possible it must seem a vain toil to polish the brass handrail of the stair or to keep an unrewarded vigil in the lightroom and the keepers are habitually tempted to the beginnings of sloth and must unremittingly resist  he who temporises with his conscience is already lost  i must tell here an anecdote that illustrates the difficulties of inspection  in the days of my uncle david and my father there was a station which they regarded with jealousy  the two engineers compared notes and were agreed  the tower was always clean but seemed always to bear traces of a hasty cleansing as though the keepers had been suddenly forewarned  on inquiry it proved that such was the case and that a wandering fiddler was the unfailing harbinger of the engineer  at last my father was stormstayed one sunday in a port at the other side of the island  the visit was quite overdue and as he walked across upon the monday morning he promised himself that he should at last take the keepers unprepared they were both waiting for him in uniform at the gate the fiddler had been there on saturday  my grandfather as will appear from the following extracts was much a martinet and had a habit of expressing himself on paper with an almost startling emphasis  personally with his powerful voice sanguine countenance and eccentric and original locutions he was well qualified to inspire a salutary terror in the service      ‘i find that the keepers have by some means or another got into the     way of cleaning too much with rottenstone and oil  i take the     principal keeper to task on this subject and make him bring a     clean towel and clean one of the brazen frames which leaves the     towel in an odious state  this towel i put up in a sheet of paper     seal and take with me to confront mr murdoch who has just left the     station’  ‘this letter’—a stern enumeration of complaints—‘to lie a     week on the lightroom bookplace and to be put in the inspector’s     hands when he comes round’  ‘it is the most painful thing that can     occur for me to have a correspondence of this kind with any of the     keepers and when i come to the lighthouse instead of having the     satisfaction to meet them with approbation it is distressing when     one is obliged to put on a most angry countenance and demeanour but     from such culpable negligence as you have shown there is no avoiding     it  i hold it as a fixed maxim that when a man or a family put on a     slovenly appearance in their houses stairs and lanterns i always     find their reflectors burners windows and light in general ill     attended to and therefore i must insist on cleanliness     throughout’  ‘i find you very deficient in the duty of the high     tower  you thus place your appointment as principal keeper in     jeopardy and i think it necessary as an old servant of the board     to put you upon your guard once for all at this time  i call upon     you to recollect what was formerly and is now said to you  the state     of the backs of the reflectors at the high tower was disgraceful as     i pointed out to you on the spot  they were as if spitten upon and     greasy fingermarks upon the back straps  i demand an explanation of     this state of things’  ‘the cause of the commissioners dismissing     you is expressed in the minute and it must be a matter of regret to     you that you have been so much engaged in smuggling and also that     the reports relative to the cleanliness of the lighthouse upon being     referred to rather added to their unfavourable opinion’  ‘i do not     go into the dwellinghouse but severely chide the lightkeepers for     the disagreement that seems to subsist among them’  ‘the families of     the two lightkeepers here agree very ill  i have effected a     reconciliation for the present’  ‘things are in a very humdrum     state here  there is no painting and in and out of doors no taste     or tidiness displayed  robert’s wife greets and m’gregor’s scolds     and robert is so downhearted that he says he is unfit for duty  i     told him that if he was to mind wives’ quarrels and to take them up     the only way was for him and m’gregor to go down to the point like     sir g grant and lord somerset’  ‘i cannot say that i have     experienced a more unpleasant meeting than that of the lighthouse     folks this morning or ever saw a stronger example of unfeeling     barbarity than the conduct which the s exhibited  these two     coldhearted persons not contented with having driven the daughter     of the poor nervous woman from her father’s house both kept     pouncing at her lest she should forget her great misfortune     write me of their conduct  do not make any communication of the     state of these families at kinnaird head as this would be like     talebearing’  there is the great word out  tales and talebearing always with the emphatic capitals run continually in his correspondence  i will give but two instances—      ‘write to david one of the lightkeepers and caution him to be more     prudent how he expresses himself  let him attend his duty to the     lighthouse and his family concerns and give less heed to     talebearers’  ‘i have not your last letter at hand to quote its     date but if i recollect it contains some kind of tales which     nonsense i wish you would lay aside and notice only the concerns of     your family and the important charge committed to you’  apparently however my grandfather was not himself inaccessible to the talebearer as the following indicates      ‘in walking along with mr   i explain to him that i should be     under the necessity of looking more closely into the business here     from his conduct at buddonness which had given an instance of     weakness in the moral principle which had staggered my opinion of     him  his answer was “that will be with regard to the lass”  i told     him i was to enter no farther with him upon the subject’  ‘mr     miller appears to be master and man  i am sorry about this foolish     fellow  had i known his train i should not as i did have rather     forced him into the service  upon finding the windows in the state     they were i turned upon mr watt and especially upon mr stewart     the latter did not appear for a length of time to have visited the     lightroom  on asking the cause—did mr watt and him sic     disagree he said no but he had got very bad usage from the     assistant “who was a very obstreperous man”  i could not bring mr     watt to put in language his objections to miller all i could get was     that he being your friend and saying he was unwell he did not like     to complain or to push the man that the man seemed to have no liking     to anything like work that he was unruly that being an educated     man he despised them  i was however determined to have out of     these unwilling witnesses the language alluded to  i fixed upon     mr stewart as chief he hedged  my curiosity increased and i     urged  then he said “what would i think just exactly of mr watt     being called an old b”  you may judge of my surprise  there was     not another word uttered  this was quite enough as coming from a     person i should have calculated upon quite different behaviour from     it spoke a volume of the man’s mind and want of principle’  ‘object     to the keeper keeping a bullterrier dog of ferocious appearance  it     is dangerous as we land at all times of the night’  ‘have only to     complain of the storehouse floor being spotted with oil  give orders     for this being instantly rectified so that on my return tomorrow i     may see things in good order’  ‘the furniture of both houses wants     much rubbing  mrs ’s carpets are absurd beyond anything i have     seen  i want her to turn the fenders up with the bottom to the     fireplace the carpets when not likely to be in use folded up and     laid as a hearthrug partly under the fender’  my grandfather was king in the service to his fingertips  all should go in his way from the principal lightkeeper’s coat to the assistant’s fender from the gravel in the gardenwalks to the bad smell in the kitchen or the oilspots on the storeroom floor  it might be thought there was nothing more calculated to awake men’s resentment and yet his rule was not more thorough than it was beneficent  his thought for the keepers was continual and it did not end with their lives  he tried to manage their successions he thought no pains too great to arrange between a widow and a son who had succeeded his father he was often harassed and perplexed by tales of hardship and i find him writing almost in despair of their improvident habits and the destitution that awaited their families upon a death  ‘the house being completely furnished they come into possession without necessaries and they go out naked  the insurance seems to have failed and what next is to be tried’  while they lived he wrote behind their backs to arrange for the education of their children or to get them other situations if they seemed unsuitable for the northern lights  when he was at a lighthouse on a sunday he held prayers and heard the children read  when a keeper was sick he lent him his horse and sent him mutton and brandy from the ship  ‘the assistant’s wife having been this morning confined there was sent ashore a bottle of sherry and a few rusks—a practice which i have always observed in this service’ he writes  they dwelt many of them in uninhabited isles or desert forelands totally cut off from shops many of them were besides fallen into a rustic dishabitude of life so that even when they visited a city they could scarce be trusted with their own affairs as for example he who carried home to his children thinking they were oranges a bag of lemons  and my grandfather seems to have acted at least in his early years as a kind of gratuitous agent for the service  thus i find him writing to a keeper in 1806 when his mind was already preoccupied with arrangements for the bell rock ‘i am much afraid i stand very unfavourably with you as a man of promise as i was to send several things of which i believe i have more than once got the memorandum  all i can say is that in this respect you are not singular  this makes me no better but really i have been driven about beyond all example in my past experience and have been essentially obliged to neglect my own urgent affairs’  no servant of the northern lights came to edinburgh but he was entertained at baxter’s place to breakfast  there at his own table my grandfather sat down delightedly with his broadspoken homespun officers  his whole relation to the service was in fact patriarchal and i believe i may say that throughout its ranks he was adored  i have spoken with many who knew him i was his grandson and their words may have very well been words of flattery but there was one thing that could not be affected and that was the look and light that came into their faces at the name of robert stevenson  in the early part of the century the foreman builder was a young man of the name of george peebles a native of anstruther  my grandfather had placed in him a very high degree of confidence and he was already designated to be foreman at the bell rock when on christmasday 1806 on his way home from orkney he was lost in the schooner traveller the tale of the loss of the traveller is almost a replica of that of the elizabeth of stromness like the elizabeth she came as far as kinnaird head was then surprised by a storm driven back to orkney and bilged and sank on the island of flotta  it seems it was about the dusk of the day when the ship struck and many of the crew and passengers were drowned  about the same hour my grandfather was in his office at the writingtable and the room beginning to darken he laid down his pen and fell asleep  in a dream he saw the door open and george peebles come in ‘reeling to and fro and staggering like a drunken man’ with water streaming from his head and body to the floor  there it gathered into a wave which sweeping forward submerged my grandfather  well no matter how deep versions vary and at last he awoke and behold it was a dream but it may be conceived how profoundly the impression was written even on the mind of a man averse from such ideas when the news came of the wreck on flotta and the death of george  george’s vouchers and accounts had perished with himself and it appeared he was in debt to the commissioners  but my grandfather wrote to orkney twice collected evidence of his disbursements and proved him to be seventy pounds ahead  with this sum he applied to george’s brothers and had it apportioned between their mother and themselves  he approached the board and got an annuity of £5 bestowed on the widow peebles and we find him writing her a long letter of explanation and advice and pressing on her the duty of making a will  that he should thus act executor was no singular instance  but besides this we are able to assist at some of the stages of a rather touching experiment no less than an attempt to secure charles peebles heir to george’s favour  he is despatched under the character of ‘a fine young man’ recommended to gentlemen for ‘advice as he’s a stranger in your place and indeed to this kind of charge this being his first outset as foreman’ and for a long while after the letterbook in the midst of that thrilling first year of the bell rock is encumbered with pages of instruction and encouragement  the nature of a bill and the precautions that are to be observed about discounting it are expounded at length and with clearness  ‘you are not i hope neglecting charles to work the harbour at springtides and see that you pay the greatest attention to get the well so as to supply the keeper with water for he is a very helpless fellow and so unfond of hard work that i fear he could do ill to keep himself in water by going to the other side for it’—‘with regard to spirits charles i see very little occasion for it’  these abrupt apostrophes sound to me like the voice of an awakened conscience but they would seem to have reverberated in vain in the ears of charles there was trouble in pladda his scene of operations his men ran away from him there was at least a talk of calling in the sheriff  ‘i fear’ writes my grandfather ‘you have been too indulgent and i am sorry to add that men do not answer to be too well treated a circumstance which i have experienced and which you will learn as you go on in business’  i wonder was not charles peebles himself a case in point  either death at least or disappointment and discharge must have ended his service in the northern lights and in later correspondence i look in vain for any mention of his name—charles i mean not peebles for as late as 1839 my grandfather is patiently writing to another of the family ‘i am sorry you took the trouble of applying to me about your son as it lies quite out of my way to forward his views in the line of his profession as a draper’    iii   a professional life of robert stevenson has been already given to the world by his son david and to that i would refer those interested in such matters  but my own design which is to represent the man would be very ill carried out if i suffered myself or my reader to forget that he was first of all and last of all an engineer  his chief claim to the style of a mechanical inventor is on account of the jib or balance crane of the bell rock which are beautiful contrivances  but the great merit of this engineer was not in the field of engines  he was above all things a projector of works in the face of nature and a modifier of nature itself  a road to be made a tower to be built a harbour to be constructed a river to be trained and guided in its channel—these were the problems with which his mind was continually occupied and for these and similar ends he travelled the world for more than half a century like an artist notebook in hand  he once stood and looked on at the emptying of a certain oiltube he did so watch in hand and accurately timed the operation and in so doing offered the perfect type of his profession  the fact acquired might never be of use it was acquired another link in the world’s huge chain of processes was brought down to figures and placed at the service of the engineer  ‘the very term mensuration sounds engineerlike’ i find him writing and in truth what the engineer most properly deals with is that which can be measured weighed and numbered  the time of any operation in hours and minutes its cost in pounds shillings and pence the strain upon a given point in footpounds—these are his conquests with which he must continually furnish his mind and which after he has acquired them he must continually apply and exercise  they must be not only entries in notebooks to be hurriedly consulted in the actor’s phrase he must be stale in them in a word of my grandfather’s they must be ‘fixed in the mind like the ten fingers and ten toes’  these are the certainties of the engineer so far he finds a solid footing and clear views  but the province of formulas and constants is restricted  even the mechanical engineer comes at last to an end of his figures and must stand up a practical man face to face with the discrepancies of nature and the hiatuses of theory  after the machine is finished and the steam turned on the next is to drive it and experience and an exquisite sympathy must teach him where a weight should be applied or a nut loosened  with the civil engineer more properly so called if anything can be proper with this awkward coinage the obligation starts with the beginning  he is always the practical man the rains the winds and the waves the complexity and the fitfulness of nature are always before him  he has to deal with the unpredictable with those forces in smeaton’s phrase that ‘are subject to no calculation’ and still he must predict still calculate them at his peril  his work is not yet in being and he must foresee its influence how it shall deflect the tide exaggerate the waves dam back the rainwater or attract the thunderbolt  he visits a piece of seaboard and from the inclination and soil of the beach from the weeds and shellfish from the configuration of the coast and the depth of soundings outside he must deduce what magnitude of waves is to be looked for  he visits a river its summer water babbling on shallows and he must not only read in a thousand indications the measure of winter freshets but be able to predict the violence of occasional great floods nay and more he must not only consider that which is but that which may be  thus i find my grandfather writing in a report on the north esk bridge ‘a less waterway might have sufficed but the valleys may come to be meliorated by drainage’  one field drained after another through all that confluence of vales and we come to a time when they shall precipitate by so much a more copious and transient flood as the gush of the flowing drainpipe is superior to the leakage of a peat  it is plain there is here but a restricted use for formulas  in this sort of practice the engineer has need of some transcendental sense smeaton the pioneer bade him obey his ‘feelings’ my father that ‘power of estimating obscure forces which supplies a coefficient of its own to every rule’  the rules must be everywhere indeed but they must everywhere be modified by this transcendental coefficient everywhere bent to the impression of the trained eye and the feelings of the engineer  a sentiment of physical laws and of the scale of nature which shall have been strong in the beginning and progressively fortified by observation must be his guide in the last recourse  i had the most opportunity to observe my father  he would pass hours on the beach brooding over the waves counting them noting their least deflection noting when they broke  on tweedside or by lyne or manor we have spent together whole afternoons to me at the time extremely wearisome to him as i am now sorry to think bitterly mortifying  the river was to me a pretty and various spectacle i could not see—i could not be made to see—it otherwise  to my father it was a chequerboard of lively forces which he traced from pool to shallow with minute appreciation and enduring interest  ‘that bank was being undercut’ he might say  ‘why suppose you were to put a groin out here would not the filum fluminis be cast abruptly off across the channel and where would it impinge upon the other shore and what would be the result  or suppose you were to blast that boulder what would happen  follow it—use the eyes god has given you—can you not see that a great deal of land would be reclaimed upon this side’  it was to me like school in holidays but to him until i had worn him out with my invincible triviality a delight  thus he pored over the engineer’s voluminous handybook of nature thus must too have pored my grandfather and uncles  but it is of the essence of this knowledge or this knack of mind to be largely incommunicable  ‘it cannot be imparted to another’ says my father  the verbal castingnet is thrown in vain over these evanescent inferential relations hence the insignificance of much engineering literature  so far as the science can be reduced to formulas or diagrams the book is to the point so far as the art depends on intimate study of the ways of nature the author’s words will too often be found vapid  this fact—that engineering looks one way and literature another—was what my grandfather overlooked  all his life long his pen was in his hand piling up a treasury of knowledge preparing himself against all possible contingencies  scarce anything fell under his notice but he perceived in it some relation to his work and chronicled it in the pages of his journal in his always lucid but sometimes inexact and wordy style  the travelling diary so he called it was kept in fascicles of ruled paper which were at last bound up rudely indexed and put by for future reference  such volumes as have reached me contain a surprising medley the whole details of his employment in the northern lights and his general practice the whole biography of an enthusiastic engineer  much of it is useful and curious much merely otiose and much can only be described as an attempt to impart that which cannot be imparted in words  of such are his repeated and heroic descriptions of reefs monuments of misdirected literary energy which leave upon the mind of the reader no effect but that of a multiplicity of words and the suggested vignette of a lusty old gentleman scrambling among tangle  it is to be remembered that he came to engineering while yet it was in the egg and without a library and that he saw the bounds of that profession widen daily  he saw iron ships steamers and the locomotive engine introduced  he lived to travel from glasgow to edinburgh in the inside of a forenoon and to remember that he himself had ‘often been twelve hours upon the journey and his grandfather lillie two days’  the profession was still but in its second generation and had already broken down the barriers of time and space  who should set a limit to its future encroachments  and hence with a kind of sanguine pedantry he pursued his design of ‘keeping up with the day’ and posting himself and his family on every mortal subject  of this unpractical idealism we shall meet with many instances there was not a trade and scarce an accomplishment but he thought it should form part of the outfit of an engineer and not content with keeping an encyclopaedic diary himself he would fain have set all his sons to work continuing and extending it they were more happily inspired  my father’s engineering pocketbook was not a bulky volume with its store of pregnant notes and vital formulas it served him through life and was not yet filled when he came to die as for robert stevenson and the travelling diary i should be ungrateful to complain for it has supplied me with many lively traits for this and subsequent chapters but i must still remember much of the period of my study there as a sojourn in the valley of the shadow  the duty of the engineer is twofold—to design the work and to see the work done  we have seen already something of the vociferous thoroughness of the man upon the cleaning of lamps and the polishing of reflectors in building in roadmaking in the construction of bridges in every detail and byway of his employments he pursued the same ideal perfection with a capital p and violently underscored was his design a crack for a penknife the waste of ‘sixandthirty shillings’ ‘the loss of a day or a tide’ in each of these he saw and was revolted by the finger of the sloven and to spirits intense as his and immersed in vital undertakings the slovenly is the dishonest and wasted time is instantly translated into lives endangered  on this consistent idealism there is but one thing that now and then trenches with a touch of incongruity and that is his love of the picturesque  as when he laid out a road on hogarth’s line of beauty bade a foreman be careful in quarrying not ‘to disfigure the island’ or regretted in a report that ‘the great stone called the devil in the hole was blasted or broken down to make roadmetal and for other purposes of the work’     chapter iii the building of the bell rock   off the mouths of the tay and the forth thirteen miles from fifeness eleven from arbroath and fourteen from the red head of angus lies the inchcape or bell rock  it extends to a length of about fourteen hundred feet but the part of it discovered at low water to not more than four hundred and twentyseven  at a little more than halfflood in fine weather the seamless ocean joins over the reef and at highwater springs it is buried sixteen feet  as the tide goes down the higher reaches of the rock are seen to be clothed by conferva rupestris as by a sward of grass upon the more exposed edges where the currents are most swift and the breach of the sea heaviest baderlock or henware flourishes and the great tangle grows at the depth of several fathoms with luxuriance before man arrived and introduced into the silence of the sea the smoke and clangour of a blacksmith’s shop it was a favourite restingplace of seals  the crab and lobster haunt in the crevices and limpets mussels and the white buckie abound  according to a tradition a bell had been once hung upon this rock by an abbot of arbroath 91a ‘and being taken down by a seapirate a year thereafter he perished upon the same rock with ship and goods in the righteous judgment of god’  from the days of the abbot and the seapirate no man had set foot upon the inchcape save fishers from the neighbouring coast or perhaps—for a moment before the surges swallowed them—the unfortunate victims of shipwreck  the fishers approached the rock with an extreme timidity but their harvest appears to have been great and the adventure no more perilous than lucrative  in 1800 on the occasion of my grandfather’s first landing and during the two or three hours which the ebbtide and the smooth water allowed them to pass upon its shelves his crew collected upwards of two hundredweight of old metal pieces of a kedge anchor and a cabin stove crowbars a hinge and lock of a door a ship’s markingiron a piece of a ship’s caboose a soldier’s bayonet a cannon ball several pieces of money a shoebuckle and the like  such were the spoils of the bell rock  from 1794 onward the mind of my grandfather had been exercised with the idea of a light upon this formidable danger  to build a tower on a sea rock eleven miles from shore and barely uncovered at low water of neaps appeared a fascinating enterprise  it was something yet unattempted unessayed and even now after it has been lighted for more than eighty years it is still an exploit that has never been repeated 92a  my grandfather was besides but a young man of an experience comparatively restricted and a reputation confined to scotland and when he prepared his first models and exhibited them in merchants’ hall he can hardly be acquitted of audacity  john clerk of eldin stood his friend from the beginning kept the key of the model room to which he carried ‘eminent strangers’ and found words of counsel and encouragement beyond price  ‘mr clerk had been personally known to smeaton and used occasionally to speak of him to me’ says my grandfather and again ‘i felt regret that i had not the opportunity of a greater range of practice to fit me for such an undertaking but i was fortified by an expression of my friend mr clerk in one of our conversations “this work” said he “is unique and can be little forwarded by experience of ordinary masonic operations  in this case smeaton’s ‘narrative’ must be the textbook and energy and perseverance the pratique”’  a bill for the work was introduced into parliament and lost in the lords in 1802–3  john rennie was afterwards at my grandfather’s suggestion called in council with the style of chief engineer  the precise meaning attached to these words by any of the parties appears irrecoverable chief engineer should have full authority full responsibility and a proper share of the emoluments and there were none of these for rennie i find in an appendix a paper which resumes the controversy on this subject and it will be enough to say here that rennie did not design the bell rock that he did not execute it and that he was not paid for it 94a  from so much of the correspondence as has come down to me the acquaintance of this man eleven years his senior and already famous appears to have been both useful and agreeable to robert stevenson  it is amusing to find my grandfather seeking high and low for a brace of pistols which his colleague had lost by the way between aberdeen and edinburgh and writing to messrs dollond ‘i have not thought it necessary to trouble mr rennie with this order but i beg you will see to get two minutes of him as he passes your door’—a proposal calculated rather from the latitude of edinburgh than from london even in 1807  it is pretty too to observe with what affectionate regard smeaton was held in mind by his immediate successors  ‘poor old fellow’ writes rennie to stevenson ‘i hope he will now and then take a peep at us and inspire you with fortitude and courage to brave all difficulties and dangers to accomplish a work which will if successful immortalise you in the annals of fame’  the style might be bettered but the sentiment is charming  smeaton was indeed the patron saint of the bell rock  undeterred by the sinister fate of winstanley he had tackled and solved the problem of the eddystone but his solution had not been in all respects perfect  it remained for my grandfather to outdo him in daring by applying to a tidal rock those principles which had been already justified by the success of the eddystone and to perfect the model by more than one exemplary departure  smeaton had adopted in his floors the principle of the arch each therefore exercised an outward thrust upon the walls which must be met and combated by embedded chains  my grandfather’s flooringstones on the other hand were flat made part of the outer wall and were keyed and dovetailed into a central stone so as to bind the work together and be positive elements of strength  in 1703 winstanley still thought it possible to erect his strange pagoda with its open gallery its florid scrolls and candlesticks like a rich man’s folly for an ornamental water in a park  smeaton followed then stevenson in his turn corrected such flaws as were left in smeaton’s design and with his improvements it is not too much to say the model was made perfect  smeaton and stevenson had between them evolved and finished the seatower  no subsequent builder has departed in anything essential from the principles of their design  it remains and it seems to us as though it must remain for ever an ideal attained  every stone in the building it may interest the reader to know my grandfather had himself cut out in the model and the manner in which the courses were fitted joggled trenailed wedged and the bond broken is intricate as a puzzle and beautiful by ingenuity  in 1806 a second bill passed both houses and the preliminary works were at once begun  the same year the navy had taken a great harvest of prizes in the north sea one of which a prussian fishing dogger flatbottomed and rounded at the stem and stern was purchased to be a floating lightship and renamed the pharos  by july 1807 she was overhauled rigged for her new purpose and turned into the lee of the isle of may  ‘it was proposed that the whole party should meet in her and pass the night but she rolled from side to side in so extraordinary a manner that even the most seahardy fled  it was humorously observed of this vessel that she was in danger of making a round turn and appearing with her keel uppermost and that she would even turn a halfpenny if laid upon deck’  by two o’clock on the morning of the 15th july this purgatorial vessel was moored by the bell rock  a sloop of forty tons had been in the meantime built at leith and named the smeaton by the 7th of august my grandfather set sail in her—      ‘carrying with him mr peter logan foreman builder and five     artificers selected from their having been somewhat accustomed to the     sea the writer being aware of the distressing trial which the     floating light would necessarily inflict upon landsmen from her     rolling motion  here he remained till the 10th and as the weather     was favourable a landing was effected daily when the workmen were     employed in cutting the large seaweed from the sites of the     lighthouse and beacon which were respectively traced with pickaxes     upon the rock  in the meantime the crew of the smeaton was     employed in laying down the several sets of moorings within about     half a mile of the rock for the convenience of vessels  the     artificers having fortunately experienced moderate weather     returned to the workyard of arbroath with a good report of their     treatment afloat when their comrades ashore began to feel some     anxiety to see a place of which they had heard so much and to change     the constant operations with the iron and mallet in the process of     hewing for an occasional tide’s work on the rock which they figured     to themselves as a state of comparative ease and comfort’  i am now for many pages to let my grandfather speak for himself and tell in his own words the story of his capital achievement  the tall quarto of 533 pages from which the following narrative has been dug out is practically unknown to the general reader yet good judges have perceived its merit and it has been named with flattering wit ‘the romance of stone and lime’ and ‘the robinson crusoe of civil engineering’  the tower was but four years in the building it took robert stevenson in the midst of his many avocations no less than fourteen to prepare the account  the titlepage is a solid piece of literature of upwards of a hundred words the table of contents runs to thirteen pages and the dedication to that revered monarch george iv must have cost him no little study and correspondence  walter scott was called in council and offered one miscorrection which still blots the page  in spite of all this pondering and filing there remain pages not easy to construe and inconsistencies not easy to explain away  i have sought to make these disappear and to lighten a little the baggage with which my grandfather marches here and there i have rejointed and rearranged a sentence always with his own words and all with a reverent and faithful hand and i offer here to the reader the true monument of robert stevenson with a little of the moss removed from the inscription and the portrait of the artist with some superfluous canvas cut away    i—operations of 1807                                                          sunday 16th aug  everything being arranged for sailing to the rock on saturday the 15th the vessel might have proceeded on the sunday but understanding that this would not be so agreeable to the artificers it was deferred until monday  here we cannot help observing that the men allotted for the operations at the rock seemed to enter upon the undertaking with a degree of consideration which fully marked their opinion as to the hazardous nature of the undertaking on which they were about to enter  they went in a body to church on sunday and whether it was in the ordinary course or designed for the occasion the writer is not certain but the service was in many respects suitable to their circumstances                                                         monday 17th aug  the tide happening to fall late in the evening of monday the 17th the party counting twentyfour in number embarked on board of the smeaton about ten o’clock pm and sailed from arbroath with a gentle breeze at west  our ship’s colours having been flying all day in compliment to the commencement of the work the other vessels in the harbour also saluted which made a very gay appearance  a number of the friends and acquaintances of those on board having been thus collected the piers though at a late hour were perfectly crowded and just as the smeaton cleared the harbour all on board united in giving three hearty cheers which were returned by those on shore in such good earnest that in the still of the evening the sound must have been heard in all parts of the town reechoing from the walls and lofty turrets of the venerable abbey of aberbrothwick  the writer felt much satisfaction at the manner of this parting scene though he must own that the present rejoicing was on his part mingled with occasional reflections upon the responsibility of his situation which extended to the safety of all who should be engaged in this perilous work  with such sensations he retired to his cabin but as the artificers were rather inclined to move about the deck than to remain in their confined berths below his repose was transient and the vessel being small every motion was necessarily heard  some who were musically inclined occasionally sung but he listened with peculiar pleasure to the sailor at the helm who hummed over dibdin’s characteristic air—      ‘they say there’s a providence sits up aloft     to keep watch for the life of poor jack’                                                        tuesday 18th aug  the weather had been very gentle all night and about four in the morning of the 18th the smeaton anchored  agreeably to an arranged plan of operations all hands were called at five o’clock am just as the highest part of the bell rock began to show its sable head among the light breakers which occasionally whitened with the foaming sea  the two boats belonging to the floating light attended the smeaton to carry the artificers to the rock as her boat could only accommodate about six or eight sitters  every one was more eager than his neighbour to leap into the boats and it required a good deal of management on the part of the coxswains to get men unaccustomed to a boat to take their places for rowing and at the same time trimming her properly  the landingmaster and foreman went into one boat while the writer took charge of another and steered it to and from the rock  this became the more necessary in the early stages of the work as places could not be spared for more than two or at most three seamen to each boat who were always stationed one at the bow to use the boathook in fending or pushing off and the other at the aftermost oar to give the proper time in rowing while the middle oars were doublebanked and rowed by the artificers  as the weather was extremely fine with light airs of wind from the east we landed without difficulty upon the central part of the rock at halfpast five but the water had not yet sufficiently left it for commencing the work  this interval however did not pass unoccupied the first and last of all the principal operations at the bell rock were accompanied by three hearty cheers from all hands and on occasions like the present the steward of the ship attended when each man was regaled with a glass of rum  as the water left the rock about six some began to bore the holes for the great bats or holdfasts for fixing the beams of the beaconhouse while the smith was fully attended in laying out the site of his forge upon a somewhat sheltered spot of the rock which also recommended itself from the vicinity of a pool of water for tempering his irons  these preliminary steps occupied about an hour and as nothing further could be done during this tide towards fixing the forge the workmen gratified their curiosity by roaming about the rock which they investigated with great eagerness till the tide overflowed it  those who had been sick picked dulse fucus palmatus which they ate with much seeming appetite others were more intent upon collecting limpets for bait to enjoy the amusement of fishing when they returned on board of the vessel  indeed none came away emptyhanded as everything found upon the bell rock was considered valuable being connected with some interesting association  several coins and numerous bits of shipwrecked iron were picked up of almost every description and in particular a markingiron lettered james—a circumstance of which it was thought proper to give notice to the public as it might lead to the knowledge of some unfortunate shipwreck perhaps unheard of till this simple occurrence led to the discovery  when the rock began to be overflowed the landingmaster arranged the crews of the respective boats appointing twelve persons to each  according to a rule which the writer had laid down to himself he was always the last person who left the rock  in a short time the bell rock was laid completely under water and the weather being extremely fine the sea was so smooth that its place could not be pointed out from the appearance of the surface—a circumstance which sufficiently demonstrates the dangerous nature of this rock even during the day and in the smoothest and calmest state of the sea during the interval between the morning and the evening tides the artificers were variously employed in fishing and reading others were busy in drying and adjusting their wet clothes and one or two amused their companions with the violin and german flute  about seven in the evening the signal bell for landing on the rock was again rung when every man was at his quarters  in this service it was thought more appropriate to use the bell than to pipe to quarters as the use of this instrument is less known to the mechanic than the sound of the bell  the landing as in the morning was at the eastern harbour during this tide the seaweed was pretty well cleared from the site of the operations and also from the tracks leading to the different landingplaces for walking upon the rugged surface of the bell rock when covered with seaweed was found to be extremely difficult and even dangerous  every hand that could possibly be occupied now employed in assisting the smith to fit up the apparatus for his forge  at 9 pm the boats returned to the tender after other two hours’ work in the same order as formerly—perhaps as much gratified with the success that attended the work of this day as with any other in the whole course of the operations  although it could not he said that the fatigues of this day had been great yet all on board retired early to rest  the sea being calm and no movement on deck it was pretty generally remarked in the morning that the bell awakened the greater number on board from their first sleep and though this observation was not altogether applicable to the writer himself yet he was not a little pleased to find that thirty people could all at once become so reconciled to a night’s quarters within a few hundred paces of the bell rock                                                      wednesday 19th aug  being extremely anxious at this time to get forward with fixing the smith’s forge on which the progress of the work at present depended the writer requested that he might be called at daybreak to learn the landingmaster’s opinion of the weather from the appearance of the rising sun a criterion by which experienced seamen can generally judge pretty accurately of the state of the weather for the following day  about five o’clock on coming upon deck the sun’s upper limb or disc had just begun to appear as if rising from the ocean and in less than a minute he was seen in the fullest splendour but after a short interval he was enveloped in a soft cloudy sky which was considered emblematical of fine weather  his rays had not yet sufficiently dispelled the clouds which hid the land from view and the bell rock being still overflowed the whole was one expanse of water  this scene in itself was highly gratifying and when the morning bell was tolled we were gratified with the happy forebodings of good weather and the expectation of having both a morning and an evening tide’s work on the rock  the boat which the writer steered happened to be the last which approached the rock at this tide and in standing up in the stern while at some distance to see how the leading boat entered the creek he was astonished to observe something in the form of a human figure in a reclining posture upon one of the ledges of the rock  he immediately steered the boat through a narrow entrance to the eastern harbour with a thousand unpleasant sensations in his mind  he thought a vessel or boat must have been wrecked upon the rock during the night and it seemed probable that the rock might be strewed with dead bodies a spectacle which could not fail to deter the artificers from returning so freely to their work  in the midst of these reveries the boat took the ground at an improper landingplace but without waiting to push her off he leapt upon the rock and making his way hastily to the spot which had privately given him alarm he had the satisfaction to ascertain that he had only been deceived by the peculiar situation and aspect of the smith’s anvil and block which very completely represented the appearance of a lifeless body upon the rock  the writer carefully suppressed his feelings the simple mention of which might have had a bad effect upon the artificers and his haste passed for an anxiety to examine the apparatus of the smith’s forge left in an unfinished state at evening tide  in the course of this morning’s work two or three apparently distant peals of thunder were heard and the atmosphere suddenly became thick and foggy  but as the smeaton our present tender was moored at no great distance from the rock the crew on board continued blowing with a horn and occasionally fired a musket so that the boats got to the ship without difficulty                                                       thursday 20th aug  the wind this morning inclined from the northeast and the sky had a heavy and cloudy appearance but the sea was smooth though there was an undulating motion on the surface which indicated easterly winds and occasioned a slight surf upon the rock  but the boats found no difficulty in landing at the western creek at halfpast seven and after a good tide’s work left it again about a quarter from eleven  in the evening the artificers landed at halfpast seven and continued till halfpast eight having completed the fixing of the smith’s forge his vice and a wooden board or bench which were also batted to a ledge of the rock to the great joy of all under a salute of three hearty cheers from an oversight on the part of the smith who had neglected to bring his tinderbox and matches from the vessel the work was prevented from being continued for at least an hour longer  the smith’s shop was of course in open space the large bellows were carried to and from the rock every tide for the serviceable condition of which together with the tinderbox fuel and embers of the former fire the smith was held responsible  those who have been placed in situations to feel the inconveniency and want of this useful artisan will be able to appreciate his value in a case like the present  it often happened to our annoyance and disappointment in the early state of the work when the smith was in the middle of a favourite heat in making some useful article or in sharpening the tools after the floodtide had obliged the pickmen to strike work a sea would come rolling over the rocks dash out the fire and endanger his indispensable implement the bellows  if the sea was smooth while the smith often stood at work kneedeep in water the tide rose by imperceptible degrees first cooling the exterior of the fireplace or hearth and then quietly blackening and extinguishing the fire from below  the writer has frequently been amused at the perplexing anxiety of the blacksmith when coaxing his fire and endeavouring to avert the effects of the rising tide                                                         friday 21st aug  everything connected with the forge being now completed the artificers found no want of sharp tools and the work went forward with great alacrity and spirit  it was also alleged that the rock had a more habitable appearance from the volumes of smoke which ascended from the smith’s shop and the busy noise of his anvil the operations of the masons the movements of the boats and shipping at a distance—all contributed to give life and activity to the scene  this noise and traffic had however the effect of almost completely banishing the herd of seals which had hitherto frequented the rock as a restingplace during the period of low water  the rock seemed to be peculiarly adapted to their habits for excepting two or three days at neaptides a part of it always dries at low water—at least during the summer season—and as there was good fishingground in the neighbourhood without a human being to disturb or molest them it had become a very favourite residence of these amphibious animals the writer having occasionally counted from fifty to sixty playing about the rock at a time  but when they came to be disturbed every tide and their seclusion was broken in upon by the kindling of great fires together with the beating of hammers and picks during low water after hovering about for a time they changed their place and seldom more than one or two were to be seen about the rock upon the more detached outlayers which dry partially whence they seemed to look with that sort of curiosity which is observable in these animals when following a boat                                                       saturday 22nd aug  hitherto the artificers had remained on board the smeaton which was made fast to one of the mooring buoys at a distance only of about a quarter of a mile from the rock and of course a very great conveniency to the work  being so near the seamen could never be mistaken as to the progress of the tide or state of the sea upon the rock nor could the boats be much at a loss to pull on board of the vessel during fog or even in very rough weather as she could be cast loose from her moorings at pleasure and brought to the lee side of the rock  but the smeaton being only about forty register tons her accommodations were extremely limited  it may therefore be easily imagined that an addition of twentyfour persons to her own crew must have rendered the situation of those on board rather uncomfortable  the only place for the men’s hammocks on board being in the hold they were unavoidably much crowded and if the weather had required the hatches to be fastened down so great a number of men could not possibly have been accommodated  to add to this evil the coboose or cookingplace being upon deck it would not have been possible to have cooked for so large a company in the event of bad weather  the stock of water was now getting short and some necessaries being also wanted for the floating light the smeaton was despatched for arbroath and the writer with the artificers at the same time shifted their quarters from her to the floating light  although the rock barely made its appearance at this period of the tides till eight o’clock yet having now a full mile to row from the floating light to the rock instead of about a quarter of a mile from the moorings of the smeaton it was necessary to be earlier astir and to form different arrangements breakfast was accordingly served up at seven o’clock this morning  from the excessive motion of the floating light the writer had looked forward rather with anxiety to the removal of the workmen to this ship  some among them who had been congratulating themselves upon having become seahardy while on board the smeaton had a complete relapse upon returning to the floating light  this was the case with the writer  from the spacious and convenient berthage of the floating light the exchange to the artificers was in this respect much for the better  the boats were also commodious measuring sixteen feet in length on the keel so that in fine weather their complement of sitters was sixteen persons for each with which however they were rather crowded but she could not stow two boats of larger dimensions when there was what is called a breeze of wind and a swell in the sea the proper number for each boat could not with propriety be rated at more than twelve persons  when the tidebell rung the boats were hoisted out and two active seamen were employed to keep them from receiving damage alongside  the floating light being very buoyant was so quick in her motions that when those who were about to step from her gunwale into a boat placed themselves upon a cleat or step on the ship’s side with the man or rail ropes in their hands they had often to wait for some time till a favourable opportunity occurred for stepping into the boat  while in this situation with the vessel rolling from side to side watching the proper time for letting go the manropes it required the greatest dexterity and presence of mind to leap into the boats  one who was rather awkward would often wait a considerable period in this position at one time his side of the ship would be so depressed that he would touch the boat to which he belonged while the next sea would elevate him so much that he would see his comrades in the boat on the opposite side of the ship his friends in the one boat calling to him to ‘jump’ while those in the boat on the other side as he came again and again into their view would jocosely say ‘are you there yet  you seem to enjoy a swing’  in this situation it was common to see a person upon each side of the ship for a length of time waiting to quit his hold  on leaving the rock today a trial of seamanship was proposed amongst the rowers for by this time the artificers had become tolerably expert in this exercise  by inadvertency some of the oars provided had been made of fir instead of ash and although a considerable stock had been laid in the workmen being at first awkward in the art were constantly breaking their oars indeed it was no uncommon thing to see the broken blades of a pair of oars floating astern in the course of a passage from the rock to the vessel  the men upon the whole had but little work to perform in the course of a day for though they exerted themselves extremely hard while on the rock yet in the early state of the operations this could not be continued for more than three or four hours at a time and as their rations were large—consisting of one pound and a half of beef one pound of ship biscuit eight ounces oatmeal two ounces barley two ounces butter three quarts of small beer with vegetables and salt—they got into excellent spirits when free of seasickness  the rowing of the boats against each other became a favourite amusement which was rather a fortunate circumstance as it must have been attended with much inconvenience had it been found necessary to employ a sufficient number of sailors for this purpose  the writer therefore encouraged the spirit of emulation and the speed of their respective boats became a favourite topic  premiums for boatraces were instituted which were contended for with great eagerness and the respective crews kept their stations in the boats with as much precision as they kept their beds on board of the ship  with these and other pastimes when the weather was favourable the time passed away among the inmates of the forecastle and waist of the ship  the writer looks back with interest upon the hours of solitude which he spent in this lonely ship with his small library  this being the first saturday that the artificers were afloat all hands were served with a glass of rum and water at night to drink the sailors’ favourite toast of ‘wives and sweethearts’  it was customary upon these occasions for the seamen and artificers to collect in the galley when the musical instruments were put in requisition for according to invariable practice every man must play a tune sing a song or tell a story                                                         sunday 23rd aug  having on the previous evening arranged matters with the landingmaster as to the business of the day the signal was rung for all hands at halfpast seven this morning  in the early state of the springtides the artificers went to the rock before breakfast but as the tides fell later in the day it became necessary to take this meal before leaving the ship  at eight o’clock all hands were assembled on the quarterdeck for prayers a solemnity which was gone through in as orderly a manner as circumstances would admit  when the weather permitted the flags of the ship were hung up as an awning or screen forming the quarterdeck into a distinct compartment the pendant was also hoisted at the mainmast and a large ensign flag was displayed over the stern and lastly the ship’s companion or top of the staircase was covered with the flag proper of the lighthouse service on which the bible was laid  a particular toll of the bell called all hands to the quarterdeck when the writer read a chapter of the bible and the whole ship’s company being uncovered he also read the impressive prayer composed by the reverend dr brunton one of the ministers of edinburgh  upon concluding this service which was attended with becoming reverence and attention all on board retired to their respective berths to breakfast and at halfpast nine the bell again rung for the artificers to take their stations in their respective boats  some demur having been evinced on board about the propriety of working on sunday which had hitherto been touched upon as delicately as possible all hands being called aft the writer from the quarterdeck stated generally the nature of the service expressing his hopes that every man would feel himself called upon to consider the erection of a lighthouse on the bell rock in every point of view as a work of necessity and mercy  he knew that scruples had existed with some and these had indeed been fairly and candidly urged before leaving the shore but it was expected that after having seen the critical nature of the rock and the necessity of the measure every man would now be satisfied of the propriety of embracing all opportunities of landing on the rock when the state of the weather would permit  the writer further took them to witness that it did not proceed from want of respect for the appointments and established forms of religion that he had himself adopted the resolution of attending the bell rock works on the sunday but as he hoped from a conviction that it was his bounden duty on the strictest principles of morality at the same time it was intimated that if any were of a different opinion they should be perfectly at liberty to hold their sentiments without the imputation of contumacy or disobedience the only difference would be in regard to the pay  upon stating this much he stepped into his boat requesting all who were so disposed to follow him  the sailors from their habits found no scruple on this subject and all of the artificers though a little tardy also embarked excepting four of the masons who from the beginning mentioned that they would decline working on sundays  it may here be noticed that throughout the whole of the operations it was observable that the men wrought if possible with more keenness upon the sundays than at other times from an impression that they were engaged in a work of imperious necessity which required every possible exertion on returning to the floating light after finishing the tide’s work the boats were received by the part of the ship’s crew left on board with the usual attention of handing ropes to the boats and helping the artificers on board but the four masons who had absented themselves from the work did not appear upon deck                                                         monday 24th aug  the boats left the floating light at a quarterpast nine o’clock this morning and the work began at threequarters past nine but as the neaptides were approaching the working time at the rock became gradually shorter and it was now with difficulty that two and a half hours’ work could be got  but so keenly had the workmen entered into the spirit of the beaconhouse operations that they continued to bore the holes in the rock till some of them were kneedeep in water  the operations at this time were entirely directed to the erection of the beacon in which every man felt an equal interest as at this critical period the slightest casualty to any of the boats at the rock might have been fatal to himself individually while it was perhaps peculiar to the writer more immediately to feel for the safety of the whole  each log or upright beam of the beacon was to be fixed to the rock by two strong and massive bats or stanchions of iron  these bats for the fixture of the principal and diagonal beams and bracing chains required fiftyfour holes each measuring two inches in diameter and eighteen inches in depth  there had already been so considerable a progress made in boring and excavating the holes that the writer’s hopes of getting the beacon erected this year began to be more and more confirmed although it was now advancing towards what was considered the latter end of the proper working season at the bell rock  the foreman joiner mr francis watt was accordingly appointed to attend at the rock today when the necessary levels were taken for the step or seat of each particular beam of the beacon that they might be cut to their respective lengths to suit the inequalities of the rock several of the stanchions were also tried into their places and other necessary observations made to prevent mistakes on the application of the apparatus and to facilitate the operations when the beams came to be set up which would require to be done in the course of a single tide                                                        tuesday 25th aug  we had now experienced an almost unvaried tract of light airs of easterly wind with clear weather in the forepart of the day and fog in the evenings  today however it sensibly changed when the wind came to the southwest and blew a fresh breeze  at nine am the bell rung and the boats were hoisted out and though the artificers were now pretty well accustomed to tripping up and down the sides of the floating light yet it required more seamanship this morning than usual  it therefore afforded some merriment to those who had got fairly seated in their respective boats to see the difficulties which attended their companions and the hesitating manner in which they quitted hold of the manropes in leaving the ship  the passage to the rock was tedious and the boats did not reach it till halfpast ten  it being now the period of neaptides the water only partially left the rock and some of the men who were boring on the lower ledges of the site of the beacon stood kneedeep in water  the situation of the smith today was particularly disagreeable but his services were at all times indispensable  as the tide did not leave the site of the forge he stood in the water and as there was some roughness on the surface it was with considerable difficulty that with the assistance of the sailors he was enabled to preserve alive his fire and while his feet were immersed in water his face was not only scorched but continually exposed to volumes of smoke accompanied with sparks from the fire which were occasionally set up owing to the strength and direction of the wind                                                      wednesday 26th aug  the wind had shifted this morning to nnw with rain and was blowing what sailors call a fresh breeze  to speak perhaps somewhat more intelligibly to the general reader the wind was such that a fishingboat could just carry full sail  but as it was of importance specially in the outset of the business to keep up the spirit of enterprise for landing on all practicable occasions the writer after consulting with the landingmaster ordered the bell to be rung for embarking and at halfpast eleven the boats reached the rock and left it again at a quarterpast twelve without however being able to do much work as the smith could not be set to work from the smallness of the ebb and the strong breach of sea which lashed with great force among the bars of the forge  just as we were about to leave the rock the wind shifted to the sw and from a fresh gale it became what seamen term a hard gale or such as would have required the fisherman to take in two or three reefs in his sail  it is a curious fact that the respective tides of ebb and flood are apparent upon the shore about an hour and a half sooner than at the distance of three or four miles in the offing  but what seems chiefly interesting here is that the tides around this small sunken rock should follow exactly the same laws as on the extensive shores of the mainland when the boats left the bell rock today it was overflowed by the floodtide but the floating light did not swing round to the floodtide for more than an hour afterwards  under this disadvantage the boats had to struggle with the ebbtide and a hard gale of wind so that it was with the greatest difficulty that they reached the floating light  had this gale happened in springtides when the current was strong we must have been driven to sea in a very helpless condition  the boat which the writer steered was considerably behind the other one of the masons having unluckily broken his oar  our prospect of getting on board of course became doubtful and our situation was rather perilous as the boat shipped so much sea that it occupied two of the artificers to bale and clear her of water  when the oar gave way we were about half a mile from the ship but being fortunately to windward we got into the wake of the floating light at about 250 fathoms astern just as the landingmaster’s boat reached the vessel  he immediately streamed or floated a lifebuoy astern with a line which was always in readiness and by means of this useful implement the boat was towed alongside of the floating light where from her rolling motion it required no small management to get safely on board as the men were much worn out with their exertions in pulling from the rock  on the present occasion the crews of both boats were completely drenched with spray and those who sat upon the bottom of the boats to bale them were sometimes pretty deep in the water before it could be cleared out  after getting on board all hands were allowed an extra dram and having shifted and got a warm and comfortable dinner the affair it is believed was little more thought of                                                       thursday 27th aug  the tides were now in that state which sailors term the dead of the neap and it was not expected that any part of the rock would be seen above water today at any rate it was obvious from the experience of yesterday that no work could be done upon it and therefore the artificers were not required to land  the wind was at west with light breezes and fine clear weather and as it was an object with the writer to know the actual state of the bell rock at neaptides he got one of the boats manned and being accompanied by the landingmaster went to it at a quarterpast twelve  the parts of the rock that appeared above water being very trifling were covered by every wave so that no landing was made  upon trying the depth of water with a boathook particularly on the sites of the lighthouse and beacon on the former at low water the depth was found to be three feet and on the central parts of the latter it was ascertained to be two feet eight inches  having made these remarks the boat returned to the ship at two pm and the weather being good the artificers were found amusing themselves with fishing  the smeaton came from arbroath this afternoon and made fast to her moorings having brought letters and newspapers with parcels of clean linen etc for the workmen who were also made happy by the arrival of three of their comrades from the workyard ashore  from these men they not only received all the news of the workyard but seemed themselves to enjoy great pleasure in communicating whatever they considered to be interesting with regard to the rock  some also got letters from their friends at a distance the postage of which for the men afloat was always free so that they corresponded the more readily  the site of the building having already been carefully traced out with the pickaxe the artificers this day commenced the excavation of the rock for the foundation or first course of the lighthouse  four men only were employed at this work while twelve continued at the site of the beaconhouse at which every possible opportunity was embraced till this essential art of the operations should be completed                                                      wednesday 2nd sept  the floating light’s bell rung this morning at halfpast four o’clock as a signal for the boats to be got ready and the landing took place at halfpast five  in passing the smeaton at her moorings near the rock her boat followed with eight additional artificers who had come from arbroath with her at last trip but there being no room for them in the floating light’s boats they had continued on board  the weather did not look very promising in the morning the wind blowing pretty fresh from wsw and had it not been that the writer calculated upon having a vessel so much at command in all probability he would not have ventured to land  the smeaton rode at what sailors call a salvagee with a crosshead made fast to the floating buoy  this kind of attachment was found to be more convenient than the mode of passing the hawser through the ring of the buoy when the vessel was to be made fast  she had then only to be steered very close to the buoy when the salvagee was laid hold of with a boathook and the bite of the hawser thrown over the crosshead  but the salvagee by this method was always left at the buoy and was of course more liable to chafe and wear than a hawser passed through the ring which could be wattled with canvas and shifted at pleasure  the salvagee and cross method is however much practised but the experience of this morning showed it to be very unsuitable for vessels riding in an exposed situation for any length of time  soon after the artificers landed they commenced work but the wind coming to blow hard the smeaton’s boat and crew who had brought their complement of eight men to the rock went off to examine her riding ropes and see that they were in proper order  the boat had no sooner reached the vessel than she went adrift carrying the boat along with her  by the time that she was got round to make a tack towards the rock she had drifted at least three miles to leeward with the praamboat astern and having both the wind and a tide against her the writer perceived with no little anxiety that she could not possibly return to the rock till long after its being overflowed for owing to the anomaly of the tides formerly noticed the bell rock is completely under water when the ebb abates to the offing  in this perilous predicament indeed he found himself placed between hope and despair—but certainly the latter was by much the most predominant feeling of his mind—situate upon a sunken rock in the middle of the ocean which in the progress of the floodtide was to be laid under water to the depth of at least twelve feet in a stormy sea  there were this morning thirtytwo persons in all upon the rock with only two boats whose complement even in good weather did not exceed twentyfour sitters but to row to the floating light with so much wind and in so heavy a sea a complement of eight men for each boat was as much as could with propriety be attempted so that in this way about onehalf of our number was unprovided for  under these circumstances had the writer ventured to despatch one of the boats in expectation of either working the smeaton sooner up towards the rock or in hopes of getting her boat brought to our assistance this must have given an immediate alarm to the artificers each of whom would have insisted upon taking to his own boat and leaving the eight artificers belonging to the smeaton to their chance  of course a scuffle might have ensued and it is hard to say in the ardour of men contending for life where it might have ended  it has even been hinted to the writer that a party of the pickmen were determined to keep exclusively to their own boat against all hazards  the unfortunate circumstance of the smeaton and her boat having drifted was for a considerable time only known to the writer and to the landingmaster who removed to the farther point of the rock where he kept his eye steadily upon the progress of the vessel  while the artificers were at work chiefly in sitting or kneeling postures excavating the rock or boring with the jumpers and while their numerous hammers with the sound of the smith’s anvil continued the situation of things did not appear so awful  in this state of suspense with almost certain destruction at hand the water began to rise upon those who were at work on the lower parts of the sites of the beacon and lighthouse from the run of sea upon the rock the forge fire was also sooner extinguished this morning than usual and the volumes of smoke having ceased objects in every direction became visible from all parts of the rock  after having had about three ‘hours’ work the men began pretty generally to make towards their respective boats for their jackets and stockings when to their astonishment instead of three they found only two boats the third being adrift with the smeaton  not a word was uttered by any one but all appeared to be silently calculating their numbers and looking to each other with evident marks of perplexity depicted in their countenances  the landingmaster conceiving that blame might be attached to him for allowing the boat to leave the rock still kept at a distance  at this critical moment the author was standing upon an elevated part of smith’s ledge where he endeavoured to mark the progress of the smeaton not a little surprised that her crew did not cut the praam adrift which greatly retarded her way and amazed that some effort was not making to bring at least the boat and attempt our relief  the workmen looked steadfastly upon the writer and turned occasionally towards the vessel still far to leeward 122a  all this passed in the most perfect silence and the melancholy solemnity of the group made an impression never to be effaced from his mind  the writer had all along been considering of various schemes—providing the men could be kept under command—which might be put in practice for the general safety in hopes that the smeaton might be able to pick up the boats to leeward when they were obliged to leave the rock  he was accordingly about to address the artificers on the perilous nature of their circumstances and to propose that all hands should unstrip their upper clothing when the higher parts of the rock were laid under water that the seamen should remove every unnecessary weight and encumbrance from the boats that a specified number of men should go into each boat and that the remainder should hang by the gunwales while the boats were to be rowed gently towards the smeaton as the course to the pharos or floating light lay rather to windward of the rock  but when he attempted to speak his mouth was so parched that his tongue refused utterance and he now learned by experience that the saliva is as necessary as the tongue itself for speech  he turned to one of the pools on the rock and lapped a little water which produced immediate relief but what was his happiness when on rising from this unpleasant beverage some one called out ‘a boat a boat’ and on looking around at no great distance a large boat was seen through the haze making towards the rock  this at once enlivened and rejoiced every heart  the timeous visitor proved to be james spink the bell rock pilot who had come express from arbroath with letters  spink had for some time seen the smeaton and had even supposed from the state of the weather that all hands were on board of her till he approached more nearly and observed people upon the rock but not supposing that the assistance of his boat was necessary to carry the artificers off the rock he anchored on the leeside and began to fish waiting as usual till the letters were sent for as the pilotboat was too large and unwieldy for approaching the rock when there was any roughness or run of the sea at the entrance of the landing creeks  upon this fortunate change of circumstances sixteen of the artificers were sent at two trips in one of the boats with instructions for spink to proceed with them to the floating light  this being accomplished the remaining sixteen followed in the two boats belonging to the service of the rock  every one felt the most perfect happiness at leaving the bell rock this morning though a very hard and even dangerous passage to the floating light still awaited us as the wind by this time had increased to a pretty hard gale accompanied with a considerable swell of sea every one was as completely drenched in water as if he had been dragged astern of the boats  the writer in particular being at the helm found on getting on board that his face and ears were completely coated with a thin film of salt from the sea spray which broke constantly over the bows of the boat  after much baling of water and severe work at the oars the three boats reached the floating light where some new difficulties occurred in getting on board in safety owing partly to the exhausted state of the men and partly to the violent rolling of the vessel  as the tide flowed it was expected that the smeaton would have got to windward but seeing that all was safe after tacking for several hours and making little progress she bore away for arbroath with the praamboat  as there was now too much wind for the pilotboat to return to arbroath she was made fast astern of the floating light and the crew remained on board till next day when the weather moderated  there can be very little doubt that the appearance of james spink with his boat on this critical occasion was the means of preventing the loss of lives at the rock this morning  when these circumstances some years afterwards came to the knowledge of the board a small pension was ordered to our faithful pilot then in his seventieth year and he still continues to wear the uniform clothes and badge of the lighthouse service  spink is a remarkably strong man whose tout ensemble is highly characteristic of a northcountry fisherman  he usually dresses in a péjacket cut after a particular fashion and wears a large flat blue bonnet  a striking likeness of spink in his pilotdress with the badge or insignia on his left arm which is characteristic of the boatmen in the service of the northern lights has been taken by howe and is in the writer’s possession                                                       thursday 3rd sept  the bell rung this morning at five o’clock but the writer must acknowledge from the circumstances of yesterday that its sound was extremely unwelcome  this appears also to have been the feelings of the artificers for when they came to be mustered out of twentysix only eight besides the foreman and seamen appeared upon deck to accompany the writer to the rock  such are the baneful effects of anything like misfortune or accident connected with a work of this description  the use of argument to persuade the men to embark in cases of this kind would have been out of place as it is not only discomfort or even the risk of the loss of a limb but life itself that becomes the question  the boats notwithstanding the thinness of our ranks left the vessel at halfpast five  the rough weather of yesterday having proved but a summer’s gale the wind came today in gentle breezes yet the atmosphere being cloudy it a not a very favourable appearance  the boats reached the rock at six am and the eight artificers who landed were employed in clearing out the batholes for the beaconhouse and had a very prosperous tide of four hours’ work being the longest yet experienced by half an hour  the boats left the rock again at ten o’clock and the weather having cleared up as we drew near the vessel the eighteen artificers who had remained on board were observed upon deck but as the boats approached they sought their way below being quite ashamed of their conduct  this was the only instance of refusal to go to the rock which occurred during the whole progress of the work excepting that of the four men who declined working upon sunday a case which the writer did not conceive to be at all analogous to the present  it may here be mentioned much to the credit of these four men that they stood foremost in embarking for the rock this morning                                                       saturday 5th sept  it was fortunate that a landing was not attempted this evening for at eight o’clock the wind shifted to ese and at ten it had become a hard gale when fifty fathoms of the floating light’s hempen cable were veered out  the gale still increasing the ship rolled and laboured excessively and at midnight eighty fathoms of cable were veered out while the sea continued to strike the vessel with a degree of force which had not before been experienced                                                         sunday 6th sept  during the last night there was little rest on board of the pharos and daylight though anxiously wished for brought no relief as the gale continued with unabated violence  the sea struck so hard upon the vessel’s bows that it rose in great quantities or in ‘green seas’ as the sailors termed it which were carried by the wind as far aft as the quarterdeck and not infrequently over the stern of the ship altogether it fell occasionally so heavily on the skylight of the writer’s cabin though so far aft as to be within five feet of the helm that the glass was broken to pieces before the deadlight could be got into its place so that the water poured down in great quantities  in shutting out the water the admission of light was prevented and in the morning all continued in the most comfortless state of darkness  about ten o’clock am the wind shifted to ne and blew if possible harder than before and it was accompanied by a much heavier swell of sea  in the course of the gale the part of the cable in the hausehole had been so often shifted that nearly the whole length of one of her hempen cables of 120 fathoms had been veered out besides the chainmoorings  the cable for its preservation was also carefully served or wattled with pieces of canvas round the windlass and with leather well greased in the hausehole  in this state things remained during the whole day every sea which struck the vessel—and the seas followed each other in close succession—causing her to shake and all on board occasionally to tremble  at each of these strokes of the sea the rolling and pitching of the vessel ceased for a time and her motion was felt as if she had either broke adrift before the wind or were in the act of sinking but when another sea came she ranged up against it with great force and this became the regular intimation of our being still riding at anchor  about eleven o’clock the writer with some difficulty got out of bed but in attempting to dress he was thrown twice upon the floor at the opposite end of the cabin  in an undressed state he made shift to get about halfway up the companionstairs with an intention to observe the state of the sea and of the ship upon deck but he no sooner looked over the companion than a heavy sea struck the vessel which fell on the quarterdeck and rushed downstairs in the officers’ cabin in so considerable a quantity that it was found necessary to lift one of the scuttles in the floor to let the water into the limbers of the ship as it dashed from side to side in such a manner as to run into the lower tier of beds  having been foiled in this attempt and being completely wetted he again got below and went to bed  in this state of the weather the seamen had to move about the necessary or indispensable duties of the ship with the most cautious use both of hands and feet while it required all the art of the landsman to keep within the precincts of his bed  the writer even found himself so much tossed about that it became necessary in some measure to shut himself in bed in order to avoid being thrown upon the floor  indeed such was the motion of the ship that it seemed wholly impracticable to remain in any other than a lying posture  on deck the most stormy aspect presented itself while below all was wet and comfortless   about two o’clock pm a great alarm was given throughout the ship from the effects of a very heavy sea which struck her and almost filled the waist pouring down into the berths below through every chink and crevice of the hatches and skylights  from the motion of the vessel being thus suddenly deadened or checked and from the flowing in of the water above it is believed there was not an individual on board who did not think at the moment that the vessel had foundered and was in the act of sinking  the writer could withstand this no longer and as soon as she again began to range to the sea he determined to make another effort to get upon deck  in the first instance however he groped his way in darkness from his own cabin through the berths of the officers where all was quietness  he next entered the galley and other compartments occupied by the artificers  here also all was shut up in darkness the fire having been drowned out in the early part of the gale several of the artificers were employed in prayer repeating psalms and other devotional exercises in a full tone of voice others protesting that if they should fortunately get once more on shore no one should ever see them afloat again  with the assistance of the landingmaster the writer made his way holding on step by step among the numerous impediments which lay in the way  such was the creaking noise of the bulkheads or partitions the dashing of the water and the whistling noise of the winds that it was hardly possible to break in upon such a confusion of sounds  in one or two instances anxious and repeated inquiries were made by the artificers as to the state of things upon deck to which the captain made the usual answer that it could not blow long in this way and that we must soon have better weather  the next berth in succession moving forward in the ship was that allotted for the seamen  here the scene was considerably different  having reached the middle of this darksome berth without its inmates being aware of any intrusion the writer had the consolation of remarking that although they talked of bad weather and the cross accidents of the sea yet the conversation was carried on in that sort of tone and manner which bespoke an ease and composure of mind highly creditable to them and pleasing to him  the writer immediately accosted the seamen about the state of the ship  to these inquiries they replied that the vessel being light and having but little hold of the water no toprigging with excellent groundtackle and everything being fresh and new they felt perfect confidence in their situation  it being impossible to open any of the hatches in the fore part of the ship in communicating with the deck the watch was changed by passing through the several berths to the companionstair leading to the quarterdeck  the writer therefore made the best of his way aft and on a second attempt to look out he succeeded and saw indeed an astonishing sight  the sea or waves appeared to be ten or fifteen feet in height of unbroken water and every approaching billow seemed as if it would overwhelm our vessel but she continued to rise upon the waves and to fall between the seas in a very wonderful manner  it seemed to be only those seas which caught her in the act of rising which struck her with so much violence and threw such quantities of water aft  on deck there was only one solitary individual looking out to give the alarm in the event of the ship breaking from her moorings  the seaman on watch continued only two hours he who kept watch at this time was a tall slender man of a black complexion he had no greatcoat nor overall of any kind but was simply dressed in his ordinary jacket and trousers his hat was tied under his chin with a napkin and he stood aft the foremast to which he had lashed himself with a gasket or small rope round his waist to prevent his falling upon deck or being washed overboard  when the writer looked up he appeared to smile which afforded a further symptom of the confidence of the crew in their ship  this person on watch was as completely wetted as if he had been drawn through the sea which was given as a reason for his not putting on a greatcoat that he might wet as few of his clothes as possible and have a dry shift when he went below  upon deck everything that was movable was out of sight having either been stowed below previous to the gale or been washed overboard  some trifling parts of the quarter boards were damaged by the breach of the sea and one of the boats upon deck was about onethird full of water the oylehole or drain having been accidently stopped up and part of her gunwale had received considerable injury  these observations were hastily made and not without occasionally shutting the companion to avoid being wetted by the successive seas which broke over the bows and fell upon different parts of the deck according to the impetus with which the waves struck the vessel  by this time it was about three o’clock in the afternoon and the gale which had now continued with unabated force for twentyseven hours had not the least appearance of going off  in the dismal prospect of undergoing another night like the last and being in imminent hazard of parting from our cable the writer thought it necessary to advise with the master and officers of the ship as to the probable event of the vessel’s drifting from her moorings  they severally gave it as their opinion that we had now every chance of riding out the gale which in all probability could not continue with the same fury many hours longer and that even if she should part from her anchor the stormsails had been laid to hand and could be bent in a very short time  they further stated that from the direction of the wind being ne she would sail up the firth of forth to leith roads  but if this should appear doubtful after passing the island and light of may it might be advisable at once to steer for tyningham sands on the western side of dunbar and there run the vessel ashore  if this should happen at the time of highwater or during the ebbing of the tide they were of opinion from the flatness and strength of the floating light that no danger would attend her taking the ground even with a very heavy sea the writer seeing the confidence which these gentlemen possessed with regard to the situation of things found himself as much relieved with this conversation as he had previously been with the seeming indifference of the forecastle men and the smile of the watch upon deck though literally lashed to the foremast  from this time he felt himself almost perfectly at ease at any rate he was entirely resigned to the ultimate result  about six o’clock in the evening the ship’s company was heard moving upon deck which on the present occasion was rather the cause of alarm  the writer accordingly rang his bell to know what was the matter when he was informed by the steward that the weather looked considerably better and that the men upon deck were endeavouring to ship the smokefunnel of the galley that the people might get some meat  this was a more favourable account than had been anticipated  during the last twentyone hours he himself had not only had nothing to eat but he had almost never passed a thought on the subject  upon the mention of a change of weather he sent the steward to learn how the artificers felt and on his return he stated that they now seemed to be all very happy since the cook had begun to light the galleyfire and make preparations for the suetpudding of sunday which was the only dish to be attempted for the mess from the ease with which it could both be cooked and served up  the principal change felt upon the ship as the wind abated was her increased rolling motion but the pitching was much diminished and now hardly any sea came farther aft than the foremast but she rolled so extremely hard as frequently to dip and take in water over the gunwales and rails in the waist  by nine o’clock all hands had been refreshed by the exertions of the cook and steward and were happy in the prospect of the worst of the gale being over  the usual complement of men was also now set on watch and more quietness was experienced throughout the ship although the previous night had been a very restless one it had not the effect of inducing repose in the writer’s berth on the succeeding night for having been so much tossed about in bed during the last thirty hours he found no easy spot to turn to and his body was all sore to the touch which ill accorded with the unyielding materials with which his bedplace was surrounded                                                         monday 7th sept  this morning about eight o’clock the writer was agreeably surprised to see the scuttle of his cabin skylight removed and the bright rays of the sun admitted  although the ship continued to roll excessively and the sea was still running very high yet the ordinary business on board seemed to be going forward on deck  it was impossible to steady a telescope so as to look minutely at the progress of the waves and trace their breach upon the bell rock but the height to which the crossrunning waves rose in sprays when they met each other was truly grand and the continued roar and noise of the sea was very perceptible to the ear  to estimate the height of the sprays at forty or fifty feet would surely be within the mark  those of the workmen who were not much afflicted with seasickness came upon deck and the wetness below being dried up the cabins were again brought into a habitable state  every one seemed to meet as if after a long absence congratulating his neighbour upon the return of good weather  little could be said as to the comfort of the vessel but after riding out such a gale no one felt the least doubt or hesitation as to the safety and good condition of her moorings  the master and mate were extremely anxious however to heave in the hempen cable and see the state of the clinch or iron ring of the chaincable  but the vessel rolled at such a rate that the seamen could not possibly keep their feet at the windlass nor work the handspikes though it had been several times attempted since the gale took off  about twelve noon however the vessel’s motion was observed to be considerably less and the sailors were enabled to walk upon deck with some degree of freedom  but to the astonishment of every one it was soon discovered that the floating light was adrift  the windlass was instantly manned and the men soon gave out that there was no strain upon the cable  the mizzen sail which was bent for the occasional purpose of making the vessel ride more easily to the tide was immediately set and the other sails were also hoisted in a short time when in no small consternation we bore away about one mile to the southwestward of the former station and there let go the best bower anchor and cable in twenty fathoms water to ride until the swell of the sea should fall when it might be practicable to grapple for the moorings and find a better anchorage for the ship                                                       tuesday 15th sept  this morning at five am the bell rung as a signal for landing upon the rock a sound which after a lapse of ten days it is believed was welcomed by every one on board  there being a heavy breach of sea at the eastern creek we landed though not without difficulty on the western side every one seeming more eager than another to get upon the rock and never did hungry men sit down to a hearty meal with more appetite than the artificers began to pick the dulse from the rocks  this marine plant had the effect of reviving the sickly and seemed to be no less relished by those who were more hardy  while the water was ebbing and the men were roaming in quest of their favourite morsel the writer was examining the effects of the storm upon the forge and loose apparatus left upon the rock  six large blocks of granite which had been landed by way of experiment on the 1st instant were now removed from their places and by the force of the sea thrown over a rising ledge into a hole at the distance of twelve or fifteen paces from the place on which they had been landed  this was a pretty good evidence both of the violence of the storm and the agitation of the sea upon the rock  the safety of the smith’s forge was always an object of essential regard  the ashpan of the hearth or fireplace with its weighty castiron back had been washed from their places of supposed security the chains of attachment had been broken and these ponderous articles were found at a very considerable distance in a hole on the western side of the rock while the tools and picks of the aberdeen masons were scattered about in every direction  it is however remarkable that not a single article was ultimately lost  this being the night on which the floating light was advertised to be lighted it was accordingly exhibited to the great joy of every one                                                     wednesday 16th sept  the writer was made happy today by the return of the lighthouse yacht from a voyage to the northern lighthouses  having immediately removed on board of this fine vessel of eightyone tons register the artificers gladly followed for though they found themselves more pinched for accommodation on board of the yacht and still more so in the smeaton yet they greatly preferred either of these to the pharos or floating light on account of her rolling motion though in all respects fitted up for their conveniency  the writer called them to the quarterdeck and informed them that having been one mouth afloat in terms of their agreement they were now at liberty to return to the workyard at arbroath if they preferred this to continuing at the bell rock  but they replied that in the prospect of soon getting the beacon erected upon the rock and having made a change from the floating light they were now perfectly reconciled to their situation and would remain afloat till the end of the working season                                                      thursday 17th sept  the wind was at ne this morning and though they were only light airs yet there was a pretty heavy swell coming ashore upon the rock  the boats landed at halfpast seven o’clock am at the creek on the southern side of the rock marked port hamilton  but as one of the boats was in the act of entering this creek the seaman at the bowoar who had just entered the service having inadvertently expressed some fear from a heavy sea which came rolling towards the boat and one of the artificers having at the same time looked round and missed a stroke with his oar such a preponderance was thus given to the rowers upon the opposite side that when the wave struck the boat it threw her upon a ledge of shelving rocks where the water left her and she having kanted to seaward the next wave completely filled her with water  after making considerable efforts the boat was again got afloat in the proper track of the creek so that we landed without any other accident than a complete ducking there being no possibility of getting a shift of clothes the artificers began with all speed to work so as to bring themselves into heat while the writer and his assistants kept as much as possible in motion  having remained more than an hour upon the rock the boats left it at halfpast nine and after getting on board the writer recommended to the artificers as the best mode of getting into a state of comfort to strip off their wet clothes and go to bed for an hour or two  no further inconveniency was felt and no one seemed to complain of the affection called ‘catching cold’                                                        friday 18th sept  an important occurrence connected with the operations of this season was the arrival of the smeaton at four pm having in tow the six principal beams of the beaconhouse together with all the stanchions and other work on board for fixing it on the rock  the mooring of the floating light was a great point gained but in the erection of the beacon at this late period of the season new difficulties presented themselves  the success of such an undertaking at any season was precarious because a single day of bad weather occurring before the necessary fixtures could be made might sweep the whole apparatus from the rock  notwithstanding these difficulties the writer had determined to make the trial although he could almost have wished upon looking at the state of the clouds and the direction of the wind that the apparatus for the beacon had been still in the workyard                                                      saturday 19th sept  the main beams of the beacon were made up in two separate rafts fixed with bars and bolts of iron  one of these rafts not being immediately wanted was left astern of the floating light and the other was kept in tow by the smeaton at the buoy nearest to the rock  the lighthouse yacht rode at another buoy with all hands on board that could possibly be spared out of the floating light  the party of artificers and seamen which landed on the rock counted altogether forty in number  at halfpast eight o’clock a derrick or mast of thirty feet in height was erected and properly supported with guyropes for suspending the block for raising the first principal beam of the beacon and a winch machine was also bolted down to the rock for working the purchasetackle  upon raising the derrick all hands on the rock spontaneously gave three hearty cheers as a favourable omen of our future exertions in pointing out more permanently the position of the rock  even to this single spar of timber could it be preserved a drowning man might lay hold  when the smeaton drifted on the 2nd of this month such a spar would have been sufficient to save us till she could have come to our relief                                                        sunday 20th sept  the wind this morning was variable but the weather continued extremely favourable for the operations throughout the whole day  at six am the boats were in motion and the raft consisting of four of the six principal beams of the beaconhouse each measuring about sixteen inches square and fifty feet in length was towed to the rock where it was anchored that it might ground upon it as the water ebbed  the sailors and artificers including all hands today counted no fewer than fiftytwo being perhaps the greatest number of persons ever collected upon the bell rock  it was early in the tide when the boats reached the rock and the men worked a considerable time up to their middle in water every one being more eager than his neighbour to be useful  even the four artificers who had hitherto declined working on sunday were today most zealous in their exertions  they had indeed become so convinced of the precarious nature and necessity of the work that they never afterwards absented themselves from the rock on sunday when a landing was practicable  having made fast a piece of very good new line at about twothirds from the lower end of one of the beams the purchasetackle of the derrick was hooked into the turns of the line and it was speedily raised by the number of men on the rock and the power of the winch tackle  when this log was lifted to a sufficient height its foot or lower end was stepped into the spot which had been previously prepared for it  two of the great iron stanchions were then set in their respective holes on each side of the beam when a rope was passed round them and the beam to prevent it from slipping till it could be more permanently fixed  the derrick or upright spar used for carrying the tackle to raise the first beam was placed in such a position as to become useful for supporting the upper end of it which now became in its turn the prop of the tackle for raising the second beam  the whole difficulty of this operation was in the raising and propping of the first beam which became a convenient derrick for raising the second these again a pair of shears for lifting the third and the shears a triangle for raising the fourth having thus got four of the six principal beams set on end it required a considerable degree of trouble to get their upper ends to fit  here they formed the apex of a cone and were all together mortised into a large piece of beechwood and secured for the present with ropes in a temporary manner  during the short period of one tide all that could further be done for their security was to put a single screwbolt through the great kneed bats or stanchions on each side of the beams and screw the nut home  in this manner these four principal beams were erected and left in a pretty secure state  the men had commenced while there was about two or three feet of water upon the side of the beacon and as the sea was smooth they continued the work equally long during floodtide  two of the boats being left at the rock to take off the joiners who were busily employed on the upper parts till two o’clock pm this tide’s work may be said to have continued for about seven hours which was the longest that had hitherto been got upon the rock by at least three hours  when the first boats left the rock with the artificers employed on the lower part of the work during the floodtide the beacon had quite a novel appearance  the beams erected formed a common base of about thirtythree feet meeting at the top which was about fortyfive feet above the rock and here half a dozen of the artificers were still at work  after clearing the rock the boats made a stop when three hearty cheers were given which were returned with equal goodwill by those upon the beacon from the personal interest which every one felt in the prosperity of this work so intimately connected with his safety  all hands having returned to their respective ships they got a shift of dry clothes and some refreshment  being sunday they were afterwards convened by signal on board of the lighthouse yacht when prayers were read for every heart upon this occasion felt gladness and every mind was disposed to be thankful for the happy and successful termination of the operations of this day                                                        monday 21st sept  the remaining two principal beams were erected in the course of this tide which with the assistance of those set up yesterday was found to be a very simple operation  the six principal beams of the beacon were thus secured at least in a temporary manner in the course of two tides or in the short space of about eleven hours and a half  such is the progress that may be made when active hands and willing minds set properly to work in operations of this kind                                                       tuesday 22nd sept  having now got the weighty part of this work over and being thereby relieved of the difficulty both of landing and victualling such a number of men the smeaton could now be spared and she was accordingly despatched to arbroath for a supply of water and provisions and carried with her six of the artificers who could best be spared                                                     wednesday 23rd sept  in going out of the eastern harbour the boat which the writer steered shipped a sea that filled her about onethird with water  she had also been hid for a short time by the waves breaking upon the rock from the sight of the crew of the preceding boat who were much alarmed for our safety imagining for a time that she had gone down  the smeaton returned from arbroath this afternoon but there was so much sea that she could not be made fast to her moorings and the vessel was obliged to return to arbroath without being able either to deliver the provisions or take the artificers on board  the lighthouse yacht was also soon obliged to follow her example as the sea was breaking heavily over her bows  after getting two reefs in the mainsail and the third or stormjib set the wind being sw she bent to windward though blowing a hard gale and got into st andrews bay where we passed the night under the lee of fifeness                                                      thursday 24th sept  at two o’clock this morning we were in st andrews bay standing off and on shore with strong gales of wind at sw at seven we were off the entrance of the tay at eight stood towards the rock and at ten passed to leeward of it but could not attempt a landing  the beacon however appeared to remain in good order and by six pm the vessel had again beaten up to st andrews bay and got into somewhat smoother water for the night                                                        friday 25th sept  at seven o’clock bore away for the bell rock but finding a heavy sea running on it were unable to land  the writer however had the satisfaction to observe with his telescope that everything about the beacon appeared entire and although the sea had a most frightful appearance yet it was the opinion of every one that since the erection of the beacon the bell rock was divested of many of its terrors and had it been possible to have got the boats hoisted out and manned it might have even been found practicable to land  at six it blew so hard that it was found necessary to strike the topmast and take in a third reef of the mainsail and under this low canvas we soon reached st andrews bay and got again under the lee of the land for the night  the artificers being seahardy were quite reconciled to their quarters on board of the lighthouse yacht but it is believed that hardly any consideration would have induced them again to take up their abode in the floating light                                                      saturday 26th sept  at daylight the yacht steered towards the bell rock and at eight am made fast to her moorings at ten all hands to the amount of thirty landed when the writer had the happiness to find that the beacon had withstood the violence of the gale and the heavy breach of sea everything being found in the same state in which it had been left on the 21st  the artificers were now enabled to work upon the rock throughout the whole day both at low and high water but it required the strictest attention to the state of the weather in case of their being overtaken with a gale which might prevent the possibility of getting them off the rock  two somewhat memorable circumstances in the annals of the bell rock attended the operations of this day one was the removal of mr james dove the foreman smith with his apparatus from the rock to the upper part of the beacon where the forge was now erected on a temporary platform laid on the cross beams or upper framing  the other was the artificers having dined for the first time upon the rock their dinner being cooked on board of the yacht and sent to them by one of the boats but what afforded the greatest happiness and relief was the removal of the large bellows which had all along been a source of much trouble and perplexity by their hampering and incommoding the boat which carried the smiths and their apparatus                                                        saturday 3rd oct  the wind being west today the weather was very favourable for operations at the rock and during the morning and evening tides with the aid of torchlight the masons had seven hours’ work upon the site of the building  the smiths and joiners who landed at halfpast six am did not leave the rock till a quarterpast eleven pm having been at work with little intermission for sixteen hours and threequarters when the water left the rock they were employed at the lower parts of the beacon and as the tide rose or fell they shifted the place of their operations  from these exertions the fixing and securing of the beacon made rapid advancement as the men were now landed in the morning and remained throughout the day  but as a sudden change of weather might have prevented their being taken off at the proper time of tide a quantity of bread and water was always kept on the beacon  during this period of working at the beacon all the day and often a great part of the night the writer was much on board of the tender but while the masons could work on the rock and frequently also while it was covered by the tide he remained on the beacon especially during the night as he made a point of being on the rock to the latest hour and was generally the last person who stepped into the boat  he had laid this down as part of his plan of procedure and in this way had acquired in the course of the first season a pretty complete knowledge and experience of what could actually be done at the bell rock under all circumstances of the weather  by this means also his assistants and the artificers and mariners got into a systematic habit of proceeding at the commencement of the work which it is believed continued throughout the whole of the operations                                                          sunday 4th oct  the external part of the beacon was now finished with its supports and bracingchains and whatever else was considered necessary for its stability in so far as the season would permit and although much was still wanting to complete this fabric yet it was in such a state that it could be left without much fear of the consequences of a storm  the painting of the upper part was nearly finished this afternoon and the smeaton had brought off a quantity of brushwood and other articles for the purpose of heating or charring the lower part of the principal beams before being laid over with successive coats of boiling pitch to the height of from eight to twelve feet or as high as the rise of springtides  a small flagstaff having also been erected today a flag was displayed for the first time from the beacon by which its perspective effect was greatly improved  on this as on all like occasions at the bell rock three hearty cheers were given and the steward served out a dram of rum to all hands while the lighthouse yacht smeaton and floating light hoisted their colours in compliment to the erection                                                          monday 5th oct  in the afternoon and just as the tide’s work was over mr john rennie engineer accompanied by his son mr george on their way to the harbour works of fraserburgh in aberdeenshire paid a visit to the bell rock in a boat from arbroath  it being then too late in the tide for landing they remained on board of the lighthouse yacht all night when the writer who had now been secluded from society for several weeks enjoyed much of mr rennie’s interesting conversation both on general topics and professionally upon the progress of the bell rock works on which he was consulted as chief engineer                                                         tuesday 6th oct  the artificers landed this morning at nine after which one of the boats returned to the ship for the writer and messrs rennie who upon landing were saluted with a display of the colours from the beacon and by three cheers from the workmen  everything was now in a prepared state for leaving the rock and giving up the works afloat for this season excepting some small articles which would still occupy the smiths and joiners for a few days longer  they accordingly shifted on board of the smeaton while the yacht left the rock for arbroath with messrs rennie the writer and the remainder of the artificers  but before taking leave the steward served out a farewell glass when three hearty cheers were given and an earnest wish expressed that everything in the spring of 1808 might be found in the same state of good order as it was now about to be left    ii—operations of 1808                                                          monday 29th feb  the writer sailed from arbroath at one am in the lighthouse yacht  at seven the floating light was hailed and all on board found to be well the crew were observed to have a very healthylike appearance and looked better than at the close of the works upon the rock  they seemed only to regret one thing which was the secession of their cook thomas elliot—not on account of his professional skill but for his facetious and curious manner  elliot had something peculiar in his history and was reported by his comrades to have seen better days  he was however happy with his situation on board of the floating light and having a taste for music dancing and acting plays he contributed much to the amusement of the ship’s company in their dreary abode during the winter months  he had also recommended himself to their notice as a good shipkeeper for as it did not answer elliot to go often ashore he had always given up his turn of leave to his neighbours  at his own desire he was at length paid off when he had a considerable balance of wages to receive which he said would be sufficient to carry him to the west indies and he accordingly took leave of the lighthouse service                                                        tuesday 1st march  at daybreak the lighthouse yacht attended by a boat from the floating light again stood towards the bell rock  the weather felt extremely cold this morning the thermometer being at 34 degrees with the wind at east accompanied by occasional showers of snow and the marine barometer indicated 2980  at halfpast seven the sea ran with such force upon the rock that it seemed doubtful if a landing could be effected  at halfpast eight when it was fairly above water the writer took his place in the floating light’s boat with the artificers while the yacht’s boat followed according to the general rule of having two boats afloat in landing expeditions of this kind that in case of accident to one boat the other might assist  in several unsuccessful attempts the boats were beat back by the breach of the sea upon the rock  on the eastern side it separated into two distinct waves which came with a sweep round to the western side where they met and at the instance of their confluence the water rose in spray to a considerable height  watching what the sailors term a smooth we caught a favourable opportunity and in a very dexterous manner the boats were rowed between the two seas and made a favourable landing at the western creek  at the latter end of last season as was formerly noticed the beacon was painted white and from the bleaching of the weather and the sprays of the sea the upper parts were kept clean but within the range of the tide the principal beams were observed to be thickly coated with a green stuff the conferva of botanists  notwithstanding the intrusion of these works which had formerly banished the numerous seals that played about the rock they were now seen in great numbers having been in an almost undisturbed state for six months  it had now also for the first time got some inhabitants of the feathered tribe in particular the scarth or cormorant and the large herringgull had made the beacon a restingplace from its vicinity to their fishinggrounds  about a dozen of these birds had rested upon the crossbeams which in some places were coated with their dung and their flight as the boats approached was a very unlookedfor indication of life and habitation on the bell rock conveying the momentary idea of the conversion of this fatal rock from being a terror to the mariner into a residence of man and a safeguard to shipping  upon narrowly examining the great iron stanchions with which the beams were fixed to the rock the writer had the satisfaction of finding that there was not the least appearance of working or shifting at any of the joints or places of connection and excepting the loosening of the bracingchains everything was found in the same entire state in which it had been left in the month of october  this in the estimation of the writer was a matter of no small importance to the future success of the work  he from that moment saw the practicability and propriety of fitting up the beacon not only as a place of refuge in case of accident to the boats in landing but as a residence for the artificers during the working months  while upon the top of the beacon the writer was reminded by the landingmaster that the sea was running high and that it would be necessary to set off while the rock afforded anything like shelter to the boats which by this time had been made fast by a long line to the beacon and rode with much agitation each requiring two men with boathooks to keep them from striking each other or from ranging up against the beacon  but even under these circumstances the greatest confidence was felt by every one from the security afforded by this temporary erection  for supposing the wind had suddenly increased to a gale and that it had been found unadvisable to go into the boats or supposing they had drifted or sprung a leak from striking upon the rocks in any of these possible and not at all improbable cases those who might thus have been left upon the rock had now something to lay hold of and though occupying this dreary habitation of the seagull and the cormorant affording only bread and water yet life would be preserved and the mind would still be supported by the hope of being ultimately relieved                                                       wednesday 25th may  on the 25th of may the writer embarked at arbroath on board of the sir joseph banks for the bell rock accompanied by mr logan senior foreman builder with twelve masons and two smiths together with thirteen seamen including the master mate and steward                                                        thursday 26th may  mr james wilson now commander of the pharos floating light and landingmaster in the room of mr sinclair who had left the service came into the writer’s cabin this morning at six o’clock and intimated that there was a good appearance of landing on the rock  everything being arranged both boats proceeded in company and at eight am they reached the rock  the lighthouse colours were immediately hoisted upon the flagstaff of the beacon a compliment which was duly returned by the tender and floating light when three hearty cheers were given and a glass of rum was served out to all hands to drink success to the operations of 1808                                                          friday 27th may  this morning the wind was at east blowing a fresh gale the weather being hazy with a considerable breach of sea setting in upon the rock the morning bell was therefore rung in some doubt as to the practicability of making a landing  after allowing the rock to get fully up or to be sufficiently left by the tide that the boats might have some shelter from the range of the sea they proceeded at 8 am and upon the whole made a pretty good landing and after two hours and threequarters’ work returned to the ship in safety  in the afternoon the wind considerably increased and as a pretty heavy sea was still running the tender rode very hard when mr taylor the commander found it necessary to take in the bowsprit and strike the fore and main topmasts that she might ride more easily  after consulting about the state of the weather it was resolved to leave the artificers on board this evening and carry only the smiths to the rock as the sharpening of the irons was rather behind from their being so much broken and blunted by the hard and tough nature of the rock which became much more compact and hard as the depth of excavation was increased  besides avoiding the risk of encumbering the boats with a number of men who had not yet got the full command of the oar in a breach of sea the writer had another motive for leaving them behind  he wanted to examine the site of the building without interruption and to take the comparative levels of the different inequalities of its area and as it would have been painful to have seen men standing idle upon the bell rock where all moved with activity it was judged better to leave them on board  the boats landed at halfpast seven pm and the landingmaster with the seamen was employed during this tide in cutting the seaweeds from the several paths leading to the landingplaces to render walking more safe for from the slippery state of the surface of the rock many severe tumbles had taken place  in the meantime the writer took the necessary levels and having carefully examined the site of the building and considered all its parts it still appeared to be necessary to excavate to the average depth of fourteen inches over the whole area of the foundation                                                        saturday 28th may  the wind still continued from the eastward with a heavy swell and today it was accompanied with foggy weather and occasional showers of rain notwithstanding this such was the confidence which the erection of the beacon had inspired that the boats landed the artificers on the rock under very unpromising circumstances at halfpast eight and they continued at work till halfpast eleven being a period of three hours which was considered a great tide’s work in the present low state of the foundation  three of the masons on board were so afflicted with seasickness that they had not been able to take any food for almost three days and they were literally assisted into the boats this morning by their companions  it was however not a little surprising to see how speedily these men revived upon landing on the rock and eating a little dulse  two of them afterwards assisted the sailors in collecting the chips of stone and carrying them out of the way of the pickmen but the third complained of a pain in his head and was still unable to do anything  instead of returning to the tender with the boats these three men remained on the beacon all day and had their victuals sent to them along with the smiths’  from mr dove the foreman smith they had much sympathy for he preferred remaining on the beacon at all hazards to be himself relieved from the malady of seasickness  the wind continuing high with a heavy sea and the tide falling late it was not judged proper to land the artificers this evening but in the twilight the boats were sent to fetch the people on board who had been left on the rock                                                          sunday 29th may  the wind was from the sw today and the signalbell rung as usual about an hour before the period for landing on the rock  the writer was rather surprised however to hear the landingmaster repeatedly call ‘all hands for the rock’ and coming on deck he was disappointed to find the seamen only in the boats  upon inquiry it appeared that some misunderstanding had taken place about the wages of the artificers for sundays  they had preferred wages for seven days statedly to the former mode of allowing a day for each tide’s work on sunday as they did not like the appearance of working for double or even treble wages on sunday and would rather have it understood that their work on that day arose more from the urgency of the case than with a view to emolument  this having been judged creditable to their religious feelings and readily adjusted to their wish the boats proceeded to the rock and the work commenced at nine am                                                          monday 30th may  mr francis watt commenced with five joiners to fit up a temporary platform upon the beacon about twentyfive feet above the highest part of the rock  this platform was to be used as the site of the smith’s forge after the beacon should be fitted up as a barrack and here also the mortar was to be mixed and prepared for the building and it was accordingly termed the mortar gallery  the landingmaster’s crew completed the discharging from the smeaton of her cargo of the castiron rails and timber  it must not here be omitted to notice that the smeaton took in ballast from the bell rock consisting of the shivers or chips of stone produced by the workmen in preparing the site of the building which were now accumulating in great quantities on the rock  these the boats loaded after discharging the iron  the object in carrying off these chips besides ballasting the vessel was to get them permanently out of the way as they were apt to shift about from place to place with every gale of wind and it often required a considerable time to clear the foundation a second time of this rubbish  the circumstance of ballasting a ship at the bell rock afforded great entertainment especially to the sailors and it was perhaps with truth remarked that the smeaton was the first vessel that had ever taken on board ballast at the bell rock  mr pool the commander of this vessel afterwards acquainted the writer that when the ballast was landed upon the quay at leith many persons carried away specimens of it as part of a cargo from the bell rock when he added that such was the interest excited from the number of specimens carried away that some of his friends suggested that he should have sent the whole to the cross of edinburgh where each piece might have sold for a penny                                                         tuesday 31st may  in the evening the boats went to the rock and brought the joiners and smiths and their sickly companions on board of the tender  these also brought with them two baskets full of fish which they had caught at highwater from the beacon reporting at the same time to their comrades that the fish were swimming in such numbers over the rock at highwater that it was completely hid from their sight and nothing seen but the movement of thousands of fish  they were almost exclusively of the species called the podlie or young coalfish  this discovery made for the first time today by the workmen was considered fortunate as an additional circumstance likely to produce an inclination among the artificers to take up their residence in the beacon when it came to be fitted up as a barrack                                                         tuesday 7th june  at three o’clock in the morning the ship’s bell was rung as the signal for landing at the rock  when the landing was to be made before breakfast it was customary to give each of the artificers and seamen a dram and a biscuit and coffee was prepared by the steward for the cabins  exactly at four o’clock the whole party landed from three boats including one of those belonging to the floating light with a part of that ship’s crew which always attended the works in moderate weather the landingmaster’s boat called the seaman but more commonly called the lifeboat took the lead  the next boat called the mason was generally steered by the writer while the floating light’s boat pharos was under the management of the boatswain of that ship  having now so considerable a party of workmen and sailors on the rock it may be proper here to notice how their labours were directed preparations having been made last month for the erection of a second forge upon the beacon the smiths commenced their operations both upon the lower and higher platforms  they were employed in sharpening the picks and irons for the masons and in making bats and other apparatus of various descriptions connected with the fitting of the railways  the landingmaster’s crew were occupied in assisting the millwrights in laying the railways to hand  sailors of all other descriptions of men are the most accommodating in the use of their hands  they worked freely with the boringirons and assisted in all the operations of the railways acting by turns as boatmen seamen and artificers  we had no such character on the bell rock as the common labourer  all the operations of this department were cheerfully undertaken by the seamen who both on the rock and on shipboard were the inseparable companions of every work connected with the erection of the bell rock lighthouse it will naturally be supposed that about twentyfive masons occupied with their picks in executing and preparing the foundation of the lighthouse in the course of a tide of about three hours would make a considerable impression upon an area even of fortytwo feet in diameter but in proportion as the foundation was deepened the rock was found to be much more hard and difficult to work while the baling and pumping of water became much more troublesome  a joiner was kept almost constantly employed in fitting the picks to their handles which as well as the points to the irons were very frequently broken  the bell rock this morning presented by far the most busy and active appearance it had exhibited since the erection of the principal beams of the beacon  the surface of the rock was crowded with men the two forges flaming the one above the other upon the beacon while the anvils thundered with the rebounding noise of their wooden supports and formed a curious contrast with the occasional clamour of the surges  the wind was westerly and the weather being extremely agreeable as soon after breakfast as the tide had sufficiently overflowed the rock to float the boats over it the smiths with a number of the artificers returned to the beacon carrying their fishingtackle along with them  in the course of the forenoon the beacon exhibited a still more extraordinary appearance than the rock had done in the morning  the sea being smooth it seemed to be afloat upon the water with a number of men supporting themselves in all the variety of attitude and position while from the upper part of this wooden house the volumes of smoke which ascended from the forges gave the whole a very curious and fanciful appearance  in the course of this tide it was observed that a heavy swell was setting in from the eastward and the appearance of the sky indicated a change of weather while the wind was shifting about  the barometer also had fallen from 30 in to 296  it was therefore judged prudent to shift the vessel to the sw or more distant buoy  her bowsprit was also soon afterwards taken in the topmasts struck and everything made snug as seamen term it for a gale  during the course of the night the wind increased and shifted to the eastward when the vessel rolled very hard and the sea often broke over her bows with great force                                                       wednesday 8th june  although the motion of the tender was much less than that of the floating light—at least in regard to the rolling motion—yet she sended or pitched much  being also of a very handsome build and what seamen term very clean aft the sea often struck the counter with such force that the writer who possessed the aftermost cabin being unaccustomed to this new vessel could not divest himself of uneasiness for when her stern fell into the sea it struck with so much violence as to be more like the resistance of a rock than the sea  the water at the same time often rushed with great force up the ruddercase and forcing up the valve of the watercloset the floor of his cabin was at times laid under water the gale continued to increase and the vessel rolled and pitched in such a manner that the hawser by which the tender was made fast to the buoy snapped and she went adrift  in the act of swinging round to the wind she shipped a very heavy sea which greatly alarmed the artificers who imagined that we had got upon the rock but this from the direction of the wind was impossible  the writer however sprung upon deck where he found the sailors busily employed in rigging out the bowsprit and in setting sail  from the easterly direction of the wind it was considered most advisable to steer for the firth of forth and there wait a change of weather  at two pm we accordingly passed the isle of may at six anchored in leith roads and at eight the writer landed when he came in upon his friends who were not a little surprised at his unexpected appearance which gave an instantaneous alarm for the safety of things at the bell rock                                                        thursday 9th june  the wind still continued to blow very hard at e by n and the sir joseph banks rode heavily and even drifted with both anchors ahead in leith roads  the artificers did not attempt to leave the ship last night but there being upwards of fifty people on board and the decks greatly lumbered with the two large boats they were in a very crowded and impatient state on board  but today they got ashore and amused themselves by walking about the streets of edinburgh some in very humble apparel from having only the worst of their jackets with them which though quite suitable for their work were hardly fit for public inspection being not only tattered but greatly stained with the red colour of the rock                                                         friday 10th june  today the wind was at se with light breezes and foggy weather  at six am the writer again embarked for the bell rock when the vessel immediately sailed  at eleven pm there being no wind the kedgeanchor was let go off anstruther one of the numerous towns on the coast of fife where we waited the return of the tide                                                       saturday 11th june  at six am the sir joseph got under weigh and at eleven was again made fast to the southern buoy at the bell rock  though it was now late in the tide the writer being anxious to ascertain the state of things after the gale landed with the artificers to the number of fortyfour everything was found in an entire state but as the tide was nearly gone only half an hour’s work had been got when the site of the building was overflowed  in the evening the boats again landed at nine and after a good tide’s work of three hours with torchlight the work was left off at midnight  to the distant shipping the appearance of things under night on the bell rock when the work was going forward must have been very remarkable especially to those who were strangers to the operations  mr john reid principal lightkeeper who also acted as master of the floating light during the working months at the rock described the appearance of numerous lights situated so low in the water when seen at the distance of two or three miles as putting him in mind of milton’s description of the fiends in the lower regions adding ‘for it seems greatly to surpass willo’thewisp or any of those earthly spectres of which we have so often heard’                                                         monday 13th june  from the difficulties attending the landing on the rock owing to the breach of sea which had for days past been around it the artificers showed some backwardness at getting into the boats this morning but after a little explanation this was got over  it was always observable that for some time after anything like danger had occurred at the rock the workmen became much more cautious and on some occasions their timidity was rather troublesome  it fortunately happened however that along with the writer’s assistants and the sailors there were also some of the artificers themselves who felt no such scruples and in this way these difficulties were the more easily surmounted  in matters where life is in danger it becomes necessary to treat even unfounded prejudices with tenderness as an accident under certain circumstances would not only have been particularly painful to those giving directions but have proved highly detrimental to the work especially in the early stages of its advancement  at four o’clock fiftyeight persons landed but the tides being extremely languid the water only left the higher parts of the rock and no work could be done at the site of the building  a third forge was however put in operation during a short time for the greater conveniency of sharpening the picks and irons and for purposes connected with the preparations for fixing the railways on the rock  the weather towards the evening became thick and foggy and there was hardly a breath of wind to ruffle the surface of the water  had it not therefore been for the noise from the anvils of the smiths who had been left on the beacon throughout the day which afforded a guide for the boats a landing could not have been attempted this evening especially with such a company of artificers  this circumstance confirmed the writer’s opinion with regard to the propriety of connecting large bells to be rung with machinery in the lighthouse to be tolled day and night during the continuance of foggy weather                                                       thursday 23rd june  the boats landed this evening when the artificers had again two hours’ work  the weather still continuing very thick and foggy more difficulty was experienced in getting on board of the vessels tonight than had occurred on any previous occasion owing to a light breeze of wind which carried the sound of the bell and the other signals made on board of the vessels away from the rock  having fortunately made out the position of the sloop smeaton at the ne buoy—to which we were much assisted by the barking of the ship’s dog—we parted with the smeaton’s boat when the boats of the tender took a fresh departure for that vessel which lay about half a mile to the southwestward  yet such is the very deceiving state of the tides that although there was a small binnacle and compass in the landingmaster’s boat we had nevertheless passed the sir joseph a good way when fortunately one of the sailors catched the sound of a blowinghorn  the only firearms on board were a pair of swivels of oneinch calibre but it is quite surprising how much the sound is lost in foggy weather as the report was heard but at a very short distance  the sound from the explosion of gunpowder is so instantaneous that the effect of the small guns was not so good as either the blowing of a horn or the tolling of a bell which afforded a more constant and steady direction for the pilot                                                       wednesday 6th july  landed on the rock with the three boats belonging to the tender at five pm and began immediately to bale the water out of the foundationpit with a number of buckets while the pumps were also kept in action with relays of artificers and seamen  the work commenced upon the higher parts of the foundation as the water left them but it was now pretty generally reduced to a level  about twenty men could be conveniently employed at each pump and it is quite astonishing in how short a time so great a body of water could be drawn off  the water in the foundationpit at this time measured about two feet in depth on an area of fortytwo feet in diameter and yet it was drawn off in the course of about half an hour  after this the artificers commenced with their picks and continued at work for two hours and a half some of the sailors being at the same time busily employed in clearing the foundation of chips and in conveying the irons to and from the smiths on the beacon where they were sharped  at eight o’clock the sea broke in upon us and overflowed the foundationpit when the boats returned to the tender                                                        thursday 7th july  the landingmaster’s bell rung this morning about four o’clock and at halfpast five the foundation being cleared the work commenced on the site of the building  but from the moment of landing the squad of joiners and millwrights was at work upon the higher parts of the rock in laying the railways while the anvils of the smith resounded on the beacon and such columns of smoke ascended from the forges that they were often mistaken by strangers at a distance for a ship on fire  after continuing three hours at work the foundation of the building was again overflowed and the boats returned to the ship at halfpast eight o’clock the masons and pickmen had at this period a pretty long day on board of the tender but the smiths and joiners were kept constantly at work upon the beacon the stability and great conveniency of which had now been so fully shown that no doubt remained as to the propriety of fitting it up as a barrack  the workmen were accordingly employed during the period of highwater in making preparations for this purpose  the foundationpit now assumed the appearance of a great platform and the late tides had been so favourable that it became apparent that the first course consisting of a few irregular and detached stones for making up certain inequalities in the interior parts of the site of the building might be laid in the course of the present springtides having been enabled today to get the dimensions of the foundation or first stone accurately taken a mould was made of its figure when the writer left the rock after the tide’s work of this morning in a fast rowingboat for arbroath and upon landing two men were immediately set to work upon one of the blocks from mylnefield quarry which was prepared in the course of the following day as the stonecutters relieved each other and worked both night and day so that it was sent off in one of the stonelighters without delay                                                        saturday 9th july  the site of the foundationstone was very difficult to work from its depth in the rock but being now nearly prepared it formed a very agreeable kind of pastime at highwater for all hands to land the stone itself upon the rock  the landingmaster’s crew and artificers accordingly entered with great spirit into this operation  the stone was placed upon the deck of the hedderwick praamboat which had just been brought from leith and was decorated with colours for the occasion flags were also displayed from the shipping in the offing and upon the beacon  here the writer took his station with the greater part of the artificers who supported themselves in every possible position while the boats towed the praam from her moorings and brought her immediately over the site of the building where her grappling anchors were let go  the stone was then lifted off the deck by a tackle hooked into a lewis bat inserted into it when it was gently lowered into the water and grounded on the site of the building amidst the cheering acclamations of about sixty persons                                                         sunday 10th july  at eleven o’clock the foundationstone was laid to hand  it was of a square form containing about twenty cubic feet and had the figures or date of 1808 simply cut upon it with a chisel  a derrick or spar of timber having been erected at the edge of the hole and guyed with ropes the stone was then hooked to the tackle and lowered into its place when the writer attended by his assistants—mr peter logan mr francis watt and mr james wilson—applied the square the level and the mallet and pronounced the following benediction ‘may the great architect of the universe complete and bless this building’ on which three hearty cheers were given and success to the future operations was drunk with the greatest enthusiasm                                                        tuesday 26th july  the wind being at se this evening we had a pretty heavy swell of sea upon the rock and some difficulty attended our getting off in safety as the boats got aground in the creek and were in danger of being upset upon extinguishing the torchlights about twelve in number the darkness of the night seemed quite horrible the water being also much charged with the phosphorescent appearance which is familiar to every one on shipboard the waves as they dashed upon the rock were in some degree like so much liquid flame  the scene upon the whole was truly awful                                                      wednesday 27th july  in leaving the rock this evening everything after the torches were extinguished had the same dismal appearance as last night but so perfectly acquainted were the landingmaster and his crew with the position of things at the rock that comparatively little inconveniency was experienced on these occasions when the weather was moderate such is the effect of habit even in the most unpleasant situations  if for example it had been proposed to a person accustomed to a city life at once to take up his quarters off a sunken reef and land upon it in boats at all hours of the night the proposition must have appeared quite impracticable and extravagant but this practice coming progressively upon the artificers it was ultimately undertaken with the greatest alacrity  notwithstanding this however it must be acknowledged that it was not till after much labour and peril and many an anxious hour that the writer is enabled to state that the site of the bell rock lighthouse is fully prepared for the first entire course of the building                                                         friday 12th aug  the artificers landed this morning at halfpast ten and after an hour and a half’s work eight stones were laid which completed the first entire course of the building consisting of 123 blocks the last of which was laid with three hearty cheers                                                      saturday 10th sept  landed at nine am and by a quarterpast twelve noon twentythree stones had been laid  the works being now somewhat elevated by the lower courses we got quit of the very serious inconvenience of pumping water to clear the foundationpit  this gave much facility to the operations and was noticed with expressions of as much happiness by the artificers as the seamen had shown when relieved of the continual trouble of carrying the smith’s bellows off the rock prior to the erection of the beacon                                                     wednesday 21st sept  mr thomas macurich mate of the smeaton and james scott one of the crew a young man about eighteen years of age immediately went into their boat to make fast a hawser to the ring in the top of the floating buoy of the moorings and were forthwith to proceed to land their cargo so much wanted at the rock  the tides at this period were very strong and the mooringchain when sweeping the ground had caught hold of a rock or piece of wreck by which the chain was so shortened that when the tide flowed the buoy got almost under water and little more than the ring appeared at the surface  when macurich and scott were in the act of making the hawser fast to the ring the chain got suddenly disentangled at the bottom and this large buoy measuring about seven feet in height and three feet in diameter at the middle tapering to both ends being what seamen term a nunbuoy vaulted or sprung up with such force that it upset the boat which instantly filled with water  mr macurich with much exertion succeeded in getting hold of the boat’s gunwale still above the surface of the water and by this means was saved but the young man scott was unfortunately drowned  he had in all probability been struck about the head by the ring of the buoy for although surrounded with the oars and the thwarts of the boat which floated near him yet he seemed entirely to want the power of availing himself of such assistance and appeared to be quite insensible while pool the master of the smeaton called loudly to him and before assistance could be got from the tender he was carried away by the strength of the current and disappeared  the young man scott was a great favourite in the service having had something uncommonly mild and complaisant in his manner and his loss was therefore universally regretted  the circumstances of his case were also peculiarly distressing to his mother as her husband who was a seaman had for three years past been confined to a french prison and the deceased was the chief support of the family  in order in some measure to make up the loss to the poor woman for the monthly aliment regularly allowed her by her late son it was suggested that a younger boy a brother of the deceased might be taken into the service  this appeared to be rather a delicate proposition but it was left to the landingmaster to arrange according to circumstances such was the resignation and at the same time the spirit of the poor woman that she readily accepted the proposal and in a few days the younger scott was actually afloat in the place of his brother  on representing this distressing case to the board the commissioners were pleased to grant an annuity of £5 to scott’s mother  the smeaton not having been made fast to the buoy had with the ebbtide drifted to leeward a considerable way eastward of the rock and could not till the return of the floodtide be worked up to her moorings so that the present tide was lost notwithstanding all exertions which had been made both ashore and afloat with this cargo the artificers landed at six am but as no materials could be got upon the rock this morning they were employed in boring trenail holes and in various other operations and after four hours’ work they returned on board the tender  when the smeaton got up to her moorings the landingmaster’s crew immediately began to unload her  there being too much wind for towing the praams in the usual way they were warped to the rock in the most laborious manner by their windlasses with successive grapplings and hawsers laid out for this purpose  at six pm the artificers landed and continued at work till halfpast ten when the remaining seventeen stones were laid which completed the third entire course or fourth of the lighthouse with which the building operations were closed for the season    iii—operations of 1809                                                        wednesday 24th may  the last night was the first that the writer had passed in his old quarters on board of the floating light for about twelve months when the weather was so fine and the sea so smooth that even here he felt but little or no motion excepting at the turn of the tide when the vessel gets into what the seamen term the trough of the sea  at six am mr watt who conducted the operations of the railways and beaconhouse had landed with nine artificers  at halfpast one pm mr peter logan had also landed with fifteen masons and immediately proceeded to set up the crane  the sheercrane or apparatus for lifting the stones out of the praamboats at the eastern creek had been already erected and the railways now formed about twothirds of an entire circle round the building some progress had likewise been made with the reach towards the western landingplace  the floors being laid the beacon now assumed the appearance of a habitation  the smeaton was at her moorings with the fernie praamboat astern for which she was laying down moorings and the tender being also at her station the bell rock had again put on its former busy aspect                                                       wednesday 31st may  the landingmaster’s bell often no very favourite sound rung at six this morning but on this occasion it is believed it was gladly received by all on board as the welcome signal of the return of better weather  the masons laid thirteen stones today which the seamen had landed together with other building materials  during these twentyfour hours the wind was from the south blowing fresh breezes accompanied with showers of snow  in the morning the snow showers were so thick that it was with difficulty the landingmaster who always steered the leading boat could make his way to the rock through the drift  but at the bell rock neither snow nor rain nor fog nor wind retarded the progress of the work if unaccompanied by a heavy swell or breach of the sea  the weather during the months of april and may had been uncommonly boisterous and so cold that the thermometer seldom exceeded 40° while the barometer was generally about 2950  we had not only hail and sleet but the snow on the last day of may lay on the decks and rigging of the ship to the depth of about three inches and although now entering upon the month of june the length of the day was the chief indication of summer  yet such is the effect of habit and such was the expertness of the landingmaster’s crew that even in this description of weather seldom a tide’s work was lost  such was the ardour and zeal of the heads of the several departments at the rock including mr peter logan foreman builder mr francis watt foreman millwright and captain wilson landingmaster that it was on no occasion necessary to address them excepting in the way of precaution or restraint  under these circumstances however the writer not unfrequently felt considerable anxiety of which this day’s experience will afford an example                                                        thursday 1st june  this morning at a quarterpast eight the artificers were landed as usual and after three hours and threequarters’ work five stones were laid the greater part of this tide having been taken up in completing the boring and trenailing of the stones formerly laid  at noon the writer with the seamen and artificers proceeded to the tender leaving on the beacon the joiners and several of those who were troubled with seasickness—among whom was mr logan who remained with mr watt—counting altogether eleven persons  during the first and middle parts of these twentyfour hours the wind was from the east blowing what the seamen term ‘fresh breezes’ but in the afternoon it shifted to ene accompanied with so heavy a swell of sea that the smeaton and tender struck their topmasts launched in their boltsprits and ‘made all snug’ for a gale  at four pm the smeaton was obliged to slip her moorings and passed the tender drifting before the wind with only the foresail set  in passing mr pool hailed that he must run for the firth of forth to prevent the vessel from ‘riding under’  on board of the tender the writer’s chief concern was about the eleven men left upon the beacon  directions were accordingly given that everything about the vessel should be put in the best possible state to present as little resistance to the wind as possible that she might have the better chance of riding out the gale  among these preparations the best bower cable was bent so as to have a second anchor in readiness in case the mooringhawser should give way that every means might be used for keeping the vessel within sight of the prisoners on the beacon and thereby keep them in as good spirits as possible  from the same motive the boats were kept afloat that they might be less in fear of the vessel leaving her station  the landingmaster had however repeatedly expressed his anxiety for the safety of the boats and wished much to have them hoisted on board  at seven pm one of the boats as he feared was unluckily filled with sea from a wave breaking into her and it was with great difficulty that she could be baled out and got on board with the loss of her oars rudder and loose thwarts  such was the motion of the ship that in taking this boat on board her gunwale was stove in and she otherwise received considerable damage  night approached but it was still found quite impossible to go near the rock consulting therefore the safety of the second boat she also was hoisted on board of the tender  at this time the cabins of the beacon were only partially covered and had neither been provided with bedding nor a proper fireplace while the stock of provisions was but slender  in these uncomfortable circumstances the people on the beacon were left for the night nor was the situation of those on board of the tender much better  the rolling and pitching motion of the ship was excessive and excepting to those who had been accustomed to a residence in the floating light it seemed quite intolerable  nothing was heard but the hissing of the winds and the creaking of the bulkheads or partitions of the ship the night was therefore spent in the most unpleasant reflections upon the condition of the people on the beacon especially in the prospect of the tender being driven from her moorings  but even in such a case it afforded some consolation that the stability of the fabric was never doubted and that the boats of the floating light were at no great distance and ready to render the people on the rock the earliest assistance which the weather would permit  the writer’s cabin being in the sternmost part of the ship which had what sailors term a good entry or was sharp built the sea as before noticed struck her counter with so much violence that the water with a rushing noise continually forced its way up the ruddercase lifted the valve of the watercloset and overran the cabin floor  in these circumstances daylight was eagerly looked for and hailed with delight as well by those afloat as by the artificers upon the rock                                                          friday 2nd june  in the course of the night the writer held repeated conversations with the officer on watch who reported that the weather continued much in the same state and that the barometer still indicated 2920 inches  at six am the landingmaster considered the weather to have somewhat moderated and from certain appearances of the sky he was of opinion that a change for the better would soon take place  he accordingly proposed to attempt a landing at lowwater and either get the people off the rock or at least ascertain what state they were in  at nine am he left the vessel with a boat well manned carrying with him a supply of cooked provisions and a teakettle full of mulled port wine for the people on the beacon who had not had any regular diet for about thirty hours while they were exposed during that period in a great measure both to the winds and the sprays of the sea  the boat having succeeded in landing she returned at eleven am with the artificers who had got off with considerable difficulty and who were heartily welcomed by all on board  upon inquiry it appeared that three of the stones last laid upon the building had been partially lifted from their beds by the force of the sea and were now held only by the trenails and that the castiron sheercrane had again been thrown down and completely broken  with regard to the beacon the sea at highwater had lifted part of the mortar gallery or lowest floor and washed away all the limecasks and other movable articles from it but the principal parts of this fabric had sustained no damage  on pressing messrs logan and watt on the situation of things in the course of the night mr logan emphatically said ‘that the beacon had an illfaured 171a twist when the sea broke upon it at highwater but that they were not very apprehensive of danger’  on inquiring as to how they spent the night it appeared that they had made shift to keep a small fire burning and by means of some old sails defended themselves pretty well from the sea sprays  it was particularly mentioned that by the exertions of james glen one of the joiners a number of articles were saved from being washed off the mortar gallery  glen was also very useful in keeping up the spirits of the forlorn party  in the early part of life he had undergone many curious adventures at sea which he now recounted somewhat after the manner of the tales of the arabian nights  when one observed that the beacon was a most comfortless lodging glen would presently introduce some of his exploits and hardships in comparison with which the state of things at the beacon bore an aspect of comfort and happiness  looking to their slender stock of provisions and their perilous and uncertain chance of speedy relief he would launch out into an account of one of his expeditions in the north sea when the vessel being much disabled in a storm was driven before the wind with the loss of almost all their provisions and the ship being much infested with rats the crew hunted these vermin with great eagerness to help their scanty allowance  by such means glen had the address to make his companions in some measure satisfied or at least passive with regard to their miserable prospects upon this halftide rock in the middle of the ocean  this incident is noticed more particularly to show the effects of such a happy turn of mind even under the most distressing and illfated circumstances                                                       saturday 17th june  at eight am the artificers and sailors fortyfive in number landed on the rock and after four hours’ work seven stones were laid  the remainder of this tide from the threatening appearance of the weather was occupied in trenailing and making all things as secure as possible at twelve noon the rock and building were again overflowed when the masons and seamen went on board of the tender but mr watt with his squad of ten men remained on the beacon throughout the day  as it blew fresh from the nw in the evening it was found impracticable either to land the building artificers or to take the artificers off the beacon and they were accordingly left there all night but in circumstances very different from those of the 1st of this month  the house being now in a more complete state was provided with bedding and they spent the night pretty well though they complained of having been much disturbed at the time of highwater by the shaking and tremulous motion of their house and by the plashing noise of the sea upon mortar gallery  here james glen’s versatile powers were again at work in cheering up those who seemed to be alarmed and in securing everything as far as possible  on this occasion he had only to recall to the recollections of some of them the former night which they had spent on the beacon the wind and sea being then much higher and their habitation in a far less comfortable state  the wind still continuing to blow fresh from the nw at five pm the writer caused a signal to be made from the tender for the smeaton and patriot to slip their moorings when they ran for lunan bay an anchorage on the east side of the redhead  those on board of the tender spent but a very rough night and perhaps slept less soundly than their companions on the beacon especially as the wind was at nw which caused the vessel to ride with her stern towards the bell rock so that in the event of anything giving way she could hardly have escaped being stranded upon it                                                         sunday 18th june  the weather having moderated today the wind shifted to the westward at a quarterpast nine am the artificers landed from the tender and had the pleasure to find their friends who had been left on the rock quite hearty alleging that the beacon was the preferable quarters of the two                                                       saturday 24th june  mr peter logan the foreman builder and his squad twentyone in number landed this morning at three o’clock and continued at work four hours and a quarter and after laying seventeen stones returned to the tender  at six am mr francis watt and his squad of twelve men landed and proceeded with their respective operations at the beacon and railways and were left on the rock during the whole day without the necessity of having any communication with the tender the kitchen of the beaconhouse being now fitted up  it was today also that peter fortune—a most obliging and wellknown character in the lighthouse service—was removed from the tender to the beacon as cook and steward with a stock of provisions as ample as his limited storeroom would admit  when as many stones were built as comprised this day’s work the demand for mortar was proportionally increased and the task of the mortarmakers on these occasions was both laborious and severe  this operation was chiefly performed by john watt—a strong active quarrier by profession—who was a perfect character in his way and extremely zealous in his department  while the operations of the mortarmakers continued the forge upon the gallery was not generally in use but as the working hours of the builders extended with the height of the building the forge could not be so long wanted and then a sad confusion often ensued upon the circumscribed floor of the mortar gallery as the operations of watt and his assistants trenched greatly upon those of the smiths  under these circumstances the boundary of the smiths was much circumscribed and they were personally annoyed especially in blowy weather with the dust of the lime in its powdered state  the mortarmakers on the other hand were often not a little distressed with the heat of the fire and the sparks elicited on the anvil and not unaptly complained that they were placed between the ‘devil and the deep sea’                                                         sunday 25th june  the work being now about ten feet in height admitted of a ropeladder being distended 174a between the beacon and the building  by this ‘jacob’s ladder’ as the seamen termed it a communication was kept up with the beacon while the rock was considerably under water  one end of it being furnished with tackleblocks was fixed to the beams of the beacon at the level of the mortar gallery while the further end was connected with the upper course of the building by means of two lewis bats which were lifted from course to course as the work advanced  in the same manner a rope furnished with a travelling pulley was distended for the purpose of transporting the mortarbuckets and other light articles between the beacon and the building which also proved a great conveniency to the work  at this period the ropeladder and tackle for the mortar had a descent from the beacon to the building by and by they were on a level and towards the end of the season when the solid part had attained its full height the ascent was from the mortar gallery to the building                                                         friday 30th june  the artificers landed on the rock this morning at a quarterpast six and remained at work five hours  the cooking apparatus being now in full operation all hands had breakfast on the beacon at the usual hour and remained there throughout the day  the crane upon the building had to be raised today from the eighth to the ninth course an operation which now required all the strength that could be mustered for working the guytackles for as the top of the crane was at this time about thirtyfive feet above the rock it became much more unmanageable  while the beam was in the act of swinging round from one guy to another a great strain was suddenly brought upon the opposite tackle with the end of which the artificers had very improperly neglected to take a turn round some stationary object which would have given them the complete command of the tackle  owing to this simple omission the crane got a preponderancy to one side and fell upon the building with a terrible crash  the surrounding artificers immediately flew in every direction to get out of its way but michael wishart the principal builder having unluckily stumbled upon one of the uncut trenails fell upon his back his body fortunately got between the movable beam and the upright shaft of the crane and was thus saved but his feet got entangled with the wheels of the crane and were severely injured  wishart being a robust young man endured his misfortune with wonderful firmness he was laid upon one of the narrow framed beds of the beacon and despatched in a boat to the tender where the writer was when this accident happened not a little alarmed on missing the crane from the top of the building and at the same time seeing a boat rowing towards the vessel with great speed when the boat came alongside with poor wishart stretched upon a bed covered with blankets a moment of great anxiety followed which was however much relieved when on stepping into the boat he was accosted by wishart though in a feeble voice and with an aspect pale as death from excessive bleeding  directions having been immediately given to the coxswain to apply to mr kennedy at the workyard to procure the best surgical aid the boat was sent off without delay to arbroath  the writer then landed at the rock when the crane was in a very short time got into its place and again put in a working state                                                          monday 3rd july  the writer having come to arbroath with the yacht had an opportunity of visiting michael wishart the artificer who had met with so severe an accident at the rock on the 30th ult and had the pleasure to find him in a state of recovery  from dr stevenson’s account under whose charge he had been placed hopes were entertained that amputation would not be necessary as his patient still kept free of fever or any appearance of mortification and wishart expressed a hope that he might at least be ultimately capable of keeping the light at the bell rock as it was not now likely that he would assist further in building the house                                                        saturday 8th july  it was remarked today with no small demonstration of joy that the tide being neap did not for the first time overflow the building at highwater  flags were accordingly hoisted on the beaconhouse and crane on the top of the building which were repeated from the floating light lighthouse yacht tender smeaton patriot and the two praams  a salute of three guns was also fired from the yacht at highwater when all the artificers being collected on the top of the building three cheers were given in testimony of this important circumstance  a glass of rum was then served out to all hands on the rock and on board of the respective ships                                                         sunday 16th july  besides laying boring trenailing wedging and grouting thirtytwo stones several other operations were proceeded with on the rock at lowwater when some of the artificers were employed at the railways and at highwater at the beaconhouse  the seamen having prepared a quantity of tarpaulin or cloth laid over with successive coats of hot tar the joiners had just completed the covering of the roof with it  this sort of covering was lighter and more easily managed than sheetlead in such a situation  as a further defence against the weather the whole exterior of this temporary residence was painted with three coats of whitelead paint  between the timber framing of the habitable part of the beacon the interstices were to be stuffed with moss as a light substance that would resist dampness and check sifting winds the whole interior was then to be lined with green baize cloth so that both without and within the cabins were to have a very comfortable appearance  although the building artificers generally remained on the rock throughout the day and the millwrights joiners and smiths while their number was considerable remained also during the night yet the tender had hitherto been considered as their night quarters  but the wind having in the course of the day shifted to the nw and as the passage to the tender in the boats was likely to be attended with difficulty the whole of the artificers with mr logan the foreman preferred remaining all night on the beacon which had of late become the solitary abode of georgeforsyth a jobbing upholsterer who had been employed in lining the beaconhouse with cloth and in fitting up the bedding forsyth was a tall thin and rather loosemade man who had an utter aversion at climbing upon the trapladders of the beacon but especially at the process of boating and the motion of the ship which he said ‘was death itself’  he therefore pertinaciously insisted with the landingmaster in being left upon the beacon with a small black dog as his only companion  the writer however felt some delicacy in leaving a single individual upon the rock who must have been so very helpless in case of accident  this fabric had from the beginning been rather intended by the writer to guard against accident from the loss or damage of a boat and as a place for making mortar a smith’s shop and a store for tools during the working months than as permanent quarters nor was it at all meant to be possessed until tile joinerwork was completely finished and his own cabin and that for the foreman in readiness when it was still to be left to the choice of the artificers to occupy the tender or the beacon  he however considered forsyth’s partiality and confidence in the latter as rather a fortunate occurrence                                                      wednesday 19th july  the whole of the artificers twentythree in number now removed of their own accord from the tender to lodge in the beacon together with peter fortune a person singularly adapted for a residence of this kind both from the urbanity of his manners and the versatility of his talents fortune in his person was of small stature and rather corpulent besides being a good scots cook he had acted both as groom and houseservant he had been a soldier a sutler a writer’s clerk and an apothecary from which he possessed the art of writing and suggesting recipes and had hence also perhaps acquired a turn for making collections in natural history  but in his practice in surgery on the bell rock for which he received an annual fee of three guineas he is supposed to have been rather partial to the use of the lancet  in short peter was the factotum of the beaconhouse where he ostensibly acted in the several capacities of cook steward surgeon and barber and kept a statement of the rations or expenditure of the provisions with the strictest integrity  in the present important state of the building when it had just attained the height of sixteen feet and the upper courses and especially the imperfect one were in the wash of the heaviest seas an express boat arrived at the rock with a letter from mr kennedy of the workyard stating that in consequence of the intended expedition to walcheren an embargo had been laid on shipping at all the ports of great britain that both the smeaton and patriot were detained at arbroath and that but for the proper view which mr ramsey the port officer had taken of his orders neither the express boat nor one which had been sent with provisions and necessaries for the floating light would have been permitted to leave the harbour  the writer set off without delay for arbroath and on landing used every possible means with the official people but their orders were deemed so peremptory that even boats were not permitted to sail from any port upon the coast  in the meantime the collector of the customs at montrose applied to the board at edinburgh but could of himself grant no relief to the bell rock shipping  at this critical period mr adam duff then sheriff of forfarshire now of the county of edinburgh and ex officio one of the commissioners of the northern lighthouses happened to be at arbroath  mr duff took an immediate interest in representing the circumstances of the case to the board of customs at edinburgh  but such were the doubts entertained on the subject that on having previously received the appeal from the collector at montrose the case had been submitted to the consideration of the lords of the treasury whose decision was now waited for  in this state of things the writer felt particularly desirous to get the thirteenth course finished that the building might be in a more secure state in the event of bad weather  an opportunity was therefore embraced on the 25th in sailing with provisions for the floating light to carry the necessary stones to the rock for this purpose which were landed and built on the 26th and 27th  but so closely was the watch kept up that a customhouse officer was always placed on board of the smeaton and patriot while they were afloat till the embargo was especially removed from the lighthouse vessels  the artificers at the bell rock had been reduced to fifteen who were regularly supplied with provisions along with the crew of the floating light mainly through the port officer’s liberal interpretation of his orders                                                         tuesday 1st aug  there being a considerable swell and breach of sea upon the rock yesterday the stones could not be got landed till the day following when the wind shifted to the southward and the weather improved  but today no less than seventyeight blocks of stone were landed of which forty were built which completed the fourteenth and part of the fifteenth courses  the number of workmen now resident in the beaconhouse was augmented to twentyfour including the landingmaster’s crew from the tender and the boat’s crew from the floating light who assisted at landing the stones  those daily at work upon the rock at this period amounted to fortysix  a cabin had been laid out for the writer on the beacon but his apartment had been the last which was finished and he had not yet taken possession of it for though he generally spent the greater part of the day at this time upon the rock yet he always slept on board of the tender                                                         friday 11th aug  the wind was at s e on the 11th and there was so very heavy a swell of sea upon the rock that no boat could approach it                                                       saturday 12th aug  the gale still continuing from the se the sea broke with great violence both upon the building and the beacon  the former being twentythree feet in height the upper part of the crane erected on it having been lifted from course to course as the building advanced was now about thirtysix feet above the rock  from observations made on the rise of the sea by this crane the artificers were enabled to estimate its height to be about fifty feet above the rock while the sprays fell with a most alarming noise upon their cabins  at lowwater in the evening a signal was made from the beacon at the earnest desire of some of the artificers for the boats to come to the rock and although this could not be effected without considerable hazard it was however accomplished when twelve of their number being much afraid applied to the foreman to be relieved and went on board of the tender  but the remaining fourteen continued on the rock with mr peter logan the foreman builder  although this rule of allowing an option to every man either to remain on the rock or return to the tender was strictly adhered to yet as it would have been extremely inconvenient to have the men parcelled out in this manner it became necessary to embrace the first opportunity of sending those who had left the beacon to the workyard with as little appearance of intention as possible lest it should hurt their feelings or prevent others from acting according to their wishes either in landing on the rock or remaining on the beacon                                                        tuesday 15th aug  the wind had fortunately shifted to the sw this morning and though a considerable breach was still upon the rock yet the landingmaster’s crew were enabled to get one praamboat lightly loaded with five stones brought in safety to the western creek these stones were immediately laid by the artificers who gladly embraced the return of good weather to proceed with their operations  the writer had this day taken possession of his cabin in the beaconhouse  it was small but commodious and was found particularly convenient in coarse and blowing weather instead of being obliged to make a passage to the tender in an open boat at all times both during the day and the night which was often attended with much difficulty and danger                                                       saturday 19th aug  for some days past the weather had been occasionally so thick and foggy that no small difficulty was experienced in going even between the rock and the tender though quite at hand  but the floating light’s boat lost her way so far in returning on board that the first land she made after rowing all night was fifeness a distance of about fourteen miles  the weather having cleared in the morning the crew stood off again for the floating light and got on board in a halffamished and much exhausted state having been constantly rowing for about sixteen hours                                                         sunday 20th aug  the weather being very favourable today fiftythree stones were landed and the builders were not a little gratified in having built the twentysecond course consisting of fiftyone stones being the first course which had been completed in one day  this as a matter of course produced three hearty cheers  at twelve noon prayers were read for the first time on the bell rock those present counting thirty were crowded into the upper apartment of the beacon where the writer took a central position while two of the artificers joining hands supported the bible                                                         friday 25th aug  today the artificers laid fortyfive stones which completed the twentyfourth course reckoning above the first entire one and the twentysixth above the rock  this finished the solid part of the building and terminated the height of the outward casing of granite which is thirtyone feet six inches above the rock or site of the foundationstone and about seventeen feet above highwater of springtides  being a particular crisis in the progress of the lighthouse the landing and laying of the last stone for the season was observed with the usual ceremonies  from observations often made by the writer in so far as such can be ascertained it appears that no wave in the open seas in an unbroken state rises more than from seven to nine feet above the general surface of the ocean  the bell rock lighthouse may therefore now be considered at from eight to ten feet above the height of the waves and although the sprays and heavy seas have often been observed in the present state of the building to rise to the height of fifty feet and fall with a tremendous noise on the beaconhouse yet such seas were not likely to make any impression on a mass of solid masonry containing about 1400 tons                                                      wednesday 30th aug  the whole of the artificers left the rock at midday when the tender made sail for arbroath which she reached about six pm  the vessel being decorated with colours and having fired a salute of three guns on approaching the harbour the workyard artificers with a multitude of people assembled at the harbour when mutual cheering and congratulations took place between those afloat and those on the quays the tender had now with little exception been six months on the station at the bell rock and during the last four months few of the squad of builders had been ashore  in particular mr peter logan the foreman and mr robert selkirk principal builder had never once left the rock the artificers having made good wages during their stay like seamen upon a return voyage were extremely happy and spent the evening with much innocent mirth and jollity  in reflecting upon the state of the matters at the bell rock during the working months when the writer was much with the artificers nothing can equal the happy manner in which these excellent workmen spent their time they always went from arbroath to their arduous task cheering and they generally returned in the same hearty state  while at the rock between the tides they amused themselves in reading fishing music playing cards draughts etc or in sporting with one another  in the workyard at arbroath the young men were almost without exception employed in the evening at school in writing and arithmetic and not a few were learning architectural drawing for which they had every convenience and facility and were in a very obliging manner assisted in their studies by mr david logan clerk of the works  it therefore affords the most pleasing reflections to look back upon the pursuits of about sixty individuals who for years conducted themselves on all occasions in a sober and rational manner    iv—operations of 1810                                                         thursday 10th may  the wind had shifted today to wnw when the writer with considerable difficulty was enabled to land upon the rock for the first time this season at ten am  upon examining the state of the building and apparatus in general he had the satisfaction to find everything in good order  the mortar in all the joints was perfectly entire  the building now thirty feet in height was thickly coated with fuci to the height of about fifteen feet calculating from the rock on the eastern side indeed the growth of seaweed was observable to the full height of thirty feet and even on the top or upper bed of the lastlaid course especially towards the eastern side it had germinated so as to render walking upon it somewhat difficult  the beaconhouse was in a perfectly sound state and apparently just as it had been left in the month of november  but the tides being neap the lower parts particularly where the beams rested on the rock could not now be seen  the floor of the mortar gallery having been already laid down by mr watt and his men on a former visit was merely soaked with the sprays but the joistingbeams which supported it had in the course of the winter been covered with a fine downy conferva produced by the range of the sea  they were also a good deal whitened with the mute of the cormorant and other seafowls which had roosted upon the beacon in winter  upon ascending to the apartments it was found that the motion of the sea had thrown open the door of the cookhouse this was only shut with a single latch that in case of shipwreck at the bell rock the mariner might find ready access to the shelter of this forlorn habitation where a supply of provisions was kept and being within two miles and a half of the floating light a signal could readily be observed when a boat might be sent to his relief as the weather permitted  an arrangement for this purpose formed one of the instructions on board of the floating light but happily no instance occurred for putting it in practice  the hearth or fireplace of the cookhouse was built of brick in as secure a manner as possible to prevent accident from fire but some of the plasterwork had shaken loose from its damp state and the tremulous motion of the beacon in stormy weather  the writer next ascended to the floor which was occupied by the cabins of himself and his assistants which were in tolerably good order having only a damp and musty smell  the barrack for the artificers over all was next visited it had now a very dreary and deserted appearance when its former thronged state was recollected  in some parts the water had come through the boarding and had discoloured the lining of green cloth but it was nevertheless in a good habitable condition  while the seamen were employed in landing a stock of provisions a few of the artificers set to work with great eagerness to sweep and clean the several apartments  the exterior of the beacon was in the meantime examined and found in perfect order  the painting though it had a somewhat blanched appearance adhered firmly both on the sides and roof and only two or three panes of glass were broken in the cupola which had either been blown out by the force of the wind or perhaps broken by seafowl  having on this occasion continued upon the building and beacon a considerable time after the tide had begun to flow the artificers were occupied in removing the forge from the top of the building to which the gangway or wooden bridge gave great facility and although it stretched or had a span of fortytwo feet its construction was extremely simple while the roadway was perfectly firm and steady  in returning from this visit to the rock every one was pretty well soused in spray before reaching the tender at two o’clock pm where things awaited the landing party in as comfortable a way as such a situation would admit                                                          friday 11th may  the wind was still easterly accompanied with rather a heavy swell of sea for the operations in hand  a landing was however made this morning when the artificers were immediately employed in scraping the seaweed off the upper course of the building in order to apply the moulds of the first course of the staircase that the joggleholes might be marked off in the upper course of the solid  this was also necessary previously to the writer’s fixing the position of the entrance door which was regulated chiefly by the appearance of the growth of the seaweed on the building indicating the direction of the heaviest seas on the opposite side of which the door was placed  the landingmaster’s crew succeeded in towing into the creek on the western side of the rock the praamboat with the balancecrane which had now been on board of the praam for five days  the several pieces of this machine having been conveyed along the railways upon the waggons to a position immediately under the bridge were elevated to its level or thirty feet above the rock in the following manner  a chaintackle was suspended over a pulley from the crossbeam connecting the tops of the kingposts of the bridge which was worked by a winchmachine with wheel pinion and barrel round which last the chain was wound  this apparatus was placed on the beacon side of the bridge at the distance of about twelve feet from the crossbeam and pulley in the middle of the bridge  immediately under the crossbeam a hatch was formed in the roadway of the bridge measuring seven feet in length and five feet in breadth made to shut with folding boards like a double door through which stones and other articles were raised the folding doors were then let down and the stone or load was gently lowered upon a waggon which was wheeled on railway trucks towards the lighthouse  in this manner the several castings of the balancecrane were got up to the top of the solid of the building  the several apartments of the beaconhouse having been cleaned out and supplied with bedding a sufficient stock of provisions was put into the store when peter fortune formerly noticed lighted his fire in the beacon for the first time this season  sixteen artificers at the same time mounted to their barrackroom and all the foremen of the works also took possession of their cabin all heartily rejoiced at getting rid of the trouble of boating and the sickly motion of the tender                                                        saturday 12th may  the wind was at ene blowing so fresh and accompanied with so much sea that no stones could be landed today  the people on the rock however were busily employed in screwing together the balancecrane cutting out the joggleholes in the upper course and preparing all things for commencing the building operations                                                          sunday 13th may  the weather still continues boisterous although the barometer has all the while stood at about 30 inches  towards evening the wind blew so fresh at e by s that the boats both of the smeaton and tender were obliged to be hoisted in and it was feared that the smeaton would have to slip her moorings  the people on the rock were seen busily employed and had the balancecrane apparently ready for use but no communication could be had with them today                                                          monday 14th may  the wind continued to blow so fresh and the smeaton rode so heavily with her cargo that at noon a signal was made for her getting under weigh when she stood towards arbroath and on board of the tender we are still without any communication with the people on the rock where the sea was seen breaking over the top of the building in great sprays and raging with much agitation among the beams of the beacon                                                        thursday 17th may  the wind in the course of the day had shifted from north to west the sea being also considerably less a boat landed on the rock at six pm for the first time since the 11th with the provisions and water brought off by the patriot  the inhabitants of the beacon were all well but tired above measure for want of employment as the balancecrane and apparatus was all in readiness  under these circumstances they felt no less desirous of the return of good weather than those afloat who were continually tossed with the agitation of the sea  the writer in particular felt himself almost as much fatigued and wornout as he had been at any period since the commencement of the work  the very backward state of the weather at so advanced a period of the season unavoidably created some alarm lest he should be overtaken with bad weather at a late period of the season with the building operations in an unfinished state  these apprehensions were no doubt rather increased by the inconveniences of his situation afloat as the tender rolled and pitched excessively at times  this being also his first offset for the season every bone of his body felt sore with preserving a sitting posture while he endeavoured to pass away the time in reading as for writing it was wholly impracticable  he had several times entertained thoughts of leaving the station for a few days and going into arbroath with the tender till the weather should improve but as the artificers had been landed on the rock he was averse to this at the commencement of the season knowing also that he would be equally uneasy in every situation till the first cargo was landed and he therefore resolved to continue at his post until this should be effected                                                          friday 18th may  the wind being now nw the sea was considerably run down and this morning at five o’clock the landingmaster’s crew thirteen in number left the tender and having now no detention with the landing of artificers they proceeded to unmoor the hedderwick praamboat and towed her alongside of the smeaton and in the course of the day twentythree blocks of stone three casks of pozzolano three of sand three of lime and one of roman cement together with three bundles of trenails and three of wedges were all landed on the rock and raised the top of the building by means of the tackle suspended from the crossbeam on the middle of the bridge  the stones were then moved along the bridge on the waggon to the building within reach of the balancecrane with which they were laid in their respective places on the building  the masons immediately thereafter proceeded to bore the trenailholes into the course below and otherwise to complete the one in hand  when the first stone was to be suspended by the balancecrane the bell on the beacon was rung and all the artificers and seamen were collected on the building  three hearty cheers were given while it was lowered into its place and the steward served round a glass of rum when success was drunk to the further progress of the building                                                          sunday 20th may  the wind was southerly today but there was much less sea than yesterday and the landingmaster’s crew were enabled to discharge and land twentythree pieces of stone and other articles for the work  the artificers had completed the laying of the twentyseventh or first course of the staircase this morning and in the evening they finished the boring trenailing wedging and grouting it with mortar  at twelve o’clock noon the beaconhouse bell was rung and all hands were collected on the top of the building where prayers were read for the first time on the lighthouse which forcibly struck every one and had upon the whole a very impressive effect  from the hazardous situation of the beaconhouse with regard to fire being composed wholly of timber there was no small risk from accident and on this account one of the most steady of the artificers was appointed to see that the fire of the cookinghouse and the lights in general were carefully extinguished at stated hours                                                          monday 4th june  this being the birthday of our muchrevered sovereign king george iii now in the fiftieth year of his reign the shipping of the lighthouse service were this morning decorated with colours according to the taste of their respective captains  flags were also hoisted upon the beaconhouse and balancecrane on the top of the building  at twelve noon a salute was fired from the tender when the king’s health was drunk with all the honours both on the rock and on board of the shipping                                                         tuesday 5th june  as the lighthouse advanced in height the cubical contents of the stones were less but they had to be raised to a greater height and the walls being thinner were less commodious for the necessary machinery and the artificers employed which considerably retarded the work  inconvenience was also occasionally experienced from the men dropping their coats hats mallets and other tools at highwater which were carried away by the tide and the danger to the people themselves was now greatly increased  had any of them fallen from the beacon or building at highwater while the landingmaster’s crew were generally engaged with the craft at a distance it must have rendered the accident doubly painful to those on the rock who at this time had no boat and consequently no means of rendering immediate and prompt assistance  in such cases it would have been too late to have got a boat by signal from the tender  a small boat which could be lowered at pleasure was therefore suspended by a pair of davits projected from the cookhouse the keel being about thirty feet from the rock  this boat with its tackle was put under the charge of james glen of whose exertions on the beacon mention has already been made and who having in early life been a seaman was also very expert in the management of a boat  a lifebuoy was likewise suspended from the bridge to which a coil of line two hundred fathoms in length was attached which could be let out to a person falling into the water or to the people in the boat should they not be able to work her with the oars                                                         tuesday 7th june  today twelve stones were landed on the rock being the remainder of the patriot’s cargo and the artificers built the thirtyninth course consisting of fourteen stones  the bell rock works had now a very busy appearance as the lighthouse was daily getting more into form  besides the artificers and their cook the writer and his servant were also lodged on the beacon counting in all twentynine and at lowwater the landingmaster’s crew consisting of from twelve to fifteen seamen were employed in transporting the building materials working the landing apparatus on the rock and dragging the stone waggons along the railways                                                          friday 8th june  in the course of this day the weather varied much  in the morning it was calm in the middle part of the day there were light airs of wind from the south and in the evening fresh breezes from the east  the barometer in the writer’s cabin in the beaconhouse oscillated from 30 inches to 3042 and the weather was extremely pleasant  this in any situation forms one of the chief comforts of life but as may easily be conceived it was doubly so to people stuck as it were upon a pinnacle in the middle of the ocean                                                         sunday 10th june  one of the praamboats had been brought to the rock with eleven stones notwithstanding the perplexity which attended the getting of those formerly landed taken up to the building  mr peter logan the foreman builder interposed and prevented this cargo from being delivered but the landingmaster’s crew were exceedingly averse to this arrangement from an idea that “ill luck” would in future attend the praam her cargo and those who navigated her from thus reversing her voyage  it may be noticed that this was the first instance of a praamboat having been sent from the bell rock with any part of her cargo on board and was considered so uncommon an occurrence that it became a topic of conversation among the seamen and artificers                                                        tuesday 12th june  today the stones formerly sent from the rock were safely landed notwithstanding the augury of the seamen in consequence of their being sent away two days before                                                       thursday 14th june  today twentyseven stones and eleven jogglepieces were landed part of which consisted of the fortyseventh course forming the storeroom floor the builders were at work this morning by four o’clock in the hopes of being able to accomplish the laying of the eighteen stones of this course  but at eight o’clock in the evening they had still two to lay and as the stones of this course were very unwieldy being six feet in length they required much precaution and care both in lifting and laying them  it was only on the writer’s suggestion to mr logan that the artificers were induced to leave off as they had intended to complete this floor before going to bed  the two remaining stones were however laid in their places without mortar when the bell on the beacon was rung and all hands being collected on the top of the building three hearty cheers were given on covering the first apartment  the steward then served out a dram to each when the whole retired to their barrack much fatigued but with the anticipation of the most perfect repose even in the “hurricanehouse” amidst the dashing seas on the bell rock  while the workmen were at breakfast and dinner it was the writer’s usual practice to spend his time on the walls of the building which notwithstanding the narrowness of the track nevertheless formed his principal walk when the rock was under water  but this afternoon he had his writingdesk set upon the storeroom floor when he wrote to mrs stevenson—certainly the first letter dated from the bell rock lighthouse—giving a detail of the fortunate progress of the work with an assurance that the lighthouse would soon be completed at the rate at which it now proceeded and the patriot having sailed for arbroath in the evening he felt no small degree of pleasure in despatching this communication to his family  the weather still continuing favourable for the operations at the rock the work proceeded with much energy through the exertions both of the seamen and artificers  for the more speedy and effectual working of the several tackles in raising the materials as the building advanced in height and there being a great extent of railway to attend to which required constant repairs two additional millwrights were added to the complement on the rock which including the writer now counted thirtyone in all  so crowded was the men’s barrack that the beds were ranged five tier in height allowing only about one foot eight inches for each bed  the artificers commenced this morning at five o’clock and in the course of the day they laid the fortyeighth and fortyninth courses consisting each of sixteen blocks  from the favourable state of the weather and the regular manner in which the work now proceeded the artificers had generally from four to seven extra hours’ work which including their stated wages of 3s 4d yielded them from 5s 4d to about 6s 10d per day besides their board even the postage of their letters was paid while they were at the bell rock  in these advantages the foremen also shared having about double the pay and amount of premiums of the artificers  the seamen being less out of their element in the bell rock operations than the landsmen their premiums consisted in a slump sum payable at the end of the season which extended from three to ten guineas  as the laying of the floors was somewhat tedious the landingmaster and his crew had got considerably beforehand with the building artificers in bringing materials faster to the rock than they could be built  the seamen having therefore some spare time were occasionally employed during fine weather in dredging or grappling for the several mushroom anchors and mooringchains which had been lost in the vicinity of the bell rock during the progress of the work by the breaking loose and drifting of the floating buoys  to encourage their exertions in this search five guineas were offered as a premium for each set they should find and after much patient application they succeeded today in hooking one of these lost anchors with its chain  it was a general remark at the bell rock as before noticed that fish were never plenty in its neighbourhood excepting in good weather indeed the seamen used to speculate about the state of the weather from their success in fishing  when the fish disappeared at the rock it was considered a sure indication that a gale was not far off as the fish seemed to seek shelter in deeper water from the roughness of the sea during these changes in the weather  at this time the rock at highwater was completely covered with podlies or the fry of the coalfish about six or eight inches in length  the artificers sometimes occupied half an hour after breakfast and dinner in catching these little fishes but were more frequently supplied from the boats of the tender                                                       saturday 16th june  the landingmaster having this day discharged the smeaton and loaded the hedderwick and dickie praamboats with nineteen stones they were towed to their respective moorings when captain wilson in consequence of the heavy swell of sea came in his boat to the beaconhouse to consult with the writer as to the propriety of venturing the loaded praamboats with their cargoes to the rock while so much sea was running after some dubiety expressed on the subject in which the ardent mind of the landingmaster suggested many arguments in favour of his being able to convey the praams in perfect safety it was acceded to  in bad weather and especially on occasions of difficulty like the present mr wilson who was an extremely active seaman measuring about five feet three inches in height of a robust habit generally dressed himself in what he called a monkey jacket made of thick duffle cloth with a pair of dutchman’s petticoat trousers reaching only to his knees where they were met with a pair of long watertight boots with this dress his glazed hat and his small brass speaking trumpet in his hand he bade defiance to the weather  when he made his appearance in this most suitable attire for the service his crew seemed to possess additional life never failing to use their utmost exertions when the captain put on his storm rigging  they had this morning commenced loading the praamboats at four o’clock and proceeded to tow them into the eastern landingplace which was accomplished with much dexterity though not without the risk of being thrown by the force of the sea on certain projecting ledges of the rock  in such a case the loss even of a single stone would have greatly retarded the work  for the greater safety in entering the creek it was necessary to put out several warps and guyropes to guide the boats into its narrow and intricate entrance and it frequently happened that the sea made a clean breach over the praams which not only washed their decks but completely drenched the crew in water                                                         sunday 17th june  it was fortunate in the present state of the weather that the fiftieth course was in a sheltered spot within the reach of the tackle of the winchmachine upon the bridge a few stones were stowed upon the bridge itself and the remainder upon the building which kept the artificers at work  the stowing of the materials upon the rock was the department of alexander brebner mason who spared no pains in attending to the safety of the stones and who in the present state of the work when the stones were landed faster than could be built generally worked till the water rose to his middle  at one o’clock today the bell rung for prayers and all hands were collected into the upper barrackroom of the beaconhouse when the usual service was performed  the wind blew very hard in the course of last night from ne and today the sea ran so high that no boat could approach the rock  during the dinnerhour when the writer was going to the top of the building as usual but just as he had entered the door and was about to ascend the ladder a great noise was heard overhead and in an instant he was soused in water from a sea which had most unexpectedly come over the walls though now about fiftyeight feet in height  on making his retreat he found himself completely whitened by the lime which had mixed with the water while dashing down through the different floors and as nearly as he could guess a quantity equal to about a hogshead had come over the walls and now streamed out at the door  after having shifted himself he again sat down in his cabin the sea continuing to run so high that the builders did not resume their operations on the walls this afternoon the incident just noticed did not create more surprise in the mind of the writer than the sublime appearance of the waves as they rolled majestically over the rock  this scene he greatly enjoyed while sitting at his cabin window each wave approached the beacon like a vast scroll unfolding and in passing discharged a quantity of air which he not only distinctly felt but was even sufficient to lift the leaves of a book which lay before him  these waves might be ten or twelve feet in height and about 250 feet in length their smaller end being towards the north where the water was deep and they were opened or cut through by the interposition of the building and beacon  the gradual manner in which the sea upon these occasions is observed to become calm or to subside is a very remarkable feature of this phenomenon  for example when a gale is succeeded by a calm every third or fourth wave forms one of these great seas which occur in spaces of from three to five minutes as noted by the writer’s watch but in the course of the next tide they become less frequent and take off so as to occur only in ten or fifteen minutes and singular enough at the third tide after such gales the writer has remarked that only one or two of these great waves appear in the course of the whole tide                                                        tuesday 19th june  the 19th was a very unpleasant and disagreeable day both for the seamen and artificers as it rained throughout with little intermission from four am till eleven pm accompanied with thunder and lightning during which period the work nevertheless continued unremittingly and the builders laid the fiftyfirst and fiftysecond courses  this state of weather was no less severe upon the mortarmakers who required to temper or prepare the mortar of a thicker or thinner consistency in some measure according to the state of the weather  from the elevated position of the building the mortar gallery on the beacon was now much lower and the limebuckets were made to traverse upon a rope distended between it and the building  on occasions like the present however there was often a difference of opinion between the builders and the mortarmakers  john watt who had the principal charge of the mortar was a most active worker but being somewhat of an irascible temper the builders occasionally amused themselves at his expense for while he was eagerly at work with his large ironshod pestle in the mortartub they often sent down contradictory orders some crying ‘make it a little stiffer or thicker john’ while others called out to make it ‘thinner’ to which he generally returned very speedy and sharp replies so that these conversations at times were rather amusing  during wet weather the situation of the artificers on the top of the building was extremely disagreeable for although their work did not require great exertion yet as each man had his particular part to perform either in working the crane or in laying the stones it required the closest application and attention not only on the part of mr peter logan the foreman who was constantly on the walls but also of the chief workmen  robert selkirk the principal builder for example had every stone to lay in its place  david cumming a mason had the charge of working the tackle of the balanceweight and james scott also a mason took charge of the purchase with which the stones were laid while the pointing the joints of the walls with cement was intrusted to william reid and william kennedy who stood upon a scaffold suspended over the walls in rather a frightful manner  the least act of carelessness or inattention on the part of any of these men might have been fatal not only to themselves but also to the surrounding workmen especially if any accident had happened to the crane itself while the material damage or loss of a single stone would have put an entire stop to the operations until another could have been brought from arbroath  the artificers having wrought seven and a half hours of extra time today had 3s 9d of extra pay while the foremen had 7s 6d over and above their stated pay and board  although therefore the work was both hazardous and fatiguing yet the encouragement being considerable they were always very cheerful and perfectly reconciled to the confinement and other disadvantages of the place  during fine weather and while the nights were short the duty on board of the floating light was literally nothing but a waiting on and therefore one of her boats with a crew of five men daily attended the rock but always returned to the vessel at night  the carpenter however was one of those who was left on board of the ship as he also acted in the capacity of assistant lightkeeper being besides a person who was apt to feel discontent and to be averse to changing his quarters especially to work with the millwrights and joiners at the rock who often for hours together wrought kneedeep and not unfrequently up to the middle in water  mr watt having about this time made a requisition for another hand the carpenter was ordered to attend the rock in the floating light’s boat  this he did with great reluctance and found so much fault that he soon got into discredit with his messmates  on this occasion he left the lighthouse service and went as a sailor in a vessel bound for america—a step which it is believed he soon regretted as in the course of things he would in all probability have accompanied mr john reid the principal lightkeeper of the floating light to the bell rock lighthouse as his principal assistant  the writer had a wish to be of service to this man as he was one of those who came off to the floating light in the month of september 1807 while she was riding at single anchor after the severe gale of the 7th at a time when it was hardly possible to make up this vessel’s crew but the crossness of his manner prevented his reaping the benefit of such intentions                                                         friday 22nd june  the building operations had for some time proceeded more slowly from the higher parts of the lighthouse requiring much longer time than an equal tonnage of the lower courses  the duty of the landingmaster’s crew had upon the whole been easy of late for though the work was occasionally irregular yet the stones being lighter they were more speedily lifted from the hold of the stone vessel to the deck of the praamboat and again to the waggons on the railway after which they came properly under the charge of the foreman builder  it is however a strange though not an uncommon feature in the human character that when people have least to complain of they are most apt to become dissatisfied as was now the case with the seamen employed in the bell rock service about their rations of beer  indeed ever since the carpenter of the floating light formerly noticed had been brought to the rock expressions of discontent had been manifested upon various occasions  this being represented to the writer he sent for captain wilson the landingmaster and mr taylor commander of the tender with whom he talked over the subject they stated that they considered the daily allowance of the seamen in every respect ample and that the work being now much lighter than formerly they had no just ground for complaint mr taylor adding that if those who now complained ‘were even to be fed upon soft bread and turkeys they would not think themselves right’  at twelve noon the work of the landingmaster’s crew was completed for the day but at four o’clock while the rock was under water those on the beacon were surprised by the arrival of a boat from the tender without any signal having been made from the beacon  it brought the following note to the writer from the landingmaster’s crew—                                                 ‘sir joseph banks tender      ‘sir—we are informed by our masters that our allowance is to be as     before and it is not sufficient to serve us for we have been at     work since four o’clock this morning and we have come on board to     dinner and there is no beer for us before tomorrow morning to     which a sufficient answer is required before we go from the beacon     and we are sir your most obedient servants’  on reading this the writer returned a verbal message intimating that an answer would be sent on board of the tender at the same time ordering the boat instantly to quit the beacon  he then addressed the following note to the landingmaster—                                        ‘beaconhouse 22nd june 1810                                                        five o’clock pm      ‘sir—i have just now received a letter purporting to be from the     landingmaster’s crew and seamen on board of the sir joseph banks     though without either date or signature in answer to which i enclose     a statement of the daily allowance of provisions for the seamen in     this service which you will post up in the ship’s galley and at     seven o’clock this evening i will come on board to inquire into this     unexpected and most unnecessary demand for an additional allowance of     beer  in the enclosed you will not find any alteration from the     original statement fixed in the galley at the beginning of the     season  i have however judged this mode of giving your people an     answer preferable to that of conversing with them on the beacon —i     am sir your most obedient servant                                                           robert stevenson      ‘to captain wilson’      ‘beacon house 22nd june 1810—schedule of the daily allowance     of provisions to be served out on board of the sir joseph banks     tender “1½ lb beef 1 lb bread 8 oz oatmeal 2 oz barley 2 oz     butter 3 quarts beer vegetables and salt no stated allowance  when     the seamen are employed in unloading the smeaton and patriot a     draught of beer is as formerly to be allowed from the stock of     these vessels  further in wet and stormy weather or when the work     commences very early in the morning or continues till a late hour at     night a glass of spirits will also be served out to the crew as     heretofore on the requisition of the landingmaster”                                                          robert stevenson’  on writing this letter and schedule a signal was made on the beacon for the landingmaster’s boat which immediately came to the rock and the schedule was afterwards stuck up in the tender’s galley  when sufficient time had been allowed to the crew to consider of their conduct a second signal was made for a boat and at seven o’clock the writer left the bell rock after a residence of four successive weeks in the beaconhouse the first thing which occupied his attention on board of the tender was to look round upon the lighthouse which he saw with some degree of emotion and surprise now vying in height with the beaconhouse for although he had often viewed it from the extremity of the western railway on the rock yet the scene upon the whole seemed far more interesting from the tender’s moorings at the distance of about half a mile  the smeaton having just arrived at her moorings with a cargo a signal was made for captain pool to come on board of the tender that he might be at hand to remove from the service any of those who might persist in their discontented conduct  one of the two principal leaders in this affair the master of one of the praamboats who had also steered the boat which brought the letter to the beacon was first called upon deck and asked if he had read the statement fixed up in the galley this afternoon and whether he was satisfied with it  he replied that he had read the paper but was not satisfied as it held out no alteration in the allowance on which he was immediately ordered into the smeaton’s boat  the next man called had but lately entered the service and being also interrogated as to his resolution he declared himself to be of the same mind with the praammaster and was also forthwith ordered into the boat  the writer without calling any more of the seamen went forward to the gangway where they were collected and listening to what was passing upon deck  he addressed them at the hatchway and stated that two of their companions had just been dismissed the service and sent on board of the smeaton to be conveyed to arbroath  he therefore wished each man to consider for himself how far it would be proper by any unreasonableness of conduct to place themselves in a similar situation especially as they were aware that it was optional in him either to dismiss them or send them on board a manofwar  it might appear that much inconveniency would be felt at the rock by a change of hands at this critical period by checking for a time the progress of a building so intimately connected with the best interests of navigation yet this would be but of a temporary nature while the injury to themselves might be irreparable  it was now therefore required of any man who in this disgraceful manner chose to leave the service that he should instantly make his appearance on deck while the smeaton’s boat was alongside but those below having expressed themselves satisfied with their situationviz william brown george gibb alexander scott john dick robert couper alexander shephard james grieve david carey william pearson stuart eaton alexander lawrence and john spink—were accordingly considered as having returned to their duty  this disposition to mutiny which had so strongly manifested itself being now happily suppressed captain pool got orders to proceed for arbroath bay and land the two men he had on board and to deliver the following letter at the office of the workyard—                                ‘on board of the tender off the bell rock                                   22nd june 1810 eight o’clock pm      ‘dear sir—a discontented and mutinous spirit having manifested     itself of late among the landingmaster’s crew they struck work     today and demanded an additional allowance of beer and i have found     it necessary to dismiss dd and me who are now sent on shore     with the smeaton  you will therefore be so good as to pay them     their wages including this day only  nothing can be more     unreasonable than the conduct of the seamen on this occasion as the     landingmaster’s crew not only had their allowance on board of the     tender but in the course of this day they had drawn no fewer than     twentyfour quart pots of beer from the stock of the patriot while     unloading her —i remain yours truly                                                           robert stevenson      ‘to mr lachlan kennedy           bell rock office arbroath’  on despatching this letter to mr kennedy the writer returned to the beacon about nine o’clock where this afternoon’s business had produced many conjectures especially when the smeaton got under weigh instead of proceeding to land her cargo  the bell on the beacon being rung the artificers were assembled on the bridge when the affair was explained to them  he at the same time congratulated them upon the first appearance of mutiny being happily set at rest by the dismissal of its two principal abettors                                                         sunday 24th june  at the rock the landing of the materials and the building operations of the lightroom store went on successfully and in a way similar to those of the provision store  today it blew fresh breezes but the seamen nevertheless landed twentyeight stones and the artificers built the fiftyeighth and fiftyninth courses  the works were visited by mr murdoch junior from messrs boulton and watt’s works of soho  he landed just as the bell rung for prayers after which the writer enjoyed much pleasure from his very intelligent conversation and having been almost the only stranger he had seen for some weeks he parted with him after a short interview with much regret                                                       thursday 28th june  last night the wind had shifted to northeast and blowing fresh was accompanied with a heavy surf upon the rock  towards highwater it had a very grand and wonderful appearance  waves of considerable magnitude rose as high as the solid or level of the entrancedoor which being open to the southwest was fortunately to the leeward but on the windward side the sprays flew like lightning up the sloping sides of the building and although the walls were now elevated sixtyfour feet above the rock and about fiftytwo feet from highwater mark yet the artificers were nevertheless wetted and occasionally interrupted in their operations on the top of the walls  these appearances were in a great measure new at the bell rock there having till of late been no building to conduct the seas or object to compare with them  although from the description of the eddystone lighthouse the mind was prepared for such effects yet they were not expected to the present extent in the summer season the sea being most awful today whether observed from the beacon or the building  to windward the sprays fell from the height above noticed in the most wonderful cascades and streamed down the walls of the building in froth as white as snow  to leeward of the lighthouse the collision or meeting of the waves produced a pure white kind of drift it rose about thirty feet in height like a fine downy mist which in its fall fell upon the face and hands more like a dry powder than a liquid substance  the effect of these seas as they raged among the beams and dashed upon the higher parts of the beacon produced a temporary tremulous motion throughout the whole fabric which to a stranger must have been frightful                                                          sunday 1st july  the writer had now been at the bell rock since the latter end of may or about six weeks during four of which he had been a constant inhabitant of the beacon without having been once off the rock  after witnessing the laying of the sixtyseventh or second course of the bedroom apartment he left the rock with the tender and went ashore as some arrangements were to be made for the future conduct of the works at arbroath which were soon to be brought to a close the landingmaster’s crew having in the meantime shifted on board of the patriot  in leaving the rock the writer kept his eyes fixed upon the lighthouse which had recently got into the form of a house having several tiers or stories of windows  nor was he unmindful of his habitation in the beacon—now far overtopped by the masonry—where he had spent several weeks in a kind of active retirement making practical experiment of the fewness of the positive wants of man  his cabin measured not more than four feet three inches in breadth on the floor and though from the oblique direction of the beams of the beacon it widened towards the top yet it did not admit of the full extension of his arms when he stood on the floor while its length was little more than sufficient for suspending a cotbed during the night calculated for being triced up to the roof through the day which left free room for the admission of occasional visitants  his folding table was attached with hinges immediately under the small window of the apartment and his books barometer thermometer portmanteau and two or three campstools formed the bulk of his movables  his diet being plain the paraphernalia of the table were proportionally simple though everything had the appearance of comfort and even of neatness the walls being covered with green cloth formed into panels with red tape and his bed festooned with curtains of yellow cottonstuff  if in speculating upon the abstract wants of man in such a state of exclusion one were reduced to a single book the sacred volume—whether considered for the striking diversity of its story the morality of its doctrine or the important truths of its gospel—would have proved by far the greatest treasure                                                          monday 2nd july  in walking over the workyard at arbroath this morning the writer found that the stones of the course immediately under the cornice were all in hand and that a week’s work would now finish the whole while the intermediate courses lay ready numbered and marked for shipping to the rock  among other subjects which had occupied his attention today was a visit from some of the relations of george dall a young man who had been impressed near dundee in the month of february last a dispute had arisen between the magistrates of that burgh and the regulating officer as to his right of impressing dall who was bonâ fide one of the protected seamen in the bell rock service  in the meantime the poor lad was detained and ultimately committed to the prison of dundee to remain until the question should be tried before the court of session  his friends were naturally very desirous to have him relieved upon bail but as this was only to be done by the judgment of the court all that could be said was that his pay and allowances should be continued in the same manner as if he had been upon the sicklist  the circumstances of dall’s case were briefly these—he had gone to see some of his friends in the neighbourhood of dundee in winter while the works were suspended having got leave of absence from mr taylor who commanded the bell rock tender and had in his possession one of the protection medals unfortunately however for dall the regulating officer thought proper to disregard these documents as according to the strict and literal interpretation of the admiralty regulations a seaman does not stand protected unless he is actually on board of his ship or in a boat belonging to her or has the admiralty protection in his possession this order of the board however cannot be rigidly followed in practice and therefore when the matter is satisfactorily stated to the regulating officer the impressed man is generally liberated  but in dall’s case this was peremptorily refused and he was retained at the instance of the magistrates  the writer having brought the matter under the consideration of the commissioners of the northern lighthouses they authorised it to be tried on the part of the lighthouse board as one of extreme hardship  the court upon the first hearing ordered dall to be liberated from prison and the proceedings never went further                                                       wednesday 4th july  being now within twelve courses of being ready for building the cornice measures were taken for getting the stones of it and the parapetwall of the lightroom brought from edinburgh where as before noticed they had been prepared and were in readiness for shipping  the honour of conveying the upper part of the lighthouse and of landing the last stone of the building on the rock was considered to belong to captain pool of the smeaton who had been longer in the service than the master of the patriot  the smeaton was therefore now partly loaded with old iron consisting of broken railways and other lumber which had been lying about the rock  after landing these at arbroath she took on board james craw with his horse and cart which could now be spared at the workyard to be employed in carting the stones from edinburgh to leith  alexander davidson and william kennedy two careful masons were also sent to take charge of the loading of the stones at greenside and stowing them on board of the vessel at leith  the writer also went on board with a view to call at the bell rock and to take his passage up the firth of forth the wind however coming to blow very fresh from the eastward with thick and foggy weather it became necessary to reef the mainsail and set the second jib  when in the act of making a tack towards the tender the sailors who worked the headsheets were all of a sudden alarmed with the sound of the smith’s hammer and anvil on the beacon and had just time to put the ship about to save her from running ashore on the northwestern point of the rock marked ‘james craw’s horse’  on looking towards the direction from whence the sound came the building and beaconhouse were seen with consternation while the ship was hailed by those on the rock who were no less confounded at seeing the near approach of the smeaton and just as the vessel cleared the danger the smith and those in the mortar gallery made signs in token of their happiness at our fortunate escape  from this occurrence the writer had an experimental proof of the utility of the large bells which were in preparation to be rung by the machinery of the revolving light for had it not been the sound of the smith’s anvil the smeaton in all probability would have been wrecked upon the rock  in case the vessel had struck those on board might have been safe having now the beaconhouse as a place of refuge but the vessel which was going at a great velocity must have suffered severely and it was more than probable that the horse would have been drowned there being no means of getting him out of the vessel  of this valuable animal and his master we shall take an opportunity of saying more in another place                                                        thursday 5th july  the weather cleared up in the course of the night but the wind shifted to the ne and blew very fresh  from the force of the wind being now the period of springtides a very heavy swell was experienced at the rock  at two o’clock on the following morning the people on the beacon were in a state of great alarm about their safety as the sea had broke up part of the floor of the mortar gallery which was thus cleared of the limecasks and other buoyant articles and the alarmbell being rung all hands were called to render what assistance was in their power for the safety of themselves and the materials  at this time some would willingly have left the beacon and gone into the building the sea however ran so high that there was no passage along the bridge of communication and when the interior of the lighthouse came to be examined in the morning it appeared that great quantities of water had come over the walls—now eighty feet in height—and had run down through the several apartments and out at the entrance door  the upper course of the lighthouse at the workyard of arbroath was completed on the 6th and the whole of the stones were therefore now ready for being shipped to the rock  from the present state of the works it was impossible that the two squads of artificers at arbroath and the bell rock could meet together at this period and as in public works of this kind which had continued for a series of years it is not customary to allow the men to separate without what is termed a “finishingpint” five guineas were for this purpose placed at the disposal of mr david logan clerk of works  with this sum the stonecutters at arbroath had a merry meeting in their barrack collected their sweethearts and friends and concluded their labours with a dance  it was remarked however that their happiness on this occasion was not without alloy  the consideration of parting and leaving a steady and regular employment to go in quest of work and mix with other society after having been harmoniously lodged for years together in one large “guildhall or barrack” was rather painful                                                          friday 6th july  while the writer was at edinburgh he was fortunate enough to meet with mrs dickson only daughter of the late celebrated mr smeaton whose works at the eddystone lighthouse had been of such essential consequence to the operations at the bell rock  even her own elegant accomplishments are identified with her father’s work she having herself made the drawing of the vignette on the titlepage of the narrative of the eddystone lighthouse  every admirer of the works of that singularly eminent man must also feel an obligation to her for the very comprehensive and distinct account given of his life which is attached to his reports published in three volumes quarto by the society of civil engineers  mrs dickson being at this time returning from a tour to the hebrides and western highlands of scotland had heard of the bell rock works and from their similarity to those of the eddystone was strongly impressed with a desire of visiting the spot  but on inquiring for the writer at edinburgh and finding from him that the upper part of the lighthouse consisting of nine courses might be seen in the immediate vicinity and also that one of the vessels which in compliment to her father’s memory had been named the smeaton might also now be seen in leith she considered herself extremely fortunate and having first visited the works at greenside she afterwards went to leith to see the smeaton then loading for the bell rock  on stepping on board mrs dickson seemed to be quite overcome with so many concurrent circumstances tending in a peculiar manner to revive and enliven the memory of her departed father and on leaving the vessel she would not be restrained from presenting the crew with a piece of money  the smeaton had been named spontaneously from a sense of the obligation which a public work of the description of the bell rock owed to the labours and abilities of mr smeaton  the writer certainly never could have anticipated the satisfaction which he this day felt in witnessing the pleasure it afforded to the only representative of this great man’s family                                                         friday 20th july  the gale from the ne still continued so strong accompanied with a heavy sea that the patriot could not approach her moorings and although the tender still kept her station no landing was made today at the rock  at highwater it was remarked that the spray rose to the height of about sixty feet upon the building  the smeaton now lay in leith loaded but the wind and weather being so unfavourable for her getting down the firth she did not sail till this afternoon  it may be here proper to notice that the loading of the centre of the lightroom floor or last principal stone of the building did not fail when put on board to excite an interest among those connected with the work  when the stone was laid upon the cart to be conveyed to leith the seamen fixed an ensignstaff and flag into the circular hole in the centre of the stone and decorated their own hats and that of james craw the bell rock carter with ribbons even his faithful and trusty horse brassey was ornamented with bows and streamers of various colours  the masons also provided themselves with new aprons and in this manner the cart was attended in its progress to the ship  when the cart came opposite the trinity house of leith the officer of that corporation made his appearance dressed in his uniform with his staff of office and when it reached the harbour the shipping in the different tiers where the smeaton lay hoisted their colours manifesting by these trifling ceremonies the interest with which the progress of this work was regarded by the public as ultimately tending to afford safety and protection to the mariner  the wind had fortunately shifted to the sw and about five o’clock this afternoon the smeaton reached the bell rock                                                         friday 27th july  the artificers had finished the laying of the balcony course excepting the centrestone of the lightroom floor which like the centres of the other floors could not be laid in its place till after the removal of the foot and shaft of the balancecrane  during the dinnerhour when the men were off work the writer generally took some exercise by walking round the walls when the rock was under water but today his boundary was greatly enlarged for instead of the narrow wall as a path he felt no small degree of pleasure in walking round the balcony and passing out and in at the space allotted for the lightroom door  in the labours of this day both the artificers and seamen felt their work to be extremely easy compared with what it had been for some days past                                                         sunday 29th july  captain wilson and his crew had made preparations for landing the last stone and as may well be supposed this was a day of great interest at the bell rock  ‘that it might lose none of its honours’ as he expressed himself the hedderwick praamboat with which the first stone of the building had been landed was appointed also to carry the last  at seven o’clock this evening the seamen hoisted three flags upon the hedderwick when the colours of the dickie praamboat tender smeaton floating light beaconhouse and lighthouse were also displayed and the weather being remarkably fine the whole presented a very gay appearance and in connection with the associations excited the effect was very pleasing  the praam which carried the stone was towed by the seamen in gallant style to the rock and on its arrival cheers were given as a finale to the landing department                                                         monday 30th july  the ninetieth or last course of the building having been laid today which brought the masonry to the height of one hundred and two feet six inches the lintel of the lightroom door being the finishingstone of the exterior walls was laid with due formality by the writer who at the same time pronounced the following benediction “may the great architect of the universe under whose blessing this perilous work has prospered preserve it as a guide to the mariner”                                                          friday 3rd aug  at three pm the necessary preparations having been made the artificers commenced the completing of the floors of the several apartments and at seven o’clock the centrestone of the lightroom floor was laid which may be held as finishing the masonry of this important national edifice  after going through the usual ceremonies observed by the brotherhood on occasions of this kind the writer addressing himself to the artificers and seamen who were present briefly alluded to the utility of the undertaking as a monument of the wealth of british commerce erected through the spirited measures of the commissioners of the northern lighthouses by means of the able assistance of those who now surrounded him  he then took an opportunity of stating that toward those connected with this arduous work he would ever retain the most heartfelt regard in all their interests                                                        saturday 4th aug  when the bell was rung as usual on the beacon this morning every one seemed as if he were at a loss what to make of himself  at this period the artificers at the rock consisted of eighteen masons two joiners one millwright one smith and one mortarmaker besides messrs peter logan and francis watt foremen counting in all twentyfive and matters were arranged for proceeding to arbroath this afternoon with all hands  the sir joseph banks tender had by this time been afloat with little intermission for six months during greater part of which the artificers had been almost constantly off at the rock and were now much in want of necessaries of almost every description  not a few had lost different articles of clothing which had dropped into the sea from the beacon and building  some wanted jackets others from want of hats wore nightcaps each was in fact more or less curtailed in his wardrobe and it must be confessed that at best the party were but in a very tattered condition  this morning was occupied in removing the artificers and their bedding on board of the tender and although their personal luggage was easily shifted the boats had nevertheless many articles to remove from the beaconhouse and were consequently employed in this service till eleven am  all hands being collected and just ready to embark as the water had nearly overflowed the rock the writer in taking leave after alluding to the harmony which had ever marked the conduct of those employed on the bell rock took occasion to compliment the great zeal attention and abilities of mr peter logan and mr francis watt foremen captain james wilson landingmaster and captain david taylor commander of the tender who in their several departments had so faithfully discharged the duties assigned to them often under circumstances the most difficult and trying  the health of these gentlemen was drunk with much warmth of feeling by the artificers and seamen who severally expressed the satisfaction they had experienced in acting under them after which the whole party left the rock  in sailing past the floating light mutual compliments were made by a display of flags between that vessel and the tender and at five pm the latter vessel entered the harbour of arbroath where the party were heartily welcomed by a numerous company of spectators who had collected to see the artificers arrive after so long an absence from the port  in the evening the writer invited the foremen and captains of the service together with mr david logan clerk of works at arbroath and mr lachlan kennedy engineer’s clerk and bookkeeper and some of their friends to the principal inn where the evening was spent very happily and after ‘his majesty’s health’ and ‘the commissioners of the northern lighthouses’ had been given ‘stability to the bell rock lighthouse’ was hailed as a standing toast in the lighthouse service                                                          sunday 5th aug  the author has formerly noticed the uniformly decent and orderly deportment of the artificers who were employed at the bell rock lighthouse and today it is believed they very generally attended church no doubt with grateful hearts for the narrow escapes from personal danger which all of them had more or less experienced during their residence at the rock                                                        tuesday 14th aug  the smeaton sailed today at one pm having on board sixteen artificers with mr peter logan together with a supply of provisions and necessaries who left the harbour pleased and happy to find themselves once more afloat in the bell rock service  at seven o’clock the tender was made fast to her moorings when the artificers landed on the rock and took possession of their old quarters in the beaconhouse with feelings very different from those of 1807 when the works commenced  the barometer for some days past had been falling from 2990 and today it was 2950 with the wind at ne which in the course of this day increased to a strong gale accompanied with a sea which broke with great violence upon the rock  at twelve noon the tender rode very heavily at her moorings when her chain broke at about ten fathoms from the ships bows the kedgeanchor was immediately let go to hold her till the floating buoy and broken chain should be got on board  but while this was in operation the hawser of the kedge was chafed through on the rocky bottom and parted when the vessel was again adrift  most fortunately however she cast off with her head from the rock and narrowly cleared it when she sailed up the firth of forth to wait the return of better weather  the artificers were thus left upon the rock with so heavy a sea running that it was ascertained to have risen to a height of eighty feet on the building  under such perilous circumstances it would be difficult to describe the feelings of those who at this time were cooped up in the beacon in so forlorn a situation with the sea not only raging under them but occasionally falling from a great height upon the roof of their temporary lodging without even the attending vessel in view to afford the least gleam of hope in the event of any accident  it is true that they now had the masonry of the lighthouse to resort to which no doubt lessened the actual danger of their situation but the building was still without a roof and the deadlights or stormshutters not being yet fitted the windows of the lower story were stove in and broken and at highwater the sea ran in considerable quantities out at the entrance door                                                       thursday 16th aug  the gale continues with unabated violence today and the sprays rise to a still greater height having been carried over the masonry of the building or about ninety feet above the level of the sea  at four o’clock this morning it was breaking into the cook’s berth when he rang the alarmbell and all hands turned out to attend to their personal safety  the floor of the smith’s or mortar gallery was now completely burst up by the force of the sea when the whole of the deals and the remaining articles upon the floor were swept away such as the castiron mortartubs the iron hearth of the forge the smith’s bellows and even his anvil were thrown down upon the rock  before the tide rose to its full height today some of the artificers passed along the bridge into the lighthouse to observe the effects of the sea upon it and they reported that they had felt a slight tremulous motion in the building when great seas struck it in a certain direction about highwater mark on this occasion the sprays were again observed to wet the balcony and even to come over the parapet wall into the interior of the lightroom                                                       thursday 23rd aug  the wind being at wsw and the weather more moderate both the tender and the smeaton got to their moorings on the 23rd when all hands were employed in transporting the sashframes from on board of the smeaton to the rock  in the act of setting up one of these frames upon the bridge it was unguardedly suffered to lose its balance and in saving it from damage captain wilson met with a severe bruise in the groin on the seat of a gunshot wound received in the early part of his life  this accident laid him aside for several days                                                         monday 27th aug  the sashframes of the lightroom eight in number and weighing each 254 pounds having been got safely up to the top of the building were ranged on the balcony in the order in which they were numbered for their places on the top of the parapetwall and the balancecrane that useful machine having now lifted all the heavier articles was unscrewed and lowered to use the landingmaster’s phrase ‘in mournful silence’                                                         sunday 2nd sept  the steps of the stair being landed and all the weightier articles of the lightroom got up to the balcony the wooden bridge was now to be removed as it had a very powerful effect upon the beacon when a heavy sea struck it and could not possibly have withstood the storms of a winter  everything having been cleared from the bridge and nothing left but the two principal beams with their horizontal braces james glen at highwater proceeded with a saw to cut through the beams at the end next the beacon which likewise disengaged their opposite extremity inserted a few inches into the building  the frame was then gently lowered into the water and floated off to the smeaton to be towed to arbroath to be applied as part of the materials in the erection of the lightkeepers’ houses  after the removal of the bridge the aspect of things at the rock was much altered  the beaconhouse and building had both a naked look to those accustomed to their former appearance a curious optical deception was also remarked by which the lighthouse seemed to incline from the perpendicular towards the beacon  the horizontal ropeladder before noticed was again stretched to preserve the communication and the artificers were once more obliged to practise the awkward and straddling manner of their passage between them during 1809  at twelve noon the bell rung for prayers after which the artificers went to dinner when the writer passed along the ropeladder to the lighthouse and went through the several apartments which were now cleared of lumber  in the afternoon all hands were summoned to the interior of the house when he had the satisfaction of laying the upper step of the stair or last stone of the building  this ceremony concluded with three cheers the sound of which had a very loud and strange effect within the walls of the lighthouse  at six o’clock mr peter logan and eleven of the artificers embarked with the writer for arbroath leaving mr james glen with the special charge of the beacon and railways mr robert selkirk with the building with a few artificers to fit the temporary windows to render the house habitable                                                         sunday 14th oct  on returning from his voyage to the northern lighthouses the writer landed at the bell rock on sunday the 14th of october and had the pleasure to find from the very favourable state of the weather that the artificers had been enabled to make great progress with the fittingup of the lightroom                                                         friday 19th oct  the lightroom work had proceeded as usual today under the direction of mr dove assisted in the plumberwork by mr john gibson and in the brazierwork by mr joseph fraser while mr james slight with the joiners were fitting up the stormshuttters of the windows  in these several departments the artificers were at work till seven o’clock pm and it being then dark mr dove gave orders to drop work in the lightroom and all hands proceeded from thence to the beaconhouse when charles henderson smith and henry dickson brazier left the work together  being both young men who had been for several weeks upon the rock they had become familiar and even playful on the most difficult parts about the beacon and building  this evening they were trying to outrun each other in descending from the lightroom when henderson led the way but they were in conversation with each other till they came to the ropeladder distended between the entrancedoor of the lighthouse and the beacon  dickson on reaching the cookroom was surprised at not seeing his companion and inquired hastily for henderson  upon which the cook replied ‘was he before you upon the ropeladder’  dickson answered ‘yes and i thought i heard something fall’  upon this the alarm was given and links were immediately lighted with which the artificers descended on the legs of the beacon as near the surface of the water as possible it being then about full tide and the sea breaking to a considerable height upon the building with the wind at sse  but after watching till lowwater and searching in every direction upon the rock it appeared that poor henderson must have unfortunately fallen through the ropeladder and been washed into the deep water  the deceased had passed along this ropeladder many hundred times both by day and night and the operations in which he was employed being nearly finished he was about to leave the rock when this melancholy catastrophe took place  the unfortunate loss of henderson cast a deep gloom upon the minds of all who were at the rock and it required some management on the part of those who had charge to induce the people to remain patiently at their work as the weather now became more boisterous and the nights long they found their habitation extremely cheerless while the winds were howling about their ears and the waves lashing with fury against the beams of their insulated habitation                                                        tuesday 23rd oct  the wind had shifted in the night to nw and blew a fresh gale while the sea broke with violence upon the rock  it was found impossible to land but the writer from the boat hailed mr dove and directed the ball to be immediately fixed  the necessary preparations were accordingly made while the vessel made short tacks on the southern side of the rock in comparatively smooth water  at noon mr dove assisted by mr james slight mr robert selkirk mr james glen and mr john gibson plumber with considerable difficulty from the boisterous state of the weather got the gilded ball screwed on measuring two feet in diameter and forming the principal ventilator at the upper extremity of the cupola of the lightroom  at mr hamilton’s desire a salute of seven guns was fired on this occasion and all hands being called to the quarterdeck ‘stability to the bell rock lighthouse’ was not forgotten                                                        tuesday 30th oct  on reaching the rock it was found that a very heavy sea still ran upon it but the writer having been disappointed on two former occasions and as the erection of the house might now be considered complete there being nothing wanted externally excepting some of the stormshutters for the defence of the windows he was the more anxious at this time to inspect it  two wellmanned boats were therefore ordered to be in attendance and after some difficulty the wind being at nne they got safely into the western creek though not without encountering plentiful sprays  it would have been impossible to have attempted a landing today under any other circumstances than with boats perfectly adapted to the purpose and with seamen who knew every ledge of the rock and even the length of the seaweeds at each particular spot so as to dip their oars into the water accordingly and thereby prevent them from getting entangled  but what was of no less consequence to the safety of the party captain wilson who always steered the boat had a perfect knowledge of the set of the different waves while the crew never shifted their eyes from observing his motions and the strictest silence was preserved by every individual except himself  on entering the house the writer had the pleasure to find it in a somewhat habitable condition the lower apartments being closed in with temporary windows and fitted with proper stormshutters  the lowest apartment at the head of the staircase was occupied with water fuel and provisions put up in a temporary way until the house could be furnished with proper utensils  the second or lightroom store was at present much encumbered with various tools and apparatus for the use of the workmen  the kitchen immediately over this had as yet been supplied only with a common ship’s caboose and plateiron funnel while the necessary cooking utensils had been taken from the beacon  the bedroom was for the present used as the joiners’ workshop and the strangers’ room immediately under the lightroom was occupied by the artificers the beds being ranged in tiers as was done in the barrack of the beacon the lightroom though unprovided with its machinery being now covered over with the cupola glazed and painted had a very complete and cleanly appearance  the balcony was only as yet fitted with a temporary rail consisting of a few iron stanchions connected with ropes and in this state it was necessary to leave it during the winter  having gone over the whole of the lowwater works on the rock the beacon and lighthouse and being satisfied that only the most untoward accident in the landing of the machinery could prevent the exhibition of the light in the course of the winter mr john reid formerly of the floating light was now put in charge of the lighthouse as principal keeper mr james slight had charge of the operations of the artificers while mr james dove and the smiths having finished the frame of the lightroom left the rock for the present  with these arrangements the writer bade adieu to the works for the season  at eleven am the tide was far advanced and there being now little or no shelter for the boats at the rock they had to be pulled through the breach of sea which came on board in great quantities and it was with extreme difficulty that they could be kept in the proper direction of the landingcreek  on this occasion he may be permitted to look back with gratitude on the many escapes made in the course of this arduous undertaking now brought so near to a successful conclusion                                                          monday 5th nov  on monday the 5th the yacht again visited the rock when mr slight and the artificers returned with her to the workyard where a number of things were still to prepare connected with the temporary fitting up of the accommodation for the lightkeepers  mr john reid and peter fortune were now the only inmates of the house  this was the smallest number of persons hitherto left in the lighthouse  as four lightkeepers were to be the complement it was intended that three should always be at the rock its present inmates however could hardly have been better selected for such a situation mr reid being a person possessed of the strictest notions of duty and habits of regularity from long service on board of a manofwar while mr fortune had one of the most happy and contented dispositions imaginable                                                        tuesday 13th nov  from saturday the 10th till tuesday the 13th the wind had been from ne blowing a heavy gale but today the weather having greatly moderated captain taylor who now commanded the smeaton sailed at two o’clock am for the bell rock  at five the floating light was hailed and found to be all well  being a fine moonlight morning the seamen were changed from the one ship to the other  at eight the smeaton being off the rock the boats were manned and taking a supply of water fuel and other necessaries landed at the western side when mr reid and mr fortune were found in good health and spirits  mr reid stated that during the late gales particularly on friday the 30th the wind veering from se to ne both he and mr fortune sensibly felt the house tremble when particular seas struck about the time of highwater the former observing that it was a tremor of that sort which rather tended to convince him that everything about the building was sound and reminded him of the effect produced when a good log of timber is struck sharply with a mallet but with every confidence in the stability of the building he nevertheless confessed that in so forlorn a situation they were not insensible to those emotions which he emphatically observed ‘made a man look back upon his former life’                                                     1881 friday 1st feb  the day long wished for on which the mariner was to see a light exhibited on the bell rock at length arrived  captain wilson as usual hoisted the float’s lanterns to the topmast on the evening of the 1st of february but the moment that the light appeared on the rock the crew giving three cheers lowered them and finally extinguished the lights                                                                                       printed by t and a

though the districts here named are those in which the name of stevenson is most common it is in point of fact far more widespread than the text indicates and occurs from dumfries and berwickshire to

from a stock of westland whigs settled in the latter part of the seventeenth century in the parish of neilston as mentioned at the beginning of the next chapter  it may be noted that the ayrshire parish of stevenston the lands of which are said to have received the name in the twelfth century lies within thirteen miles southwest of this place  the lands of stevenson in lanarkshire first mentioned in the next century in the ragman roll lie within twenty miles east  54a  this is only a probable hypothesis i have tried to identify my father’s anecdote in my grandfather’s diary and may very well have been deceived—r l s  91a  this is of course the tradition commemorated by southey in his ballad of ‘the inchcape bell’  whether true or not it points to the fact that from the infancy of scottish navigation the seafaring mind had been fully alive to the perils of this reef  repeated attempts had been made to mark the place with beacons but all efforts were unavailing one such beacon having been carried away within eight days of its erection until robert stevenson conceived and carried out the idea of the stone tower  but the number of vessels actually lost upon the reef was as nothing to those that were cast away in fruitless efforts to avoid it placed right in the fairway of two navigations and one of these the entrance to the only harbour of refuge between the downs and the moray firth it breathed abroad along the whole coast an atmosphere of terror and perplexity and no ship sailed that part of the north sea at night but what the ears of those on board would be strained to catch the roaring of the seas on the bell rock  92a  the particular event which concentrated mr stevenson’s attention on the problem of the bell rock was the memorable gale of december 1799 when among many other vessels hms york a seventyfourgun ship went down with all hands on board  shortly after this disaster mr stevenson made a careful survey and prepared his models for a stone tower the idea of which was at first received with pretty general scepticism smeaton’s eddystone tower could not be cited as affording a parallel for there the rock is not submerged even at highwater while the problem of the bell rock was to build a tower of masonry on a sunken reef far distant from land covered at every tide to a depth of twelve feet or more and having thirtytwo fathoms’ depth of water within a mile of its eastern edge  94a  the grounds for the rejection of the bill by the house of lords in 1802–3 had been that the extent of coast over which dues were proposed to be levied would be too great  before going to parliament again the board of northern lights desiring to obtain support and corroboration for mr stevenson’s views consulted first telford who was unable to give the matter his attention and then on stevenson’s suggestion rennie who concurred in affirming the practicability of a stone tower and supported the bill when it came again before parliament in 1806 rennie was afterwards appointed by the commissioners as advising engineer whom stevenson might consult in cases of emergency  it seems certain that the title of chief engineer had in this instance no more meaning than the above  rennie in point of fact proposed certain modifications in stevenson’s plans which the latter did not accept nevertheless rennie continued to take a kindly interest in the work and the two engineers remained in friendly correspondence during its progress  the official view taken by the board as to the quarter in which lay both the merit and the responsibility of the work may be gathered from a minute of the commissioners at their first meeting held after stevenson died in which they record their regret ‘at the death of this zealous faithful and able officer to whom is due the honour of conceiving and executing the bell rock lighthouse’  the matter is briefly summed up in the life of robert stevenson by his son david stevenson a  c black 1878 and fully discussed on the basis of official facts and figures by the same writer in a letter to the civil engineers’ and architects’ journal 1862  122a  ‘nothing was said but i was
