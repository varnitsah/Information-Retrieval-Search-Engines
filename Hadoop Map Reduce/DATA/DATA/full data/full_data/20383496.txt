20383496	sir walter scott and the border minstrelsy     contents     preface    scott and the ballads    auld maitland    the ballad of otterburne    scotts traditional copy and how he edited it    the mystery of the ballad of jamie telfer    kinmont willie    conclusions    preface    persons not much interested in or cognisant of antiquarian old womanries as sir walter called them may ask what all the pother is about in this little tractate  on my side it is about the veracity of sir walter scott  he has been suspected of helping to compose and of issuing as a genuine antique a ballad auld maitland  he also wrote about the ballad as a thing obtained from recitation to two friends and fellowantiquaries  if to scotts knowledge it was a modern imitation sir walter deliberately lied  he did not  he did obtain the whole ballad from hogg who got it from recitationas i believe and try to prove and as scott certainly believed  the facts in the case exist in published works and in manuscript letters of ritson to scott and hogg to scott and in the original ms of the song with a note by hogg to laidlaw  if we are interested in the truth about the matter we ought at least to read the very accessible material before bringing charges against the sheriff and the shepherd of ettrick  whether auld maitland be a good or a bad ballad is not part of the question  it was a favourite of mine in childhood and i agree with scott in thinking that it has strong dramatic situations  if it is a bad ballad such as many people could compose then it is not by sir walter  the ballad of otterburne is said to have been constructed from herds version tempered by percys version with additions from a modern imagination  we have merely to read professor childs edition of otterburne with hoggs letter covering his ms copy of otterburne from recitation to see that this is a wholly erroneous view of the matter  we have all the materials for forming a judgment accessible to us in print and have no excuse for preferring our own conjectures  no one now believes it may be said in the aged persons who lived at the head of ettrick and recited otterburne to hogg  colonel elliot disbelieves but he shows no signs of having read hoggs curious letter in two parts about these old parties a letter written on the day when hogg he says twice pumped their memories  i print this letter and if any one chooses to think that it is a crafty fabrication i can only say that its craft would have beguiled myself as it beguiled scott  it is a common cheap and ignorant scepticism that disbelieves in the existence in scotts day or in ours of persons who know and can recite variants of our traditional ballads  the strange song of the bitter withy unknown to professor child was recovered from recitation but lately in several english counties  the ignoble lay of johnny johnston has also been recovered  it is widely diffused i myself obtained a genuine version of where goudie rins through the kindness of lady mary glyn and a friend of lady rosalind northcote procured the low english version of young beichan or lord bateman from an old woman in a rural workhouse  in shropshire my friend miss burne the president of the folklore society received from mr hubert smith in 1883 a very remarkable variant undoubtedly antique of the wife of ushers well 0a  in 1896 miss backus found in the hills of polk county north carolina another variant intermediate between the shropshire and the ordinary version 0b  there are many other examples of this persistence of ballads in the popular memory even in our day and only persons ignorant of the facts can suppose that a century ago there were no reciters at the head of ettrick and elsewhere in scotland  not even now has the halfpenny newspaper wholly destroyed the memories of traditional poetry and of traditional tales even in the englishspeaking parts of our islands while in the highlands a rich harvest awaits the reapers  i could not have produced the facts about auld maitland especially and in some other cases without the kind and ungrudging aid freely given to a stranger of mr william macmath whose knowledge of balladlore and especially of the ballad manuscripts at abbotsford is unrivalled  as to auld maitland mr t f henderson in his edition of the minstrelsy blackwood 1892 also made due use of hoggs ms and his edition is most valuable to every student of scotts method of editing being based on the abbotsford mss  mr henderson suspects more than i do the veracity of the shepherd  i am under obligations to colonel elliots book as it has drawn my attention anew to auld maitland a topic which i had studied somewhat lazily like quintus smyrnaeus  i supposed that there was an inconsistency in two of scotts accounts as to how he obtained the ballad  as colonel elliot points out there was no inconsistency scott had two copies  one was hoggs ms  the other was derived from the recitation of hoggs mother  this trifle is addressed to lovers of scott of the border and of ballads et non aultres  it is curious to see how facts make havoc of the conjectures of the higher criticism in the case of auld maitland  if hogg was the forger of that ballad i asked how did he know the traditions about maitland and his three sons which we only know from poems of about 1576 in the manuscripts of sir richard maitland  these poems in 1802 were as far as i am aware still unpublished  colonel elliot urged that leyden would know the poems and must have known hogg  from leyden then hogg would get the information  in the text i have urged that leyden did not know hogg  i am able now to prove that hogg and leyden never met till after laidlaw gave the manuscript of auld maitland to hogg  the fact is given in the original manuscript of laidlaws recollections of sir walter scott among the laing mss in the library of the university of edinburgh  carruthers in publishing laidlaws reminiscences omitted the following passage  after scott had read auld maitland aloud to leyden and laird laidlaw the three rode together to dine at whitehope  near the craigbents says laidlaw mr scott and leyden drew together in a close and seemingly private conversation  i of course fell back  after a minute or two leyden reined in his horse a black horse that mr scotts servant used to ride and let me come up  this hogg said he writes verses i understand  i assured him that he wrote very beautiful verses and with great facility but i trust he replied that there is no fear of his passing off any of his own upon scott for old ballads  i again assured him that he would never think of such a thing and neither would he at that period of his life  let him beware of forgery cried leyden with great force and energy and in i suppose what mr scott used afterwards to call the saw tones of his voice  this proves that leyden had no personal knowledge of this hogg and did not supply the shepherd with the traditions about auld maitland  mr w j kennedy of hawick pointed out to me this passage in laidlaws recollections edited from the ms by mr james sinton as reprinted from the transactions of the hawick archaeological society 1905    scott and the ballads    it was through his collecting and editing of the border minstrelsy that sir walter scott glided from law into literature  the history of the conception and completion of his task a labour of love truly if ever such there was says lockhart is well known but the tale must be briefly told if we are to understand the following essays in defence of scotts literary morality  late in 1799 scott wrote to james ballantyne then a printer in kelso i have been for years collecting border ballads and he thought that he could put together such a selection as might make a neat little volume to sell for four or five shillings  in december 1799 scott received the office of sheriff of selkirkshire or as he preferred to say of ettrick forest  in the forest as was natural he found much of his materials  the people at the head of ettrick were still says hogg 1a like many of the highlanders even now in that they cheered the long winter nights with the telling of old tales and some aged people still remembered no doubt in a defective and corrupted state many old ballads  some of these especially the ballads of border raids and rescues may never even have been written down by the original authors  the borderers says lesley bishop of ross writing in 1578 take much pleasure in their old music and chanted songs which they themselves compose whether about the deeds of their ancestors or about ingenious raiding tricks and stratagems 2a  the historical ballads about the deeds of their ancestors would be far more romantic than scientifically accurate  the verses as they passed from mouth to mouth and from generation to generation would be in a constant state of flux and change  when a man forgot a verse he would make something to take its place  a more or less appropriate stanza from another ballad would slip in or the reciter would tell in prose the matter of which he forgot the versified form  again in the towns street ballads on remarkable events as early at least as the age of henry viii were written or printed  knox speaks of ballads on queen marys four maries  of these ballads only one is left and it is a libel  the hanging of a french apothecary of the queen and a french waitingmaid for child murder has been transferred to one of the maries or rather to an apocryphal mary hamilton with darnley for her lover  of this ballad twentyeight variantsand extremely various they arewere collected by professor child in his english and scottish popular ballads ten parts 1882 1898  in one mangled form or another such ballads would drift at last even to ettrick forest  a ballad may be found in a form which the first author could scarcely recognise dozens of hands in various generations having been at work on it  at any period especially in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the cheap press might print a sheet of the ballads edited and interpolated by the very lowest of printers hacks that copy would circulate be lost and become in turn a traditional source though full of modernisms  or an educated person might make a written copy filling up gaps himself in late seventeenth or in eighteenth century ballad style and this might pass into the memory of the children and servants of the house and so to the herds and to the farm lasses  i suspect that this process may have occurred in the cases of auld maitland and of the outlaw murraythese two bores mr child is said to have styled them  when allan ramsay about 1720 took up and printed a ballad he altered it if he pleased  more faithful to his texts wherever he got them was david herd in his collection of 1776 but his version did not reach as we shall see old reciters in ettrick  if scott found any traditional ballads in ettrick as his collectors certainly did they had passed through the processes described  they needed reediting of some sort if they were to be intelligible and readable with pleasure  in 1800 apparently while scott made only brief flying visits from the little inn of clovenfords on tweed to his sheriffdom he found a coadjutor  richard heber the wealthy and luxurious antiquary and collector looked into constables first little bookselling shop and saw a strange poor young student prowling among the books  this was john leyden son of a shepherd in roxburghshire a lad living in extreme poverty  leyden in 1800 was making himself a savant  heber spoke with him found that he was rich in balladlore and carried him to scott  he was presently introduced into the best society in edinburgh which would not happen in our time and a casual note of scotts proves that he did not leave leyden in poverty  early in 1802 leyden got the promise of an east indian appointment read medicine furiously and sailed for the east in the beginning of 1803  it does not appear that leyden went balladhunting in ettrick before he rode thither with scott in the spring of 1802  he was busy with books with editorial work and in aiding scott in edinburgh  it was he who insisted that a small volume at five shillings was far too narrow for the materials collected  scott also corresponded with the aged percy bishop of dromore editor of the reliques and with joseph ritson the precise collector percys bitter foe  unfortunately the correspondence on ballads with ritson who died in 1803 is but scanty nor has most of the correspondence with another student george ellis been published  even in mr  douglass edition of scotts familiar letters the portion of an important letter of hoggs which deals with balladlore is omitted  i shall give the letter in full  in 180001 the minstrelsy formed the editors chief occupation says lockhart but later up to april 1801 the forest and liddesdale had yielded little material  in fact i do not know that scott ever procured much in liddesdale where he had no hogg or laidlaw always on the spot and in touch with the old people  it was in spring 1802 that scott first met his lifelong friend william laidlaw farmer in blackhouse on douglasburn in yarrow  laidlaw as is later proved completely introduced scott to hogg then a very unsophisticated shepherd  laidlaw says lockhart took care that scott should see without delay james hogg 4a  these two men hogg and laidlaw knowing the country people well were scotts chief sources of recited balladry and probably they sometimes improved in making their copies the materials won from the failing memories of the old  thus laidlaw while tenant in traquair knowe obtained from recitation the daemon lover  scott does not tell us whether or not he knew the fact that laidlaw wrote in stanza 6 half of it traditional stanza 12 also a ballad formula stanzas 17 and 18 necessary to complete the sense the last two lines of 18 are purely and romantically modern  we shall later quote hoggs account of his own dealings with his raw materials from recitation  in january 1802 scott published the two first volumes of the minstrelsy  lockhart describes the enthusiasm of dukes fine ladies and antiquarians  in the end of april 1803 the third volume appeared including ballads obtained through hogg and laidlaw in spring 1802  scott by his store of historic anecdote in his introductions and notes by his way of vivifying the past and by his method of editing revived but did not create the interest in the romance of ballad poetry  it had always existed  we all know sidneys words on the douglas and the percy addisons on folkpoetry mr pepys ballad collection the ballads in tom durfeys and other miscellanies allan ramsays evergreen bishop percys reliques of ancient poetry herds ballad volumes of 1776 evans collections burns remakings of old songs ritsons publications and so forth  but the genius of burns while it transfigured many old songs was not often exercised on old narrative ballads and when scott produced the minstrelsy the taste for ballads was confined to amateurs of early literature and to country folk  sir walters method of editing of presenting his traditional materials was literary and usually not scientific  a modern collector would publish thingslegends ballads or folktales exactly as he found them in old broadsides or in ms copies or received them from oral recitation  he would give the names and residences and circumstances of the reciters or narrators herd in 1776 gave no such information  he would fill up no gaps with his own inventions would add no stanzas of his own and the circulation of his work would arrive at some two or three hundred copies given away  as lockhart says scotts diligent zeal had put him in possession of a variety of copies in various stages of preservation and to the task of selecting a standard text among such a diversity of materials he brought a knowledge of old manners and phraseology and a manly simplicity of taste such as had never before been united in the person of a poetical antiquary  lockhart speaks of the editors conscientious fidelity    which prevented the introduction of anything new and his pure taste in the balancing of discordant recitations  he had already written that scott had i firmly believe interpolated hardly a line or even an epithet of his own 8a  it is clear that lockhart had not compared the texts in the minstrelsy with the mass of manuscript materials which are still at abbotsford  these copied by the accurate mr macmath have been published in the monumental collection of english and scottish popular ballads in ten parts by the late professor child of harvard the greatest of scholars in balladlore  from his book we often know exactly what kinds of copies of ballads scott possessed and what alterations he made in his copies  the ballad of otterburne is especially instructive as we shall see later  but of the most famous of border historical ballads kinmont willie and its companion jamie telfer of the fair dodhead scott has left no original manuscript texts  now into each of these ballads scott has written if internal evidence be worth anything verses of his own stanzas unmistakably marked by his own spirit energy sense of romance and occasionally by a somewhat inflated rhetoric  on this point doubt is not easy  when he met the names of his chief buccleuch and of his favourite ancestor wat of warden scott did in two cases for those heroes what by his own confession he did for anecdotes that came in his wayhe decked them out with a cocked hat and a sword  sir walter knew perfectly well that he was not playing the game in a truly scientific spirit  he explains his ideas in his essay on popular poetry as late as 1830  he mentions joseph ritsons extreme attachment to the severity of truth and his attacks on bishop percys purely literary treatment of the materials of his reliques of ancient poetry 1765  as scott says by percy words were altered phrases improved and whole verses were inserted or omitted at pleasure  percy accommodated the ballads with such emendations as might recommend them to the modern taste  ritson cried forgery but percy says scott had to win a hearing from his age and confessed in general terms to his additions and decorations  scott then speaks reprovingly of pinkertons wholesale fabrication of entire ballads 1783 a crime acknowledged later by the culprit 1786  scott applauds ritsons accuracy but regrets his preference of the worst to the better readings as if their inferiority was a security for their being genuine  scott preferred the best the most poetical readings  in 1830 scott also wrote an essay on imitations of the ancient ballads and spoke very leniently of imitations passed off as authentic  there is no small degree of cant in the violent invectives with which impostors of this nature have been assailed as to hardyknute the favourite poem of his infancy the first that i ever learned and the last that i shall forget he says the public is surely more enriched by the contribution than injured by the deception  besides he says the deception almost never deceives  his method in the minstrelsy he writes was to imitate the plan and style of bishop percy observing only more strict fidelity concerning my originals  that is to say he avowedly made up texts out of a variety of copies when he had more copies than one  this is frequently acknowledged by scott what he does not acknowledge is his own occasional interpolation of stanzas  a good example is the gay gosshawk  he had a ms of his own of some antiquity a ms of mrs brown a famous reciter and collector of the eighteenth century and the abbotsford mss show isolated stanzas from hogg and a copy from will laidlaw  mr t f hendersons notes 10a display the methods of selection combination emendation and possible interpolation  by these methods scott composed a standard text now the classical text of the ballads which he published  ballad lovers who are not specialists go to the minstrelsy for their favourite fare and for historical elucidation and anecdote  scott often mentions his sources of all kinds such as mss of herd and mrs brown an old person an old woman at kirkhill west lothian an ostler at carlisle allan ramsays teatable miscellany surtees of mainsforth these ballads are by surtees himself  scott never suspected him caws hawick museum 1774 ritsons copies others from leyden the glenriddell mss collected by the friend of burns on several occasions copies from recitations procured by james hogg or will laidlaw and possibly or probably each of these men emended the copy he obtained while scott combined and emended all in his published text  sometimes scott gives no source at all and in these cases research finds variants in old broadsides or elsewhere  in thirteen cases he gives no source or from tradition which is the same thing though tradition in ettrick forest may sometimes imply once certainly does the intermediary hogg or will laidlaw  we now understand scotts methods as editor  they are not scientific they are literary  we also acknowledge on internal evidence his interpolation of his own stanzas in kinmont willie and jamie telfer where he exalts his chief and ancestor  we cannot do otherwise as scholars than regret and condemn scotts interpolations never confessed  as lovers of poetry we acknowledge that without scotts interpolation we could have no more of kinmont willie than verses much mangled by reciters as scott says of a ballad perhaps no more poetical than jock o the side  scott says that some conjectural emendations have been absolutely necessary to render it intelligible  as it is now very intelligible to say conjectural emendations is a way of saying interpolations  but while thus confessing scotts sins i cannot believe that he like pinkerton palmed off on the world any ballad or ballads of his own sole manufacture or any ballad which he knew to be forged  the truth is that scott was easily deceived by a modern imitation if he liked the poetry  surtees hoaxed him not only with barthrams dirge and anthony featherstonhaugh but with a long prose excerpt from a nonexistent manuscript about a phantom knight  scott made the plot of marmion hinge on this myth in the encounter of marmion with wilfred as the phantasmal cavalier  he tells us that in the flowers of the forest the manner of the ancient minstrels is so happily imitated that it required the most positive evidence to convince the editor that the song was of modern date  really the author was miss jane elliot 17471805 daughter of sir gilbert elliot of minto  herd published a madeup copy in 1776  the tune scott says is old and he has heard an imperfect verse of the original ballad    i ride single on my saddle for the flowers o the forest are a wede awa   the constant use of double rhymes within the line    at een in the gloaming nae younkers are roaming   an artifice rare in genuine ballads might alone have proved to scott that the poem of miss elliot is not popular and ancient  i have cleared my conscience by confessing scotts literary sins his interpolations elsewhere mere stopgaps are mainly to be found in kinmont willie and jamie telfer  his duty was to say in his preface to each ballad the editor has interpolated stanza so and so if he made up the last verses of kinmont willie from the conclusion of a version of archie o cafield he should have said so as he does acknowledge two stopgap interpolations by hogg in auld maitland  but as to the conclusion of kinmont willie he did we shall see make confession  professor kittredge who edited childs last part x says in his excellent abridged edition of child 1905 it was no doubt the feeling that the popular ballad is a fluid and unstable thing that has prompted so many editorsamong them sir walter scott whom it is impossible to assail however much the scholarly conscience may disapproveto deal freely with the versions that came into their hands  twentyfive years after the appearance of the border minstrelsy in 1827 appeared motherwells minstrelsy ancient and modern motherwell was in favour of scientific methods of editing  given two copies of a ballad he says perhaps they may not have a single stanza which is mutual property except certain commonplaces which seem an integral portion of the original mechanism of all our ancient ballads      by selecting the most beautiful and striking passages from each copy and making those cohere an editor he says may produce a more perfect and ornate version than any that exists in tradition  of the originals the individuality entirely disappears  motherwell disapproved of this method which as a rule is scotts and scientifically the method is not defensible  thus having three ballads of rescues in similar circumstances with a river to ford scott confessedly places that incident where he thinks it most poetically appropriate and in all probability by a single touch he gives poetry in place of rough humour  of all this motherwell disapproved see kinmont willie infra  aytoun in the ballads of scotland thought motherwell hypercritical and also in his practice inconsistent with his preaching  aytoun observed with much regret and not a little indignation 1859 that later editors insinuated a doubt as to the fidelity of sir walters rendering  my firm belief resting on documentary evidence is that scott was most scrupulous in adhering to the very letter of his transcripts whenever copies of ballads previously taken down were submitted to him  as an example aytoun using a now lost ms copy of about 16891702 of the outlaw murray says sir walter has given it throughout just as he received it  yet scotts copy mainly from a lost cockburn ms contains a humorous passage on buccleuch which child half suspects to be by sir walter himself 15a  it is impossible for me to know whether childs hesitating conjecture is right or wrong  certainly we shall see when scott had but one ms copy as of auld maitland his editing left little or nothing to be desired  but now scott is assailed both where he deserves and where in my opinion he does not deserve censure  scott did no more than his confessed following of percys method implies to his original text of the ballad of otterburne  this i shall prove from his original text published by child from the abbotsford mss and by a letter from the collector of the ballad the ettrick shepherd  the facts in this instance apparently are utterly unknown to lieutenantcolonel the hon fitzwilliam elliot in his further essays on border ballads 1910 pp 145  again i am absolutely certain and can demonstrate that scott did not as colonel elliot believes detect hogg in forging auld maitland join with him in this fraud and palm the ballad off on the public  nothing of the kind occurred  scott did not lie in this matter both to the world and to his intimate friends in private letters  once more without better evidence than we possess i do not believe that in jamie telfer scott transferred the glory from the elliots to the scotts and the shame from buccleuch to elliot of stobs  the discussion leads us into very curious matter  but here with our present materials neither absolute proof nor disproof is possible  finally as to kinmont willie i merely give such reasons as i can find for thinking that scott had mangled fragments of an old ballad before him and did not merely paraphrase the narrative of walter scott of satchells in his doggerel true history of the name of scott 1688  the positions of colonel elliot are in each case the reverse of mine in the instance of auld maitland where scotts conduct would be unpardonable if colonel elliots view were correct i have absolute proof that he is entirely mistaken  for otterburne i am equally fortunate that is i can show that scotts part went no further than the making of a standard text on his avowed principles  for jamie telfer having no original manuscript i admit decorative interpolations and for the rest argue on internal evidence no other being accessible  for kinmont willie i confess that the poem as it stands is scotts but give reasons for thinking that he had ballad fragments in his mind if not on paper  it will be understood that colonel elliot does not i conceive say that his charges are proved but he thinks that the evidence points to these conclusions  he hopes that i will give reasons for my disbelief in his theories and hopes though he cannot expect that they will completely dispose of his views about jamie telfer 17a  i give my reasons though i entertain but slight hope of convincing my courteous opponent  that is always a task rather desperate  but the task leads me in defence of a great memory into a countryside and into old times on the border which are so alluring that like socrates i must follow where the logos guides me  to one conclusion it guides me which startles myself but i must follow the logos even against the verdict of professor child notre maitre a tous  in some instances i repeat positive proof of the correctness of my views is impossible all that i can do is to show that colonel elliots contrary opinions also fall far short of demonstration or are demonstrably erroneous    auld maitland    the ballad of auld maitland holds in the border minstrelsy a place like that of the doloneia or tenth book in the iliad  every professor of the higher criticism throws his stone at the doloneia in passing and every balladeditor does as much to auld maitland 19a professor child excluded it from his monumental collection of english and scottish popular ballads fragments and variants for which mr child and his friends and helpers ransacked every attainable collection of ballads in manuscript and ballads in print as they listened to the last murmurings of ballad tradition from the lips of old or young  mr child says his friend and pupil professor kittredge possessed a kind of instinct for distinguishing what is genuine and traditional or modern or manipulated or if i may say so faked in a ballad  this instinct trained by thirty years of study had become wonderfully swift in its operations and almost infallible  a forged or retouched piece could not escape him for a moment  he detected the slightest jar in the ballad ring 18a  but all old traditional ballads are masses of retouches made through centuries by reciters copyists editors and so forth unluckily child never gave in detail his reasons for rejecting that treasure of sir walters auld maitland  child excluded the poem sans phrase  if he did this like falstaff on instinct one can only say that antiquarian instincts are never infallible  we must apply our reason to the problem what is auld maitland  colonel elliot has taken this course  by far the most blighting of the many charges made by colonel elliot against sir walter scott are concerned with the ballad of auld maitland 19a  after stating that in his opinion several stanzas of the ballad are by sir walter himself colonel elliot sums up his own ideas thus  my view is that hogg in the first instance tried to palm off the ballad on scott and failed and then scott palmed it off on the public and succeeded    let us as gentlemen and honest judges admit that the responsibility of the deception rests rather on the laird scott than on the herd hogg 19b  if colonel elliots views were correct and it is absolutely erroneous the guilt of the laird would be great  scott conspires with a shepherd a stranger to palm off a forgery on the public scott issues the forgery and what is worse in a private letter to a learned friend he utters what i must borrow words for  he utters cold and calculated falsehoods about the manner in which and the person from whom he obtained what he calls my first copy of the song  if hogg and scott forged the poem then when scott told his tale of its acquisition by himself from laidlaw scott lied  colonel elliot is ignorant of the facts in the case  he gropes his way under the misleading light of a false date and of fragments torn from the context of a letter which in its complete form has never till now been published  where positive and published information exists it has not always come within the range of the critics researches had it done so he would have taken the information into account but he does not  of the existence of scotts first copy of the ballad in manuscript our critic seems never to have heard certainly he has not studied the ms  had he done so he would not assign on grounds like those of homeric critics this verse to hogg and that to scott  he would know that scott did not interpolate a single stanza that spelling punctuation and some slight verbal corrections with an admirable emendation were the sum of his industry  that he did not even excise two stanzas of at earliest eighteenth century work  i must now clear up misconceptions which have imposed themselves on all critics of the ballad on myself for example no less than on colonel elliot  and must tell the whole story of how the existence of the ballad first became known to scotts collector and friend william laidlaw how he procured the copy which he presented to sir walter and how sir walter obtained from recitation his second copy that which he printed in the minstrelsy in 1803  in 1801 scott who was collecting ballads gave a list of songs which he wanted to mr andrew mercer of selkirk  mercer knew young will laidlaw farmer in blackhouse on yarrow where hogg had been a shepherd for ten years  laidlaw applied for two ballads one of them the outlaw murray to hogg then shepherding at ettrick house at the head of ettrick above thirlestane  hogg replied on 20th july 1801 he could get but a few verses of the outlaw from his maternal uncle will laidlaw of phawhope  he said that from traditions known to him he could make good songs but without mr scotts permission this would be an imposition neither could i undertake it without an order from him in his own handwriting     21a  laidlaw went on trying to collect songs for scott  we now take his own account of auld maitland from a manuscript left by him 21b  i heard from one of the servant girls who had all the turn and qualifications for a collector of a ballad called auld maitland that a grandfather maternal of hogg could repeat and she herself had several of the first stanzas which i took a note of and have still the copy  this greatly aroused my anxiety to procure the whole for this was a ballad not even hinted at by mercer in his list of desiderata received from mr scott  i forthwith wrote to hogg himself requesting him to endeavour to procure the whole ballad  in a week or two i received his reply containing auld maitland exactly as he had received it from the recitation of his uncle will of phawhope corroborated by his mother who both said they learned it from their father a still older will of phawhope and an old man called andrew muir who had been servant to the famous mr boston minister of ettrick  concerning laidlaws evidence colonel elliot says not a word  this copy of auld maitland with the superscription outside    mr william laidlaw blackhouse  all in hoggs hand is now at abbotsford  we next have through carruthers using laidlaws manuscript an account of the arrival of scott and leyden at blackhouse of laidlaws presentation of hoggs manuscript which scott read aloud and of their surprise and delight  scott was excited so that his burr became very perceptible 23a  the time of year when scott and leyden visited yarrow was not the autumn vacation of 1802 as lockhart erroneously writes 23b but the spring vacation of 1802  the spring vacation mr macmath informs me ran from 11th march to 12th may in 1802  in may apparently scott having obtained the auld maitland ms in the vernal vacation of the court of session gave his account of his discovery to his friend ellis lockhart does not date the letter but wrongly puts it after the return to edinburgh in november 1802  scott wrote thus we john leyden and himself have just concluded an excursion of two or three weeks through my jurisdiction of selkirkshire where in defiance of mountains rivers and bogs damp and dry we have penetrated the very recesses of ettrick forest    i have    returned loaded with the treasures of oral tradition  the principal result of our inquiries has been a complete and perfect copy of maitland with his auld berd graie referred to by gawain douglas in his palice of honour 1503 along with john the reef and other popular characters and celebrated in the poems from the maitland ms circ 1575  you may guess the surprise of leyden and myself when this was presented to us copied down from the recitation of an old shepherd by a country farmer    many of the old words are retained which neither the reciter nor the copyer understood  such are the military engines sowies springwalls springalds and many others     24a  that scott got the ballad in spring 1802 is easily proved  on 10th april 1802 joseph ritson the crabbed illtempered but meticulously accurate scholar who thought that balladforging should be made a capital offence wrote thus to scott  i have the pleasure of enclosing my copy of a very ancient poem which appears to me to be the original of the wee wee man and which i learn from mr ellis you are desirous to see  in scotts letter to ellis just quoted he says  i have lately had from him ritson a copie of ye litel wee man of which i think i can make some use  in return i have sent him a sight of auld maitland the original ms    i wish him to see it in puris naturalibus  the precaution here taken was very natural says lockhart considering ritsons temper and hatred of literary forgeries  scott when he wrote to ellis had received ritsons the wee wee man lately  it was sent to him by ritson on 10th april 1802  scott had already when he wrote to ellis got the original ms of auld maitland now in abbotsford library  by 10th june 1802 ritson wrote saying you may depend on my taking the utmost care of old maitland and returning it in health and safety  i would not use the liberty of transcribing it into my manuscript copy of mrs browns ballads but if you will signify your permission i shall be highly gratified 25 your ancient and curious ballad he styles the piece  thus scott had auld maitland in may 1802 he sent the original ms to ritson ritson received it graciously he had on 10th april 1802 sent scott another ms the wee wee man  and when scott wrote to ellis about his surprise at getting a complete and perfect copy of maitland he had but lately received the wee wee man sent by ritson on 10th april 1802  he had made a spring not an autumn raid into the forest  we now know the external history of the ballad  laidlaw hearing his servant repeat some stanzas asks hogg for the full copy which hogg sends with a pedigree from which he never wavered  auld andrew muir taught the song to hoggs mother and uncle  hogg took it from his uncles recitation and sent it directed outside  to mr william laidlaw blackhouse  and laidlaw gave it to scott in march 12may 12 1802  but scott publishing the ballad in the minstrelsy 1803 says it is given as written down from the recitation of the mother of mr james hogg who sings or rather chants it with great animation manifestly he had heard the recitation which he describes  it seems that scott before he wrote to ellis in may 1802 had misgivings about the ballad  says carruthers he made another visit to blackhouse for the purpose of getting laidlaw as a guide to ettrick being curious to see the poetical shepherd  laidlaws ms used by carruthers describes the wild ride by the marshes at the head of the loch of the lowes through the bogs on the knees of the hills down a footpath to ramseycleuch in ettrick  they sent to ettrick house for hogg scott was surprised and pleased with jamess appearance  they had a delightful evening  the qualities of hogg came out at every instant and his unaffected simplicity and fearless frankness both surprised and pleased the sheriff 26a next morning they visited hogg and his mother at her cottage and hogg tells how the old lady recited auld maitland  hogg gave the story in prose with great vivacity and humour in his domestic manners of sir walter scott 1834  in an earlier poetical address to scott congratulating him on his elevation to the baronetcy 1818 the shepherd says    when maitlands song first met your ear how the furled visage up did clear beaming delight though now a shade of doubt would darken into dread that some unskilled presumptuous arm had marred traditions mighty charm scarce grew thy lurking dread the less till she the ancient minstreless with fervid voice and kindling eye and withered arms waving on high sung forth these words in eldritch shriek while tears stood on thy nutbrown cheek na we are nane o the lads o france nor eer pretend to be we be three lads of fair scotland auld maitlands sons a three   stanza xliii as printed  in hoggs ms copy given to laidlaw there are two verbal differences in lines 1 and 4  then says hogg    thy fist made all the table ring by  sir but that is the thing   hogg could not thus describe the scene in addressing scott himself in 1818 if his story were not true  it thus follows that his mother knew the sixtyfive stanzas of the ballad by heart  does any one believe that as a woman of seventytwo she learned the poem to back hoggs hoax  that he wrote the poem and caused her to learn it by rote so as to corroborate his imposture  this is absurd  but now comes the source of colonel elliots theory of a conspiracy between scott and hogg to forge a ballad and issue the forgery colonel elliot knows scraps of a letter to hogg of 30th june 1802 he has read parts not bearing on the question in mr douglass familiar letters of sir walter scott vol i pp 1215 and another scrap in which hogg says that i am surprised to hear that auld maitland is suspected by some to be a modern forgery  this part of hoggs letter of 30th june 1802 was published by scott himself in the third volume of the minstrelsy april 1803  not having the context of the letter colonel elliot seems to argue scott says he got his first copy in autumn 1802 lockharts mistake yet here are hogg and scott corresponding about the ballad long before autumn in june 1802  this is very suspicious  i give what appears to be colonel elliots line of reflection in my own words  he decides that as early as june 1802 hoggin the colonels view in the first instance tried to palm off the ballad on scott and failed and that then scott palmed it off on the public and succeeded  this is all a mares nest  scott in marchmay 1802 had the whole of the ballad except one stanza which hogg sent to him on 30th june  i now print for the first time the whole of hoggs letter of 30th june with its shrewd criticism on ballads hitherto omitted and i italicise the passage about auld maitland   ettrick house june 30  dear siri have been perusing your minstrelsy very diligently for a while past and it being the first book i ever perused which was written by a person i had seen and conversed with the consequence hath been to me a most sensible pleasure for in fact it is the remarks and modern pieces that i have delighted most in being as it were personally acquainted with many of the modern pieces formerly my mother is actually a living miscellany of old songs  i never believed that she had half so many until i came to a trial  there are some sic in your collection of which she hath not a part and i should by this time had a great number written for your amusement thinking them all of great antiquity and lost to posterity had i not luckily lighted upon a collection of songs in two volumes published by i know not who in which i recognised about halfascore of my mothers best songs almost word for word  no doubt i was piqued but it saved me much trouble paper and ink for i am carefully avoiding anything which i have seen or heard of being in print although i have no doubt that i shall err being acquainted with almost no collections of that sort but i am not afraid that you too will mistake  i am still at a loss with respect to some  such as the battle of flodden beginning from spey to the border a long poetical piece on the battle of bannockburn i fear modern  the battle of the boyne young batemans ghost all of which and others which i cannot mind i could mostly recover for a few miles travel were i certain they could be of any use concerning the above and i might have mentioned may cohn and a duel between two friends graham and bewick undoubtedly very old  you must give me information in your answer  i have already scraped together a considerable quantitysuspend your curiosity mr scott you will see them when i see you of which i am as impatient as you can be to see the songs for your life  but as i suppose you have no personal acquaintance in this parish it would be presumption in me to expect that you will visit my cottage but i will attend you in any part of the forest if you will send me word  i am far from supposing that a person of your discernmentdn it ill blot out that tis so like flattery  i say i dont think you would despise a shepherds humble cot an hamely fare as burns hath it yet though i would be extremely proud of a visit yet hang me if i would know what to do wi ye  i am surprised to find that the songs in your collection differ so widely from my mothers  is mr herds ms genuine  i suspect it  jamie telfer differs in many particulars  johnny armstrong of gilnockie is another song altogether  i have seen a verse of my mothers way called johny armstrongs last goodnight cited in the spectator and another in boswells journal  it begins is there neer a man in fair scotland  do you know if this is in print mr scott  in the tale of tomlin the whole of the interlude about the horse and the hawk is a distinct song altogether 30a  clerk saunders is nearly the same with my mothers until that stanza xvi which ends was in the tower last night wi me then with another verse or two which are not in yours ends clerk saunders  all the rest of the song in your edition is another song altogether which my mother hath mostly likewise and i am persuaded from the change in the stile that she is right for it is scarce consistent with the forepart of the ballad i have made several additions and variations out to the printed songs for your inspection but only when they could be inserted without disjointing the songs as they are at present to have written all the variations would scarcely be possible and i thought would embarrass you exceedingly  i have recovered another half verse of old maitlan and have rhymed it thus    remember fiery of the scot hath cowrd aneath thy hand for ilka drap o maitlens blood ill gie thee rigs o land    the two last lines only are original you will easily perceive that they occur in the very place where we suspected a want  i am surprised to hear that this song is suspected by some to be a modern forgery this will be best proved by most of the old people hereabouts having a great part of it by heart many indeed are not aware of the manners of this place it is but lately emerged from barbarity and till this present age the poor illiterate people in these glens knew of no other entertainment in the long winter nights than in repeating and listening to these feats of their ancestors which i believe to be handed down inviolate from father to son for many generations although no doubt had a copy been taken of them at the end of every fifty years there must have been some difference which the repeaters would have insensibly fallen into merely by the change of terms in that period  i believe that it is thus that many very ancient songs have been modernised which yet to a connoisseur will bear visible marks of antiquity  the maitlen for instance exclusive of its mode of description is all composed of words which would mostly every one spell and pronounce in the very same dialect that was spoken some centuries ago  pardon my dear sir the freedom i have taken in addressing youit is my nature and i could not resist the impulse of writing to you any longer  let me hear from you as soon as this comes to your hand and tell me when you will be in ettrick forest and suffer me to subscribe myself sir your most humble and affectionate servant  james hogg   in scotts printed text of the ballad two interpolations of two lines each are acknowledged in notes  they occur in stanzas vii xlvi and are attributed to hogg  in fact hogg sent one of them vii to laidlaw in his manuscript  the other he sent to scott on 30th june 1802  colonel elliot in the spirit of the higher criticism chimaera bombinans in vacuo writes 31a few will doubt that the footnotes on these interpolations were inserted with the purpose of leading the public to think that hogg made no other interpolations but i am afraid i must go further than this and say that since they were inserted on the editors responsibility the intention must have been to make it appear as if no other interpolations by any other hand had been inserted  but no other interpolations by another hand were inserted  some verbal emendations were made by scott but he never put in a stanza or two lines of his own  colonel elliot provides us with six pages of the higher criticism he knows how to distinguish between verses by hogg and verses by scott 32a  but save when scott puts one line a ballad formula where hogg has another line scott makes no interpolations and the ballad formula he probably took with other things of no more importance from mrs hoggs recitation  oh higher criticism  i now print the ballad as hogg sent it to laidlaw between august 1801 and march 1802 in all probability  back of hoggs ms  mr william laidlaw blackhouse

following lines anywhere you think it needs them or substitute two better    and marching south with curst dunbar    a ready welcome found   iiwhat is auld maitland   is auld maitland a sheer forgery by hogg or is it in any sense and if so in what sense antique and traditional  that hogg made the whole of it is to me incredible  he had told laidlaw on 20th july 1801 that he would make no ballads on traditions without scotts permission written in scotts hand  moreover how could he have any traditions about auld maitland his noble sonnis three personages of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries  scott had read about them in poems of about 1580 but these poems then lay in crabbed manuscripts again hogg wrote in words springs wallstanes of whose meaning he had no idea he took it as he heard it in recitation  finally the style is not that of hogg when he attempts the ballad  scott observed that this ballad notwithstanding its present appearance has a claim to very high antiquity  the language except for a few technical terms is modern but what else could it be if handed down orally  the language of undoubted ballads is often more modern than that which was spoken in my boyhood in ettrick forest  as sir walter scott remarked a poem of 15701580 which he quotes from the maitland mss would run as smoothly and appear as modern as any verse in the ballad with a few exceptions if divested of its antique spelling  we now turn to the historical characters in the ballad  sir richard maitland of lauder or thirlestane says scott was already in his lands and making donations to the church in 1249  if in 1296 fortyseven years later he held his castle against edward i as in the ballad he must have been a man of say seventyfive  by about 1574 his descendant sir richard maitland was consoled for his family misfortunes his famous son lethington having died after the long siege of edinburgh castle which he and kirkcaldy of grange held for queen mary by a poet who reminded him that his ancestor in the thirteenth century lost all his sonspeerless pearlssave one burdallane  the sir richard of 1575 has also one son left john the minister of james vi 41a  from this evidence in 1802 in ms unpublished and from other maitland mss we learn that in the sixteenth century the auld maitland of the ballad was an eminent character in the legends of that period and in the ballads of the people 42b  his      nobill sonnis three ar sung in monie far countrie albeit in rural rhyme   pinkerton published in 1786 none of the pieces to which scott refers in his extracts from the maitland mss  how then did hogg if hogg forged the ballad know of maitland and his three noble sons  except colonel elliot to whose explanation we return i am not aware that any critic has tried to answer this question  it seems to me that if the ballad of otterburne extant in 1550 in england survived in scottish memory till herds fragment appeared in 1776 a tradition of maitland who was popular in the ballads of 1575 and known to gawain douglas seventy years earlier may also have persisted  there is no impossibility  looking next at scotts auld maitland the story is that king edward i reigned for fifty years  he had a nephew edward an apocryphal person such figures are common in ballads who wished to take part in the invasion of scotland  the english are repulsed by old maitland from his darksome house on the leader  the english however stanza xv conquer scotland and join edward i in france  they besiege that town   which some call billopgrace xviii   here maitlands three sons are learning at school as scots often were educated in france  they see that edwards standard quarters the arms of france and infer that he has conquered their country  they will try some jeopardy  persuading the english that they are themselves englishmen they ask leave to carry the royal flag  the eldest is told that he is singularly like auld maitland  in anger he stabs the standardbearer seizes the flag and with his brothers spurs to billopgrace where the french captain receives them  there is fighting at the gate  the king says that three disguised lads of france have stolen his flag  the maitlands apparently heard of this the youngest goes to edward and explains that they are maitlands sons and scots they challenge any three englishmen a thing in the manner of the period  the three scots are victorious  young edward then challenges one of the dauntless three who slays him  edward wishes himself home at london tower  such is the story  it is out of the regular line of ballad narrative but it does not follow that in the sixteenth century some such tale was not told in rural rhyme about maitlands three noble sons that it is not historically true is nothing of course and that it is not in the scots of the thirteenth century is nothing  colonel elliot asks what in the ballad raised suspicion of forgery in 180203  the historical inaccuracies are common to all historical ballads  in an english ballad known to me of 1578 henry darnley is hanged on a tree  next there are occasional lines and even stanzas which jar in style to such a degree that they must have been written by two separate hands  but this also is a common feature  in professor child and the ballad mr w m hart gives a list of professor childs notes on the multiplicity of hands which he and every critic detect in some ballads with a genuinely antique substratum 44a  colonel elliot quotes as in his opinion the best stanzas viii ix x xi while he thinks xv xviii the worst  i give these stanzas    viii  they lighted on the banks o tweed    and blew their coals sae het and fired the merse and teviotdale    all in an evening late  ix  as they fared up oer lammermoor    they burned baith up and doun until they came to a darksome house    some call it leader town  x  wha hauds this house young edward cried    or wha giest ower to me a greyhaird knight set up his head    and crackit right crousely  xi  of scotlands king i haud my house    he pays me meat and fee and i will keep my guid auld house    while my house will keep me   i cannot i admit find any fault with these stanzas  cannot see any reason why they should not be traditional  then colonel elliot cites as the worst    xv  then fifteen barks all gaily good    met them upon a day which they did lade with as much spoil    as they could take away  xviii  until we came unto that town    which some call billopgrace there were auld maitlands sons a three    learning at school alas   now if i venture to differ from colonel elliot here i may plead that i am practised in the art of balladfaking and can produce high testimonials of skill  to me stanzas xv xviii seem to differ much from viiixi but not in such a way as hogg would have differed had he made them  hoggs error would have lain as scotts did in being as scott said of mrs hemans too poetical  neither hogg nor scott i think was crafty enough to imitate the prosaic drawl of the printed broadside ballad or the feeble interpolations with which the gangrel scrapegut or bankelsanger supplied gaps in his memory  the modern complete balladfaker would introduce such abject verses but scott and hogg desired to decorate not to debase ballads with which they intermeddled and we track them by their modern romantic touch when they interpolate  i take it for this reason that hogg did not write stanzas xv xviii  it was hardly in nature for hogg if he knew ville de grace in normandy a thing not very probable to invent billopgrace as a popular corruption of the nameand a popular corruption it is i think  probably the original maker of this stanza wrote in line 4 alace an old spellingnot alasto rhyme with grace  colonel elliot then assigns xv xviii as most likely of all to be by hogg  on that i have given my opinion with my reasons  these verses with xviii lead us to france and whereas scott here suspects that some verses have been lost see his note to stanza xviii colonel elliot suspects that the stanzas relating to france have been interpolated  but the french scenes occupy the whole poem from xvi to lxv the end  what if hogg were the forger were his sources  he may have known douglass palice of honour which of course existed in print with its mention of maitlands grey beard  but how did he know maitlands three noble sons in 18011802 lying unsunned in the maitland mss  this is a point which critics of auld maitland studiously ignore yet it is the essential point  how did the shepherd know about the three young maitlands whose existence in legend is only revealed to us through a manuscript unpublished in 1802  colonel elliot does not evade the point  we may be sure he says that leyden before 1802 knew hogg and hogg might have obtained from him sufficient information to enable him to compose the ballad 47a  but it was from laidlaw not from leyden that scott after receiving his first copy at blackhouse in spring 1802 obtained hoggs address 47b  there is no hint that before spring 1802 leyden ever saw hogg  had he known him and his balladlore he would have brought him and scott together  in 180102 leyden was very busy in edinburgh helping scott to edit sir tristram copying arthour seeking for an east india appointment and going into society  scotts letters prove all this 47c  that hogg in 1802 was very capable of writing a ballad i admit also that through blind harrys wallace he may have known all about sowies and portculize and springwalls or springalds or springalls mediaeval balistas for throwing heavy stones and darts but hogg did not know or guess what a springwall was  in his stanza xiii in the ms given to laidlaw hogg wrote    with springs wall stanes and good oern    among them fast he threw   scott saw the real meaning of this nonsense and read    with springalds stones and gads o airn   in his preface he says that many words in the ballad which the reciters have retained without understanding them still preserve traces of their antiquity  for instance springalls corruptedly pronounced springwalls  hogg hearing the pronunciation and not understanding wrote with springs  wall stanes  a leader would not throw wall stanes till he had exhausted his ammunition  hogg heard with springwalls stones he threw and wrote it with springs  wall stones he threw  hogg could not know of auld maitland and his three noble sons except through an informant familiar with the maitland mss in edinburgh university library  on the theory of a conspiracy to forge scott taught him but that theory is crushed  hogg says in domestic manners of sir walter scott that when his mother met scott she told him that her brother and she learned the ballad from auld andrew muir and he from auld babby mettlin housekeeper of the first anderson laird of tushielaw  this first anderson laird of tushielaw reigned from 1688 to 1721  or 1724 48a  hoggs mother was born in 1730 and was only one removefilled up by andrew muirfrom babby who was ither than a gude yin and knew many songs  does any one think hogg crafty enough to have invented babby maitland as the source of a song about the maitlands and to have introduced her into his narrative in 1834  i conjecture that this maitland woman knew a maitland song modernised in time and perhaps copied out and emended by one of the maitland family possibly one of the descendants of lethington  we know that under james i about 1620 lethingtons impoverished son james had several children and that lauderdale was still supporting them or their children during the restoration  only a century before ballads on the maitlands had certainly been popular and there is nothing impossible in the suggestion that one such ballad survived in the lauderdale or lethington family and came through babby maitland to andrew muir then to hoggs mother to hogg and to scott  if a manuscript copy ever existed and was babbys ultimate source it would be of the late seventeenth century  that is the ascertained date of the oldest known ms of the outlaw murray as is proved from an allusion in a note appended to a copy referring to a judge of session lord philiphaugh as then alive  the copy was of 16891702 49a  granting a ms of auld maitland existing in any branch of the maitland family in 16801700 babby mettlins knowledge of the ballad and its few modernisms are explained  as lockhart truly says hogg was the most extraordinary man that ever wore the maud of a shepherd  he had none of burns education  in 1802 he was young and ignorant of cities and always was innocent of research in the crabbed mss of the sixteenth century  yet he gets at legendary persons known to us only through these mss  he makes a ballad named auld maitland about them  through him a farmlass at blackhouse acquires some stanzas which laidlaw copies  in a fortnight hogg sends laidlaw the whole ballad with the pedigreehis uncle his mother their father and old andrew muir servant to the famous rev mr boston of ettrick  the copy takes in scott and leyden  later ritson makes no objection  mrs hogg recites it to scott and according to hogg gives a casual auld babby maitland as the original source  is the whole fraud conceivable  hogg we must believe puts in two stanzas xv xviii of the lowliest order of printed stallcopy or gangrel scrapegut style and the same with intent to deceive  he introduces billopgrace as a deceptive popular corruption of ville de grace  this is far beyond any craft that i have found in the most artful modern fakers  one stanza xlix    but ethert lunn a baited bear had many battles seen    seems to me very recent whoever made it  scott in lxii gives a variant of some reciters for that edward once lay under me they read that englishman lay under me  this if a false story was an example of an art more delicate than scott elsewhere exhibits  one does not know what professor child would have said to my arguments he never gave a criticism in detail of the ballad and of the circumstances in which scott acquired it  a man most reasonable most open to conviction he would i think have confessed his perplexity  scott did not interpolate a single stanza even where as hogg wrote he suspected a lacuna in the text  he neither cut out nor improved the cryingly modern stanzas  he kept them as he kept several stanzas in tamlane which so he told laidlaw were obviously recent but were in a copy which he procured through lady dalkeith 51a  by neither adding to nor subtracting from his ms copy of auld maitland scott proved i think his respect for a poem which in its primal form he believed to be very ancient  we know at all events that ballads on the maitland heroes were current about 1580  so late in the sixteenth century were the ballads quoted by hume of godscroft on the murder of the knight of liddesdale 1354 the murder of the young earl of douglas in edinburgh castle 1440 and the battle of otterburn  of these three only otterburne was recovered by herd published in 1776  the other two are lost and there is no prima facie reason why a maitland ballad of the sort current in 1580 should not in favourable circumstances have survived till 1802  as regards the shepherds ideas of honesty in balladcollecting at this early period i have quoted his letter to laidlaw of 20th july 1802  again in the case of his text from recitation of the ballad of otterburne published by scott in the minstrelsy of 1806 he gave the sheriff a full account of his mode of handling his materials and scott could get more minute details by questioning him  to this text of otterburne freely attacked by colonel elliot in apparent ignorance as before of the published facts of the case and of the manuscript we next turn our attention  in the meantime scott no more conspired to forge auld maitland than he conspired to forge the pentateuch  that hogg did not forge auld maitland i think i have made as nearly certain as anything in this region can be  i think that the results are a lesson to professors of the higher criticism of homer    the ballad of otterburne    scotts version of the ballad of otterburne as given first in the minstrelsy of 1806 comes under colonel elliots most severe censure he concludes in favour of the view that it consists partly of stanzas from percys reliques which have undergone emendations calculated to disguise the source from which they came partly of stanzas of modern fabrication and partly of a very few stanzas and lines from herds version 1776 53a  as a matter of fact we know though colonel elliot does not the whole process of construction of the otterburne in the minstrelsy of 1806 professor child published all the texts with a letter 53b  it is a pity that colonel elliot overlooks facts in favour of conjecture concerning historical facts he is not more thorough in research  the story in percys reliques of the slaying of douglas by percy is so far as i know supported neither by history nor by tradition 53c if unfamiliar with the english chroniclers in latin of the end of the fourteenth century colonel elliot could find them cited by professor child  knyghton walsingham and the continuator of higden malverne all assert that percy killed douglas with his own hand 54a  the english ballad of otterburne in ms of about 1550 gives this version of douglass death  it is erroneous  froissart a contemporary had accounts of the battle from combatants both english and scottish douglas fighting in the front of the van on a moonlight night was slain by three lancewounds received in the mellay  the english knew not whom they had slain  the interesting point is that while the scottish ballads give either the english version of percys death in minstrelsy 1806 or another account mentioned by hume of godscroft circ 1610 that he was slain by one of his own men the scottish versions are all deeply affected in an important point by froissarts contemporary narrative which has not affected the english versions  the point is that the death of douglas was by his order concealed from both parties  when both the english version in percys reliques from a ms of about 1550 and scotts version of 1806 mention a challenge to battle between percy and douglas colonel elliot calls this incident probably purely fanciful and imaginary and suspects scotts version of being made up and altered from the english text  but the challenge which resulted in the battle of otterburn is not fanciful and imaginary  it is mentioned by froissart  douglas he says took percys pennon in an encounter under newcastle  percy vowed that douglas would never carry the pennon out of northumberland douglas challenged him to come and take it from his tent door that night but percy was constrained not to accept the challenge  the scots then marched homewards but douglas insisted on besieging otterburn castle here he passed some days on purpose to give percy a chance of a fight percys force surprised the scots they were warned as in the ballads suddenly by a man who galloped up the fight began and so on  now herds version says nothing of douglas at newcastle the whole scene is at otterburn  on the other hand charles kirkpatrick sharpes ms text did bring douglas to newcastle  of this colonel elliot says nothing  the english version says nothing of percys loss of his pennon to douglas nor does sharpes and gives the challenge and tryst  scotts version says nothing of percys pennon but douglas takes percys sword and vows to carry it home  percys challenge in the english version is accompanied by a gross absurdity  he bids douglas wait at otterburn where pour tout potage to an army absurdly stated at 40000 men percy suggests venison and pheasants  in the scottish version percy offers tryst at otterburn  douglas answers that though otterburn has no suppliesnothing but deer and wild birdshe will there tarry for percy  this is chivalrous and in scotts version douglas understands war  in the english version percy does not  to these facts i return giving more details  colonel elliot supposes some one scott i daresay to have taken percysthe english versionaltered it to taste concealed the alterations as in this part of the challenge by inverting the speeches and writing new stanzas of the fight at otterburn used a very little of herd which is true and inserted modern stanzas  now first as regards pilfering from the english version that version and herds undisputed version have undeniably a common source  neither as it stands is original of an original contemporary otterburn ballad we have no trace  by 1550 when such ballads were certainly current both in england and scotland they were late confused by tradition and of what we possess say herds and the english ms of 1550 all were interblended  the scots ballad version known to hume of godscroft 1610 may have been taken from the english and altered as child thought or the english as motherwell maintained may have been borrowed from the scots and altered  one or the other process undeniably occurred the second poet who made the changes introduced the events most favourable to his country and left out the less favourable  by scotts time or herds the versions were much degraded through decay of memory bad penny broadsides lost and uneducated reciters herds version has forgotten the historic affair of the capture of percys pennon and of the whole movement on newcastle preserved in sharpes and scotts scotts remembers the encounter at newcastle forgets the pennon and substitutes the capture by douglas of percys sword  the englishman deliberately omits the capture of the pennon the scots version here altered by sir walter makes percy wound douglas at otterburn    till backward he did flee   now colonel elliot has no right i conceive to argue that this scots version with the newcastle incident the captured sword the challenge the backward flight of douglas were introduced by a modern scott who was deliberately faking the english version there is no reason why tradition should not have retained historical incidents in the scottish form it is a mere assumption that a modern borrowed and travestied these incidents from percys reliques  we possess hoggs unedited original of scotts version of 1806 an original ms never hinted at by colonel elliot and it retains clear traces of being contaminated with a version of the huntiss of chevet popular in 1459 as we read in the complaynte of scotland of that date there is also an old english version of the hunting of the cheviot 1550 or later bodleian library  the unedited text of scotts otterburne then contained traces of the huntiss of chevet the two were mixed in popular memory  in short scotts text manipulated slightly by him in a way which i shall describe was a thing surviving in popular memory  how confusedly will be explained  the differences between the english version of 1550 and the scots collected for scott by hogg are of old standing  i am not sure that there was not before 1550 a scottish ballad which the english balladmonger of that date annexed and altered  the english version of 1550 is not popular it is the work of a humble literary man  the english is a very long ballad in seventy quatrains it greatly exaggerates the number of the scots engaged 40000 and it is the work of a professional author who uses the stereotyped prosaic stopgaps of the cheap hack    i tell you withouten dread   is his favourite phrase and he cites historical authority    the cronykle wyll not layne lie   scottish ballads do not appeal to chroniclers  a patriotic and imbecile effort is made by the englishman to represent percy as captured indeed but released without ransom    there was then a scottysh prisoner tayne sir hew mongomery was his name for sooth as i yow saye he borrowed the persey home agayne   this is obscure and in any case false  percy was taken and towards his ransom richard ii paid 3000 pounds 59a  it may be well to quote the openings of each ballad english and scots   english 1550  i  it fell about the lammas tyde    when husbands win their hay the doughty douglas bound him to ride    in england to take a prey  ii  the earl of fife withouten strife    he bound him over solway the great would ever together ride    that race they may rue for aye  iii  over hoppertop hill they came in    and so down by rodcliff crag upon green linton they lighted down    stirring many a stag  iv  and boldly brent northumberland    and harried many a town they did our englishmen great wrong    to battle that were not boune  v  then spake a berne upon the bent     scottish herd 1776  i  it fell and about the lammas time    when hushandmen do win their hay earl douglas is to the english woods    and a with him to fetch a prey  ii  he has chosen the lindsays light    with them the gallant gordons gay and the earl of fyfe withouten strife    and hugh montgomery upon a grey the last line is obviously a reciters stopgap  iii  they have taken northumberland    and sae hae they the north shire and the otterdale they hae burned hale    and set it a into fire  iv  out then spak a bonny boy   manifestly these copies so far are not independent  but now herds copy begins to vary much from the english  in both ballads a boy or berne speaks up  in the english he recommends to the scots an attack on newcastle in the scots he announces the approach of an english host  douglas promises to reward the boy if his tale be true to hang him if it be false  the scene is otterburn  the boy stabs douglas in a stanza which is a common ballad formula of frequent occurrence    the boys taen out his little pen knife    that hanget low down by his gare and he gaed earl douglas a deadly wound    alack a deep wound and a sare   douglas then says to sir hugh montgomery       take thou the vanguard of the three and bury me at yon bracken bush    that stands upon yon lilly lea  herd 48   hume of godscroft about 1610 author of the history of the douglases was fond of quoting ballads  he gives a form of the first verse in otterburn which is common to herd and the english copy  he says that according to some douglas was treacherously slain by one of his own men whom he had offended  but this narration is not so probable and the fact is fairly meaningless in herds fragment the boy has no motive for stabbing douglas for if his report is true he will be rewarded  the deed is probably based on the tradition which godscroft thought less probablethe treacherous murder of the earl  in the english ballad douglas marches on newcastle where percy without fighting makes a tryst to meet and combat him at otterburn on his way home from newcastle to scotland  thither douglas goes and is warned by a scottish knight of percys approach  as in herd he is sceptical but is convinced by facts  this warning of douglas by a scout who gallops up is narrated by froissart from witnesses engaged in the battle  after various incidents percy and douglas encounter each other and douglas is slain  after a desperate fight sir hugh montgomery a prisoner of the english   borrowed the percy home again   this is absurd  the scots fought on took percy and won the day walsingham the contemporary english chronicler in latin says that percy slew douglas so do knyghton and the continuator of higden  meanwhile we observe that the english ballad says nothing of douglass chivalrous fortitude and soldierlike desire to have his death concealed  here every scottish version follows froissart  in herds fragment montgomery now attacks percy and bids him yield thee to yon bracken bush where the dead douglass body lies concealed  percy does yieldto sir hugh montgomery  the fragment has but fourteen stanzas  in 1802 scott correcting by another ms published herds copy  in 1806 he gave another version for fortunately two copies have since been obtained from the recitation of old persons residing at the head of ettrick forest 62a  colonel elliot devotes a long digression to the trivial value of recitations so styled 62b and gives his suggestions about the copy being made up from the reliques  when scotts copy of 1806 agrees with the english version colonel elliot surmises that a modern person familiar with the english has written the coincident verses in with differences  percy and douglas for example change speeches each saying what in the english the other said in substance not in the actual words  when scotts version touches on an incident known in history but not given in the english version the encounter between douglas and percy at newcastle scott vii viii colonel elliot suspects the interpolator and well he may for the verses are mawkish and modern not earlier than the eighteenth century imitations or remaniements which occur in many ballads traditional in essence  so colonel elliot says we are not told either in the minstrelsy or in any of scotts works or writings who the reciters were and who the transcribers were 63a  we very seldom are told by scott who the reciters were and who the transcribers but our critics information is here mournfully limitedby his own lack of study  colonel elliot goes on to criticise a very curious feature in scotts version of 1806 and finds certain lines beautiful but without a note of antiquity that he can detect while the sentiment is hardly of the kind met with in old ballads  to understand the position we must remember that in the english percy and douglas fight each other thus 1    the percy and the douglas met    that either of other was fain they swapped together while that they sweat    with swords of fine collayne  cologne steel   douglas bids percy yield but percy slays douglas as in walsinghams and other contemporary chronicles stanzas lilvi  the scottish losses are then enumerated only eighteen scots were left alive and stanza lix runs    this fray began at otterburn    between the night and the day there the douglas lost his life    and the percy was led away   herd ends    this deed was done at otterburn    about the breaking of the day earl douglas was buried at the bracken bush    and percy led captive away   manifestly either the maker of herds version knew the english and altered at pleasure or the englishman knew a scots version and altered at pleasure  the perversion is of ancient standing undeniably  but when scotts original text exhibits the same phenomena of perversion in a part of the ballad missing in herds brief lay colonel elliot supposes that now the exchanges are by a modern ballad forger shall we say sir walter  by sir walter they certainly are not one tiny hint of scots originality is dubious  in the english and in all scots versions men win their hay at lammastide  in scotland the hay harvest is often much later  but if the english ballad be northumbrian little can be made out of that proof of scottish origin if the english version be a southern version for the minstrel is a professional then lammastide for haymaking is borrowed from the scots  the scots version herds insists on douglass burial by the bracken bush to which montgomery bids percy surrender  this is obviously done to hide his body and keep his death secret from both parties as in froissart he bids his friends do  the verse of the english l on the fight between douglas and percy is borrowed by or is borrowed from the scottish stanza ix in herd where sir hugh montgomery fights percy   then percy and montgomery met    and weel a wot they warna fain they swaped swords and they twa swat    and ay the blood ran down between     the persses and the mongomry met   as quoted is already familiar in the complaynte of scotland about 1549 and this line is not in the english ballad  so far it seems as if the english balladist borrowed the scene from a scots version and perverted it into a description of a fight between percy who wins and douglasin place of the scots version the victory over percy of sir hugh montgomery  this transference of incidents in the english and scottish ballads is a phenomenon which we are to meet again in the ballad of jamie telfer of the fair dodhead  one maker or the other has in old times pirated and perverted the ballad of another maker    scotts traditional copy and how he edited it    as early as december 1802january 1803 scott was so anxious to have a complete scottish otterburn that i will omit the ballad entirely in the first volume of 1803 hoping to recover it in time for insertion in the third 67a  the letter is undated but is determined by scotts expressed interest about the tushielaw lines which from what you mention must be worth recovering  in a letter abbotsford mss from hogg to scott marked in copy january 7 1803 hogg encloses the tushielaw lines which were popular in ettrick but were verses of the eighteenth century they were orally repeated but literary in origin  scott who wanted a complete scottish otterburn in winter 1802 did not sit down and make one  he waited till he got a text from hogg in 1805 and published an edited version in 1806  scotts published stanza i is herds stanza i with slight verbal changes taken from the hogg ms text of 1805   hoggs ms and scott in stanza ii give herds lines on the lindsays and gordons adding the grahams and in place of herds         the earl of fife and sir hugh montgomery upon a grey   they end thus    but the jardines wald not wi him ride    and they rue it to this day   this is from hoggs copy it is a natural border variant  no earl of fife is named but a reproach to a border clan is conveyed  for herds iii they take northumberland and burn the north shire and the otter dale hoggs reciters gave    and he has burned the dales o tyne    and part o almonshire and three good towers in roxburgh fells    he left them all on fire   hogg in his letter accompanying his copy says that almonshire may stand for the bamborowshire of the english vi but that he leaves in almonshire as both reciters insist on it  scott printed bambroughshire as in the english version vi  now here is proof that hogg had a copy from recitersa copy which he could not understand  almonshire is alneshire or alnwickshire where is the percys alnwick castle  in froissart the scots burn and waste the region of alneshire all round alnwick but the earl of northumberland holds out in the castle unattacked and sends his sons henry and ralph percy to newcastle to gather forces and take the retreating scots between two fires newcastle and alnwick  but the scots were not such poor strategists as to return by the way they had come  in a skirmish or joust at newcastle says froissart douglas captured percys lance and pennon with his blazon of arms and vowed that he would set it up over his castle of dalkeith  percy replied that he would never carry it out of england  to give percy a chivalrous chance of recovering his pennon and making good his word douglas insists on waiting at otterburn to besiege the castle there and he is taken by surprise as in the ballads when a mounted man brings news of percys approach  no tryst is made by percy and douglas at otterburn in froissart douglas merely tarried there by the courtesy of scotland  in hoggs version we have a reason why douglas should tarry at otterburn in the english ballad we have none very definite  no captured pennon of percys is mentioned no encounter of the heroes at the barriers of newcastle  percy from the castle wall merely threatens douglas vaguely douglas says where will you meet me and percy appoints otterburn as we said  he makes the absurd remark that by way of supplies for 40000 men douglas will find abundance of pheasants and red deer 69a  we see that the english balladist is an unwarlike literary hack  the author of the ettrick version knew better the nature of war as we shall see and his douglas objects to otterburn as a place destitute of supplies nothing is there but wild beasts and birds  if the original poem is the sensible poem the scott version is the original which the english hath perverted  in hogg douglas jousts with percy at newcastle and gives him a fall then come two verses viiiix  the second is especially modern and mawkish    but o how pale his lady lookd    frae off the castle wa when down before the scottish spear    she saw brave percy fa how pale and wan his lady lookd    frae off the castle hieght when she beheld her percy yield    to doughty douglas might   colonel elliot asks can any one believe that these stanzas are really ancient and have come down orally through many generations 70a  certainly not  but colonel elliot does not allow for the fact insisted on by professor child that traditional ballads from the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries were often printed on broad sheets as edited by the cheapest broadsidevendors hacks that the hacks interpolated and messed their originals and that after the broadside was worn out lost or burned oral memory kept it alive in tradition  for examples of this process we have only to look at williams ghost in herds copy of 1776  this is a traditional ballad it is included in scotts clerk saunders but as hogg told him is a quite distinct song  in herds copy it ends thus    oh stay my only true love stay    the constant margret cryd wan grew her cheeks she closed her eyes    stretched her soft limbs and dyd   let this get into tradition and be taken down from recitation and the ballad will be denounced as modern  but it is essentially ancient  these two modern stanzas in hoggs copy are rather too bad for hoggs making and i do not know whether they are his he practically says they are not we shall see or whether they are remembered by reciters from a stallcopy of the period of lady wardlaws hardyknute  after that hoggs copy becomes more natural  douglas says to the discomfited percy x    had we twa been upon the green    and never an eye to see i should hae had ye flesh and fell    but your sword shall gae wi me   that rings true  moreover had either hogg or scott tampered here scott excised either would have made douglas carry offnot percys sword but the historic captured pennon of percy  scott really could not have resisted the temptation had he been interpolating a son devis   but your pennon shall gae wi me   it was easy to write in that  percy had challenged douglas thus    but gae ye up to otterburn    and there wait days three xi   as in the english xiii  in the english percy we saw promises game enough there in hogg douglas demurs xii xiii xiv  there are no supplies at otterburn he says       to feed my men and me  the deer rins wild frae dale to dale    the birds fly wild frae tree to tree and there is neither bread nor kale    to fend my men and me   these seem to me sound true ballad lines like    my hounds may a rin masterless    my hawks may fly frae tree to tree   in childs variant of young beichan  the speakers we see are inverted  percy in the english promises douglass men pheasants absurd provision for the army of 40000 men of the english ballad  in the ettrick text douglas says that there are no supplies merely ferae naturae but he will wait at otterburn to give percy his chance  colonel elliot takes the inversion of parts as a proof of modern pilfering and deliberate change to hide the theft at least he mentions them and the prettier verses with a note of exclamation  73a but there are we repeat similar inversions in the english and in herds old copy and nobody says that scott or hogg or any modern faker made the inversions in herds text  the differences and inversions in the english and in herd are very ancient by 1550 the percy and the montgomery met in the line quoted in the complaynte of scotland  at about the same period 1550 it was the percy and the douglas who met in the english version  manifestly there preexisted by 1550 an old ballad which either a scot then perverted from the english text or an englishman from the scots  thus the inversions in the ettrick and english version need not be due they are not due to a modern faker  in the hogg ms xxiii percy wounds douglas till backwards he did flee  hogg was too good a scot to interpolate the flight of douglas and scott was so good a scot thatwhat do you suppose he didhe excised till backwards he did flee from hoggs text and inserted that he fell to the ground from the english text  in the hogg ms xviii xix in scott xvii xviii douglas at otterburn is roused from sleep by his page with news of percys approach  douglas says that the page lies compare herd where douglas doubts the page    for percy hadna men yestreen to dight my men and me   there is nothing in this to surprise any one who knows the innumerable variants in traditional ballads  but now comes in a very curious variation hogg ms xx scott xix  douglas says hogg ms xx    but i have seen a dreary dream    beyond the isle o skye i saw a dead man won the fight    and i think that man was i   here is something not in herd and as remote from the manner of the english poet with his   the chronicle will not lie   as heine is remote from saymilman  the verse is magical it has haunted my memory since i was ten years old  godscroft who does not approve of the story of douglass murder by one of his men writes that the dying leader said  first do yee keep my death both from our own folke and from the enemy froissart let neither friend nor foe know of my estate then that ye suffer not my standard to be lost or cast downe froissart up with my standard and call douglas and last that ye avenge my death also in froissart  bury me at melrose abbey with my father if i could hope for these things i should die with the greater contentment for long since i heard a prophesie that a dead man should winne a field and i hope in god it shall be i 75a   i saw a dead man won the fight    and i think that man was i   godscroft up to the mention of melrose and the prophecy took his tale direct from froissart or if he took it from george buchanans latin history buchanans source was froissart but froissarts was evidence from scots who were in the battle  but who changed the prophecy to a dream of douglas and who versified godscrofts a dead man shall winne a field and i hope in god it shall be i  did godscroft take that from the ballad current in his time and quoted by him  or did a remanieur of godscroft turn his words into   i saw a dead man win the fight    and i think that man was i   scott did not make these two noble lines out of godscroft he found them in hoggs copy from recitation only altering i saw into i dreamed and the ungrammatic won into win and the fight into a fight  the whole dream stanza occurs in a part of the ballad where hogg confesses to no alteration or interpolation and i doubt if the shepherd of ettrick had read a rare old book like godscroft  if he had not this stanza is purely traditional if he had he showed great genius in his use of godscroft  in hoggs ettrick copy douglas after telling his dream rushes into battle is wounded by percy and backward flees  scott xx following a historical version wyntouns cronykil makes   douglas forget the helmit good    that should have kept his brain   being wounded in hoggs version and backward fleeing douglas sends his page to bring montgomery hogg and from stanza xxiv to xxxiv in hogg all is made up by himself he saysfrom facts given in plain prose by his reciters with here and there a line or two given in verse  scott omitted some verses here amended others slightly by help of herds version left out a broken last stanza xl and put in herds concluding lines stanza lxviii in the english text   this deed was done at the otterburn herd  the fraye began at otterburn english   now what was the broken ettrick stanza that scott omitted in his published otterburne 1806  it referred to sir hugh montgomery who in herd captured percy after a fight in the english version is a prisoner apparently exchanged for percy  in the ettrick ms the omitted verse is   he left not an englishman on the field    that he hadna either killed or taen    ere his hearts blood was cauld   scott ended with herds last stanza in the english version the last but two  now the death at otterburn of sir hugh is recorded in an english ballad styled the hunting of the cheviot  by 154050 it was among the popular songs north of tweed  the complaynte of scotland 1549 mentions among the songis of natural music of the antiquitie volkslieder the hunttis of chevet  our copy of the english version is in the bodleian ms ashmole 48  it ends  expliceth quod rychard sheale a minstrel who recited ballads and tales at tamworth circ 1559  the text was part of his stockintrade  the cheviot ballad in a scots form popular in 1549 is later in many ways than the english battle of otterburne  it begins with a brag of percy a vow that despite douglas he will hunt in the cheviot hills while percy is hunting with a strong force douglas arrives with another  douglas offers to decide the quarrel by single combat with percy who accepts  richard witherington refuses to look on quietly and a general engagement ensues   at last the duglas and the perse met lyk to captayns of myght and of mayne they swapte together tylle they both swat with swordes that wear of fyn myllan   we are back in stanza i of the english otterburne in stanza xxxv substituting hugh

perse never went away   this is a form of herds stanza xiv of the english otterburn lxviii made soon after the battle  we see that the original ballad has protean variants in time all is mixed in tradition  now the curious and interesting point is that hogg when he collected the ballad from two reciters himself noticed that the cheviot ballad had merged in some way into the otterburn ballad and pointed this out to scott  i now publish hoggs letter to scott in which as usual he does not give the yeardate  i think it was 1805   ettrick house sept 10 1805  dear sirthough i have used all diligence in my power to recover the old song about which you seemed anxious i am afraid it will arrive too late to be of any use  i cannot at this time have grame and bewick the only person who hath it being absent at a harvest and as for the scraps of otterburn which you have got they seem to have been some confused jumble made by some person who had learned both the songs you have 79a and in time had been straitened to make one out of them both  but you shall have it as i had it saving that as usual i have sometimes helped the metre without altering one original word  hogg here gives his version from recitation as far as stanza xxiv  here hogg stops and writes   the ballad which i have collected from two different people a crazy old man and a woman deranged in her mind seems hitherto considerably entire but now when it becomes most interesting they have both failed me and i have been obliged to take much of it in plain prose however as none of them seemed to know anything of the history save what they had learned from the song i took it the more kindly  any few verses which follow are to me unintelligible  he told sir hugh that he was dying and ordered him to conceal his body and neither let his own men nor piercys know which he did and the battle went on headed by sir hugh montgomery and at length    here follow stanzas up to xxxviii  hogg then goes on thus   piercy seems to have been fighting devilishly in the dark  indeed my narrators added no more but told me that sir hugh died on the field but that   he left not an englishman on the field    that he hadna either killed or taen    ere his hearts blood was cauld   almonshire stanza iii may probably be a corruption of bamburghshire but as both my narrators called it so i thought proper to preserve it the towers in roxburgh fells stanza iii may not be so improper as we were thinking there may have been some english strength on the very bordersi remain dear sir your most faithful and affectionate servant james hogg   hogg adds a postscript   not being able to get the letter away to the post i have taken the opportunity of again pumping my old friends memory and have recovered some more lines and half lines of otterburn of which i am becoming somewhat enamoured  these i have been obliged to arrange somewhat myself as you will see below but so mixed are they with original lines and sentences that i think if you pleased they might pass without any acknowledgment  sure no man will like an old song the worse of being somewhat harmonious  after stanza xxiv you may read stanzas xxv to xxxiv  then after xxxviii read xxxix   now we know all that can be known about the copy of the ballad which in 1805 scott received from hogg  up to stanza xxiv it is as given by the two old reciters  the crazy man may be the daft man who recited to hogg burnss tam o shanter and inspired him with the ambition to be a poet  the deranged woman like mad madge wildfire was rich in ballad scraps  from stanza xxv to xxxiv hogg confessedly harmonises what he got in plain prose intermixed with verse  stanza xxxix is apparently hoggs  the last broken stanza as hogg said is a reminiscence of the hunting of the cheviot in a scots form long lost  hogg was not a scientific collector  had he been he would have taken down the plain prose and the broken lines and stanzas verbally  but hogg has done his best  we have next to ask how did scott treat the material thus placed before him  he dropped five stanzas sent by hogg mainly from the part made up from plain prose he placed in a stanza and a line or two from herds text he remade a stanza and adopted a line from the english of 1550 and inserted an incident from wyntouns cronykil about 1430  he did these things in the effort to construct what lockhart calls a standard text  1  in stanza i for hoggs douglas went scott put bound him to ride 2  h  with the lindsays     s  with them the lindesays 3  h  almonshire     s  bamboroughshire     h  roxburgh     s  reidswire

said the douglas    my troth ill plight to thee 19  h  i have seen a dreary dream 20  s  i have dreamed a dreary dream 21  h where he met with the stout percy    and a his goodly train 21  s but he

wan but let the name of douglas still    be shouted in the van  this is precisely what douglas does say in froissart but scott deletes the stanza  probably hogg got the fact from his reciters in plain prose with a phrase or two in verse  31  h line 4    on yonder lily lee 27  s    that his merrie men might not see 33  h scott deletes the stanza 35  h    when stout sir hugh wi piercy met 30  s the

slight verbal alteration 39  h line 1 34  s line 1 scott substitutes herds    as soon as he knew it was montgomery  40  h hoggs broken stanza on the death of montgomery derived from a lost form of the huntiss of chevets named in the complaynte of scotland  35  s scott omits giving the formula common to the english of 1550 and to herd  this was the whole of scotts editorial alteration  any one may discover the facts from professor kittredges useful abbreviation of childs collection into a single volume nutt  london 1905  colonel elliot quotes professor kittredges book three or four times but in place of looking at the facts he abounds in the higher criticism  colonel elliot says that scott does not tell us of a single line having been borrowed from percys version 84a  scott has only a single line to tell of the fourth line in his stanza xxii till he fell to the ground  for the rest the old english version and herds have many inter borrowings of stanzas but we do not know whether a scot borrowed from an englishman or vice versa  thus in another and longer traditional versionhoggsmore correspondence must be expected than in herds fourteen stanzas  it is of course open to scepticism to allege that hogg merely made his text invented the two crazy old reciters and the whole story about them and his second pumping of their memories invented almonshire which he could not understand and invented his last broken stanza on the death of montgomery to give the idea that the huntiss of chevets was mingled in the recollections of the reciters with the battle of otterburn  he also gave the sword in place of the pennon of percy as the trophy of douglas and the same with intent to deceive just as he pretended in auld maitland not to know what springwalls were and wrote springs  wallstanes  if this probable theory be correct then scott was the dupe of truthful james at all events though for three years scott was moving heaven and earth and ettrick forest to find a copy of a scottish ballad of otterburn he did not sit down and make one as in colonel elliots system he easily could and probably would have done  before studying his next ill deed we must repeat that the otterburn ballads prove that in early times one nation certainly pirated a ballad of a rival nation and very ingeniously altered it and inverted the parts of the heroes  we have next to examine a case in a later generation in which a maker who was interested in one clan pirated perverted and introverted the roles of the heroes in a ballad by a maker interested in another clan either an elliotophile perverted a ballad by a scottophile or a scottophile perverted a ballad by an elliotophile  this might be done at the time when the ballad was made say 162060 but colonel elliot believes that the perversion was inflicted on an elliotophile ballad by a scottophile impostor about 18001802  the name of this desperate and unscrupulous character was walter scott sheriff of ettrick forest commonly called selkirkshire  in this instance i have no manuscript evidence  the name of jamie of the fair dodhead the ballad appears in a list of twentytwo ballads in sir walters hand written in a commonplace book about 18001801 eleven are marked x  jamie is one of that eleven  kinmont willie is among the eleven not marked x  we may conjecture that he had obtained the first eleven and was hunting for the second elevensome of which he never got or never published    the mystery of the ballad of jamie telfer    ia riding song  the ballad of jamie telfer of the fair dodhead has many charms for lovers of the border  the swift and simple stanzas carry us through a great tract of country which remains not unlike what it was in the days when scotts armstrongs and elliots rode the hills in jack and knapscap with sword and lance  the song leads us first with a foraging party of english riders from bewcastle an english hold east of the border stream of the liddel then through the armstrong tribe on the north bank then through more armstrongs north across tarras water tarras for the good bull trout then north up ewes water that springs from the feet of the changeless green hills and the pastorum loca vasta where now only the shepherd or the angler wakens the cry of the curlews but where then the armstrongs were in force we ride on as it were and look down into the dale of the stripling teviot electro clarior then held by the scotts we descend and ford borthwicks roaring strand as leyden sings though the burn is usually a purling brook even where it joins teviot three miles above hawick  next we pass across the green waves of moorlands that rise to the heights over ettrick held by the scotts whence the foragers of the song gallop down to the fair dodhead now a heap of grasscovered stones but in their day a peel tower occupied according to the ballad by one james telfer  the english rob the peel tower they drive away ten cows and urge them southwards over borthwick water then across teviot at coultart cleugh say seven miles above hawick then up the frostily burn and so down ewes water as before but the scottish pursuers meet them before they cross the liddel again into english bounds  the english are defeated their captain is shot through the head which in no way affects his power of making speeches he is taken twenty or thirty of his men are killed or wounded his own cattle are seized and his victim telfer returns rejoicing to dodhead in distant ettrick  cest magnifique mais ce nest pas la guerre  these events never occurred as we shall see later yet the poet has the old reiving spirit the full sense of the fierce manly times and possesses a traditional knowledge of the historical personages of the day and knows the countrymore or less  the poem has raised as many difficulties as nestors long story about raided cattle in the eleventh book of the iliad  historical greece knew but dimly the places which were familiar to nestor the towns that time had ruined the hill where athene turned the people again  we too have to seek in documents of the end of the sixteenth century or in an old map of 1654 drawn about 1600 to find dodhead catslack or catloch or catlock hill and preakinhaugh places essential to our inquiry  i see the student who has ventured so far into my tract wax wan  he does notshe does notwish to hear about dusty documents and ancient maps  for him or for her the ballad is enough and a very good ballad it is  i would shake the faith of no man in the accuracy of the ballad tale if it were not necessary for me to defend the character of sir walter scott which on occasion of this and other ballads is impugned by colonel the hon fitzwilliam elliot  he hopes though he cannot expect that i will give my reasons for not sharing his belief that sir walter did a certain thing which i could not easily palliate   iithe ballad impossible   my attempts to relieve colonel elliot from his painful convictions about sir walters unsportsmanlike behaviour must begin with proof that the ballad as it stands cannot conceivably be other than a pack o lees  here colonel elliot to a great extent and on an essential point agrees with me  in sketching rapidly the story of the ballad the raid from england into ettrick the return of the raiders the pursuiti omitted the clou the pivot the central point of dramatic interest  it is this  in one version of the balladcall it a for the presentthe unfortunate telfer runs to ask aid from the laird of buccleuch at branksome hall some three and a half or four miles above hawick on the teviot  from the dodhead it was a stiff run of eight miles through newfallen snow  the farmer of dodhead in the centre of the scott country naturally went for help to the nearest of his neighbours the greatest chief in the midborder  in version a which i shall call the elliot version auld buccleuch who was a man of about thirty in fact was deaf to telfers prayer   gae seek your succour frae martin elliot    for succour yes get nane frae me gae seek your succour where ye paid blackmail    for man ye neer paid money to me   this is impossibly absurd  as colonel elliot writes i pointed out in my book the trustworthiness of border ballads that the allegation that buccleuch had refused to strike a blow at a party of english raiders who had insolently ridden some twentyfive miles into scottish ground and into the very middle of his own territory was too absurd to be believed     91a  certainly and the story is the more ridiculous as buccleuch who has taken telfers protectionmoney or blackmail pretends to believe that telferliving in ettrick about nine miles from selkirkpays protectionmoney to martin elliot residing at preakinhaugh high up the water of liddel  martin was too small a potentate and far too remote to be chosen as protector by a man living near the farm of singlee on ettrick and near the bold buccleuch  all this is nonsense  colonel elliot sees that and suggests that all this is not by the original poet but has been inserted at some later period 91a  but if so what was the original ballad before the insertion  as it stands all hinges on this impossible refusal of buccleuch to help his neighbour and retainer james telfer  if colonel elliot excises buccleuchs refusal of aid as a later interpolation and if he allows telfer to reach branksome and receive the aid which buccleuch would rejoice to give then the elliot version of the ballad cannot take a further step  it becomes a scott ballad buccleuch sends out his scotts to pursue the english raiders and the elliots if they come in at all must only be subordinates  but as the elliot version stands it is buccleuchs refusal to do his duty that compels poor jamie to run to his brotherinlaw auld jock grieve in coultartcleugh four miles higher on teviot than branksome  jock gives him a mount and he rides to martins hab at catlockhill a place unknown to research thereabout  thence they both ride to martin elliot at preakinhaugh high up in liddesdale and the elliots under martin rescue jamies kye  now the original ballad if it did not contain buccleuchs refusal of aid to telfer which refusal is a thing too absurd to be believed must merely have told about the rescue of jamies kye by the scotts wat of harden and the rest  if buccleuch did not refuse help he gave it and there was no ride by telfer to martin elliot  therefore without a passage too absurd to be believed buccleuchs refusal there could be no elliots in the story  the alternative is that telfer in ettrick did pay blackmail to a man so remote as elliot of preakinhaugh though buccleuch was his chief and his neighbour  this is absurd  yet colonel elliot firmly maintains that the version in which the elliots have all the glory and buccleuch all the shame is the original version and is true on essential points  that is only possible if we cut out the verses about buccleuch and make an ettrick man not appeal to him but go direct to a liddesdale man for succour  he must run from dodhead to coultartcleugh get a horse from jock grieve buccleuchs man and tenant and then ride into liddesdale to martin  but an ettrick man in a country of scotts would inevitably go to his chief and neighbour buccleuch  it is inconceivable that he should choose the remote martin elliot as his protector and go to him  thus as a corollary from colonel elliots own disbelief in the buccleuch incident the elliot version of the ballad must be absolutely false and foolish  if colonel elliot leaves in the verses on buccleuchs refusal he leaves in what he calls too absurd to be believed  if he cuts out these verses as an interpolation then buccleuch lent aid to telfer and there was no occasion to approach martin elliot  or by a third course the elliot ballad originally made an ettrick man a neighbour of the great buccleuch never dream of appealing to him for help but run to coultartcleugh four miles above buccleuchs house and thence make his way over to distant liddesdale to martin elliot  yet colonel elliot says that in what i call the elliot version the story defies criticism 93a  now however you take iti give you three choicesthe story is absolutely impossible  this elliot version was unknown to lovers of the ballads till the late professor child of harvard the greatest master of british balladlore that ever lived in his beautiful english and scottish popular ballads printed it from a manuscript belonging to mr macmath which had previously been the property of a friend of scott charles kirkpatrick sharpe  this version is entitled jamie telfer in the fair dodhead not of  jamie was a tenant there was no jamie telfer tenant of dodhead in 15701609 but concerning that i have more to say  jamie was no laird  before professor childs publication of the elliot version we had only that given by scott in the border minstrelsy of 1802  now scotts version is at least as absurdly incredible as the elliot version  in scotts version the unhappy jamie runs not to branksome and buccleuch to meet a refusal but to the stobss haon slitterick above hawick and to auld gibby elliot the laird  elliot bids him go to branksome and the laird of buccleuch   for man ye never paid money to me   naturally telfer did not pay to elliot  he paid to buccleuch if to any one  more till after the union of 1603 and the end of border raids gilbert elliot a cousin and friend of buccleuch was not the owner of stobs  the hon george elliot pointed out this fact in his border elliots and the family of minto  colonel elliot rightly insists on this point  the scott version is therefore as hopelessly false as the elliot version  the elliot version with the buccleuch incident is too absurd to be believed and could not have been written except in banter of buccleuch while men remembered the customs of the sixteenth century  the scott version again could not be composed before the tradition arose that gilbert elliot was laird of stobs before the union of the crowns in 1603  now that tradition was in full force on the border before 1688  we know that see chapter on kinmont willie infra for in 1688 a man born in 1613 captain walter scott of satchells in his metrical history of the honourable families of the names of scott and elliot represents gilbert elliot of stobs as riding with buccleuch in the rescue of kinmont willie in 1596 95a  now satchellss own father rode in that fray he says 95b and he gives a minute genealogy of the elliots of stobs 95c  thus the belief that gilbert elliot was laird of stobs by 1596 was current in the traditions of a man born seventeen years after 1596 the scott version rests on that tradition and is not earlier than the rise of that erroneous belief  neither the scott nor elliot version is other than historically false but the scott version if we cut out the reference to auld gibby elliot offers a conceivable though not an actual course of events the elliot version if we excise the buccleuch incident does not cutting out the buccleuch incident telfer goes all the way from ettrick to liddesdale seeking help in that remote country and never thinks of asking aid from buccleuch his neighbour and chief  this is idiotic  in the scott version if we cut out the refusal of gilbert elliot of stobs telfer goes straight to his brotherinlaw auld jock grieve within four miles of buccleuch at branksome thence to another friend williams wat at catslockhill now branksomebraes and so to buccleuch at branksome  this is absurd enough  telfer would have gone straight to branksome and buccleuch unless he were a poor shy small farmer who wanted sponsors known to buccleuch  jock grieve and williams wat both of them retainers and near neighbours of buccleuch were such sponsors  granting this the scott version runs smoothly telfer goes to his sponsors and with his sponsors to buccleuch and buccleuchs men rescue his kye   iiicolonel elliots charge against sir walter scott   colonel elliot believes generally in the historical character of the ballad as given in the elliot version but is inclined to think that the original poet never wrote the stanza the stanza with buccleuchs refusal at all and that it has been inserted at some later period 97a  in that case colonel elliot is inclined to think that an ettrick farmer robbed by the english never dreamed of going to his neighbour and potent chief but went all the way to martin elliot high up in liddesdale to seek redress  surely few can share the colonels inclination  why should a farmer in ettrick choose to lord a remote elliot when he had the cock of the border the heroic buccleuch within eight miles of his home  holding these opinions colonel elliot with deep regret    i wat the tear blinded his ee    accuses sir walter scott of having taken the elliot versiontill then the only versionand of having altered stanzas viixi in which jamie goes to branksome and is refused succour into his own stanzas viixi in which jamie goes to stobs and is refused succour  this evil thing scott did thinks colonel elliot  scott had no copy he thinks of the ballad except an elliot copy which he deliberately perverted  we must look into the facts of the case  i know no older published copy of the ballad than that of scott in border minstrelsy vol i p 91 et seqq 1802  professor child quotes a letter from the ettrick shepherd to scott of june 30 1802 thus  i am surprised to find that the songs in your collection differ so widely from my mothers jamie telfer differs in many particulars 98a  this is an incomplete quotation  i give the ms version later  scott himself before hogg wrote thus had said in the prefatory note to his jamie telfer  there is another ballad under the same title as the following in which nearly the same incidents are narrated with little difference except that the honour of rescuing the cattle is attributed to the liddesdale elliots headed by a chief there called martin elliot of the preakin tower whose son simm is said to have fallen in the action  it is very possible that both the teviotdale scotts and the elliots were engaged in the affair and that each claimed the honour of the victory  old mrs hoggs version differing in many particulars from scotts must have been the elliot version published by professor child as a jamie telfer in not of the fair dodhead from a ms written about the beginning of the nineteenth century and now in the possession of mr william macmath it had previously belonged to charles kirkpatrick sharpe 98b  there is one great point of difference between the two forms  in sir walters variant verse 26 summons the scotts of teviotdale including wat of harden  in his 28 the scotts ride with the slogan rise for branksome readily  scotts verses 34 36 and the two first lines of 38 are if there be such a thing as internal evidence from his own pen  such lines as   the dinlay snaw was neer mair white nor the lyart locks o hardens hair   are cryingly modern and scottesque  that sir walter knew the other version as in mr macmaths ms of the early nineteenth century is certain he describes that version in his preface  that he effected the whole transposition of scotts for elliots is colonel elliots opinion 99a  if scott did i am not the man to defend his conduct i regret and condemn it and shall try to prove that he found the matter in his copy  i shall first prove beyond possibility of doubt that the ballad is from end to end utterly unhistorical though based on certain real incidents of 159697  i shall next show that the elliot version is probably later than the scott version  finally i shall make it certain or so it seems to me that scott worked on an old copy which was not the copy that belonged to kirkpatrick sharpe but contained points of difference not those inserted by sir walter scott about dinlay snaw and so forth   ivwho was the farmer in the dodhead in 15801609   colonel elliot has made no attempt to prove that one telfer was tenant of the dodhead in 15801603 which must we shall see include the years in which the alleged incidents occur  on this questionwas there a telfer in the dodhead in 15801603i consulted my friend mr t craig brown author of an excellent history of selkirkshire  in that work vol i p 356 the author writes  dodhead or scotsbank dodhead was one of the four stedes of redefurd in 1455  in 1609 robert scot of satchells ancestor of the poetcaptain obtained a crown charter of the lands of dodbank  for the statement that dodhead was one of the three stedes in 1455 mr craig brown quotes the retoured extent of 1628 an unimpeachable authority  for the crown charter of 1609 we have only to look up dodbank in the register of the great seal of 1609  the charter is of november 24 1609 and gratifies robert scott of satscheillis father of the captain walter scott who composed the metrical history of the scotts in 1688 with the lands which have been occupied by him and his forefathers from a time past human memory  thus writes mr craig brown to me scott of satchells was undoubtedly scott of dodhead also in 1609  in the retoured extent of 1628 dodhead or dodbank appears as hardens property  thus in 1628 the place was dodhead or dodbank a farm that had been tenanted by scotts from beyond human memory  but mr craig brown proves from record that one simpson farmed it in 1510  so where does jamie telfer come in  the farmers were scotts it was to their chief buccleuch that they went when they needed aid 101a  thus vanishes the hero of the ballad jamie telfer in the fair dodhead and thus the ballad is pure fiction from end to end   vmore impossibilities in the ballad   this is only one of the impossibilities in the ballad  that the captain of bewcastle an english hold stated in a letter of the period to be distant three miles from the frontier the liddel water should seek to drive a prey from the ettrick far through the bounds of his neighbours and foes grahams armstrongs scotts and elliots is a ridiculously absurd circumstance  colonel elliot attempts to meet this difficulty by his theory of the route taken by the captain which he illustrates by a map 102a  the ballad gives no details except that the captain found his first guide high up in hardhaughswire which colonel elliot cannot identify  the second guide was laigh down in borthwick water  if this means on the lower course of the borthwick the captain was perilously near branksome hall and harden and his ride was foolhardy  but laigh down i think means merely on lower ground than hardhaughswire  the captain as soon as he crossed the ritterford after leaving bewcastle was in hostile and very watchful armstrong country  this initial difficulty colonel elliot meets by marking on his map as armstrong country the north bank of the liddel down to kershope burn and the captain crosses liddel below that burn at ritterford  thence he goes north by west across tarras water up ewes water up mickledale burn by merrylaw and ramscleugh and so on to howpasley which is not on the lower but the upper borthwick  looking at colonel elliots chart of the captains route all seems easy enough for the captain  he does not try to ride into teviotdale for which he is making up the liddel water and thence by the hermitage tributary on his left  colonel elliot studs that region with names of armstrong and elliot strongholds  he makes the captain crossing liddel by the ritterford bear to his left through a space empty of hostile habitations in his map  this seems prudent but the region thus left blank was full of the fiercest and most warlike of the armstrong name  that road was closed to the captain  colonel elliot has failed to observe this fact which i go on to prove from a memoir addressed in 1583 to burleigh by thomas musgrave the active son of the aged captain of bewcastle sir simon musgrave thomas describes the topography of the middle marches  he says that the armstrongs hold both banks of liddel as far south as kershope foot the junction of the kershope with the liddel and hold the north side of the liddel as far as its junction with the esk 103a thus on crossing liddel by the ritterford the captain had at once to pass through the hostile armstrongs  thereby also were grahams with whom the musgraves of bewcastle were in deadly feud  farther down esk west of esk dwelt kinmont willie an armstrong at a place called morton  if he did pass so far through armstrongs the captain met them again farther north on tarras side where runyen armstrong lived at thornythaite  near him was armstrong of hollhouse musgraves great enemy  north of tarras the captain rode through ewesdale there he had to deal with three hundred armstrong men of the spear 104a  when he reached ramscleuch which he never could have done the colonels map makes the captain ride past ramscleuch then farmed by the grieves retainers of buccleuch who would warn branksome  when the captain reached howpasley on borthwick water he would be observed by the men of scott of howpasley the grieves who could send a rider some six miles to warn branksome  we get the same information as to the perils of the captains path from the places marked on blaeus map of 160054  there are hollhouse and thornythaite armstrong towers and the active john armstrong of langholm can come at a summons  it seems to be a great error to suppose that the route chosen for the captain by colonel elliot could lead him into anything better than a deathtrap  i must insist that it would have been madness for a captain of bewcastle to ride far through armstrong country deep into buccleuchs country and return on another line through scott and near elliot and through armstrong countryand all for no purpose but to steal ten cows in remote selkirkshire  here i may save the reader trouble by omitting a great mass of detail as to the deplorable condition of bewcastle itself in 158096  sir simon the captain declares himself old and weary  the hold is utterly decayed the riders are only thirtyseven men fairly equipped  soldiers are asked for sometimes fifty are sent from the garrison of berwick then they are withdrawn  bewcastle is forayed almost daily march bills minutely describe the cattle horses and personal property taken from the captain and the people by the armstrongs and elliots  once in 1582 thomas musgrave slew arthur graham a near neighbour and took one hundred and sixty kye but this only caused such a feud that the musgraves could not stir safely from home  from 1586 onwards thomas musgrave officially or unofficially was acting captain of bewcastle  he had no strength to justify him in raiding to remote ettrick through enemies who penned him in at bewcastle  i look on musgrave as the captain whose existence is known to the balladmaker and i find the origin of the tale of his defeat and capture in the ballad in a distorted memory of his actual capture  on 3rd july 1596 thomas having got scropes permission without which he dared not cross the border on affairs of war attempted a retaliatory raid on armstrongs within seven miles of the border the armstrongs of hollace or hollhouse  he found only empty houses he sought a prey in vain he let his men straggle and returning homeward with some fifteen companions he was ambushed by the armstrongs near bewcastle was refused shelter by a graham was taken prisoner and was sent to buccleuch at branksome  on 15th july he came home under a bond of 200 pounds for ransom 106a  as every one did in his circumstances the captain made out his bill for damages  it was indented on 28th april 1597  we learn that john armstrong of langholm will of kinmont not liddesdale men and others who took him are in the captains debt for 24 horses and mares himself prisoner and ransomed to 200 pounds and 16 other prisoners and slaughter  the charges are admitted by the accused the captain is to get 400 pounds 106b  in my opinion this capture of the captain of bewcastle and others poetically handled is with other incidents the basis of the ballad colonel elliot says that the incident is no proof that a captain of bewcastle was not also taken or killed at some other place or at some other time  but what captain and when  sir simon in 1586 had been captain he says for thirty years  thenceforth till near the union of the crowns thomas was captain or acting captain  so considerable an event as the taking of a captain of bewcastle who in the ballad was shot through the head and elsewhere could not escape record in dispatches and the periodical march bills or statements of wrongs to be redressed  colonel elliots reply takes the shape of the argument that the ballad may speak of some other captain at some other time and that in one way or another the sufferings and losses of that captain may have escaped mention in the english dispatches from the border  these dispatches are full of minute details down to the theft of a single mare  i am content to let historians familiar with the dispatches decide as to whether the captains mad ride into ettrick with his dangerous wounds loss of property and loss of seventeen men killed and wounded as in the ballad could escape mention  the capture of thomas musgrave i think and two other incidents confused in course of tradition and handled by the poet with poetic freedomare the materials of jamie telfer  one of the other incidents is of april 1597 107a  here buccleuch in person on the sabbath burned twenty houses in tynedale and slew fourteen men who had been in scotland and brought away their booty  here we have buccleuch on the hot trod pursuing english reivers recovering the spoils probably and slaying as many of the raiders as the captain lost in the ballad  again not a son of elliot of preakinhaugh as i had erroneously said but a nephew named martin was slain in a tynedale raid into liddesdale 108a  soldiers aided the english raiders  a confused memory of this death of elliots nephew in 1597 may be the source of the story of the death of his son simmy in the ballad  our traditional ballads all arise out of some germs of history all handle the facts romantically and all appear to have been composed in their extant shapes at a considerable time after the events  i may cite mary hamilton the laird of logie is another case in point there are many others  colonel elliot does not agree with me  so be it  colonel elliot writes thatin place of my saying that jamie telfer is a mere mythical perversion of carefully recorded factsit would surely be more correct to say that it is a fairly true though jumbled account of actual incidents separated from each other by only short periods of time     108b  if he means or thinks that i mean that the actual facts were the capture of musgrave near bewcastle in 1596 by the armstrongs with buccleuchs hottrod and martin elliots slaying in 1597 i entirely agree with him that the facts are jumbled  but as to the opinion that the ballad is fairly true about the raid to ettrick the captain could not ride a mile beyond the border without the wardens permission about the nonexistent jamie telfer about the shooting taking and plundering of the captain about his loss of seventeen men wounded and slain he lost about as many prisonersi have given reasons for my disbelief   viis the scott version with elliots and scotts transposed the later version   we now come to the important question is the scott version of the ballad apart from sir walters decorative stanzas necessarily later than the elliot version in sharpes copy  the chief argument for the lateness of the scott version the presence of a gilbert elliot of stobs at a date when this gentleman had not yet acquired stobs i have already treated  if the ballad is no earlier than the date when elliot was believed as by satchells to have obtained stobs before 1596 the argument falls to the ground  starting from that point and granting that a minstrel fond of the scotts wants to banter the elliots he may make telfer ask aid at stobs  after that which version is better in its topography  bidden by stobs to seek buccleuch telfer runs to teviot to coultartcleugh some four miles above branksome  branksome was nearer but telfer was shy let us say and did not know buccleuch while at coultartcleugh jock grieve was his brotherinlaw  jock gives him a mount and takes him to catslockhill  now no catslockhill is known anywhere to me or to colonel elliot mr henderson in a note to the ballad 110a speaks of catslack in branxholm and cites the register of the privy seal for 4th june 1554 and the register of the privy council for 14th october 1592  the records are full of that catslack but it is not in branksome  blaeus map 160054 gives it with its appurtenances on the north side of st marys loch  there is a catslack on the north side of yarrow near ladhope on the southern side  neither catslack is the catslockhill of the scott ballad  but on evidence and it is good evidence says colonel elliot 110b i prove that in 1802 a place called catlochill existed between coultartcleugh and branksome  the place mrs grieve branksome park informs me is now called branksome braes  on his copy of the minstrelsy of 1802 mr grieve then tenant of branksome park made a marginal note  catlochill was still known to him it was in a commanding site and had been strengthened by the art of man  his note i have seen and read  thus on good evidence there was a catlochill or catlockhill between coultartcleugh and branksome  the scott version is right in its topography  this fact was unknown to colonel elliot  not knowing a catslackhill or catslockhill in teviot he made scotts telfer go to an apocryphal catlockhill in liddesdale  professor veitch had said that the catslockhill of the ballad is to be sought in some locality between coultartcleugh and branxholm  colonel elliot calls this a really preposterously cool suggestion 111a  why really preposterously cool  being sought the place is found where it had always been jamie telfer found it and in it his friend williams wat who took him to the laird of buccleuch at branksome  in the elliot version when refused aid by buccleuch jamie ran to coultartcleughas in scottson his way to martin elliot at preakinhaugh on the liddel  jamie next takes the fray to the catlockhill and is there remounted by martins hab an elliot not by williams wat and they take the fray to martin elliot at preakinhaugh in liddesdale  this is very well but where is this catlockhill in liddesdale  is it even a real place  colonel elliot has found no such place nor can i find it in the registrum magni sigilli nor in blaeus map of 160054  colonel elliots argument has been that the elliot version the version of the sharpe ms is the earlier for among other reasons its topography is correct 112a  it makes telfer run from dodhead to branksome for aid because that was the comparatively near residence of the powerful buccleuch  told by buccleuch to seek aid from martin elliot in liddesdale telfer does so  he runs up teviot four miles to his brotherinlaw jock grieve who mounts him  he then rides off at a right angle from teviot to catlockhill says the elliot ballad where he is rehorsed by martins hab  the pair then take the fray to martin elliot at preakinhaugh on liddel water and martin summons and leads the pursuers of the captain  this to colonel elliots mind is all plain sailing all is feasible and natural  and so it is feasible and natural if colonel elliot can find a catlockhill anywhere between coultartcleugh and preakinhaugh on that line in mr veitchs words catlockhill is to be sought but just as mr veitch could find no catslockhill between coultartcleugh and branksome so colonel elliot can find no catlockhill between coultartcleugh and preakinhaugh  he tells us 112b indeed of catlockhill on hermitage water  but there is no such place known colonel elliots method is to take a place which he says is given as catlie hill between dinlay burn and hermitage water on blaeus map of 1654  we may murmur that catlie hill is one thing and catlock another but colonel elliot points out that lock means the meeting of waters and that catlie hill is near the meeting of dinlay burn and the hermitage water  but then why does blaeu call it not catlockhill nor catlie hill nor catlie even but gatlie for so it is distinctly printed on my copy of the map  really we cannot take a place called gatlie hill and pronounce that we have found catlockhill  would colonel elliot have permitted mr veitchif mr veitch had found gatlie hill near branksome in blaeuto aver that he had found catslockhill near branksome  thus till colonel elliot produces on good evidence a catlockhill between coultartcleugh and preakinhaugh the topography of the elliot ballad of the sharpe copy of the ballad is nowhere for neither catliehill nor gatliehill is catlockhill  that does not look as if the elliot were older than the scott version  there was a sim armstrong of the cathill slain by a ridley of hartswell in 1597 113a  we now take the scott version where telfer has arrived at branksome scotts stanza xxv is sharpes xxiv  in scott buccleuch in sharpe martin elliot bids his men warn the waterside sharpe warn the water braid and wide scott  scotts stanza xxvi is probably his own or may be for he bids them warn wat o harden borthwick water and the teviot scotts and gilmanscleuchwhich is remote  then in xxvii buccleuch says    ride by the gate of priesthaughswire    and warn the currors o the lee as ye come down the hermitage slack    warn doughty wiliie o gorrinberry   all this is plain sailing by the pass of priesthaughswire the scotts will ride from teviot into hermitage water and near the slack they will pass gorrinberry will call will and gallop down hermitage water to the liddel where they will nick the returning captain at the ritterford  the sharpe version makes martin order the warning of the waterside xxiv and then martin says xxv    when ye come in at the hermitage slack warn doughty will o gorranherry   colonel elliot 114a supposes martin if i follow his meaning to send simmy with his command back over all the course that telfer and martins hab have already ridden  back past shaws near braidley a house of martins past catlockhill to gorranberry to warn the waterside  but surely telfer who passed gorranberry gates and with hab passed the other places had taken the fray and warned the water quite sufficiently already  if this be granted the sharpe version is taking from the scott version the stanza so natural there about the hermitage slack and gorranberry  but colonel elliot infers from stanzas xxvi xxx xxxi that simmy has warned the water as far as gorranberry again has come in touch with the captain between the frostily and the ritterford and that this is consistent only with his having moved up the hermitage water  meanwhile martin he thinks rode with his men down liddel water  but here we get into a maze of topographical conjecture including the hypothesis that perhaps the liddel came down in flood and caused the english to make for kershope ford instead of ritterford and here they were met by martins men on the hermitage line of advance  i cannot find this elegant combined movement in the ballad all this seems to me hypothesis upon hypothesis even granting that martin sent simmy back up hermitage that he might thence cut sooner across the enemys path colonel elliot himself writes  it is certain that after the news of the raid reached catlockhill and gorranberry telfer passed it it must have spread rapidly through hermitage water and it is most unlikely for the men of this district to have delayed taking action until they received instructions from their chief  that is exactly what i say but martin says when ye come in at the hermitage slack warn doughty will o gorranberry  why go to warn him when as colonel elliot says the news is running through hermitage water and the men are most probably acting on itas they certainly would do  martins orders in sharpe xxv are taken i think from buccleuchs in scotts xxvii  the point is that martin had no need to warn men so far away as gorranberrythey were roused already  yet he orders them to be warned and about a combined movement of martin and simmy on different lines the ballad says not a word  all this is inference merely inference not from historical facts but from what may be guessed to have been in the mind of the poet  thus the elliot or sharpe version has topography that will not hold water while the scott topography does hold water and the elliot song seems to borrow the lines on the hermitage slack and gorranberry from a form of the scott version  this being the case the original version on which scott worked is earlier than the elliot version  in the scott version the rescuers must come down the hermitage slack  in the elliot they have no reason for riding back to that place   viiscott had a copy of the ballad which was not the sharpe copy   did scott know no other version than that of the sharpe ms  in scotts version stanza xlix the last is absent from the elliot version which concludes triumphantly thus    now on they came to the fair dodhead    they were a welcome sight to see and instead of his ain ten milkkye    jamie telfers gotten thirty and three   scott too gives this but ends with a verse not in sharpe    and he has paid the rescue shot    baith wi goud and white money and at the burial o willie scott    i wat was mony a weeping ee   did scott add this  proof is impossible but the verse is so prosaic and so injurious to the triumphant preceding verse that i think scott found it in his copy  in which case he had another copy than sharpes  scott stanza xviii reads catslockhill where the sharpe ms reads catlockhill  in scotts time it was a mound but the name was then known to mr grieve the tenant of branksome park  today i cannot find the mound is it likely that scott before making the change sought diligently for the mound and its name  if so he found catlochill for so mr grieve writes it not catslockhill  meanwhile colonel elliot we know has no catlockhill where he wants it he has only gatliehill unless his blaeu varies from my copy and gatliehill is not catlockhill  scott gives xlviii the speech of the captain after he is shot through the head and in another dangerous part of his frame    hae back thy kye the captain said    dear kye i trow to some they be for gin i suld live a hundred years    there will neer fair lady smile on me   this is not in sharpes ms and i attribute this redundant stanza to scotts copy  the captain remember has a shot through his head and another which must have caused excruciating torture  in these circumstances would a poet like scott put in his mouth a speech which merely reiterates the previous verse  no  but the verse was in scotts copy  colonel elliot has himself noted a more important point than these  he quotes scotts stanza xii which is absent from the sharpe ms    my hounds may a rin masterless    my hawks may fly frae tree to tree my lord may grip my vassal lands    for there again maun i never be   they are doubtless beautiful lines but their very beauty jars like a false note  one feels they were written by another hand by an artist of a higher stamp than a border balladmaker  and not only is it their beauty that jars but so also does their inapplicability to jamie telfer and to the circumstances in which he found himselfso much so indeed that it may well occur to one that the stanza belongs to some other ballad and has accidentally been pitchforked into this one  it would not have been out of place in the ballad of the battle of otterbourne and indeed it bears some resemblance to a stanza in that ballad  here the colonel says that the lines one feels were written by another hand by an artist of a higher stamp than a border balladmaker  but it may also occur to one that the stanza belongs to some other ballad and has accidentally my italics been pitchforked into this  a very sound inference  now if scott had only the sharpe version he was the last man to pitchfork into it accidentally a stanza from some other ballad that stanza being as colonel elliot says inapplicable to telfer and his circumstances  poor jamie a small tenantfarmer with ten cows and as far as we learn not one horse had no hawks and hounds no vassal lands and no reason to say that at the dodhead he maun never be again  he could return from his long run  scott certainly did not compose these lines and he could not have pitchforked them into jamie telfer either by accident or design  professor child remarked on all this  stanza xii is not only found elsewhere compare young beichan e vi but could not be more inappropriately brought in than here scott however is not responsible for that 120a   the hawk that flies from tree to tree   is a formula it comes in the kinloch ms copy of the ballad of jamie douglas date about 1690  i know no proof that scott was acquainted with variant e of young beichan 120a  if he had been he could not have introduced into jamie telfer lines so utterly out of keeping with telfers circumstances as colonel elliot himself says that stanza xii is  it may be argued if scott did find stanza xii in his copy it was in his power to cut it out he treated his copies as he pleased  this is true but my position is that of the two scott is more likely to have let the stanza abide where he found it as he did with his ms of tamlane retaining its absurdities in his copy than to pitchfork it in from an obscure variant of young beichan which we cannot prove that he had ever heard or read  but as we can never tell that scott did not know any rhyme we ask why did he pitchfork in the stanza where it was quite out of place  child absolves him from this absurdity  thus scott had before him another than the sharpe copy had a copy containing stanza xii  that copy presented the perversionthe transposition of scotts and elliotsand into that copy scott wrote the stanzas which bear his modern romantic mark  colonel elliot we saw is uncertain whether to attribute stanza xii to another hand an artist of higher stamp than a border balladmaker or to regard it as belonging to some other ballad and as having been accidentally pitchforked into this one  the stanza is in fact an old floating ballad stanza attracted into the cantefable of susie pye and the ballad of young beichan e and partly into jamie douglas  thus scott did not make the stanza and we cannot suppose that if he knew the stanza in any form he either accidentally pitchforked or wilfully inserted into jamie telfer anything so absurdly inappropriate  the inference is that scott worked on another copy not the sharpe copy  if scott had not a copy other than sharpes why should he alter sharpes vii   the moon was up and the sun was down  into  the sun wasna up but the moon was down   what did he gain by that  why did he make jamie of not in the dodhead if he found in in his copy  in means tenant in of means laird of as nobody knew better than scott  jamie is evidently no laird but of was in scotts copy  if the question were about two greek texts the learned would admit that these points in a scott are not derived from b sharpe scotts additions have an obvious motive they add picturesqueness to his clan  but the differences which i have noticed do nothing of that kind  when they affect the poetry they spoil the poetry when they do not affect the poetry they are quite motiveless whence i conclude that scott followed his copy in these cases and that his copy was not the sharpe ms  if i have satisfied the reader on that point i need not touch on colonel elliots long and intricate argument to prove or suggest that scott had before him no copy of the ballad except one supposed by the colonel to have been taken by james hogg from his mothers recitation while that copy again is supposed to be the sharpe msall sheer conjecture 122a  not that i fear to encounter colonel elliot on this ground but argufying on it is dull and apt to be inconclusive  in the letter of hogg to scott june 30 1803 as given by mr douglas in familiar letters hogg says i am surprised to find that the songs in your collection differ so widely from my mothers    jamie telfer differs in many particulars 123a  the marks of omission were all filled up in hoggs ms letter thus  is mr herds ms genuine  i suspect it  then it runs on jamie telfer differs in many particulars  i owe this information to the kindness of mr macmath  what does hogg mean  does is mr herds ms genuine mean all herds ms copies used by scott  or does it refer to jamie telfer in especial  mr macmath who possesses c k sharpes ms copy of the elliot version believes that it is herds hand as affected by age  mr macmath and i independently reached the conclusion that by mr herds ms hogg meant all herds mss which scott quoted in the minstrelsy of 1803  their readings varied from mrs hoggs therefore hogg misdoubted them  he adds that jamie telfer differs from his mothers version without meaning that for jamie scott used a herd ms   conclusion   i have now proved i hope that the ballad of jamie telfer is entirely mythical except for a few suggestions derived from historical events of 159697  i have shown and colonel elliot agrees that refusal of aid by buccleuch or by elliot of stobs is impossible and that the ballad if it existed without this incident must have been a scott and could not be an elliot ballad  no farmer in ettrick would pay protectionmoney to an elliot on liddel while he had a scott at branksome  i have also disproved the existence of a jamie telfer as farmer at dodhead or dodbank in the late sixteenth century  as to the character of sir walter scott i have proved i hope that he worked on a copy of the ballad which was not the elliot version or the sharpe copy so that this copy may have represented the scotts as taking the leading part while for the reasons given it is apparently earlier than the elliot versioncannot at least be proved to be laterand is topographically the more correct of the two  i have given antique examples of the same sort of perversions in otterburn if i am right colonel elliots charge against scott lacks its base that scott knew none but the sharpe copy whence it is inferred that he not only decorated the song as is undeniable but perverted it in a way far from sportsmanlike  i may have shaken colonel elliots belief in the historicity of the ballad  his suspicions of scott i cannot hope to remove and they are very natural suspicions due to scotts method of editing ballads and habit of giving them a cocked hat and a sword as he did to stories which he heard and repeated much improved  absolute proof that scott did or did not pervert the ballad and turn a false elliot into a false scott version cannot be obtained unless new documents bearing on the matter are discovered  but i repeat as may be read in the chapter on the ballad of otterburne such inversions and perversions of ballads occurred freely in the sixteenth century and in the seventeenth the process may have been applied to jamie telfer 125a    kinmont willie    if there be in the border minstrelsy a ballad which is still popular or at least is still not forgotten it is kinmont willie  this hero was an armstrong and one of the most active of that unbridled clan he was taken prisoner contrary to border law on a day of wardens truce by salkeld of corby on the eden deputy of lord scrope the english warden and despite the written remonstrances of buccleuch he was shut up in carlisle castle  diplomacy failing buccleuch resorted to force and by a sudden and daring march he surprised carlisle castle rescued willie and returned to branksome  the date of the rescue is 13th april 1596  the dispatches of the period are full of this event and of the subsequent negotiations with which we are not concerned  the ballad is worthy of the cool yet romantic gallantry of the achievement  kinmont willie was a ruffian but he had been unlawfully seized  this was one of many studied insults passed by elizabeths officials on scotland at that time when the english government leagued with the furious pulpiteers of the kirk and with francis stewart the wild earl of bothwell was persecuting and personally affronting james vi  in buccleuch the warden of the march england insulted the man who was least likely to pocket a wrong  without causing the loss of an english life buccleuch repaid the affront recovered the prisoner broke the strong castle of carlisle made scrope ridiculous and elizabeth frantic  in addition to kinmont willie there survive two other ballads on rescues of prisoners in similar circumstances  one is jock o the side of which there is an english version in the percy mss john a side  scotts version in the border minstrelsy is from caws museum published at hawick in 1784  scott leaves out caws last stanza about a punchbowl  there are other variations  four armstrongs break into newcastle tower  jock heavily ironed is carried downstairs on the back of one of them they ride a river in spait where the english dare not follow  archie o cafield another rescue scott printed in 1802 from a ms of mr riddell of glenriddell a great collector the friend of burns  he omitted six stanzas and made many editorial improvements besides scotticising the spelling  in the edition published after his death 1833 he has been enabled to add several stanzas from recitation leyden appears to have collected the copy whence the additional stanzas came the ms at abbotsford is in his hand  in this ballad the halls noted freebooters rescue archie o cafield from prison in dumfries  as in jock o the side and kinmont willie they speak to their friend asking how he sleeps they carry him downstairs irons and all and as in the two other ballads they are pursued cross a flooded river banter the english and then in a version in the percy mss communicated to percy by miss fisher 1780 the english lieutenant says    i think some witch has bore thee dicky    or some devil in hell been thy daddy i would not swam that wan water doublehorsed    for a the gold in christenty   manifestly here was a form of lord scropes reply to buccleuch in the last stanza of kinmont willie    he is either himself a devil frae hell    or else his mother a witch may be i wadna hae ridden that wan water    for a the gowd in christentie   scott writes in a preface to archie o cafield and jock o the side that there are with kinmont willie three ballads of rescues the incidents in which nearly resemble each other though the poetical description is so different that the editor did not feel himself at liberty to reject any one of them as borrowed from the others  as however there are several verses which in recitation are common to all these three songs the editor to prevent unnecessary and disagreeable repetition has used the freedom of appropriating them to that in which they have the best poetical effect 129a  consequently the verse quoted from the percy ms of archie o cafield may be improved and placed in the lips of lord scrope in kinmont willie  but there is no evidence that scott ever saw or even heard of this percy ms and probably he got the verse from recitation  now the affair of the rescue of kinmont willie was much more important and resonant than the two other rescues and was certain to give rise to a ballad which would contain much the same formulae as the other two  the balladmaker like homer always uses a formula if he can find one  but kinmont willie is so much superior to the two others so epic in its speed and concentration of incidents that the question rises had scott even fragments of an original ballad of the kinmont much mangled by reciters as he admits or did he compose the whole no ms copies exist at abbotsford  there is only one hint  in a list of twentytwo ballads pasted into a commonplace book eleven are marked x as if he had obtained them and eleven others are unmarked as if they were still to seek  unmarked is kinmount willie  did he find it or did he make it all  in 1888 in a note to kinmont willie i wrote  there is a prose account very like the ballad in scott of satchells history of the name of scott 1688  satchells longwinded story is partly in unrhymed and unmetrical lines partly in rhymes of various metres  the man born in 1613 was old had passed his life as a soldier certainly could not write possibly could not read  colonel elliot believes that sir walter wrote the whole from beginning to end and that it is in fact a clever and extremely beautiful paraphrase of satchells rhymes 130a  this thorough scepticism is not a novelty as colonel elliot quotes me i had written years ago in kinmont willie scott has been suspected of making the whole ballad  i did not as the colonel says mention the names of the sceptics or the grounds of their suspicions  the sceptics or one of them was myself  i had suspected on much the same grounds as colonel elliots own and i shall give my reasons for adopting a more conservative opinion  one reason is merely subjective as a man by long familiarity with ancient works of art greek gems for example acquires a sense of their authenticity or the reverse so he does in the case of balladsor thinks he doesbut of course this result of experience is no ground of argument  experts are often gulled  the ballad varies in many points from satchells which colonel elliot explains thus  i think that the cause for the narrative at times diverging from that recorded by the rhymes of satchells is due partly to artistic considerations partly to the author having wished to bring it more or less into conformity with history 131a  colonel elliot quotes scotts preface to the ballad  in many things satchells agrees with the ballads current in his time 164388 from which in all probability he derived most of his information as to past events and from which he occasionally pirates whole verses as we noticed in the annotations upon the raid of the reidswire  in the present instance he mentions the prisoners large spurs alluding to fetters and some other little incidents noticed in the ballad which therefore was probably well known in his day  as satchells was born in 1613 while the rescue of kinmont willie by buccleuch out of carlisle castle was in 1596 and as satchells father was in that adventure or so satchells says he probably knew much about the affair from fresh tradition  colonel elliot notices this and says  the probability of satchells having obtained information from a hypothetical ballad is really quite an inadmissible argument  this comes near to begging the question  as contemporary incidents much less striking and famous than the rescue of kinmont willie were certainly recorded in ballads the opinion that there was a ballad of kinmont willie is a legitimate hypothesis which must be tested on its merits  for example we shall ask does satchells version yield any traces of ballad sources  my own opinion has been anticipated by mr frank miller in his the poets of dumfriesshire p 33 1910 and in balladlore mr miller is well equipped  he says  the balance of probability seems to be in favour of the originality of kinmont willie rather than of satchells he means not of our kinmont willie as scott gives it but of a ballad concerning the kinmont  captain walter scotts of satchells true history was certainly gathered out of the ballads current in his day as well as out of formal histories and his account of the assault on the castle reads like a narrative largely due to suggestions from some popular lay  does satchells version then show traces of a memory of such a lay undoubtedly it does  satchells prolix narrative occasionally drops or rises into ballad lines as in the opening about kinmont willie    it fell about the martinmas when kine was in the prime   that willie brought a prey out of northumberland  the old ballad disregarding dates may well have opened with this common formula lord scrope vowed vengence   took kinmont the selfsame night  if he had had but ten men more    that had been as stout as he lord scroup had not the kinmont taen    with all his company   scotts ballad stanza i says that fause sakelde and scrope took willie as in fact salkeld of corby did and   had willie had but twenty men    but twenty men as stout as he fause sakelde had never the kinmont taen    wi eight score in his cumpanie   manifestly either satchells is here pirating a verse of a ballad as scott holds or scott if he had no ballad fragments before him is pirating a verse from satchells as colonel elliot must suppose  in my opinion satchells had a memory of a kinmont ballad beginning like jamie telfer it fell about the martinmas tyde or like otterburn it fell about the lammas tide and he opened with this formula broke away from it and came back to the ballad in the stanza if he had had but ten men more which differs but slightly from stanza ii of scotts ballad  that this is so and that later satchells is again reminiscent of a ballad is no improbable opinion  in the ballad iiiviii we learn how willie is brought a prisoner across liddel to carlisle we have his altercation with lord scrope and the arrival of the news at branksome where buccleuch is at table satchells also gives the altercation  in both versions willie promises to take his leave of scrope before he quits the castle  in scotts ballad scrope speaks stanza vi   before ye cross my castle yate i trow ye shall take fareweel o me   willie replies    i never yet lodged in a hostelrie but i paid my lawing before i gaed   in satchells lord scrope says    before thou goest away thou must    even take thy leave of me by the cross of my sword says willie then    ill take my leave of thee   now had scott been pirating satchells i think he would have kept by the cross of my sword which is picturesque and probable willie being no good presbyterian  in otterburne scott altering hoggs copy makes douglas swear by the might of our ladye  it is a question of opinion but i do think that if scott were merely paraphrasing and pirating satchells he could not have helped putting into his version the catholic by the cross of my sword then willy said as given by satchells  to do this was safe as scott had said that satchells does pirate ballads  on the other hand satchells composing in black 1688 when catholicism had been stamped out on the scottish border was not apt to invent by the cross of my sword  it looks like scotts work for he of course knew how catholicism lingered among the spears of bothwell himself a catholic in 1596 but it is not scotts work it is in satchells  in both satchells and the ballad news comes to buccleuch  here satchells again balladises    it is that way buckcleugh did say    lord scrope must understand that he has not only done me wrong    but my sovereign james of scotland  my sovereign lord king of scotland    thinks not his cousin queen will offer to invade his land    without leave asked and gien   i do not see how satchells could either invent or glean from tradition the gist of buccleuchs diplomatic remonstrances first with salkeld for scrope was absent at the time of willies capture then with scrope  buccleuch in fact wrote that the taking of willie was to the touch of the king a stain on his honour says a contemporary manuscript 135a  in a contemporary ballad a kind of rhymed newssheet the facts would be known and reported  but at this point at buccleuchs reception of the news of kinmont scott is perhaps overmastered by his opportunity and i think himself composes stanzas ix x xi xii   o is my basnet a widows curch or my lance a wand o the willow tree   and so on  child and mr henderson are of the same opinion but it is only sense of style that guides us in such a matter nor can i give other grounds for supposing that the original ballad appears again in stanza xiii   o were there war between the lands    as well i wot that there is none i would slight carlisle castle high    tho it were built o marble stone   thence i think the original ballad doubtless made harmonious as hogg put it ran into stanza xxxi where scott probably introduced the elliot tune if it be ancient    o wha dare meddle wi me   satchells next through a hundred and forty lines describes buccleuchs correspondence with scrope his counsels with his clansmen and gives all their names and estates with remarks on their relationships  he thinks himself a historian and a genealogist  the stuff is partly in prose lines partly in rhymed couplets of various lengths  there are two or three more or less balladlike stanzas at the beginning but they are too bad for any author but satchells  scotts ballad cuts all that omits even what satchells gives mentions of harden and goes on xv    he has called him forty marchmen bauld    i trow they were of his own name except sir gilbert elliot called    the laird of stubs i mean the same   now i would stake a large sum that sir walter never wrote that stall copy stanza  colonel elliot replies that i have said the balladfaker should avoid being too poetical  the balladfaker should shun being too poetical as he would shun kippered sturgeon but scott did not know this nor did hogg  we can always track them by their too decorative too literary interpolations  on this i lay much stress  the ballad next gives xvixxv the spirited stanzas on the ride to the border    there were five and five before them a    wi hunting horns and bugles bright and five and five came wi buccleuch    like wardens men arrayed for fight  and five and five like a mason gang    that carried the ladders lang and hie and five and five like broken men    and so they reached the woodhouselee    a house in scotland within a lang mile of netherby in england the seat of the grahams who were partial for private reasons to the scottish cause  they were at deadly feud with thomas musgrave captain of bewcastle and willie had married a graham  now in my opinion up to stanza xxvi all the evasive answers given to salkeld by each gang till dicky o dryhope a real person replies with a spearthrust    for never a word o lear had he   are not an invention of scotts who knew that salkeld was not met and slain but a fantasy of the original ballad  here i have only familiarity with the romantic perversion of facts that marks all ballads on historical themes to guide me  salkeld is met    as we crossed the batable land when to the english side we held   the ballad does not specify the crossing of esk nor say that salkeld was on the english side nor is there any blunder in the reply of the mason gang    we gang to harry a corbies nest that wons not far frae woodhouselee   whether on english or scottish soil the masons say not and their pretence is derisive bitterly ironical  colonel elliot makes much of the absence of mention of the esk and says it is after they are in england that the false reports are spread 139a  but the ballad does not say soread it  all passes with judicious vagueness   as we crossed the batable land when to the english side we held   satchells knows that the ladders were made at woodhouselee it took till nightfall to finish them  the ballad swift and poetical takes the ladders for grantedas a matter of fact chronicled in the dispatches the grahams of netherby harboured buccleuch  netherby was his base  i could nought have done that matter without great friendship of the grames of eske wrote buccleuch in a letter which scrope intercepted 139b  in satchells buccleuch leaves half his men at the stonish bank staneshaw bank for fear they had made noise or din  an old soldier should have known better and the ballad his probable halfremembered source here does know better    and there the laird garrd leave our steeds    for fear that they should stamp and nie   and alarm the castle garrison  each man of the post on the ford would hold two horses and also keep the ford open for the retreat of the advanced party  the ballad gives the probable version satchells when offering as a reason for leaving half the force lest they should make noise or din is maundering  colonel elliot does not seem to perceive this obvious fact though he does perceive buccleuchs motive for dividing his force presumably with the object of protecting his line of retreat and also to keep the horses out of earshot as the ballad says 140a  in satchells the river is in no great rage  in the ballad it is great and meikle o spait  and it really was so  the ms already cited which scott had not seen when he published the song says that buccleuch arrived at the stoniebank beneath carleile brig the water being at the tyme through raines that had fallen weill thick  in scotts original this river he says was the esk in satchells it is the eden and scott says he made this necessary correction in the ballad  in satchells the storming party   broke a sheet of leid on the castle top   in the ballad they   cut a hole through a sheet o lead   both stories are erroneous the ladders were too short the rescuers broke into a postern door  scrope told this to his government on the day after the deed 14th april 140b  in xxxi the ballad makes buccleuch sound trumpets when the castleroof was scaled in fact it was not scaled  the ladders were too short and the scots broke in a postern door  the wardens trumpet blew o wha dare meddle wi me and here as has been said i think scott is the author  here colonel elliot enters into learning about wha dare meddle wi me a liddesdale tune and in the poem an adaptation by scott of satchells the trumpets sounded come if ye dare  satchells makes the trumpets sound when the rescuers bring kinmont willie to the castletop on the ladder which they did not and again when the rescuers reach the ground by the ladder  they made no use at all of the ladders which were too short and willie says the ballad lay in the lower prison  they came in and went out by a door but the trumpets are not apocryphal  they and the shortness of the ladders are mentioned in a ms quoted by scott and in birrells contemporary diary i p 57  in the ms buccleuch causes the trumpets to be sounded from below by a detachment in the plain field securing the retreat  his motive is to encourage his party and to terrify both castle and town by imagination of a greater force buccleuch again sounds up his trumpet before taking the river in the ms colonel elliot may claim stanza xxxi for scott and also the tune wha dare meddle wi me he may even claim here a suggestion from satchells come if ye dare  colonel elliot says that no tune of this title ever existed a thing not easy to prove 142a  in the conclusion with differences there are resemblances in the ballad and satchells  colonel elliot goes into them very minutely for example he says that kinmont is made to ride off not on horseback but on red rowans back  the ballad says not a word to that effect  kinmonts speech about red rowan as a rough beast to ride is made immediately after the stanza   then shoulder high with shout and cry    we bore him down the ladder lang at every stride red rowan made    i wot the kinmonts airns played clang 142b   after this verse kinmont makes his speech xlxli  but if he did ride on red rowans back to staneshaw bank it was the best thing that a heavily ironed man could do  in the ballad xxvii no horses of the party were waiting at the castle all horses were left behind at staneshaw bank satchells brings horses or at least a horse for willie to the castle  on what could willie ride off except on red rowan 142c  stanzas xxxv xxxvi and xliv are related we have seen to passages in jock o the side and archie o cafield but ballads like homer employ the same formulae to describe the same circumstances  a note of archaism as in gaelic poetic passages in marchen  i do not pretend always to know how far scott kept and emended old stanzas mangled by reciters  there are places in which i am quite at a loss to tell whether he is making or copying  i incline to hold that satchells was occasionally reminiscent of a ballad for the reasons and traces given and i think that scott when his and satchells versions coincide did not borrow direct from satchells but that both men had a ballad source  that ballad was later than the popular belief held by satchells that gilbert elliot was at the time 1596 laird of stobs which he did not acquire till after the union 1603 and that he the only man not a scot says satchells wrongly rode with buccleuch  elliot is not accused of doing so in scropes dispatches but he may have come as far as staneshaw bank where half the company were left behind says satchells with the horses which were also left says the ballad  in that case elliot would not be observed in or near the castle  yet it may have been known in scotland that he was of the party  he was as satchells says a cousin he was also a friend of buccleuchs and he may conceivably have taken a part in this glorious adventure though he could not at the moment be called laird of stobs  were i an elliot this opinion would be welcome to me  really salkeld was in a good position to know whether elliot rode with buccleuch or not  the whole question is not one on which i can speak dogmatically  a person who suspects scott intensely may believe that there were no ballad fragments of kinmont in his possession  the person who like myself thinks satchells with his it fell about the martinmas knew a ballad vaguely believes that satchells had some ballad sources bemuddled in his old memory  a person who cannot conceive that scott wrote   except sir gilbert elliot called    the laird of stobs i mean the same   will hold that scott knew some ballad fragments disjecta membra  but i quite agree with colonel elliot that the ballad as it stands with the exception to my mind of some thirty stanzas themselves emended belongs to the early nineteenth century not to the early seventeenth  the time for supposing the poem as it stands to be saturated with the folkspirit all through is past the poem is far too much contaminated by the genius of scott itself like burns transfiguration of the folkspirit at its best  near the beginning of this paper i said in answer to a question of colonel elliots that i myself was the person who had suspected scott of composing the whole of kinmont willie and i have given my reasons for not remaining constant to my suspicions  but in a work which colonel elliot quotes the abridged edition of childs great book by mrs childsargent and professor kittredge 1905 the learned professor writes kinmont willie is under vehement suspicion of being the work of sir walter scott  mr kittredges entire passage on the matter is worth quoting  he first saysthe traditional ballad appears to be inimitable by any person of literary cultivation the efforts of poets and poetasters end in invariable failure  i do not think that they need end in failure except for one reason the poet or poetaster cannot now except by flat lying and laborious forgery of old papers produce any documentary evidence to prove the authenticity of his attempt at imitation  without documentary evidence of antiquity no critic can approach the imitation except in a spirit of determined scepticism  he knows certainly that the ballad is modern and knowing that he easily finds proofs of modernism even where they do not really exist  i am convinced that to imitate a ballad that would except for the lack of documentary evidence beguile the expert is perfectly feasible  i even venture to offer examples of my own manufacture at the close of this volume  i can find nothing suspicious in them except the deliberate insertion of formulae which occur in genuine ballads  such wiederholungen are not reasons for rejection in my opinion but they are suspect with people who do not understand that they are a natural and necessary feature of archaic poetry and this fact mr kittredge does understand  mr kittredge speaks of sir walters unique success with kinmont willie but is sir walter successful  some of his stanzas i for one can hardly accept even as emended traditional verses  mr kittredge writessir walters success however in a special kind of balladry for which he was better adapted by nature and habit of mind than for any other would only emphasise the universal failure  and it must not be forgotten that kinmont willie if it be scotts work is not made out of whole cloth it is a working over of one of the best traditional ballads known jock o the side with the intention of fitting it to an historical exploit of buccleuch  further the subject itself was of such a nature that it might well have been celebrated in a balladindeed one is tempted to say it must have been so celebrated  not a doubt of that  and finally sir walter scott felt towards the kinmont and the bold buccleuch precisely as the mosstrooping author of such a ballad would have felt  for once then the miraculous happened     146a  or did not happen for the exception is solitary though doubtful and under vehement suspicion  but mr kittredge must remember that no known scottish ballad is made out of whole cloth all have in various degrees the successive modifications wrought by centuries of oral tradition itself in some cases modifying a much modified printed stallcopy or broadside  take jock o the side  the oldest version is in the percy ms 147a as mr henderson says it contains many evident corruptions   jock on his lively bay wats on his white horse behind   there is an example of what the original author could not have written  we do not know how good jock was when he left his poets hands and scott has not touched him up  we cannot estimate the original excellence of any traditional poem by the state in which we find it   corrupt by every beggarman and soiled by all ignoble use    conclusions    we have now examined critically the four essentially border ballads which sir walter is suspected of having edited in an unrighteous manner  now he helps to forge and issues auld maitland  now he or somebody makes up otterburne partly of stanzas from percys reliques which have undergone emendations calculated to disguise the source from which they came partly of stanzas of modern fabrication and partly of a few stanzas and lines from herds version 148a thirdly scott it is suggested knew only what i call the elliot version of jamie telfer perverted that by transposing the roles of buccleuch and stobs and added picturesque stanzas in glorification of his ancestor wat of harden  fourthly he is suspected of writing the whole ballad of kinmont willie from beginning to end  of these four charges the first and most disastrous we have absolutely disproved  scott did not write one verse of the auld maitland he edited it with unusual scrupulosity for he had but one copy and an almost identical recitation  he could not eke and alter by adding verses from other texts as he did in otterburne  secondly scott did not make up otterburne in the way suggested by his critic  he took hoggs ms and i have shown minutely what that ms was and he edited it in accordance with his professed principles  he made a standard text  it is only to be regretted that hogg did not take down verbatim the words of his two reciters and narrators and that scott did not publish hoggs version with his letter in his notes but that was not his method nor the method of his contemporaries  thirdly as to jamie telfer long ago i wrote opposite   the lyart locks of hardens hair   aut jacobus aut diabolus meaning that either james hogg or the devil composed that stanza  i was wrong  hogg had nothing to do with it on internal evidence scott was the maker  but that he transposed the scott and elliot roles is incapable of proof and i have shown that such perversions were made in very early times where national not clan prejudices were concerned  i have also shown that scotts version contains matter not in the elliot version matter injurious to the poem as in one stanza certainly not composed by himself the stanza being an inappropriate stray formula from other ballads  but in the absence of manuscript materials i can only produce presumptions not proofs  lastly kinmont willie and scotts share in it is matter of presumption not of proof  he had been in quest of the ballad as we know from his list of desiderata he says that what he got was mangled by reciters and that in what he got one river was mentioned where topography requires another  he also admits that in the three ballads of rescues he placed passages where they had most poetical appropriateness  my arguments to show that satchells had memory of a kinmont ballad will doubtless appeal with more or less success or with none to different students  that an indefinite quantity of the ballad and improvements on the rest are scotts i cannot doubt from evidence of style  sir walter scott it is impossible to assail however much the scholarly conscience may disapprove says mr kittredge 150a  not much is to be taken by assailing him  business first pleasure afterwards as according to sam weller richard iii said when he killed henry vi before smothering the princes in the tower  i proceed to pleasure in the way of presenting imitations of the traditional ballad which appears to be inimitable by any person of literary cultivation according to mr kittredge   imitations of ballads   the three following ballads are exhibited in connection with mr kittredges opinion that neither poet nor poetaster can imitate to day the traditional ballad  of course not one of my three could now take in an expert for he would ask for documentary evidence of their antiquity  but i doubt if mr kittredge can find any points in my three imitations which infallibly betray their modernity  the first simmy o whythaugh is based on facts in the border despatches  historically the attempt to escape from york castle failed after the prisoners had got out they were recaptured  the second ballad the young ruthven gives the traditional view of the slaying of the ruthvens in their own house in perth on 5th august 1600  the third the dead mans dance combines the horror of the ballads of lizzy wan and the bonny hind with that of the romaic ballad in english the suffolk miracle child no 272   isimmy o whythaugh  o will ye hear o the
