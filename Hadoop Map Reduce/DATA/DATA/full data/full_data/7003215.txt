stupider men than he are now sprawling in parliament and lauding themselves as the authors of their own distinction he was of a fat habit even from boyhood and inclined to a cheerful and cursory reading of the face of life and possibly this attitude of mind was the original cause of his misfortunes beyond this hint philosophy is silent on his career and superstition steps in with the more ready explanation that he was detested of the gods  his fatherthat iron gentlemanhad long ago enthroned himself on the heights of the disruption principles what these are and in spite of their grim name they are quite innocent no array of terms would render thinkable to the merely english intelligence but to the scot they often prove unctuously nourishing and mr nicholson found in them the milk of lions about the period when the churches convene at edinburgh in their annual assemblies he was to be seen descending the mound in the company of divers redheaded clergymen these voluble he only contributing oracular nods brief negatives and the austere spectacle of his stretched upper lip the names of candlish and begg were frequent in these interviews and occasionally the talk ran on the residuary establishment and the doings of one lee a stranger to the tight little theological kingdom of scotland might have listened and gathered literally nothing and mr nicholson who was not a dull man knew this and raged at it he knew there was a vast world outside to whom disruption principles were as the chatter of treetop apes the paper brought him chill whiffs from it he had met englishmen who had asked lightly if he did not belong to the church of scotland and then had failed to be much interested by his elucidation of that nice point it was an evil wild rebellious world lying sunk in dozenedness for nothing short of a scots word will paint this scotsmans feelings and when he entered his own house in randolph crescent south side and shut the door behind him his heart swelled with security here at least was a citadel unassailable by righthand defections or lefthand extremes here was a family where prayers came at the same hour where the sabbath literature was unimpeachably selected where the guest who should have leaned to any false opinion was instantly set down and over which there reigned all the week and grew denser on sundays a silence that was agreeable to his ear and a gloom that he found comfortable  mrs nicholson had died about thirty and left him with three children a daughter two years and a son about eight years younger than john and john himself the unfortunate protagonist of the present history the daughter maria was a good girldutiful pious dull but so easily startled that to speak to her was quite a perilous enterprise i dont think i care to talk about that if you please she would say and strike the boldest speechless by her unmistakable pain this upon all topicsdress pleasure morality politics in which the formula was changed to my papa thinks otherwise and even religion unless it was approached with a particular whining tone of voice alexander the younger brother was sickly clever fond of books and drawing and full of satirical remarks in the midst of these imagine that natural clumsy unintelligent and mirthful animal john mighty wellbehaved in comparison with many lads although not up to the standard of the house in randolph crescent full of a sort of blundering affection full of caresses which were never very warmly received full of sudden and loud laughter which rang out in that still house like curses mr nicholson himself had a great fund of humour of the scots orderintellectual turning on the observation of men his own character for instanceif he could have seen it in anotherwould have been a rare feast to him but his sons empty guffaws over a broken plate and empty almost lightheaded remarks struck him with pain as the indices of a weak mind  outside the family john had early attached himself much as a dog may follow a marquess to the steps of alan houston a lad about a year older than himself idle a trifle wild the heir to a good estate which was still in the hands of a rigorous trustee and so royally content with himself that he took johns devotion as a thing of course the intimacy was gall to mr nicholson it took his son from the house and he was a jealous parent it kept him from the office and he was a martinet lastly mr nicholson was ambitious for his family in which and in the disruption principles he entirely lived and hated to see a son of his play second fiddle to an idler after some hesitation he ordered that the friendship should ceasean unfair command though seemingly inspired by the spirit of prophecy and john saying nothing continued to disobey the order under the rose  john was nearly nineteen when he was one day dismissed rather earlier than usual from his fathers office where he was studying the practice of the law it was saturday and except that he had a matter of four hundred pounds in his pocket which it was his duty to hand over to the british linen companys bank he had the whole afternoon at his disposal he went by princes street enjoying the mild sunshine and the little thrill of easterly wind that tossed the flags along that terrace of palaces and tumbled the green trees in the garden the band was playing down in the valley under the castle and when it came to the turn of the pipers he heard their wild sounds with a stirring of the blood something distantly martial woke in him and he thought of miss mackenzie the daughter of a retired captain of highlanders whom he was to meet that day at dinner in his fathers house  now it is undeniable that he should have gone directly to the bank but right in the way stood the billiardroom of the hotel where alan was almost certain to be found and the temptation proved too strong he entered the billiardroom and was instantly greeted by his friend cue in hand  nicholson said he i want you to lend me a pound or two till monday  youve come to the right shop havent you returned john i have twopence  nonsense said alan you can get some go and borrow at your tailors they all do it or ill tell you what pop your watch  o yes i daresay said john and how about my father  how is he to know he doesnt wind it up for you at night does he inquired alan at which john guffawed no seriously i am in a fix continued the tempter i have lost some money to a man here ill give it you tonight and you can get the heirloom out again on monday come its a small service after all i would do a good deal more for you  whereupon john went forth and pawned his gold watch under the assumed name of john froggs 85 pleasance but the nervousness that assailed him at the door of that inglorious haunt a pawnshop and the effort necessary to invent the pseudonym which somehow seemed to him a necessary part of the procedure had taken more time than he imagined and when he returned to the billiardroom with the spoils the bank had already closed its doors  this was a shrewd knock a piece of business had been neglected he heard these words in his fathers trenchant voice and trembled and then dodged the thought after all who was to know he must carry four hundred pounds about with him till monday when the neglect could be surreptitiously repaired and meanwhile he was free to pass the afternoon on the encircling divan of the billiardroom smoking his pipe sipping a pint of ale and enjoying to the masthead the modest pleasures of admiration  none can admire like a young man of all youths passions and pleasures this is the most common and least alloyed and every flash of alans black eyes every aspect of his curly head every graceful reach and easy standoff attitude of waiting everything about him down even to his shirtsleeves and wristlinks were seen by john through a luxurious glory he valued himself by the possession of that royal friend hugged himself upon the thought and swam in warm azure his own defects like vanquished difficulties becoming things on which to plume himself only when he thought of miss mackenzie there fell upon his mind a shadow of regret that young lady was worthy of better things than plain john nicholson still known among schoolmates by the derisive name of fatty and he felt that if he could chalk a cue or stand at ease with such a careless grace as alan he could approach the object of his sentiments with a less crushing sense of inferiority  before they parted alan made a proposal that was startling in the extreme he would be at collettes that night about twelve he said why should not john come there and get the money to go to collettes was to see life indeed it was wrong it was against the laws it partook in a very dingy manner of adventure were it known it was the sort of exploit that disconsidered a young man for good with the more serious classes but gave him a standing with the riotous and yet collettes was not a hell it could not come without vaulting hyperbole under the description of a gilded saloon and if it was a sin to go there the sin was merely local and municipal collette was simply an unlicensed publican who gave suppers after eleven at night the edinburgh hour of closing if you belonged to a club you could get a much better supper at the same hour and lose not a jot in public esteem but if you lacked that qualification and were anhungered or inclined towards conviviality at unlawful hours collettes was your only port you were very ill supplied the company was not recruited from the senate or the church though the bar was very well represented on the only occasion on which i flew in the face of my countrys laws and taking my reputation in my hand penetrated into that grim supperhouse and collettes frequenters thrillingly conscious of wrongdoing and that twohanded engine the policeman at the door were perhaps inclined to somewhat feverish excess but the place was in no sense a very bad one and it is somewhat strange to me at this distance of time how it had acquired its dangerous repute  in precisely the same spirit as a man may debate a project to ascend the matterhorn or to cross africa john considered alans proposal and greatly daring accepted it as he walked home the thoughts of this excursion out of the safe places of life into the wild and arduous stirred and struggled in his imagination with the image of flora mackenzieincongruous and yet kindred thoughts for did not each imply unusual tightening of the pegs of resolution did not each woo him forth and warn him back again into himself  between these two considerations at least he was more than usually moved and when he got to randolph crescent he quite forgot the four hundred pounds in the inner pocket of his greatcoat hung up the coat with its rich freight upon his particular pin of the hatstand and in the very action sealed his doom     chapter ii  in which john reaps the whirlwind   about halfpast ten it was johns brave good fortune to offer his arm to miss mackenzie and escort her home the night was chill and starry all the way eastward the trees of the different gardens rustled and looked black up the stone gully of leith walk when they came to cross it the breeze made a rush and set the flames of the streetlamps quavering and when at last they mounted to the royal terrace where captain mackenzie lived a great salt freshness came in their faces from the sea these phases of the walk remained written on johns memory each emphasised by the touch of that light hand on his arm and behind all these aspects of the nocturnal city he saw in his minds eye a picture of the lighted drawingroom at home where he had sat talking with flora and his father from the other end had looked on with a kind and ironical smile john had read the significance of that smile which might have escaped a stranger mr nicholson had remarked his sons entanglement with satisfaction tinged by humour and his smile if it still was a thought contemptuous had implied consent  at the captains door the girl held out her hand with a certain emphasis and john took it and kept it a little longer and said goodnight flora dear and was instantly thrown into much fear by his presumption but she only laughed ran up the steps and rang the bell and while she was waiting for the door to open kept close in the porch and talked to him from that point as out of a fortification she had a knitted shawl over her head her blue highland eyes took the light from the neighbouring streetlamp and sparkled and when the door opened and closed upon her john felt cruelly alone  he proceeded slowly back along the terrace in a tender glow and when he came to greenside church he halted in a doubtful mind over the crown of the calton hill to his left lay the way to collettes where alan would soon be looking for his arrival and where he would now have no more consented to go than he would have wilfully wallowed in a bog the touch of the girls hand on his sleeve and the kindly light in his fathers eyes both loudly forbidding but right before him was the way home which pointed only to bed a place of little ease for one whose fancy was strung to the lyrical pitch and whose not very ardent heart was just then tumultuously moved the hilltop the cool air of the night the company of the great monuments the sight of the city under his feet with its hills and valleys and crossing files of lamps drew him by all he had of the poetic and he turned that way and by that quite innocent deflection ripened the crop of his venial errors for the sickle of destiny  on a seat on the hill above greenside he sat for perhaps half an hour looking down upon the lamps of edinburgh and up at the lamps of heaven wonderful were the resolves he formed beautiful and kindly were the vistas of future life that sped before him he uttered to himself the name of flora in so many touching and dramatic keys that he became at length fairly melted with tenderness and could have sung aloud at that juncture a certain creasing in his greatcoat caught his ear he put his hand into the pocket pulled forth the envelope that held the money and sat stupefied the calton hill about this period had an ill name of nights and to be sitting there with four hundred pounds that did not belong to him was hardly wise he looked up there was a man in a very bad hat a little on one side of him apparently looking at the scenery from a little on the other a second nightwalker was drawing very quietly near up jumped john the envelope fell from his hands he stooped to get it and at the same moment both men ran in and closed with him  a little after he got to his feet very sore and shaken the poorer by a purse which contained exactly one penny postagestamp by a cambric handkerchief and by the allimportant envelope  here was a young man on whom at the highest point of loverly exaltation there had fallen a blow too sharp to be supported alone and not many hundred yards away his greatest friend was sitting at supperay and even expecting him was it not in the nature of man that he should run there he went in quest of sympathyin quest of that droll article that we all suppose ourselves to want when in a strait and have agreed to call advice and he went besides with vague but rather splendid expectations of relief alan was rich or would be so when he came of age by a stroke of the pen he might remedy this misfortune and avert that dreaded interview with mr nicholson from which john now shrank in imagination as the hand draws back from fire  close under the calton hill there runs a certain narrow avenue part street part byroad the head of it faces the doors of the prison its tail descends into the sunless slums of the low calton on one hand it is overhung by the crags of the hill on the other by an old graveyard between these two the roadway runs in a trench sparsely lighted at night sparsely frequented by day and bordered when it has cleared the place of tombs by dingy and ambiguous houses one of these was the house of collette and at his door our illstarred john was presently beating for admittance in an evil hour he satisfied the jealous inquiries of the contraband hotelkeeper in an evil hour he penetrated into the somewhat unsavoury interior alan to be sure was there seated in a room lit by noisy gasjets beside a dirty tablecloth engaged on a coarse meal and in the company of several tipsy members of the junior bar but alan was not sober he had lost a thousand pounds upon a horserace had received the news at dinnertime and was now in default of any possible means of extrication drowning the memory of his predicament he to help john the thing was impossible he couldnt help himself  if you have a beast of a father said he i can tell you i have a brute of a trustee  im not going to hear my father called a beast said john with a beating heart feeling that he risked the last sound rivet of the chain that bound him to life  but alan was quite goodnatured  all right old fellow said he mos respecable man your father and he introduced his friend to his companions as old nicholson the whatdyecallums son  john sat in dumb agony collettes foul walls and spotted tablelinen everything even down to collettes villainous casters seemed like objects in a nightmare and just then there came a knock and a scurrying the police so lamentably absent from the calton hill appeared upon the scene and the party taken flagrante delicto with their glasses at their elbow were seized marched up to the police office and all duly summoned to appear as witnesses in the consequent case against that archshebeener collette  it was a sorrowful and a mightily sobered company that came forth again the vague terror of public opinion weighed generally on them all but there were private and particular horrors on the minds of individuals alan stood in dread of his trustee already sorely tried one of the group was the son of a country minister another of a judge john the unhappiest of all had david nicholson to father the idea of facing whom on such a scandalous subject was physically sickening they stood a while consulting under the buttresses of st giles thence they adjourned to the lodgings of one of the number in north castle street where for that matter they might have had quite as good a supper and far better drink than in the dangerous paradise from which they had been routed there over an almost tearful glass they debated their position each explained that he had the world to lose if the affair went on and he appeared as a witness it was remarkable what bright prospects were just then in the very act of opening before each of that little company of youths and what pious consideration for the feelings of their families began now to well from them each moreover was in an odd state of destitution not one could bear his share of the fine not one but evinced a wonderful twinkle of hope that each of the others in succession was the very man who could step in to make good the deficit one took a high hand he could not pay his share if it went to a trial he should bolt he had always felt the english bar to be his true sphere another branched out into touching details about his family to which no one listened john in the midst of this disorderly competition of poverty and meanness sat stunned contemplating the mountain bulk of his misfortunes  at last upon a pledge that each should apply to his family with a common frankness this convention of unhappy young asses broke up went down the common stair and in the grey of the spring morning with the streets lying dead empty all about them the lamps burning on into the daylight in diminished lustre and the birds beginning to sound premonitory notes from the groves of the town gardens went each his own way with bowed head and echoing footfall  the rooks were awake in randolph crescent but the windows looked down discreetly blinded on the return of the prodigal johns passkey was a recent privilege this was the first time it had been used and o with what a sickening sense of his unworthiness he now inserted it into the welloiled lock and entered that citadel of the proprieties all slept the gas in the hall had been left faintly burning to light his return a dreadful stillness reigned broken by the deep ticking of the eightday clock he put the gas out and sat on a chair in the hall waiting and counting the minutes longing for any human countenance but when at last he heard the alarmclock spring its rattle in the lower story and the servants begin to be about he instantly lost heart and fled to his own room where he threw himself upon the bed     chapter iii  in which john enjoys the harvest home   shortly after breakfast at which he assisted with a highly tragical countenance john sought his father where he used to sit presumably in religious meditation on the sabbath mornings the old gentleman looked up with that sour inquisitive expression that came so near to smiling and was so different in effect  this is a time when i do not like to be disturbed he said  i know that returned john but i havei wantive made a dreadful mess of it he broke out and turned to the window  mr nicholson sat silent for an appreciable time while his unhappy son surveyed the poles in the back green and a certain yellow cat that was perched upon the wall despair sat upon john as he gazed and he raged to think of the dreadful series of his misdeeds and the essential innocence that lay behind them  well said the father with an obvious effort but in very quiet tones what is it  maclean gave me four hundred pounds to put in the bank sir began john and im sorry to say that ive been robbed of it  robbed of it cried mr nicholson with a strong rising inflection robbed be careful what you say john  i cant say anything else sir i was just robbed of it said john in desperation sullenly  and where and when did this extraordinary event take place inquired the father  on the calton hill about twelve last night  the calton hill repeated mr nicholson and what were you doing there at such a time of the night  nothing sir says john  mr nicholson drew in his breath  and how came the money in your hands at twelve last night he asked sharply  i neglected that piece of business said john anticipating comment and then in his own dialect i clean forgot all about it  well said his father its a most extraordinary story have you communicated with the police  i have answered poor john the blood leaping to his face they think they know the men that did it i daresay the money will be recovered if that was all said he with a desperate indifference which his father set down to levity but which sprang from the consciousness of worse behind  your mothers watch too asked mr nicholson  o the watch is all right cried john at least i mean i was coming to the watchthe fact is i am ashamed to say ii had pawned the watch before here is the ticket they didnt find that the watch can be redeemed they dont sell pledges the lad panted out these phrases one after another like minuteguns but at the last word which rang in that stately chamber like an oath his heart failed him utterly and the dreaded silence settled on father and son  it was broken by mr nicholson picking up the pawnticket john froggs 85 pleasance he read and then turning upon john with a brief flash of passion and disgust who is john froggs he cried  nobody said john it was just a name  an alias his father commented  o i think scarcely quite that said the culprit its a form they all do it the man seemed to understand we had a great deal of fun over the name  he paused at that for he saw his father wince at the picture like a man physically struck and again there was silence  i do not think said mr nicholson at last that i am an ungenerous father i have never grudged you money within reason for any avowable purpose you had just to come to me and speak and now i find that you have forgotten all decency and all natural feeling and actually pawnedpawnedyour mothers watch you must have had some temptation i will do you justice to suppose it was a strong one what did you want with this money  i would rather not tell you sir said john it will only make you angry  i will not be fenced with cried his father there must be an end of disingenuous answers what did you want with this money  to lend it to houston sir says john  i thought i had forbidden you to speak to that young man asked the father  yes sir said john but i only met him  where came the deadly question  and in a billiardroom was the damning answer thus had johns single departure from the truth brought instant punishment for no other purpose but to see alan would he have entered a billiardroom but he had desired to palliate the fact of his disobedience and now it appeared that he frequented these disreputable haunts upon his own account  once more mr nicholson digested the vile tidings in silence and when john stole a glance at his fathers countenance he was abashed to see the marks of suffering  well said the old gentleman at last i cannot pretend not to be simply bowed down i rose this morning what the world calls a happy manhappy at least in a son of whom i thought i could be reasonably proud  but it was beyond human nature to endure this longer and john interrupted almost with a scream o wheest he cried thats not all thats not the worst of itits nothing how could i tell you were proud of me o i wish i wish that i had known but you always said i was such a disgrace and the dreadful thing is this we were all taken up last night and we have to pay collettes fine among the six or well be had up for evidenceshebeening it is they made me swear to tell you but for my part he cried bursting into tears i just wish that i was dead and he fell on his knees before a chair and hid his face  whether his father spoke and whether he remained long in the room or at once departed are points lost to history a horrid turmoil of mind and body bursting sobs broken vanishing thoughts now of indignation now of remorse broken elementary whiffs of consciousness of the smell of the horsehair on the chairbottom of the jangling of church bells that now began to make day horrible throughout the confines of the city of the hard floor that bruised his knees of the taste of tears that found their way into his mouth for a period of time the duration of which i cannot guess while i refuse to dwell longer on its agony these were the whole of gods world for john nicholson  when at last as by the touching of a spring he returned again to clearness of consciousness and even a measure of composure the bells had but just done ringing and the sabbath silence was still marred by the patter of belated feet by the clock above the fire as well as by these more speaking signs the service had not long begun and the unhappy sinner if his father had really gone to church might count on near two hours of only comparative unhappiness with his father the superlative degree returned infallibly he knew it by every shrinking fibre in his body he knew it by the sudden dizzy whirling of his brain at the mere thought of that calamity an hour and a half perhaps an hour and threequarters if the doctor was longwinded and then would begin again that active agony from which even in the dull ache of the present he shrank as from the bite of fire he saw in a vision the family pew the somnolent cushions the bibles the psalmbooks maria with her smellingsalts his father sitting spectacled and critical and at once he was struck with indignation not unjustly it was inhuman to go off to church and leave a sinner in suspense unpunished unforgiven and at the very touch of criticism the paternal sanctity was lessened yet the paternal terror only grew and the two strands of feeling drew him in the same direction  and suddenly there came upon him a mad fear lest his father should have locked him in the notion had no ground in sense it was probably no more than a reminiscence of similar calamities in childhood for his fathers room had always been the chamber of inquisition and the scene of punishment but it stuck so rigorously in his mind that he must instantly approach the door and prove its untruth as he went he struck upon a drawer left open in the business table it was the moneydrawer a measure of his fathers disarray the moneydrawerperhaps a pointing providence who is to decide when even divines differ between a providence and a temptation or who sitting calmly under his own vine is to pass a judgment on the doings of a poor hunted dog slavishly afraid slavishly rebellious like john nicholson on that particular sunday his hand was in the drawer almost before his mind had conceived the hope and rising to his new situation he wrote sitting in his fathers chair and using his fathers blottingpad his pitiful apology and farewell    my dear fatheri have taken the money but i will pay it back as   soon as i am able you will never hear of me again i did not mean any   harm by anything so i hope you will try and forgive me i wish you   would say goodbye for me to alexander and maria but not if you dont   want to i could not wait to see you really please try to forgive   me      your affectionate son      john nicholson  the coins abstracted and the missive written he could not be gone too soon from the scene of these transgressions and remembering how his father had once returned from church on some slight illness in the middle of the second psalm he durst not even make a packet of a change of clothes attired as he was he slipped from the paternal doors and found himself in the cool spring air the thin spring sunshine and the great sabbath quiet of the city which was now only pointed by the cawing of the rooks there was not a soul in randolph crescent nor a soul in queensferry street in this outdoor privacy and the sense of escape john took heart again and with a pathetic sense of leavetaking he even ventured up the lane and stood a while a strange peri at the gates of a quaint paradise by the west end of st georges church they were singing within and by a strange chance the tune was st georges edinburgh which bears the name and was first sung in the choir of that church who is this king of glory went the voices from within and to john this was like the end of all christian observances for he was now to be a wild man like ishmael and his life was to be cast in homeless places and with godless people  it was thus with no rising sense of the adventurous but in mere desolation and despair that he turned his back on his native city and set out on foot for californiawith a more immediate eye to glasgow     chapter iv  the second sowing   it is no part of mine to narrate the adventures of john nicholson which were many but simply his more momentous misadventures which were more than he desired and by human standards more than he deserved how he reached california how he was rooked and robbed and beaten and starved how he was at last taken up by charitable folk restored to some degree of selfcomplacency and installed as a clerk in a bank in san francisco it would take too long to tell nor in these episodes were there any marks of the peculiar nicholsonic destiny for they were just such matters as befell some thousands of other young adventurers in the same days and places but once posted in the bank he fell for a time into a high degree of good fortune which as it was only a longer way about to fresh disaster it behoves me to explain  it was his luck to meet a young man in what is technically called a dive and thanks to his monthly wages to extricate this new acquaintance from a position of present disgrace and possible danger in the future this young man was the nephew of one of the nob hill magnates who run the san francisco stock exchange much as more humble adventurers in the corner of some public park at home may be seen to perform the simple artifice of pea and thimble for their own profit that is to say and the discouragement of public gambling it was hence in his powerand as he was of grateful temper it was among the things that he desiredto put john in the way of growing rich and thus without thought or industry or so much as even understanding the game at which he played but by simply buying and selling what he was told to buy and sell that plaything of fortune was presently at the head of between eleven and twelve thousand pounds or as he reckoned it of upwards of sixty thousand dollars  how he had come to deserve this wealth any more than how he had formerly earned disgrace at home was a problem beyond the reach of his philosophy it was true that he had been industrious at the bank but no more so than the cashier who had seven small children and was visibly sinking in a decline nor was the step which had determined his advancea visit to a dive with a months wages in his pocketan act of such transcendent virtue or even wisdom as to seem to merit the favour of the gods from some sense of this and of the dizzy seesawheavenhigh helldeepon which men sit clutching or perhaps fearing that the sources of his fortune might be insidiously traced to some root in the field of petty cash he stuck to his work said not a word of his new circumstances and kept his account with a bank in a different quarter of the town the concealment innocent as it seems was the first step in the second tragicomedy of johns existence  meanwhile he had never written home whether from diffidence or shame or a touch of anger or mere procrastination or because as we have seen he had no skill in literary arts or because as i am sometimes tempted to suppose there is a law in human nature that prevents young mennot otherwise beastsfrom the performance of this simple act of pietymonths and years had gone by and john had never written the habit of not writing indeed was already fixed before he had begun to come into his fortune and it was only the difficulty of breaking this long silence that withheld him from an instant restitution of the money he had stolen or as he preferred to call it borrowed in vain he sat before paper attending on inspiration that heavenly nymph beyond suggesting the words my dear father remained obstinately silent and presently john would crumple up the sheet and decide as soon as he had a good chance to carry the money home in person and this delay which is indefensible was his second step into the snares of fortune  ten years had passed and john was drawing near to thirty he had kept the promise of his boyhood and was now of a lusty frame verging towards corpulence good features good eyes a genial manner a ready laugh a long pair of sandy whiskers a dash of an american accent a close familiarity with the great american joke and a certain likeness to a ryl prsnge who shall remain nameless for me made up the mans externals as he could be viewed in society inwardly in spite of his gross body and highly masculine whiskers he was more like a maiden lady than a man of twentynine  it chanced one day as he was strolling down market street on the eve of his fortnights holiday that his eye was caught by certain railway bills and in very idleness of mind he calculated that he might be home for christmas if he started on the morrow the fancy thrilled him with desire and in one moment he decided he would go  there was much to be done his portmanteau to be packed a credit to be got from the bank where he was a wealthy customer and certain offices to be transacted for that other bank in which he was a humble clerk and it chanced in conformity with human nature that out of all this business it was the last that came to be neglected night found him not only equipped with money of his own but once more as on that former occasion saddled with a considerable sum of other peoples  now it chanced there lived in the same boardinghouse a fellowclerk of his an honest fellow with what is called a weakness for drinkthough it might in this case have been called a strength for the victim had been drunk for weeks together without the briefest intermission to this unfortunate john intrusted a letter with an inclosure of bonds addressed to the bank manager even as he did so he thought he perceived a certain haziness of eye and speech in his trustee but he was too hopeful to be stayed silenced the voice of warning in his bosom and with one and the same gesture committed the money to the clerk and himself into the hands of destiny  i dwell even at the risk of tedium on johns minutest errors his case being so perplexing to the moralist but we have done with them now the roll is closed the reader has the worst of our poor hero and i leave him to judge for himself whether he or john has been the less deserving henceforth we have to follow the spectacle of a man who was a mere whiptop for calamity on whose unmerited misadventures not even the humorist can look without pity and not even the philosopher without alarm  that same night the clerk entered upon a bout of drunkenness so consistent as to surprise even his intimate acquaintance he was speedily ejected from the boardinghouse deposited his portmanteau with a perfect stranger who did not even catch his name wandered he knew not where and was at last hoveto all standing in a hospital at sacramento there under the impenetrable alias of the number of his bed the crapulous being lay for some more days unconscious of all things and of one thing in particular that the police were after him two months had come and gone before the convalescent in the sacramento hospital was identified with kirkman the absconding san francisco clerk even then there must elapse nearly a fortnight more till the perfect stranger could be hunted up the portmanteau recovered and johns letter carried at length to its destination the seal still unbroken the inclosure still intact  meanwhile john had gone upon his holidays without a word which was irregular and there had disappeared with him a certain sum of money which was out of all bounds of palliation but he was known to be careless and believed to be honest the manager besides had a regard for him and little was said although something was no doubt thought until the fortnight was finally at an end and the time had come for john to reappear then indeed the affair began to look black and when inquiries were made and the penniless clerk was found to have amassed thousands of dollars and kept them secretly in a rival establishment the stoutest of his friends abandoned him the books were overhauled for traces of ancient and artful fraud and though none were found there still prevailed a general impression of loss the telegraph was set in motion and the correspondent of the bank in edinburgh for which place it was understood that john had armed himself with extensive credits was warned to communicate with the police  now this correspondent was a friend of mr nicholsons he was well acquainted with the tale of johns calamitous disappearance from edinburgh and putting one thing with another hasted with the first word of this scandal not to the police but to his friend the old gentleman had long regarded his son as one dead johns place had been taken the memory of his faults had already fallen to be one of those old aches which awaken again indeed upon occasion but which we can always vanquish by an effort of the will and to have the long lost resuscitated in a fresh disgrace was doubly bitter  macewen said the old man this must be hushed up if possible if i give you a cheque for this sum about which they are certain could you take it on yourself to let the matter rest  i will said macewen i will take the risk of it  you understand resumed mr nicholson speaking precisely but with ashen lips i do this for my family not for that unhappy young man if it should turn out that these suspicions are correct and he has embezzled large sums he must lie on his bed as he has made it and then looking up at macewen with a nod and one of his strange smiles goodbye said he and macewen perceiving the case to be too grave for consolation took himself off and blessed god on his way home that he was childless     chapter v  the prodigals return   by a little after noon on the eve of christmas john had left his portmanteau in the cloakroom and stepped forth into princes street with a wonderful expansion of the soul such as men enjoy on the completion of longnourished schemes he was at home again incognito and rich presently he could enter his fathers house by means of the passkey which he had piously preserved through all his wanderings he would throw down the borrowed money there would be a reconciliation the details of which he frequently arranged and he saw himself during the next month made welcome in many stately houses at many frigid dinnerparties taking his share in the conversation with the freedom of the man and the traveller and laying down the law upon finance with the authority of the successful investor but this programme was not to be begun before eveningnot till just before dinner indeed at which meal the reassembled family were to sit roseate and the best wine the modern fatted calf should flow for the prodigals return  meanwhile he walked familiar streets merry reminiscences crowding round him sad ones also both with the same surprising pathos the keen frosty air the low rosy wintry sun the castle hailing him like an old acquaintance the names of friends on doorplates the sight of friends whom he seemed to recognise and whom he eagerly avoided in the streets the pleasant chant of the northcountry accent the dome of st georges reminding him of his last penitential moments in the lane and of that king of glory whose name had echoed ever since in the saddest corner of his memory and the gutters where he had learned to slide and the shop where he had bought his skates and the stones on which he had trod and the railings in which he had rattled his clacken as he went to school and all those thousand and one nameless particulars which the eye sees without noting which the memory keeps indeed yet without knowing and which taken one with another build up for us the aspect of the place that we call home all these besieged him as he went with both delight and sadness  his first visit was for houston who had a house on regent terrace kept for him in old days by an aunt the door was opened to his surprise upon the chain and a voice asked him from within what he wanted  i want mr houstonmr alan houston said he  and who are you said the voice  this is most extraordinary thought john and then aloud he told his name  no young mr john cried the voice with a sudden increase of scottish accent testifying to a friendlier feeling  the very same said john  and the old butler removed his defences remarking only i thocht ye were that man but his master was not there he was staying it appeared at the house in murrayfield and though the butler would have been glad enough to have taken his place and given all the news of the family john struck with a little chill was eager to be gone only the door was scarce closed again before he regretted that he had not asked about that man  he was to pay no more visits till he had seen his father and made all well at home alan had been the only possible exception and john had not time to go as far as murrayfield but here he was on regent terrace there was nothing to prevent him going round the end of the hill and looking from without on the mackenzies house as he went he reflected that flora must now be a woman of near his own age and it was within the bounds of possibility that she was married but this dishonourable doubt he dammed down  there was the house sure enough but the door was of another colour and what was thistwo doorplates he drew nearer the top one bore with dignified simplicity the words mr proudfoot the lower one was more explicit and informed the passerby that here was likewise the abode of mr j a dunlop proudfoot advocate the proudfoots must be rich for no advocate could look to have much business in so remote a quarter and john hated them for their wealth and for their name and for the sake of the house they desecrated with their presence he remembered a proudfoot he had seen at school not known a little wheyfaced urchin the despicable member of some lower class could it be this abortion that had climbed to be an advocate and now lived in the birthplace of flora and the home of johns tenderest memories the chill that had first seized upon him when he heard of houstons absence deepened and struck inward for a moment as he stood under the doors of that estranged house and looked east and west along the solitary pavement of the royal terrace where not a cat was stirring the sense of solitude and desolation took him by the throat and he wished himself in san francisco  and then the figure he made with his decent portliness his whiskers the money in his purse the excellent cigar that he now lit recurred to his mind in consolatory comparison with that of a certain maddened lad who on a certain spring sunday ten years before and in the hour of churchtime silence had stolen from that city by the glasgow road in the face of these changes it were impious to doubt fortunes kindness all would be well yet the mackenzies would be found flora younger and lovelier and kinder than before alan would be found and would have so nicely discriminated his behaviour as to have grown on the one hand into a valued friend of mr nicholsons and to have remained upon the other of that exact shade of joviality which john desired in his companions and so once more john fell to work discounting the delightful future his first appearance in the family pew his first visit to his uncle greig who thought himself so great a financier and on whose purblind edinburgh eyes john was to let in the dazzling daylight of the west and the details in general of that unrivalled transformation scene in which he was to display to all edinburgh a portly and successful gentleman in the shoes of the derided fugitive  the time began to draw near when his father would have returned from the office and it would be the prodigals cue to enter he strolled westward by albany street facing the sunset embers pleased he knew not why to move in that cold air and indigo twilight starred with streetlamps but there was one more disenchantment waiting him by the way  at the corner of pitt street he paused to light a fresh cigar the vesta threw as he did so a strong light upon his features and a man of about his own age stopped at sight of it  i think your name must be nicholson said the stranger  it was too late to avoid recognition and besides as john was now actually on the way home it hardly mattered and he gave way to the impulse of his nature  great scott he cried beatson and shook hands with warmth it scarce seemed he was repaid in kind  so youre home again said beatson where have you been all this long time  in the states said johncalifornia ive made my pile though and it suddenly struck me it would be a noble scheme to come home for christmas  i see said beatson well i hope well see something of you now youre here  i guess so said john a little frozen  well tata concluded beatson and he shook hands again and went  this was a cruel first experience it was idle to blink facts here was john home again and beatsonold beatsondid not care a rush he recalled old beatson in the pastthe merry and affectionate ladand their joint adventures and mishaps the window they had broken with a catapult in india place the escalade of the castle rock and many another inestimable bond of friendship and his hurt surprise grew deeper well after all it was only on a mans own family that he could count blood was thicker than water he remembered and the net result of this encounter was to bring him to the doorstep of his fathers house with tenderer and softer feelings  the night had come the fanlight over the door shone bright the two windows of the diningroom where the cloth was being laid and the three windows of the drawingroom where maria would be waiting dinner glowed softer through yellow blinds it was like a vision of the past all this time of his absence life had gone forward with an equal foot and the fires and the gas had been lighted and the meals spread at the accustomed hours at the accustomed hour too the bell had sounded thrice to call the family to worship and at the thought a pang of regret for his demerit seized him he remembered the things that were good and that he had neglected and the things that were evil and that he had loved and it was with a prayer upon his lips that he mounted the steps and thrust the key into the keyhole  he stepped into the lighted hall shut the door softly behind him and stood there fixed in wonder no surprise of strangeness could equal the surprise of that complete familiarity there was the bust of chalmers near the stairrailings there was the clothesbrush in the accustomed place and there on the hatstand hung hats and coats that must surely be the same as he remembered ten years dropped from his life as a pin may slip between the fingers and the ocean and the mountains and the mines and the crowded marts and mingled races of san francisco and his own fortune and his own disgrace became for that one moment the figures of a dream that was over  he took off his hat and moved mechanically towards the stand and there he found a small change that was a great one to him the pin that had been his from boyhood where he had flung his balmoral when he loitered home from the academy and his first hat when he came briskly back from college or the officehis pin was occupied they might have at least respected my pin he thought and he was moved as by a slight and began at once to recollect that he was here an interloper in a strange house which he had entered almost by a burglary and where at any moment he might be scandalously challenged  he moved at once his hat still in his hand to the door of his fathers room opened it and entered mr nicholson sat in the same place and posture as on that last sunday morning only he was older and greyer and sterner and as he now glanced up and caught the eye of his son a strange commotion and a dark flush sprang into his face  father said john steadily and even cheerfully for this was a moment against which he was long ago prepared father here i am and here is the money that i took from you i have come back to ask your forgiveness and to stay christmas with you and the children  keep your money said the father and go  father cried john for gods sake dont receive me this way ive come for  understand me interrupted mr nicholson you are no son of mine and in the sight of god i wash my hands of you one last thing i will tell you one warning i will give you all is discovered and you are being hunted for your crimes if you are still at large it is thanks to me but i have done all that i mean to do and from this time forth i would not raise one fingernot one fingerto save you from the gallows and now with a low voice of absolute authority and a single weighty gesture of the finger and nowgo     chapter vi  the house at murrayfield   how john passed the evening in what windy confusion of mind in what squalls of anger and lulls of sick collapse in what pacing of streets and plunging into publichouses it would profit little to relate his misery if it were not progressive yet tended in no way to diminish for in proportion as grief and indignation abated fear began to take their place at first his fathers menacing words lay by in some safe drawer of memory biding their hour at first john was all thwarted affection and blighted hope next bludgeoned vanity raised its head again with twenty mortal gashes and the father was disowned even as he had disowned the son what was this regular course of life that john should have admired it what were these clockwork virtues from which love was absent kindness was the test kindness the aim and soul and judged by such a standard the discarded prodigalnow rapidly drowning his sorrows and his reason in successive dramswas a creature of a lovelier morality than his selfrighteous father yes he was the better man he felt it glowed with the consciousness and entering a publichouse at the corner of howard place whither he had somehow wandered he pledged his own virtues in a glassperhaps the fourth since his dismissal of that he knew nothing keeping no account of what he did or where he went and in the general crashing hurry of his nerves unconscious of the approach of intoxication indeed it is a question whether he were really growing intoxicated or whether at first the spirits did not even sober him for it was even as he drained this last glass that his fathers ambiguous and menacing wordspopping from their hidingplace in memorystartled him like a hand laid upon his shoulder crimes hunted the gallows they were ugly words in the ears of an innocent man perhaps all the uglier for if some judicial error were in act against him who should set a limit to its grossness or to how far it might be pushed not john indeed he was no believer in the powers of innocence his cursed experience pointing in quite other ways and his fears once wakened grew with every hour and hunted him about the city streets  it was perhaps nearly nine at night he had eaten nothing since lunch he had drunk a good deal and he was exhausted by emotion when the thought of houston came into his head he turned not merely to the man as a friend but to his house as a place of refuge the danger that threatened him was still so vague that he knew neither what to fear nor where he might expect it but this much at least seemed undeniable that a private house was safer than a public inn moved by these counsels he turned at once to the caledonian station passed not without alarm into the bright lights of the approach redeemed his portmanteau from the cloakroom and was soon whirling in a cab along the glasgow road the change of movement and position the sight of the lamps twinkling to the rear and the smell of damp and mould and rotten straw which clung about the vehicle wrought in him strange alternations of lucidity and mortal giddiness  i have been drinking he discovered i must go straight to bed and sleep and he thanked heaven for the drowsiness that came upon his mind in waves  from one of these spells he was awakened by the stoppage of the cab and getting down found himself in quite a country road the last lamp of the suburb shining some way below and the high walls of a garden rising before him in the dark the lodge as the place was named stood indeed very solitary to the south it adjoined another house but standing in so large a garden as to be well out of cry on all other sides open fields stretched upward to the woods of corstorphine hill or backward to the dells of ravelston or downward towards the valley of the leith the effect of seclusion was aided by the great height of the garden walls which were indeed conventual and as john had tested in former days defied the climbing schoolboy the lamp of the cab threw a gleam upon the door and the not brilliant handle of the bell  shall i ring for ye said the cabman who had descended from his perch and was slapping his chest for the night was bitter  i wish you would said john putting his hand to his brow in one of his accesses of giddiness  the man pulled at the handle and the clanking of the bell replied from further in the garden twice and thrice he did it with sufficient intervals in the great frosty silence of the night the sounds fell sharp and small  does he expect ye asked the driver with that manner of familiar interest that well became his portwine face and when john had told him no well then said the cabman if yell tak my advice of it well just gang back and thats disinterested mind ye for my stables are in the glesgie road  the servants must hear said john  hout said the driver he keeps no servants here man theyre a in the town house i drive him often its just a kind of a hermitage this  give me the bell said john and he plucked at it like a man desperate  the clamour had not yet subsided before they heard steps upon the gravel and a voice of singular nervous irritability cried to them through the door who are you and what do you want  alan said john its meits fattyjohn you know im just come home and ive come to stay with you  there was no reply for a moment and then the door was opened  get the portmanteau down said john to the driver  do nothing of the kind said alan and then to john come in here a moment i want to speak to you  john entered the garden and the door was closed behind him a candle stood on the gravel walk winking a little in the draughts it threw inconstant sparkles on the clumped holly struck the light and darkness to and fro like a veil on alans features and sent his shadow hovering behind him all beyond was inscrutable and johns dizzy brain rocked with the shadow yet even so it struck him that alan was pale and his voice when he spoke unnatural  what brings you here tonight he began i dont want god knows to seem unfriendly but i cannot take you in nicholson i cannot do it  alan said john youve just got to you dont know the mess im in the governors turned me out and i darent show face in an inn because theyre down on me for murder or something  for what cried alan starting  murder i believe says john  murder repeated alan and passed his hand over his eyes what was that you were saying he asked again  that they were down on me said john im accused of murder by what i can make out and ive really had a dreadful day of it alan and i cant sleep on the roadside on a night like thisat least not with a portmanteau he pleaded  hush said alan with his head on one side and then did you hear nothing he asked  no said john thrilling he knew not why with communicated terror no i heard nothing why and then as there was no answer he reverted to his pleading but i say alan youve just got to take me in ill go right away to bed if you have anything to do i seem to have been drinking i was that knocked over i wouldnt turn you away alan if you were down on your luck  no returned alan neither will i you then come and lets get your portmanteau  the cabman was paid and drove off down the long lamplit hill and the two friends stood on the sidewalk beside the portmanteau till the last rumble of the wheels had died in silence it seemed to john as though alan attached importance to this departure of the cab and john who was in no state to criticise shared profoundly in the feeling  when the stillness was once more perfect alan shouldered the portmanteau carried it in and shut and locked the garden door and then once more abstraction seemed to fall upon him and he stood with his hand on the key until the cold began to nibble at johns fingers  why are we standing here asked john  eh said alan blankly  why man you dont seem yourself said the other  no im not myself said alan and he sat down on the portmanteau and put his face in his hands  john stood beside him swaying a little and looking about him at the swaying shadows the flitting sparkles and the steady stars overhead until the windless cold began to touch him through his clothes on the bare skin even in his bemused intelligence wonder began to awake  i say lets come on to the house he said at last  yes lets come on to the house repeated alan  and he rose at once reshouldered the portmanteau and taking the candle in his other hand moved forward to the lodge this was a long low building smothered in creepers and now except for some chinks of light between the diningroom shutters it was plunged in darkness and silence  in the hall alan lit another candle gave it to john and opened the door of a bedroom  here said he go to bed dont mind me john youll be sorry for me when you know  wait a bit returned john ive got so cold with all that standing about lets go into the diningroom a minute just one glass to warm me alan  on the table in the hall stood a glass and a bottle with a whisky label on a tray it was plain the bottle had been just opened for the cork and corkscrew lay beside it  take that said alan passing john the whisky and then with a certain roughness pushed his friend into the bedroom and closed the door behind him  john stood amazed then he shook the bottle and to his further wonder found it partly empty three or four glasses were gone alan must have uncorked a bottle of whisky and drunk three or four glasses one after the other without sitting down for there was no chair and that in his own cold lobby on this freezing night it fully explained his eccentricities john reflected sagely as he mixed himself a grog poor alan he was drunk and what a dreadful thing was drink and what a slave to it poor alan was to drink in this unsociable uncomfortable fashion the man who would drink alone except for healths sakeas john was now doingwas a man utterly lost he took the grog out and felt hazier but warmer it was hard work opening the portmanteau and finding his night things and before he was undressed the cold had struck home to him once more well said he just a drop more theres no sense in getting ill with all this other trouble and presently dreamless slumber buried him  when john awoke it was day the low winter sun was already high in the heavens but his watch had stopped and it was impossible to tell the hour exactly ten he guessed it and made haste to dress dismal reflections crowding on his mind but it was less from terror than from regret that he now suffered and with his regret there were mingled cutting pangs of penitence there had fallen upon him a blow cruel indeed but yet only the punishment of old misdoing and he had rebelled and plunged into fresh sin the rod had been used to chasten and he had bit the chastening fingers his father was right john had justified him john was no guest for decent peoples houses and no fit associate for decent peoples children and had a broader hint been needed there was the case of his old friend john was no drunkard though he could at times exceed and the picture of houston drinking neat spirits at his halltable struck him with something like disgust he hung back from meeting his old friend he could have wished he had not come to him and yet even now where else was he to turn  these musings occupied him while he dressed and accompanied him into the lobby of the house the door stood open on the garden doubtless alan had stepped forth and john did as he supposed his friend had done the ground was hard as iron the frost still rigorous as he brushed among the hollies icicles jingled and glittered in their fall and wherever he went a volley of eager sparrows followed him here were christmas weather and christmas morning duly met to the delight of children this was the day of reunited families the day to which he had so long looked forward thinking to awake in his own bed in randolph crescent reconciled with all men and repeating the footprints of his youth and here he was alone pacing the alleys of a wintry garden and filled with penitential thoughts  and that reminded him why was he alone and where was alan the thought of the festal morning and the due salutations reawakened his desire for his friend and he began to call for him by name as the sound of his voice died away he was aware of the greatness of the silence that environed him but for the twittering of the sparrows and the crunching of his own feet upon the frozen snow the whole windless world of air seemed to hang over him entranced and the stillness weighed upon his mind with a horror of solitude  still calling at intervals but now with a moderated voice he made the hasty circuit of the garden and finding neither man nor trace of man in all its evergreen coverts turned at last to the house about the house the silence seemed to deepen strangely the door indeed stood open as before but the windows were still shuttered the chimneys breathed no stain into the bright air there sounded abroad none of that low stir perhaps audible rather to the ear of the spirit than to the ear of the flesh by which a house announces and betrays its human lodgers and yet alan must be therealan locked in drunken slumbers forgetful of the return of day of the holy season and of the friend whom he had so coldly received and was now so churlishly neglecting johns disgust redoubled at the thought but hunger was beginning to grow stronger than repulsion and as a step to breakfast if to nothing else he must find and arouse the sleeper  he made the circuit of the bedroom quarters all until he came to alans chamber were locked from without and bore the marks of a long disuse but alans was a room in commission filled with clothes knickknacks letters books and the conveniences of a solitary man the fire had been lit but it had long ago burnt out and the ashes were stone cold the bed had been made but it had not been slept in  worse and worse then alan must have fallen where he sat and now sprawled brutishly no doubt upon the diningroom floor  the diningroom was a very long apartment and was reached through a passage so that john upon his entrance brought but little light with him and must move towards the windows with spread arms groping and knocking on the furniture suddenly he tripped and fell his length over a prostrate body it was what he had looked for yet it shocked him and he marvelled that so rough an impact should not have kicked a groan out of the drunkard men had killed themselves ere now in such excesses a dreary and degraded end that made john shudder what if alan were dead there would be a christmas day  by this john had his hand upon the shutters and flinging them back beheld once again the blessed face of the day even by that light the room had a discomfortable air the chairs were scattered and one had been overthrown the tablecloth laid as if for dinner was twitched upon one side and some of the dishes had fallen to the floor behind the table lay the drunkard still unaroused only one foot visible to john  but now that light was in the room the worst seemed over it was a disgusting business but not more than disgusting and it was with no great apprehension that john proceeded to make the circuit of the table his last comparatively tranquil moment for that day no sooner had he turned the corner no sooner had his eyes alighted on the body than he gave a smothered breathless cry and fled out of the room and out of the house  it was not alan who lay there but a man well up in years of stern countenance and irongrey locks and it was no drunkard for the body lay in a black pool of blood and the open eyes stared upon the ceiling  to and fro walked john before the door the extreme sharpness of the air acted on his nerves like an astringent and braced them swiftly presently he not relaxing in his disordered walk the images began to come clearer and stay longer in his fancy and next the power of thought came back to him and the horror and danger of his situation rooted him to the ground  he grasped his forehead and staring on one spot of gravel pieced together what he knew and what he suspected alan had murdered some one possibly that man against whom the butler chained the door in regent terrace possibly another some one at least a human soul whom it was death to slay and whose blood lay spilt upon the floor this was the reason of the whiskydrinking in the passage of his unwillingness to welcome john of his strange behaviour and bewildered words this was why he had started at and harped upon the name of murder this was why he had stood and hearkened or sat and covered his eyes in the black night and now he was gone now he had basely fled and to all his perplexities and dangers john stood heir  let me think let me think he said aloud impatiently even pleadingly as if to some merciless interrupter in the turmoil of his wits a thousand hints and hopes and threats and terrors dinning continuously in his ears he was like one plunged in the hubbub of a crowd how was he to rememberhe who had not a thought to sparethat he was himself the author as well as the theatre of so much confusion but in hours of trial the junto of mans nature is dissolved and anarchy succeeds  it was plain he must stay no longer where he was for here was a new judicial error in the very making it was not so plain where he must go for the old judicial error vague as a cloud appeared to fill the habitable world whatever it might be it watched for him fullgrown in edinburgh it must have had its birth in san francisco it stood guard no doubt like a dragon at the bank where he should cash his credit and though there were doubtless many other places who should say in which of them it was not ambushed no he could not tell where he was to go he must not lose time on these insolubilities let him go back to the beginning it was plain he must stay no longer where he was it was plain too that he must not flee as he was for he could not carry his portmanteau and to flee and leave it was to plunge deeper in the mire he must go leave the house unguarded find a cab and returnreturn after an absence had he courage for that  and just then he spied a stain about a hands breadth on his trousersleg and reached his finger down to touch it the finger was stained red it was blood he stared upon it with disgust and awe and terror and in the sharpness of the new sensation fell instantly to act  he cleansed his finger in the snow returned into the house drew near with hushed footsteps to the diningroom door and shut and locked it then he breathed a little freer for here at least was an oaken barrier between himself and what he feared next he hastened to his room tore off the spotted trousers which seemed in his eyes a link to bind him to the gallows flung them in a corner donned another pair breathlessly crammed his nightthings into his portmanteau locked it swung it with an effort from the ground and with a rush of relief came forth again under the open heavens  the portmanteau being of occidental build was no featherweight it had distressed the powerful alan and as for john he was crushed under its bulk and the sweat broke upon him thickly twice he must set it down to rest before he reached the gate and when he had come so far he must do as alan did and take his seat upon one corner here then he sat a while and panted but now his thoughts were sensibly lightened now with the trunk standing just inside the door some part of his dissociation from the house of crime had been effected and the cabman need not pass the garden wall it was wonderful how that relieved him for the house in his eyes was a place to strike the most cursory beholder with suspicion as though the very windows had cried murder  but there was to be no remission of the strokes of fate as he thus sat taking breath in the shadow of the wall and hopped about by sparrows it chanced that his eye roved to the fastening of the door and what he saw plucked him to his feet the thing locked with a spring once the door was closed the bolt shot of itself and without a key there was no means of entering from the road  he saw himself compelled to one of two distasteful and perilous alternatives either to shut the door altogether and set his portmanteau out upon the wayside a wonder to all beholders or to leave the door ajar so that any thievish tramp or holiday schoolboy might stray in and stumble on the grisly secret to the last as the least desperate his mind inclined but he must first insure himself that he was unobserved he peered out and down the long road it lay dead empty he went to the corner of the byroad that comes by way of dean there also not a passenger was stirring plainly it was now or never the high tide of his affairs and he drew the door as close as he durst slipped a pebble in the chink and made off downhill to find a cab  halfway down a gate opened and a troop of christmas children sallied forth in the most cheerful humour followed more soberly by a smiling mother  and this is christmas day thought john and could have laughed aloud in tragic bitterness of heart     chapter vii  a tragicomedy in a cab   in front of donaldsons hospital john counted it good fortune to perceive a cab a great way off and by much shouting and waving of his arm to catch the notice of the driver he counted it good fortune for the time was long to him till he should have done for ever with the lodge and the farther he must go to find a cab the greater the chance that the inevitable discovery had taken place and that he should return to find the garden full of angry neighbours yet when the vehicle drew up he was sensibly chagrined to recognise the portwine cabman of the night before here he could not but reflect here is another link in the judicial error  the driver on the other hand was pleased to drop again upon so liberal a fare and as he was a manthe reader must already have perceivedof easy not to say familiar manners he dropped at once into a vein of friendly talk commenting on the weather on the sacred season which struck him chiefly in the light of a day of liberal gratuities on the chance which had reunited him to a pleasing customer and on the fact that john had been as he was pleased to call it visibly on the randan the night before  and ye look dreidful bad theday sir i must say that he continued theres nothing like a dram for yeif yell take my advice of it and bein as its christmas im no saying he added with a fatherly smile but what i would join ye mysel  john had listened with a sick heart  ill give you a dram when weve got through said he affecting a sprightliness which sat on him most unhandsomely and not a drop till then business first and pleasure afterwards  with this promise the jarvey was prevailed upon to clamber to his place and drive with hideous deliberation to the door of the lodge there were no signs as yet of any public emotion only two men stood not far off in talk and their presence seen from afar set johns pulses buzzing he might have spared himself his fright for the pair were lost in some dispute of a theological complexion and with lengthened upper lip and enumerating fingers pursued the matter of their difference and paid no heed to john  but the cabman proved a thorn in the flesh nothing would keep him on his perch he must clamber down comment upon the pebble in the door which he regarded as an ingenious but unsafe device help john with the portmanteau and enliven matters with a flow of speech and especially of questions which i thus condense  hell no be here himsel will he no well hes an eccentric mana fair oddityif ye ken the expression great trouble with his tenants they tell me ive driven the faimly for years i drove a cab at his fathers waddin whatll your name bei should ken your face baigrey ye say there were baigreys about gilmerton yell be one of that lot then thisll be a friends portmantie like why because the name upon its nucholson o if yere in a hurry thats another job waverley brig are ye for away  so the friendly toper prated and questioned and kept johns heart in a flutter but to this also as to other evils under the sun there came a period and the victim of circumstances began at last to rumble towards the railway terminus at waverley bridge during the transit he sat with raised glasses in the frosty chill and mouldy foetor of his chariot and glanced out sidelong on the holiday face of things the shuttered shops and the crowds along the pavement much as the rider in the tyburn cart may have observed the concourse gathering to his execution  at the station his spirits rose again another stage of his escape was fortunately endedhe began to spy blue water he called a railway porter and bade him carry the portmanteau to the cloakroom not that he had any notion of delay flight instant flight was his design no matter whither but he had determined to dismiss the cabman ere he named or even chose his destination thus possibly baulking the judicial error of another link this was his cunning aim and now with one foot on the roadway and one still on the coachstep he made haste to put the thing in practice and plunged his hand into his trouserspocket  there was nothing there  o yes this time he was to blame he should have remembered and when he deserted his bloodstained pantaloons he should not have deserted along with them his purse make the most of his error and then compare it with the punishment conceive his new position for i lack words to picture it conceive him condemned to return to that house from the very thought of which his soul revolted and once more to expose himself to capture on the very scene of the misdeed conceive him linked to the mouldy cab and the familiar cabman john cursed the cabman silently and then it occurred to him that he must stop the incarceration of his portmanteau that at least he must keep close at hand and he returned to recall the porter but his reflections brief as they had appeared must have occupied him longer than he supposed and there was the man already returning with the receipt  well that was settled he had lost his portmanteau also for the sixpence with which he had paid the murrayfield toll was one that had strayed alone into his waistcoatpocket and unless he once more successfully achieved the adventure of the house of crime his portmanteau lay in the cloakroom in eternal pawn for lack of a penny fee and then he remembered the porter who stood suggestively attentive words of gratitude hanging on his lips  john hunted right and left he found a coinprayed god that it was a sovereigndrew it out beheld a halfpenny and offered it to the porter  the mans jaw dropped  its only a halfpenny he said startled out of railway decency  i know that said john piteously  and here the porter recovered the dignity of man  thank you sir said he and would have returned the base gratuity but john too would none of it and as they struggled who must join in but the cabman  hoots mr baigrey said he you surely forget what day it is  i tell you i have no change cried john  well said the driver and what then i would rather give a man a shillin on a day like this than put him off with a derision like a bawbee im surprised at the like of you mr baigrey  my name is not baigrey broke out john in mere childish temper and distress  ye told me it was yoursel said the cabman  i know i did and what the devil right had you to ask cried the unhappy one  o very well said the driver i know my place if you know yoursif you know yours he repeated as one who should imply grave doubts and muttered inarticulate thunders in which the grand old name of gentleman was taken seemingly in vain  o to have been able to discharge this monster whom john now perceived with tardy clearsightedness to have begun betimes the festivities of christmas but far from any such ray of consolation visiting the lost he stood bare of help and helpers his portmanteau sequestered in one place his money deserted in another and guarded by a corpse himself so sedulous of privacy the cynosure of all mens eyes about the station and as if these were not enough mischances he was now fallen in illblood with the beast to whom his poverty had linked him in illblood as he reflected dismally with the witness who perhaps might hang or save him there was no time to be lost he durst not linger any longer in that public spot and whether he had recourse to dignity or to conciliation the remedy must be applied at once some happily surviving element of manhood moved him to the former  let us have no more of this said he his foot once more upon the step go back to where we came from  he had avoided the name of any destination for there was now quite a little band of railway folk about the cab and he still kept an eye upon the court of justice and laboured to avoid concentric evidence but here again the fatal jarvey outmanoeuvred him  back to the ludge cried he in shrill tones of protest  drive on at once roared john and slammed the door behind him so that the crazy chariot rocked and jingled  forth trundled the cab into the christmas streets the fare within plunged in the blackness of a despair that neighboured on unconsciousness the driver on the box digesting his rebuke and his customers duplicity i would not be thought to put the pair in competition johns case was out of all parallel but the cabman too is worth the sympathy of the judicious for he was a fellow of genuine kindliness and a high sense of personal dignity incensed by drink and his advances had been cruelly and publicly rebuffed as he drove therefore he counted his wrongs and thirsted for sympathy and drink now it chanced he had a friend a publican in queensferry street from whom in view of the sacredness of the occasion he thought he might extract a dram queensferry street lies something off the direct road to murrayfield but then there is the hilly crossroad that passes by the valley of the leith and the dean cemetery and queensferry street is on the way to that what was to hinder the cabman since his horse was dumb from choosing the crossroads and calling on his friend in passing so it was decided and the charioteer already somewhat mollified turned aside his horse to the right  john meanwhile sat collapsed his chin sunk upon his chest his mind in abeyance the smell of the cab was still faintly present to his senses and a certain leaden chill about his feet all else had disappeared in one vast oppression of calamity and physical faintness it was drawing on to noontwoandtwenty hours since he had broken bread in the interval he had suffered tortures of sorrow and alarm and had been partly tipsy and though it was impossible to say he slept yet when the cab stopped and the cabman thrust his head into the window his attention had to be recalled from depths of vacancy  if youll no stand me a dram said the driver with a wellmerited severity of tone and manner i daresay yell have no objection to my taking one mysel  yesnodo what you like returned john and then as he watched his tormentor mount the stairs and enter the whiskyshop there floated into his mind a sense as of something long ago familiar at that he started fully awake and stared at the shopfronts yes he knew them but when and how long since he thought and then casting his eye through the front glass which had been recently occluded by the figure of the jarvey he beheld the treetops of the rookery in randolph crescent he was close to homehome where he had thought at that hour to be sitting in the wellremembered drawingroom in friendly converse and instead  it was his first impulse to drop into the bottom of the cab his next to cover his face with his hands so he sat while the cabman toasted the publican and the publican toasted the cabman and both reviewed the affairs of the nation so he still sat when his master condescended to return and drive off at last downhill along the curve of lynedoch place but even so sitting as he passed the end of his fathers street he took one glance from between shielding fingers and beheld a doctors carriage at the door  well just so thought he ill have killed my father and this is christmas day  if mr nicholson died it was down this same road he must journey to the grave and down this road on the same errand his wife had preceded him years before and many other leading citizens with the proper trappings and attendance of the end and now in that frosty illsmelling strawcarpeted and raggedcushioned cab with his breath congealing on the glasses towards what other destination was john himself advancing  the thought stirred his imagination which began to manufacture many thousand pictures bright and fleeting like the shapes in a kaleidoscope and now he saw himself ruddy and comfortered sliding in the gutter and again a little woebegone bored urchin tricked forth in crape and weepers descending this same hill at the footspace of mourning coaches his mothers body just preceding him and yet again his fancy running far in front showed him the house at murrayfieldnow standing solitary in the low sunshine with the sparrows hopping on the threshold and the dead man within staring at the roof and now with a sudden change thronged about with whitefaced handuplifting neighbours the doctor bursting through their midst and fixing his stethoscope as he went the policeman shaking a sagacious head beside the body it was to this he feared that he was driving in the midst of this he saw himself arrive heard himself stammer faint explanations and felt the hand of the constable upon his shoulder heavens how he wished he had played the manlier part how he despised himself that he had fled that fatal neighbourhood when all was quiet and should now be tamely travelling back when it was thronging with avengers  any strong degree of passion lends even to the dullest the forces of the imagination and so now as he dwelt on what was probably awaiting him at the end of this distressful drivejohn who saw things little remembered them less and could not have described them at all beheld in his minds eye the garden of the lodge detailed as in a map he went to and fro in it feeling his terrors he saw the hollies the snowy borders the paths where he had sought alan the high conventual walls the shut doorwhat was the door shut ay truly he had shut itshut in his money his escape his future lifeshut it with these hands and none could now open it he heard the snap of the springlock like something bursting in his brain and sat astonied  and then he woke again terror jarring through his vitals this was no time to be idle he must be up and doing he must think once at the end of this ridiculous cruise once at the lodge door there would be nothing for it but to turn the cab and trundle back again why then go so far why add another feature of suspicion to a case already so suggestive why not turn at once it was easy to say turn but whither he had nowhere now to go to he could neverhe saw it in letters of bloodhe could never pay that cab he was saddled with that cab for ever o that cab his soul yearned to be rid of it he forgot all other cares he must first quit himself of this illsmelling vehicle and of the human beast that guided itfirst do that do that at least do that at once  and just then the cab suddenly stopped and there was his persecutor rapping on the front glass john let it down and beheld the portwine countenance flamed with intellectual triumph  i ken wha ye are cried the husky voice i mind ye now yere a nucholson i drove ye to hermiston to a christmas party and ye came back on the box and i let ye drive  it was a fact john knew the man they had been even friends his enemy he now remembered was a fellow of great goodnatureendless goodnaturewith a boy why not with a man why not appeal to his better side he grasped at the new hope  great scott and so you did he cried as if in a transport of delight his voice sounding false in his own ears well if thats so ive something to say to you ill just get out i guess where are we any way  the driver had fluttered his ticket in the eyes of the branch tollkeeper and they were now brought to on the highest and most solitary part of the byroad on the left a row of fieldside trees beshaded it on the right it was bordered by naked fallows undulating downhill to the queensferry road in front corstorphine hill raised its snowbedabbled darkling woods against the sky john looked all about him drinking the clear air like wine then his eyes returned to the cabmans face as he sat not ungleefully awaiting johns communication with the air of one looking to be tipped  the features of that face were hard to read drink had so swollen them drink had so painted them in tints that varied from brickred to mulberry the small grey eyes blinked the lips moved with greed greed was the ruling passion and though there was some goodnature some genuine kindliness a true human touch in the old toper his greed was now so set afire by hope that all other traits of character lay dormant he sat there a monument of gluttonous desire  johns heart slowly fell he had opened his lips but he stood there and uttered nought he sounded the well of his courage and it was dry he groped in his treasury of words and it was vacant a devil of dumbness had him by the throat a devil of terror babbled in his ears and suddenly without a word uttered with no conscious purpose formed in his will john whipped about tumbled over the roadside wall and began running for his life across the fallows  he had not gone far he was not past the midst of the first field when his whole brain thundered within him fool you have your watch the shock stopped him and he faced once more towards the cab the driver was leaning over the wall brandishing his whip his face empurpled roaring like a bull and john saw or thought that he had lost the chance no watch would pacify the mans resentment now he would cry for vengeance also john would be under the eye of the police his tale would be unfolded his secret plumbed his destiny would close on him at last and for ever  he uttered a deep sigh and just as the cabman taking heart of grace was beginning at last to scale the wall his defaulting customer fell again to running and disappeared into the farther fields     chapter viii  singular instance of the utility of passkeys   where he ran at first john never very clearly knew nor yet how long a time elapsed ere he found himself in the byroad near the lodge of ravelston propped against the wall his lungs heaving like bellows his legs leadenheavy his mind possessed by one sole desireto lie down and be unseen he remembered the thick coverts round the quarryhole pond an untrodden corner of the world where he might surely find concealment till the night should fall thither he passed down the lane and when he came there behold he had forgotten the frost and the pond was alive with young people skating and the pondside coverts were thick with lookerson he looked on awhile himself there was one tall graceful maiden skating hand in hand with a youth on whom she bestowed her bright eyes perhaps too patently and it was strange with what anger john beheld her he could have broken forth in curses he could have stood there like a mortified tramp and shaken his fist and vented his gall upon her by the houror so he thought and the next moment his heart bled for the girl poor creature its little she knows he sighed let her enjoy herself while she can but was it possible when flora used to smile at him on the braid ponds she could have looked so fulsome to a sickhearted bystander  the thought of one quarry in his frozen wits suggested another and he plodded off towards craigleith a wind had sprung up out of the northwest it was cruel keen it dried him like a fire and racked his fingerjoints it brought clouds too pale swift hurrying clouds that blotted heaven and shed gloom upon the earth he scrambled up among the hazelled rubbishheaps that surround the cauldron of the quarry and lay flat upon the stones the wind searched close along the earth the stones were cutting and icy the bare hazels wailed about him and soon the air of the afternoon began to be vocal with those strange and dismal harpings that herald snow pain and misery turned in johns limbs to a harrowing impatience and blind desire of change now he would roll in his harsh lair and when the flints abraded him was almost pleased now he would crawl to the edge of the huge pit and look dizzily down he saw the spiral of the descending roadway the steep crags the clinging bushes the peppering of snowwreaths and far down in the bottom the diminished crane here no doubt was a way to end it but it somehow did not take his fancy  and suddenly he was aware that he was hungry ay even through the tortures of the cold even through the frosts of despair a gross desperate longing after food no matter what no matter how began to wake and spur him suppose he pawned his watch but no on christmas daythis was christmas daythe pawnshop would be closed suppose he went to the publichouse close by at blackhall and offered the watch which was worth ten pounds in payment for a meal of bread and cheese the incongruity was too remarkable the good folks would either put him to the door or only let him in to send for the police he turned his pockets out one after another some san francisco tramcar checks one cigar no lights the passkey to his fathers house a pockethandkerchief with just a touch of scent nomoney could be raised on none of these there was nothing for it but to starve and after all what mattered it that also was a door of exit  he crept close among the bushes the wind playing round him like a lash his clothes seemed thin as paper his joints burned his skin curdled on his bones he had a vision of a highlying cattledrive in california and the bed of a dried stream with one muddy pool by which the vaqueros had encamped splendid sun over all the big bonfire blazing the strips of cow browning and smoking on a skewer of wood how warm it was how savoury the steam of scorching meat and then again he remembered his manifold calamities and burrowed and wallowed in the sense of his disgrace and shame and next he was entering franks restaurant in montgomery street san francisco he had ordered a panstew and venison chops of which he was immoderately fond and as he sat waiting munroe the good attendant brought him a whiskypunch he saw the strawberries float on the delectable cup he heard the ice chink about the straws and then he woke again to his detested fate and found himself sitting humped together in a windy combe of quarryrefusedarkness thick about him thin flakes of snow lying here and there like rags of paper and the strong shuddering of his body clashing his teeth like a hiccough  we have seen john in nothing but the stormiest conditions we have seen him reckless desperate tried beyond his moderate powers of his daily self cheerful regular not unthrifty we have seen nothing and it may thus be a surprise to the reader to learn that he was studiously careful of his health this favourite preoccupation now awoke if he were to sit there and die of cold there would be mighty little gained better the police cell and the chances of a jury trial than the miserable certainty of death at a dykeside before the next winters dawn or death a little later in the gaslit wards of an infirmary  he rose on aching legs and stumbled here and there among the rubbishheaps still circumvented by the yawning crater of the quarry or perhaps he only thought so for the darkness was already dense the snow was growing thicker and he moved like a blind man and with a blind mans terrors at last he climbed a fence thinking to drop into the road and found himself staggering instead among the iron furrows of a ploughland endless it seemed as a whole county and next he was in a wood beating among young trees and then he was aware of a house with many lighted windows christmas carriages waiting at the doors and christmas drivers for christmas has a double edge becoming swiftly hooded with snow from this glimpse of human cheerfulness he fled like cain wandered in the night unpiloted careless of whither he went fell and lay and then rose again and wandered farther and at last like a transformation scene behold him in the lighted jaws of the city staring at a lamp which had already donned the tilted nightcap of the snow it came thickly now a feeding storm and while he yet stood blinking at the lamp his feet were buried he remembered something like it in the past a street lamp crowned and caked upon the windward side with snow the wind uttering its mournful hoot himself looking on even as now but the cold had struck too sharply on his wits and memory failed him as to the date and sequel of the reminiscence  his next conscious moment was on the dean bridge but whether he was john nicholson of a bank in california street or some former john a clerk in his fathers office he had now clean forgotten another blank and he was thrusting his passkey into the doorlock of his fathers house  hours must have passed whether crouched on the cold stones or wandering in the fields among the snow was more than he could tell but hours had passed the finger of the hall clock was close on twelve a narrow peep of gas in the halllamp shed shadows and the door of the back roomhis fathers roomwas open and emitted a warm light at so late an hour all this was strange the lights should have been out the doors locked the good folk safe in bed he marvelled at the irregularity leaning on the hall table and marvelled to himself there and thawed and grew once more hungry in the warmer air of the house  the clock uttered its premonitory catch in five minutes christmas day would be among the days of the pastchristmaswhat a christmas well there was no use waiting he had come into that house he scarce knew how if they were to thrust him forth again it had best be done at once and he moved to the door of the back room and entered  o wellthen he was insane as he had long believed  there in his fathers room at midnight the fire was roaring and the gas blazing the papers the sacred papersto lay a hand on which was criminalhad all been taken off and piled along the floor a cloth was spread and a supper laid upon the business table and in his fathers chair a woman habited like a nun sat eating as he appeared in the doorway the nun rose gave a low cry and stood staring she was a large woman strong calm a little masculine her features marked with courage and good sense and as john blinked back at her a faint resemblance dodged about his memory as when a tune haunts us and yet will not be recalled  why its john cried the nun  i daresay im mad said john unconsciously following king lear but upon my word i do believe youre flora  of course i am replied she  and yet it is not flora at all thought john flora was slender and timid and of changing colour and dewyeyed and had flora such an edinburgh accent but he said none of these things which was perhaps as well what he said was then why are you a nun  such nonsense said flora im a sicknurse and i am here nursing your sister with whom between you and me there is precious little the matter but that is not the question the point is how do you come here and are you not ashamed to show yourself  flora said john sepulchrally i havent eaten anything for three days or at least i dont know what day it is but i guess im starving  you unhappy man she cried here sit down and eat my supper and ill just run upstairs and see my patient not but what i doubt shes fast asleep for maria is a malade imadginaire  with this specimen of the french not of stratfordattebowe but of a finishing establishment in moray place she left john alone in his fathers sanctum he fell at once upon the food and it is to be supposed that flora had found her patient wakeful and been detained with some details of nursing for he had time to make a full end of all there was to eat and not only to empty the teapot but to fill it again from a kettle that was fitfully singing on his fathers fire then he sat torpid and pleased and bewildered his misfortunes were then half forgotten his mind considering not without regret this unsentimental return to his old love  he was thus engaged when that bustling woman noiselessly reentered  have you eaten said she then tell me all about it  it was a long and as the reader knows a pitiful story but flora heard it with compressed lips she was lost in none of those questionings of human destiny that have from time to time arrested the flight of my own pen for women such as she are no philosophers and behold the concrete only and women such as she are very hard on the imperfect man  very well said she when he had done then down upon your knees at once and beg gods forgiveness  and the great baby plumped upon his knees and did as he was bid and none the worse for that but while he was heartily enough requesting forgiveness on general principles the rational side of him distinguished and wondered if perhaps the apology were not due upon the other part and when he rose again from that becoming exercise he first eyed the face of his old love doubtfully and then taking heart uttered his protest  i must say flora said he in all this business i can see very little fault of mine  if you had written home replied the lady there would have been none of it if you had even gone to murrayfield reasonably sober you would never have slept there and the worst would not have happened besides the whole thing began years ago you got into trouble and when your father honest man was disappointed you took the pet or got afraid and ran away from punishment well youve had your own way of it john and i dont suppose you like it  i sometimes fancy im not much better than a fool sighed john  my dear john said she not much  he looked at her and his eye fell a certain anger rose within him here was a flora he disowned she was hard she was of a set colour a settled mature undecorative manner plain of speech plain of habithe had come near saying plain of face and this changeling called herself by the same name as the manycoloured clinging maid of yore she of the frequent laughter and the many sighs and the kind stolen glances and to make all worse she took the upper hand with him which as john well knew was not the true relation of the sexes he steeled his heart against this sicknurse  and how do you come to be here he asked  she told him how she had nursed her father in his long illness and when he died and she was left alone had taken to nurse others partly from habit partly to be of some service in the world partly it might be for amusement theres no accounting for taste said she and she told him how she went largely to the houses of old friends as the need arose and how she was thus doubly welcome as an old friend first and then as an experienced nurse to whom doctors would confide the gravest case  and indeed its a mere farce my being here for poor maria she continued but your father takes her ailments to heart and i cannot always be refusing him we are great friends your father and i he was very kind to me long agoten years ago  a strange stir came in johns heart all this while had he been thinking only of himself all this while why had he not written to flora in penitential tenderness he took her hand and to his awe and trouble it remained in his compliant a voice told him this was flora after alltold him so quietly yet with a thrill of singing  and you never married said he  no john i never married she replied  the hall clock striking two recalled them to the sense of time  and now said she you have been fed and warmed and i have heard your story and now its high time to call your brother  o cried john chapfallen do you think that absolutely necessary  i cant keep you here i am a stranger said she do you want to run away again i thought you had enough of that  he bowed his head under the reproof she despised him he reflected as he sat once more alone a monstrous thing for a woman to despise a man and strangest of all she seemed to like him would his brother despise him too and would his brother like him  and presently the brother appeared under floras escort and standing afar off beside the doorway eyed the hero of this tale  so this is you he said at length  yes alick its meits john replied the elder brother feebly  and how did you get in here inquired the younger  o i had my passkey says john  the deuce you had said alexander ah you lived in a better world there are no passkeys going now  well father was always averse to them sighed john and the conversation then broke down and the brothers looked askance at one another in silence  well and what the devil are we to do said alexander i suppose if the authorities got wind of you you would be taken up  it depends on whether theyve found the body or not returned john and then theres that cabman to be sure  o bother the body said alexander i mean about the other thing thats serious  is that what my father spoke about asked john i dont even know what it is  about your robbing your bank in california of course replied alexander  it was plain from floras face that this was the first she had heard of it it was plainer still from johns that he was innocent  i he exclaimed i rob my bank my god flora this is too much even you must allow that  meaning you didnt asked alexander  i never robbed a soul in all my days cried john except my father if you call that robbery and i brought him back the money in this room and he wouldnt even take it  look here john said his brother let us have no misunderstanding upon this macewen saw my father he told him a bank you had worked for in san francisco was wiring over the habitable globe to have you collaredthat it was supposed you had nailed thousands and it was dead certain you had nailed three hundred so macewen said and i wish you would be careful how you answer i may tell you also that your father paid the three hundred on the spot  three hundred repeated john three hundred pounds you mean thats fifteen hundred dollars why then its kirkman he broke out thank heaven i can explain all that i gave them to kirkman to pay for me the night before i leftfifteen hundred dollars and a letter to the manager what do they suppose i would steal fifteen hundred dollars for im rich i struck it rich in stocks its the silliest stuff i ever heard of all thats needful is to cable to the manager kirkman has the fifteen hundredfind kirkman he was a fellowclerk of mine and a hard case but to do him justice i didnt think he was as hard as this  and what do you say to that alick asked flora  i say the cablegram shall go tonight cried alexander with energy answer prepaid too if this can be cleared awayand upon my word i do believe it canwe shall all be able to hold up our heads again here you john you stick down the address of your bank manager you flora you can pack john into my bed for which i have no further use tonight as for me i am off to the postoffice and thence to the high street about the dead body the police ought to know you see and they ought to know through john and i can tell them some rigmarole about my brother being a man of a highly nervous organisation and the rest of it and then ill tell you what johndid you notice the name upon the cab  john gave the name of the driver which as i have not been able to commend the vehicle i here suppress  well resumed alexander ill call round at their place before i come back and pay your shot for you in that way before breakfasttime youll be as good as new  john murmured inarticulate thanks to see his brother thus energetic in his service moved him beyond expression if he could not utter what he felt he showed it legibly in his face and alexander read it there and liked it the better in that dumb delivery  but theres one thing said the latter cablegrams are dear and i daresay you remember enough of the governor to guess the state of my finances  the trouble is said john that all my stamps are in that beastly house  all your what asked alexander  stampsmoney explained john its an american expression im afraid i contracted one or two  i have some said flora i have a poundnote upstairs  my dear flora returned alexander a poundnote wont see us very far and besides this is my fathers business and i shall be very much surprised if it isnt my father who pays for it  i would not apply to him yet i do not think that can be wise objected flora  you have a very imperfect idea of my resources and none at all of my effrontery replied alexander please observe  he put john from his way chose a stout knife among the supper things and with surprising quickness broke into his fathers drawer  theres nothing easier when you come to try he observed pocketing the money  i wish you had not done that said flora you will never hear the last of it  o i dont know returned the young man the governor is human after all and now john let me see your famous passkey get into bed and dont move for any one till i come back they wont mind you not answering when they knock i generally dont myself     chapter ix  in which mr nicholson concedes the principle of an allowance   in spite of the horrors of the day and the teadrinking of the night john slept the sleep of infancy he was wakened by the maid as it might have been ten years ago tapping at the door the winter sunrise was painting the east and as the window was to the back of the house it shone into the room with many strange colours of refracted light without the houses were all cleanly roofed with snow the garden walls were coped with it a foot in height the greens lay glittering yet strange as snow had grown to john during his years upon the bay of san francisco it was what he saw within that most affected him for it was to his own room that alexander had been promoted there was the old paper with the device of flowers in which a cunning fancy might yet detect the face of skinny jim of the academy johns former dominie there was the old chest of drawers there were the chairsone two threethree as before only the carpet was new and the litter of alexanders clothes and books and drawing materials and a pencildrawing on the wall which in johns eyes appeared a marvel of proficiency  he was thus lying and looking and dreaming hanging as it were between two epochs of his life when alexander came to the door and made his presence known in a loud whisper john let him in and jumped back into the warm bed  well john said alexander the cablegram is sent in your name and twenty words of answer paid i have been to the cab office and paid your cab even saw the old gentleman himself and properly apologised he was mighty placable and indicated his belief you had been drinking then i knocked up old macewen out of bed and explained affairs to him as he sat and shivered in a dressinggown and before that i had been to the high street where they have heard nothing of your dead body so that i incline to the idea that you dreamed it  catch me said john  well the police never do know anything assented alexander and at any rate they have despatched a man to inquire and to recover your trousers and your money so that really your bill is now fairly clean and i see but one lion in your paththe governor  ill be turned out again youll see said john dismally  i dont imagine so returned the other not if you do what flora and i have arranged and your business now is to dress and lose no time about it is your watch right well you have a quarter of an hour by five minutes before the halfhour you must be at table in your old seat under uncle duthies picture flora will be there to keep you countenance and we shall see what we shall see  wouldnt it be wiser for me to stay in bed said john  if you mean to manage your own concerns you can do precisely what you like replied alexander but if you are not in your place five minutes before the halfhour i wash my hands of you for one  and thereupon he departed he had spoken warmly but the truth is his heart was somewhat troubled and as he hung over the banisters watching for his father to appear he had hard ado to keep himself braced for the encounter that must follow  if he takes it well i shall be lucky he reflected if he takes it ill why itll be a herring across johns tracks and perhaps all for the best hes a confounded muff this brother of mine but he seems a decent soul  at that stage a door opened below with a certain emphasis and mr nicholson was seen solemnly to descend the stairs and pass into his own apartment alexander followed quaking inwardly but with a steady face he knocked was bidden to enter and found his father standing in front of the forced drawer to which he pointed as he spoke  this is a most extraordinary thing said he i have been robbed  i was afraid you would notice it observed his son it made such a beastly hash of the table  you were afraid i would notice it repeated mr nicholson and pray what may that mean  that i was the thief sir returned alexander i took all the money in case the servants should get hold of it and here is the change and a note of my expenditure you were gone to bed you see and i did not feel at liberty to knock you up but i think when you have heard the circumstances you will do me justice the fact is i have reason to believe there has been some dreadful error about my brother john the sooner it could be cleared up the better for all parties it was a piece of business sirand so i took it and decided on my own responsibility to send a telegram to san francisco thanks to my quickness we may hear tonight there appears to be no doubt sir that john has been abominably used  when did this take place asked the father  last night sir after you were asleep was the reply  its most extraordinary said mr nicholson do you mean to say you have been out all night  all night as you say sir i have been to the telegraph and the police office and mr macewens o i had my hands full said alexander  very irregular said the father you think of no one but yourself  i do not see that i have much to gain in bringing back my elder brother returned alexander shrewdly  the answer pleased the old man he smiled well well i will go into this after breakfast said he  im sorry about the table said the son  the table is a small matter i think nothing of that said the father  its another example continued the son of the awkwardness of a man having no money of his own if i had a proper allowance like other fellows of my age this would have been quite unnecessary  a proper allowance repeated his father in tones of blighting sarcasm for the expression was not new to him i have never grudged you money for any proper purpose  no doubt no doubt said alexander but then you see you arent always on the spot to have the thing explained to you last night for instance  you could have wakened me last night interrupted his father  was it not some similar affair that first got john into a mess asked the son skilfully evading the point  but the father was not less adroit and pray sir how did you come and go out of the house he asked  i forgot to lock the door it seems replied alexander  i have had cause to complain of that too often said mr nicholson but still i do not understand did you keep the servants up  i propose to go into all that at length after breakfast returned alexander there is the halfhour going we must not keep miss mackenzie waiting  and greatly daring he opened the door  even alexander who it must have been perceived was on terms of comparative freedom with his parenteven alexander had never before dared to cut short an interview in this highhanded fashion but the truth is the very mass of his sons delinquencies daunted the old gentleman he was like the man with the cart of applesthis was beyond him that alexander should have spoiled his table taken his money stayed out all night and then coolly acknowledged all was something undreamed of in the nicholsonian philosophy and transcended comment the return of the change which the old gentleman still carried in his hand had been a feature of imposing impudence it had dealt him a staggering blow then there was the reference to johns original flighta subject which he always kept resolutely curtained in his own mind for he was a man who loved to have made no mistakes and when he feared he might have made one kept the papers sealed in view of all these surprises and reminders and of his sons composed and masterful demeanour there began to creep on mr nicholson a sickly misgiving he seemed beyond his depth if he did or said anything he might come to regret it the young man besides as he had pointed out himself was playing a generous part and if wrong had been doneand done to one who was after and in spite of all a nicholsonit should certainly be righted  all things considered monstrous as it was to be cut short in his inquiries the old gentleman submitted pocketed the change and followed his son into the diningroom during these few steps he once more mentally revolted and once more and this time finally laid down his arms a still small voice in his bosom having informed him authentically of a piece of news that he was afraid of alexander the strange thing was that he was pleased to be afraid of him he was proud of his son he might be proud of him the boy had character and grit and knew what he was doing  these were his reflections as he turned the corner of the diningroom door miss mackenzie was in the place of honour conjuring with a teapot and a cosy and behold there was another person present a large portly whiskered man of a very comfortable and respectable air who now rose from his seat and came forward holding out his hand  goodmorning father said he  of the contention of feeling that ran high in mr nicholsons starched bosom no outward sign was visible nor did he delay long to make a choice of conduct yet in that interval he had reviewed a great field of possibilities both past and future whether it was possible he had not been perfectly wise in his treatment of john whether it was possible that john was innocent whether if he turned john out a second time as his outraged authority suggested it was possible to avoid a scandal and whether if he went to that extremity it was possible that alexander might rebel  hum said mr nicholson and put his hand limp and dead into johns  and then in an embarrassed silence all took their places and even the paperfrom which it was the old gentlemans habit to suck mortification daily as he marked the decline of our institutionseven the paper lay furled by his side  but presently flora came to the rescue she slid into the silence with a technicality asking if john still took his old inordinate amount of sugar thence it was but a step to the burning question of the day and in tones a little shaken she commented on the interval since she had last made tea for the prodigal and congratulated him on his return and then addressing mr nicholson she congratulated him also in a manner that defied his illhumour and from that launched into the tale of johns misadventures not without some suitable suppressions  gradually alexander joined between them whether he would or no they forced a word or two from john and these fell so tremulously and spoke so eloquently of a mind oppressed with dread that mr nicholson relented at length even he contributed a question and before the meal was at an end all four were talking even freely  prayers followed with the servants gaping at this newcomer whom no one had admitted and after prayers there came that moment on the clock which was the signal for mr nicholsons departure  john said he of course you will stay here be very careful not to excite maria if miss mackenzie thinks it desirable that you should see heralexander i wish to speak with you alone and then when they were both in the backroom you need not come to the office today said he you can stay and amuse your brother and i think it would be respectful to call on uncle greig and bytheby this spoken with a certaindare we saybashfulness i agree to concede the principle of an allowance and i will consult dr durie who is quite a man of the world and has sons of his own as to the amount and my fine fellow you may consider yourself in luck he added with a smile  thank you said alexander   before noon a detective had restored to john his money and brought news sad enough in truth but perhaps the least sad possible alan houston had been found in his own house in regent terrace under care of the terrified butler he was quite mad and instead of going to prison had been taken to morningside asylum the murdered man it appeared was an evicted tenant who had for nearly a year pursued his late landlord with threats and insults and beyond this the cause and details of the tragedy were lost  when mr nicholson returned for dinner they were able to put a despatch into his handsjohn v nicholson randolph crescent edinburghkirkman has disappeared police looking for him all understood keep mind quite easyaustin having had this explained to him the old gentleman took down the cellar key and departed for two bottles of the 1820 port uncle greig dined there that day and cousin robina and by an odd chance mr macewen and the presence of these strangers relieved what might have been otherwise a somewhat strained relation ere they departed the family was welded once more into a fair semblance of unity  in the end of april john led floraor let us say as more descriptive flora led johnto the altar if altar that may be called which was indeed the drawingroom mantelpiece in mr nicholsons house the reverend dr durie posted on the hearthrug in the guise of hymens priest  the last i saw of them on a recent visit to the north was at a dinnerparty in the house of my old friend gellatly macbride and after we had in classic phrase rejoined the ladies i had an opportunity to overhear flora conversing with another married woman on the much canvassed matter of a husbands tobacco  o yes said she i only allow mr nicholson four cigars a day three he smokes at fixed timesafter a meal you know my dear and the fourth he can take when he likes with any friend  bravo thought i to myself this is the wife for my friend john     kidnapped    being memoirs of the adventures of david balfour    in the year 1751 how he was kidnapped and cast away his sufferings in   a desert isle his journey in the wild highlands his acquaintance   with alan breck stewart and other notorious highland jacobites with   all that he suffered at the hands of his uncle ebenezer balfour of   shaws falsely socalled written by himself and now set forth by   robert louis stevenson     dedication   my dear charles baxter  if you ever read this tale you will likely ask yourself more questions than i should care to answer as for instance how the appin murder has come to fall in the year 1751 how the torran rocks have crept so near to earraid or why the printed trial is silent as to all that touches david balfour these are nuts beyond my ability to crack but if you tried me on the point of alans guilt or innocence i think i could defend the reading of the text to this day you will find the tradition of appin clear in alans favour if you inquire you may even hear that the descendants of the other man who fired the shot are in the country to this day but that other mans name inquire as you please you shall not hear for the highlander values a secret for itself and for the congenial exercise of keeping it i might go on for long to justify one point and own another indefensible it is more honest to confess at once how little i am touched by the desire of accuracy this is no furniture for the scholars library but a book for the winter evening schoolroom when the tasks are over and the hour for bed draws near and honest alan who was a grim old fireeater in his day has in this new avatar no more desperate purpose than to steal some young gentlemans attention from his ovid carry him a while into the highlands and the last century and pack him to bed with some engaging images to mingle with his dreams  as for you my dear charles i do not even ask you to like this tale but perhaps when he is older your son will he may then be pleased to find his fathers name on the flyleaf and in the mean while it pleases me to set it there in memory of many days that were happy and some now perhaps as pleasant to remember that were sad if it is strange for me to look back from a distance both in time and space on these bygone adventures of our youth it must be stranger for you who tread the same streetswho may tomorrow open the door of the old speculative where we begin to rank with scott and robert emmet and the beloved and inglorious macbeanor may pass the corner of the close where that great society the l j r held its meetings and drank its beer sitting in the seats of burns and his companions i think i see you moving there by plain daylight beholding with your natural eyes those places that have now become for your companion a part of the scenery of dreams how in the intervals of present business the past must echo in your memory let it not echo often without some kind thoughts of your friend                                                      r l s   skerryvore     bournemouth     kidnapped  chapter i  i set off upon my journey to the house of shaws   i will begin the story of my adventures with a certain morning early in the month of june the year of grace 1751 when i took the key for the last time out of the door of my fathers house the sun began to shine upon the summit of the hills as i went down the road and by the time i had come as far as the manse the blackbirds were whistling in the garden lilacs and the mist that hung around the valley in the time of the dawn was beginning to arise and die away  mr campbell the minister of essendean was waiting for me by the garden gate good man he asked me if i had breakfasted and hearing that i lacked for nothing he took my hand in both of his and clapped it kindly under his arm  well davie lad said he i will go with you as far as the ford to set you on the way  and we began to walk forward in silence  are ye sorry to leave essendean said he after a while  why sir said i if i knew where i was going or what was likely to become of me i would tell you candidly essendean is a good place indeed and i have been very happy there but then i have never been anywhere else my father and mother since they are both dead i shall be no nearer to in essendean than in the kingdom of hungary and to speak truth if i thought i had a chance to better myself where i was going i would go with a good will  ay said mr campbell very well davie then it behoves me to tell your fortune or so far as i may when your mother was gone and your father the worthy christian man began to sicken for his end he gave me in charge a certain letter which he said was your inheritance so soon says he as i am gone and the house is redd up and the gear disposed of all which davie hath been done give my boy this letter into his hand and start him off to the house of shaws not far from cramond that is the place i came from he said and its where it befits that my boy should return he is a steady lad your father said and a canny goer and i doubt not he will come safe and be well liked where he goes  the house of shaws i cried what had my poor father to do with the house of shaws  nay said mr campbell who can tell that for a surety but the name of that family davie boy is the name you bearbalfours of shaws an ancient honest reputable house peradventure in these latter days decayed your father too was a man of learning as befitted his position no man more plausibly conducted school nor had he the manner or the speech of a common dominie but as ye will yourself remember i took aye a pleasure to have him to the manse to meet the gentry and those of my own house campbell of kilrennet campbell of dunswire campbell of minch and others all wellkenned gentlemen had pleasure in his society lastly to put all the elements of this affair before you here is the testamentary letter itself superscrived by the own hand of our departed brother  he gave me the letter which was addressed in these words to the hands of ebenezer balfour esquire of shaws in his house of shaws these will be delivered by my son david balfour my heart was beating hard at this great prospect now suddenly opening before a lad of seventeen years of age the son of a poor country dominie in the forest of ettrick  mr campbell i stammered and if you were in my shoes would you go  of a surety said the minister that would i and without pause a pretty lad like you should get to cramond which is near in by edinburgh in two days of walk if the worst came to the worst and your high relations as i cannot but suppose them to be somewhat of your blood should put you to the door ye can but walk the two days back again and risp at the manse door but i would rather hope that ye shall be well received as your poor father forecast for you and for anything that i ken come to be a great man in time and here davie laddie he resumed it lies near upon my conscience to improve this parting and set you on the right guard against the dangers of the world  here he cast about for a comfortable seat lighted on a big boulder under a birch by the trackside sate down upon it with a very long serious upper lip and the sun now shining in upon us between two peaks put his pockethandkerchief over his cocked hat to shelter him there then with uplifted forefinger he first put me on my guard against a considerable number of heresies to which i had no temptation and urged upon me to be instant in my prayers and reading of the bible that done he drew a picture of the great house that i was bound to and how i should conduct myself with its inhabitants  be soople davie in things immaterial said he bear ye this in mind that though gentle born ye have had a country rearing dinna shame us davie dinna shame us in yon great muckle house with all these domestics upper and under show yourself as nice as circumspect as quick at the conception and as slow of speech as any as for the lairdremember hes the laird i say no more honour to whom honour its a pleasure to obey a laird or should be to the young  well sir said i it may be and ill promise you ill try to make it so  why very well said replied mr campbell heartily and now to come to the material or to make a quibble to the immaterial i have here a little packet which contains four things he tugged it as he spoke and with some great difficulty from the skirtpocket of his coat of these four things the first is your legal due the little pickle money for your fathers books and plenishing which i have bought as i have explained from the first in the design of reselling at a profit to the incoming dominie the other three are gifties that mrs campbell and myself would be blithe of your acceptance the first which is round will likely please ye best at the first offgo but o davie laddie its but a drop of water in the sea itll help you but a step and vanish like the morning the second which is flat and square and written upon will stand by you through life like a good staff for the road and a good pillow to your head in sickness and as for the last which is cubical thatll see you its my prayerful wish into a better land  with that he got upon his feet took off his hat and prayed a little while aloud and in affecting terms for a young man setting out into the world then suddenly took me in his arms and embraced me very hard then held me at arms length looking at me with his face all working with sorrow and then whipped about and crying goodbye to me set off backward by the way that we had come at a sort of jogging run it might have been laughable to another but i was in no mind to laugh i watched him as long as he was in sight and he never stopped hurrying nor once looked back then it came in upon my mind that this was all his sorrow at my departure and my conscience smote me hard and fast because i for my part was overjoyed to get away out of that quiet countryside and go to a great busy house among rich and respected gentlefolk of my own name and blood  davie davie i thought was ever seen such black ingratitude can you forget old favours and old friends at the mere whistle of a name fie fie think shame  and i sat down on the boulder the good man had just left and opened the parcel to see the nature of my gifts that which he had called cubical i had never had much doubt of sure enough it was a little bible to carry in a plaidneuk that which he had called round i found to be a shilling piece and the third which was to help me so wonderfully both in health and sickness all the days of my life was a little piece of coarse yellow paper written upon thus in red ink    to make lilly of the valley watertake the flowers of lilly of the   valley and distil them in sack and drink a spooneful or two as there   is occasion it restores speech to those that have the dumb palsey it   is good against the gout it comforts the heart and strengthens the   memory and the flowers put into a glasse close stopt and set into   ane hill of ants for a month then take it out and you will find a   liquor which comes from the flowers which keep in a vial it is good   ill or well and whether man or woman  and then in the ministers own hand was added    likewise for sprains rub it in and for the cholic a great   spooneful in the hour  to be sure i laughed over this but it was rather tremulous laughter and i was glad to get my bundle on my staffs end and set out over the ford and up the hill upon the farther side till just as i came on the green droveroad running wide through the heather i took my last look of kirk essendean the trees about the manse and the big rowans in the kirkyard where my father and my mother lay     chapter ii  i come to my journeys end   on the forenoon of the second day coming to the top of a hill i saw all the country fall away before me down to the sea and in the midst of this descent on a long ridge the city of edinburgh smoking like a kiln there was a flag upon the castle and ships moving or lying anchored in the firth both of which for as far away as they were i could distinguish clearly and both brought my country heart into my mouth  presently after i came by a house where a shepherd lived and got a rough direction for the neighbourhood of cramond and so from one to another worked my way to the westward of the capital by colinton till i came out upon the glasgow road and there to my great pleasure and wonder i beheld a regiment marching to the fifes every foot in time an old redfaced general on a grey horse at the one end and at the other the company of grenadiers with their popeshats the pride of life seemed to mount into my brain at the sight of the red coats and the hearing of that merry music  a little farther on and i was told i was in cramond parish and began to substitute in my inquiries the name of the house of shaws it was a word that seemed to surprise those of whom i sought my way at first i thought the plainness of my appearance in my country habit and that all dusty from the road consorted ill with the greatness of the place to which i was bound but after two or maybe three had given me the same look and the same answer i began to take it into my head there was something strange about the shaws itself  the better to set this fear at rest i changed the form of my inquiries and spying an honest fellow coming along a lane on the shaft of his cart i asked him if he had ever heard tell of a house they called the house of shaws  he stopped his cart and looked at me like the others  ay said he what for  its a great house i asked  doubtless says he the house is a big muckle house  ay said i but the folk that are in it  folk cried he are ye daft theres nae folk thereto call folk  what say i not mr ebenezer  ou ay says the man theres the laird to be sure if its him youre wanting whatll like be your business mannie  i was led to think that i would get a situation i said looking as modest as i could  what cries the carter in so sharp a note that his very horse started and then well mannie he added its nane of my affairs but ye seem a decentspoken lad and if yell take a word from me yell keep clear of the shaws  the next person i came across was a dapper little man in a beautiful white wig whom i saw to be a barber on his rounds and knowing well that barbers were great gossips i asked him plainly what sort of a man was mr balfour of the shaws  hoot hoot hoot said the barber nae kind of a man nae kind of a man at all and began to ask me very shrewdly what my business was but i was more than a match for him at that and he went on to his next customer no wiser than he came  i cannot well describe the blow this dealt to my illusions the more indistinct the accusations were the less i liked them for they left the wider field to fancy what kind of a great house was this that all the parish should start and stare to be asked the way to it or what sort of a gentleman that his illfame should be thus current on the wayside if an hours walking would have brought me back to essendean i had left my adventure then and there and returned to mr campbells but when i had come so far a way already mere shame would not suffer me to desist till i had put the matter to the touch of proof i was bound out of mere selfrespect to carry it through and little as i liked the sound of what i heard and slow as i began to travel i still kept asking my way and still kept advancing  it was drawing on to sundown when i met a stout dark sourlooking woman coming trudging down a hill and she when i had put my usual question turned sharp about accompanied me back to the summit she had just left and pointed to a great bulk of building standing very bare upon a green in the bottom of the next valley the country was pleasant round about running in low hills pleasantly watered and wooded and the crops to my eyes wonderfully good but the house itself appeared to be a kind of ruin no road led up to it no smoke arose from any of the chimneys nor was there any semblance of a garden my heart sank that i cried  the womans face lit up with a malignant anger that is the house of shaws she cried blood built it blood stopped the building of it blood shall bring it down see here she cried againi spit upon the ground and crack my thumb at it black be its fall if ye see the laird tell him what ye hear tell him this makes the twelve hunner and nineteen time that jennet clouston has called down the curse on him and his house byre and stable man guest and master wife miss or bairnblack black be their fall  and the woman whose voice had risen to a kind of eldritch singsong turned with a skip and was gone i stood where she left me with my hair on end in those days folk still believed in witches and trembled at a curse and this one falling so pat like a wayside omen to arrest me ere i carried out my purpose took the pith out of my legs  i sat me down and stared at the house of shaws the more i looked the pleasanter that countryside appeared being all set with hawthorn bushes full of flowers the fields dotted with sheep a fine flight of rooks in the sky and every sign of a kind soil and climate and yet the barrack in the midst of it went sore against my fancy  countryfolk went by from the fields as i sat there on the side of the ditch but i lacked the spirit to give them a goodeen at last the sun went down and then right up against the yellow sky i saw a scroll of smoke go mounting not much thicker as it seemed to me than the smoke of a candle but still there it was and meant a fire and warmth and cookery and some living inhabitant that must have lit it and this comforted my heart  so i set forward by a little faint track in the grass that led in my direction it was very faint indeed to be the only way to a place of habitation yet i saw no other presently it brought me to stone uprights with an unroofed lodge beside them and coats of arms upon the top a main entrance it was plainly meant to be but never finished instead of gates of wroughtiron a pair of hurdles were tied across with a straw rope and as there were no park walls nor any sign of avenue the track that i was following passed on the right hand of the pillars and went wandering on toward the house  the nearer i got to that the drearier it appeared it seemed like the one wing of a house that had never been finished what should have been the inner end stood open on the upper floors and showed against the sky with steps and stairs of uncompleted masonry many of the windows were unglazed and bats flew in and out like doves out of a dovecote  the night had begun to fall as i got close and in three of the lower windows which were very high up and narrow and well barred the changing light of a little fire began to glimmer  was this the palace i had been coming to was it within these walls that i was to seek new friends and begin great fortunes why in my fathers house on essenwaterside the fire and the bright lights would show a mile away and the door open to a beggars knock  i came forward cautiously and giving ear as i came heard some one rattling with dishes and a little dry eager cough that came in fits but there was no sound of speech and not a dog barked  the door as well as i could see it in the dim light was a great piece of wood all studded with nails and i lifted my hand with a faint heart under my jacket and knocked once then i stood and waited the house had fallen into a dead silence a whole minute passed away and nothing stirred but the bats overhead i knocked again and hearkened again by this time my ears had grown so accustomed to the quiet that i could hear the ticking of the clock inside as it slowly counted out the seconds but whoever was in that house kept deadly still and must have held his breath  i was in two minds whether to run away but anger got the upper hand and i began instead to rain kicks and buffets on the door and to shout out aloud for mr balfour i was in full career when i heard the cough right overhead and jumping back and looking up beheld a mans head in a tall nightcap and the bell mouth of a blunderbuss at one of the firststory windows  its loaded said a voice  i have come here with a letter i said to mr ebenezer balfour of shaws is he here  from whom is it asked the man with the blunderbuss  that is neither here nor there said i for i was growing very wroth  well was the reply ye can put it down upon the doorstep and be off with ye  i will do no such thing i cried i will deliver it into mr balfours hands as it was meant i should it is a letter of introduction  a what cried the voice sharply  i repeated what i had said  who are ye yourself was the next question after a considerable pause  i am not ashamed of my name said i they call me david balfour  at that i made sure the man started for i heard the blunderbuss rattle on the windowsill and it was after quite a long pause and with a curious change of voice that the next question followed  is your father dead  i was so much surprised at this that i could find no voice to answer but stood staring  ay the man resumed hell be dead no doubt and thatll be what brings ye chapping to my door another pause and then defiantly well man he said ill let ye in and he disappeared from the window     chapter iii  i make acquaintance of my uncle   presently there came a great rattling of chains and bolts and the door was cautiously opened and shut to again behind me as soon as i had passed  go into the kitchen and touch naething said the voice and while the person of the house set himself to replacing the defences of the door i groped my way forward and entered the kitchen  the fire had burned up fairly bright and showed me the barest room i think i ever put my eyes on halfadozen dishes stood upon the shelves the table was laid for supper with a bowl of porridge a horn spoon and a cup of small beer besides what i have named there was not another thing in that great stonevaulted empty chamber but lockfast chests arranged along the wall and a cornercupboard with a padlock  as soon as the last chain was up the man rejoined me he was a mean stooping narrowshouldered clayfaced creature and his age might have been anything between fifty and seventy his nightcap was of flannel and so was the nightgown that he wore instead of coat and waistcoat over his ragged shirt he was long unshaved but what most distressed and even daunted me he would neither take his eyes away from me nor look me fairly in the face what he was whether by trade or birth was more than i could fathom but he seemed most like an old unprofitable servingman who should have been left in charge of that big house upon board wages  are ye sharpset he asked glancing at about the level of my knee ye can eat that drop parritch  i said i feared it was his own supper  o said he i can do fine wanting it ill take the ale though for it slockens1 my cough he drank the cup about half out still keeping an eye upon me as he drank and then suddenly held out his hand lets see the letter said he  i told him the letter was for mr balfour not for him  and who do ye think i am says he give me alexanders letter  you know my fathers name  it would be strange if i didna he returned for he was my born brother and little as ye seem to like either me or my house or my good parritch im your born uncle davie my man and you my born nephew so give us the letter and sit down and fill your kyte  if i had been some years younger what with shame weariness and disappointment i believe i had burst into tears as it was i could find no words neither black nor white but handed him the letter and sat down to the porridge with as little appetite for meat as ever a young man had  meanwhile my uncle stooping over the fire turned the letter over and over in his hands  do ye ken whats in it he asked suddenly  you see for yourself sir said i that the seal has not been broken  ay said he but what brought you here  to give the letter said i  no says he cunningly but yell have had some hopes nae doubt  i confess sir said i when i was told that i had kinsfolk welltodo i did indeed indulge the hope that they might help me in my life but i am no beggar i look for no favours at your hands and i want none that are not freely given for as poor as i appear i have friends of my own that will be blithe to help me  hoottoot said uncle ebenezer dinna fly up in the snuff at me well agree fine yet and davie my man if youre done with that bit parritch i could just take a sup of it myself ay he continued as soon as he had ousted me from the stool and spoon theyre fine halesome foodtheyre grand food parritch he murmured a little grace to himself and fellto your father was very fond of his meat i mind he was a hearty if not a great eater but as for me i could never do mair than pyke at food he took a pull at the small beer which probably reminded him of hospitable duties for his next speech ran thus if yere dry yell find water behind the door  to this i returned no answer standing stiffly on my two feet and looking down upon my uncle with a mighty angry heart he on his part continued to eat like a man under some pressure of time and to throw out little darting glances now at my shoes and now at my homespun stockings once only when he had ventured to look a little higher our eyes met and no thief taken with a hand in a mans pocket could have shown more lively signals of distress this set me in a muse whether his timidity arose from too long a disuse of any human company and whether perhaps upon a little trial it might pass off and my uncle change into an altogether different man from this i was awakened by his sharp voice  your fathers been long dead he asked  three weeks sir said i  he was a secret man alexandera secret silent man he continued he never said muckle when he was young hell never have spoken muckle of me  i never knew sir till you told it me yourself that he had any brother  dear me dear me said ebenezer nor yet of shaws i daresay  not so much as the name sir said i  to think o that said he a strange nature of a man for all that he seemed singularly satisfied but whether with himself or me or with this conduct of my fathers was more than i could read certainly however he seemed to be outgrowing that distaste or illwill that he had conceived at first against my person for presently he jumped up came across the room behind me and hit me a smack upon the shoulder well agree fine yet he cried im just as glad i let you in and now come awa to your bed  to my surprise he lit no lamp or candle but set forth into the dark passage groped his way breathing deeply up a flight of steps and paused before a door which he unlocked i was close upon his heels having stumbled after him as best i might and then he bade me go in for that was my chamber i did as he bid but paused after a few steps and begged a light to go to bed with  hoottoot said uncle ebenezer theres a fine moon  neither moon nor star sir and pitmirk2 said i i canna see the bed  hoottoot hoottoot said he lights in a house is a thing i dinna agree with im unco feared of fires goodnight to ye davie my man and before i had time to add a further protest he pulled the door to and i heard him lock me in from the outside  i did not know whether to laugh or cry the room was as cold as a well and the bed when i had found my way to it as damp as a peathag but by good fortune i had caught up my bundle and my plaid and rolling myself in the latter i lay down upon the floor under lee of the big bedstead and fell speedily asleep  with the first peep of day i opened my eyes to find myself in a great chamber hung with stamped leather furnished with fine embroidered furniture and lit by three fair windows ten years ago or perhaps twenty it must have been as pleasant a room to lie down or to awake in as a man could wish but damp dirt disuse and the mice and spiders had done their worst since then many of the windowpanes besides were broken and indeed this was so common a feature in that house that i believe my uncle must at some time have stood a siege from his indignant neighboursperhaps with jennet clouston at their head  meanwhile the sun was shining outside and being very cold in that miserable room i knocked and shouted till my gaoler came and let me out he carried me to the back of the house where was a drawwell and told me to wash my face there if i wanted and when that was done i made the best of my own way back to the kitchen where he had lit the fire and was making the porridge the table was laid with two bowls and two horn spoons but the same single measure of small beer perhaps my eye rested on this particular with some surprise and perhaps my uncle observed it for he spoke up as if in answer to my thought asking me if i would like to drink alefor so he called it  i told him such was my habit but not to put himself about  na na said he ill deny you nothing in reason  he fetched another cup from the shelf and then to my great surprise instead of drawing more beer he poured an accurate half from one cup to the other there was a kind of nobleness in this that took my breath away if my uncle was certainly a miser he was one of that thorough breed that goes near to make the vice respectable  when we had made an end of our meal my uncle ebenezer unlocked a drawer and drew out of it a clay pipe and a lump of tobacco from which he cut one fill before he locked it up again then he sat down in the sun at one of the windows and silently smoked from time to time his eyes came coasting round to me and he shot out one of his questions once it was and your mother and when i had told him that she too was dead ay she was a bonny lassie then after another long pause wha were these friends o yours  i told him they were different gentlemen of the name of campbell though indeed there was only one and that the minister that had ever taken the least note of me but i began to think my uncle made too light of my position and finding myself all alone with him i did not wish him to suppose me helpless  he seemed to turn this over in his mind and then davie my man said he yeve come to the right bit when ye came to your uncle ebenezer ive a great notion of the family and i mean to do the right by you but while im taking a bit think to mysel of whats the best thing to put you towhether the law or the meenistry or maybe the army whilk is what boys are fondest ofi wouldna like the balfours to be humbled before a wheen hieland campbells and ill ask you to keep your tongue within your teeth nae letters nae messages no kind of word to onybody or elsetheres my door  uncle ebenezer said i ive no manner of reason to suppose you mean anything but well by me for all that i would have you to know that i have a pride of my own it was by no will of mine that i came seeking you and if you show me your door again ill take you at the word  he seemed grievously put out hootstoots said he ca cannie manca cannie bide a day or two im nae warlock to find a fortune for you in the bottom of a parritchbowl but just you give me a day or two and say naething to naebody and as sure as sure ill do the right by you  very well said i enough said if you want to help me theres no doubt but ill be glad of it and none but ill be grateful  it seemed to me too soon i daresay that i was getting the upper hand of my uncle and i began next to say that i must have the bed and bedclothes aired and put to sundry for nothing would make me sleep in such a pickle  is this my house or yours said he in his keen voice and then all of a sudden broke off na na said he i did na mean that whats mine is yours davie my man and whats yours is mine bloods thicker than water and theres naebody but you and me that ought the name and then on he rambled about the family and its ancient greatness and his father that began to enlarge the house and himself that stopped the building as a sinful waste and this put it in my head to give him jennet cloustons message  the limmer he cried twelve hunner and fifteenthats every day since i had the limmer rowpit3 dod david ill have her roasted on red peats before im by with it a witcha proclaimed witch ill aff and see the sessionclerk  and with that he opened a chest and got out a very old and wellpreserved blue coat and waistcoat and a good enough beaver hat both without lace these he threw on anyway and taking a staff from the cupboard locked all up again and was for setting out when a thought arrested him  i canna leave you by yoursel in the house said he ill have to lock you out  the blood came to my face if you lock me out i said itll be the last youll see of me in friendship  he turned very pale and sucked his mouth in this is no the way he said looking wickedly at a corner of the floorthis is no the way to win my favour david  sir says i with a proper reverence for your age and our common blood i do not value your favour at a bodles purchase i was brought up to have a good conceit of myself and if you were all the uncle and all the family i had in the world ten times over i wouldnt buy your liking at such prices  uncle ebenezer went and looked out of the window for a while i could see him all trembling and twitching like a man with palsy but when he turned round he had a smile upon his face  well well said he we must bear and forbear ill no go thats all thats to be said of it  uncle ebenezer i said i can make nothing out of this you use me like a thief you hate to have me in this house you let me see it every word and every minute its not possible that you can like me and as for me ive spoken to you as i never thought to speak to any man why do you seek to keep me then let me gang backlet me gang back to the friends i have and that like me  na na na na he said very earnestly i like you fine well agree fine yet and for the honour of the house i couldna let you leave the way ye came bide here quiet theres a good lad just you bide here quiet a bittie and yell find that we agree  well sir said i after i had thought the matter out in silence ill stay a while its more just i should be helped by my own blood than strangers and if we dont agree ill do my best it shall be through no fault of mine   footnotes    1 moistens    2 dark as the pit    3 sold up     chapter iv  i run a great danger in the house of shaws   for a day that was begun so ill the day passed fairly well we had the porridge cold again at noon and hot porridge at night porridge and small beer was my uncles diet he spoke but little and that in the same way as before shooting a question at me after a long silence and when i sought to lead him in talk about my future slipped out of it again in a room next door to the kitchen where he suffered me to go i found a great number of books both latin and english in which i took great pleasure all the afternoon indeed the time passed so lightly in this good company that i began to be almost reconciled to my residence at shaws and nothing but the sight of my uncle and his eyes playing hide and seek with mine revived the force of my distrust  one thing i discovered which put me in some doubt this was an entry on the flyleaf of a chapbook one of patrick walkers plainly written by my fathers hand and thus conceived to my brother ebenezer on his fifth birthday now what puzzled me was this that as my father was of course the younger brother he must either have made some strange error or he must have written before he was yet five an excellent clear manly hand of writing  i tried to get this out of my head but though i took down many interesting authors old and new history poetry and storybook this notion of my fathers hand of writing stuck to me and when at length i went back into the kitchen and sat down once more to porridge and small beer the first thing i said to uncle ebenezer was to ask him if my father had not been very quick at his book  alexander no him was the reply i was far quicker mysel i was a clever chappie when i was young why i could read as soon as he could  this puzzled me yet more and a thought coming into my head i asked if he and my father had been twins  he jumped upon his stool and the horn spoon fell out of his hand upon the floor what gars ye ask that he said and he caught me by the breast of the jacket and looked this time straight into my eyes his own were little and light and bright like a birds blinking and winking strangely  what do you mean i asked very calmly for i was far stronger than he and not easily frightened take your hand from my jacket this is no way to behave  my uncle seemed to make a great effort upon himself dod man david he said ye shouldna speak to me about your father thats where the mistake is he sat a while and shook blinking in his plate he was all the brother that ever i had he added but with no heart in his voice and then he caught up his spoon and fell to supper again but still shaking  now this last passage this laying of hands upon my person and sudden profession of love for my dead father went so clean beyond my comprehension that it put me into both fear and hope on the one hand i began to think my uncle was perhaps insane and might be dangerous on the other there came up into my mind quite unbidden by me and even discouraged a story like some ballad i had heard folk singing of a poor lad that was a rightful heir and a wicked kinsman that tried to keep him from his own for why should my uncle play a part with a relative that came almost a beggar to his door unless in his heart he had some cause to fear him  with this notion all unacknowledged but nevertheless getting firmly settled in my head i now began to imitate his covert looks so that we sat at table like a cat and a mouse each stealthily observing the other not another word had he to say to me black or white but was busy turning something secretly over in his mind and the longer we sat and the more i looked at him the more certain i became that the something was unfriendly to myself  when he had cleared the platter he got out a single pipeful of tobacco just as in the morning turned round a stool into the chimneycorner and sat a while smoking with his back to me  davie he said at length ive been thinking then he paused and said it again theres a wee bit siller that i half promised ye before ye were born he continued promised it to your father o naething legal ye understand just gentlemen daffing at their wine well i keepit that bit money separateit was a great expense but a promise is a promiseand it has grown by now to be a maitter of just preciselyjust exactlyand here he paused and stumbledof just exactly forty pounds this last he rapped out with a sidelong glance over his shoulder and the next moment added almost with a scream scots  the pound scots being the same thing as an english shilling the difference made by this second thought was considerable i could see besides that the whole story was a lie invented with some end which it puzzled me to guess and i made no attempt to conceal the tone of raillery in which i answered  o think again sir pounds sterling i believe  thats what i said returned my uncle pounds sterling and if youll step outby to the door a minute just to see what kind of a night it is ill get it out to ye and call ye in again  i did his will smiling to myself in my contempt that he should think i was so easily to be deceived it was a dark night with a few stars low down and as i stood just outside the door i heard a hollow moaning of wind far off among the hills i said to myself there was something thundery and changeful in the weather and little knew of what a vast importance that should prove to me before the evening passed  when i was called in again my uncle counted out into my hand sevenandthirty golden guinea pieces the rest was in his hand in small gold and silver but his heart failed him there and he crammed the change into his pocket  there said he thatll show you im a queer man and strange wi strangers but my word is my bond and theres the proof of it  now my uncle seemed so miserly that i was struck dumb by this sudden generosity and could find no words in which to thank him  no a word said he nae thanks i want nae thanks i do my duty im no saying that everybody would have done it but for my part though im a careful body too its a pleasure to me to do the right by my brothers son and its a pleasure to me to think that now well agree as such near friends should  i spoke him in return as handsomely as i was able but all the while i was wondering what would come next and why he had parted with his precious guineas for as to the reason he had given a baby would have refused it  presently he looked towards me sideways  and see here says he tit for tat  i told him i was ready to prove my gratitude in any reasonable degree and then waited looking for some monstrous demand and yet when at last he plucked up courage to speak it was only to tell me very properly as i thought that he was growing old and a little broken and that he would expect me to help him with the house and the bit garden  i answered and expressed my readiness to serve  well he said lets begin he pulled out of his pocket a rusty key there says he theres the key of the stairtower at the far end of the house ye can only win into it from the outside for that part of the house is no finished gang ye in there and up the stairs and bring me down the chest thats at the top theres papers int he added  can i have a light sir said i  na said he very cunningly nae lights in my house  very well sir said i are the stairs good  theyre grand said he and then as i was going keep to the wall he added theres nae banisters but the stairs are grand under foot  out i went into the night the wind was still moaning in the distance though never a breath of it came near the house of shaws it had fallen blacker than ever and i was glad to feel along the wall till i came the length of the stairtower door at the far end of the unfinished wing i had got the key into the keyhole and had just turned it when all upon a sudden without sound of wind or thunder the whole sky lighted up with wildfire and went black again i had to put my hand over my eyes to get back to the colour of the darkness and indeed i was already half blinded when i stepped into the tower  it was so dark inside it seemed a body could scarce breathe but i pushed out with foot and hand and presently struck the wall with the one and the lowermost round of the stair with the other the wall by the touch was of fine hewn stone the steps too though somewhat steep and narrow were of polished masonwork and regular and solid under foot minding my uncles word about the banisters i kept close to the tower side and felt my way in the pitch darkness with a beating heart  the house of shaws stood some five full stories high not counting lofts well as i advanced it seemed to me the stair grew airier and a thought more lightsome and i was wondering what might be the cause of this change when a second blink of the summer lightning came and went if i did not cry out it was because fear had me by the throat and if i did not fall it was more by heavens mercy than my own strength it was not only that the flash shone in on every side through breaches in the wall so that i seemed to be clambering aloft upon an open scaffold but the same passing brightness showed me the steps were of unequal length and that one of my feet rested that moment within two inches of the well  this was the grand stair i thought and with the thought a gust of a kind of angry courage came into my heart my uncle had sent me here certainly to run great risks perhaps to die i swore i would settle that perhaps if i should break my neck for it got me down upon my hands and knees and as slowly as a snail feeling before me every inch and testing the solidity of every stone i continued to ascend the stair the darkness by contrast with the flash appeared to have redoubled nor was that all for my ears were now troubled and my mind confounded by a great stir of bats in the top part of the tower and the foul beasts flying downwards sometimes beat about my face and body  the tower i should have said was square and in every corner the step was made of a great stone of a different shape to join the flights well i had come close to one of these turns when feeling forward as usual my hand slipped upon an edge and found nothing but emptiness beyond it the stair had been carried no higher to set a stranger mounting it in the darkness was to send him straight to his death and although thanks to the lightning and my own precautions i was safe enough the mere thought of the peril in which i might have stood and the dreadful height i might have fallen from brought out the sweat upon my body and relaxed my joints  but i knew what i wanted now and turned and groped my way down again with a wonderful anger in my heart about halfway down the wind sprang up in a clap and shook the tower and died again the rain followed and before i had reached the ground level it fell in buckets i put out my head into the storm and looked along towards the kitchen the door which i had shut behind me when i left now stood open and shed a little glimmer of light and i thought i could see a figure standing in the rain quite still like a man hearkening and then there came a blinding flash which showed me my uncle plainly just where i had fancied him to stand and hard upon the heels of it a great towrow of thunder  now whether my uncle thought the crash to be the sound of my fall or whether he heard in it gods voice denouncing murder i will leave you to guess certain it is at least that he was seized on by a kind of panic fear and that he ran into the house and left the door open behind him i followed as softly as i could and coming unheard into the kitchen stood and watched him  he had found time to open the corner cupboard and bring out a great casebottle of aqua vitæ and now sat with his back towards me at the table ever and again he would be seized with a fit of deadly shuddering and groan aloud and carrying the bottle to his lips drink down the raw spirits by the mouthful  i stepped forward came close behind him where he sat and suddenly clapping my two hands down upon his shouldersah cried i  my uncle gave a kind of broken cry like a sheeps bleat flung up his arms and tumbled to the floor like a dead man i was somewhat shocked at this but i had myself to look to first of all and did not hesitate to let him lie as he had fallen the keys were hanging in the cupboard and it was my design to furnish myself with arms before my uncle should come again to his senses and the power of devising evil in the cupboard were a few bottles some apparently of medicine a great many bills and other papers which i should willingly enough have rummaged had i had the time and a few necessaries that were nothing to my purpose thence i turned to the chests the first was full of meal the second of moneybags and papers tied into sheaves in the third with many other things and these for the most part clothes i found a rusty uglylooking highland dirk without the scabbard this then i concealed inside my waistcoat and turned to my uncle  he lay as he had fallen all huddled with one knee up and one arm sprawling abroad his face had a strange colour of blue and he seemed to have ceased breathing fear came on me that he was dead then i got water and dashed it in his face and with that he seemed to come a little to himself working his mouth and fluttering his eyelids at last he looked up and saw me and there came into his eyes a terror that was not of this world  come come said i sit up  are ye alive he sobbed o man are ye alive  that am i said i small thanks to you  he had begun to seek for his breath with deep sighs the blue phial said hein the aumrythe blue phial his breath came slower still  i ran to the cupboard and sure enough found there a blue phial of medicine with the dose written on it on a paper and this i administered to him with what speed i might  its the trouble said he reviving a little i have a trouble davie its the heart  i set him on a chair and looked at him it is true i felt some pity for a man that looked so sick but i was full besides of righteous anger and i numbered over before him the points on which i wanted explanation why he lied to me at every word why he feared that i should leave him why he disliked it to be hinted that he and my father were twinsis that because it is true i asked why he had given me money to which i was convinced i had no claim and last of all why he had tried to kill me he heard me all through in silence and then in a broken voice begged me to let him go to bed  ill tell ye the morn he said as sure as death i will  and so weak was he that i could do nothing but consent i locked him into his room however and pocketed the key and then returning to the kitchen made up such a blaze as had not shone there for many a long year and wrapping myself in my plaid lay down upon the chests and fell asleep     chapter v  i go to the queens ferry   much rain fell in the night and the next morning there blew a bitter wintry wind out of the northwest driving scattered clouds for all that and before the sun began to peep or the last of the stars had vanished i made my way to the side of the burn and had a plunge in a deep whirling pool all aglow from my bath i sat down once more beside the fire which i replenished and began gravely to consider my position  there was now no doubt about my uncles enmity there was no doubt i carried my life in my hand and he would leave no stone unturned that he might compass my destruction but i was young and spirited and like most lads that have been countrybred i had a great opinion of my shrewdness i had come to his door no better than a beggar and little more than a child he had met me with treachery and violence it would be a fine consummation to take the upper hand and drive him like a herd of sheep  i sat there nursing my knee and smiling at the fire and i saw myself in fancy smell out his secrets one after another and grow to be that mans king and ruler the warlock of essendean they say had made a mirror in which men could read the future it must have been of other stuff than burning coal for in all the shapes and pictures that i sat and gazed at there was never a ship never a seaman with a hairy cap never a big bludgeon for my silly head or the least sign of all those tribulations that were ripe to fall on me  presently all swollen with conceit i went upstairs and gave my prisoner his liberty he gave me goodmorning civilly and i gave the same to him smiling down upon him from the heights of my sufficiency soon we were set to breakfast as it might have been the day before  well sir said i with a jeering tone have you nothing more to say to me and then as he made no articulate reply it will be time i think to understand each other i continued you took me for a country johnny raw with no more motherwit or courage than a porridgestick i took you for a good man or no worse than others at the least it seems we were both wrong what cause you have to fear me to cheat me and to attempt my life  he murmured something about a jest and that he liked a bit of fun and then seeing me smile changed his tone and assured me he would make all clear as soon as we had breakfasted i saw by his face that he had no lie ready for me though he was hard at work preparing one and i think i was about to tell him so when we were interrupted by a knocking at the door  bidding my uncle sit where he was i went to open it and found on the doorstep a halfgrown boy in seaclothes he had no sooner seen me than he began to dance some steps of the seahornpipe which i had never before heard of far less seen snapping his fingers in the air and footing it right cleverly for all that he was blue with the cold and there was something in his face a look between tears and laughter that was highly pathetic and consisted ill with this gaiety of manner  what cheer mate says he with a cracked voice  i asked him soberly to name his pleasure  o pleasure says he and then began to sing    for its my delight of a shiny night      in the season of the year  well said i if you have no business at all i will even be so unmannerly as to shut you out  stay brother he cried have you no fun about you or do you want to get me thrashed ive brought a letter from old heasyoasy to mr belflower he showed me a letter as he spoke and i say mate he added im mortal hungry  well said i come into the house and you shall have a bite if i go empty for it  with that i brought him in and set him down to my own place where he fell to greedily on the remains of breakfast winking to me betweenwhiles and making many faces which i think the poor soul considered manly meanwhile my uncle had read the letter and sat thinking then suddenly he got to his feet with a great air of liveliness and pulled me apart into the farthest corner of the room  read that said he and put the letter in my hand  here it is lying before me as i write      the hawes inn at the queens ferry    siri lie here with my hawser up and down and send my cabinboy to   informe if you have any further commands for overseas today will   be the last occasion as the wind will serve us well out of the

these parts an auld man forbye highly respeckit and he kenned your father  i stood awhile and thought i was going to some place of shipping which was doubtless populous and where my uncle durst attempt no violence and indeed even the society of the cabinboy so far protected me once there i believed i could force on the visit to the lawyer even if my uncle were now insincere in proposing it and perhaps in the bottom of my heart i wished a nearer view of the sea and ships you are to remember i had lived all my life in the inland hills and just two days before had my first sight of the firth lying like a blue floor and the sailed ships moving on the face of it no bigger than toys one thing with another i made up my mind  very well says i let us go to the ferry  my uncle got into his hat and coat and buckled an old rusty cutlass on and then we trod the fire out locked the door and set forth upon our walk  the wind being in that cold quarter the northwest blew nearly in our faces as we went it was the month of june the grass was all white with daisies and the trees with blossom but to judge by our blue nails and aching wrists the time might have been winter and the whiteness a december frost  uncle ebenezer trudged in the ditch jogging from side to side like an old ploughman coming home from work he never said a word the whole way and i was thrown for talk on the cabinboy he told me his name was ransome and that he had followed the sea since he was nine but could not say how old he was as he had lost his reckoning he showed me tattoo marks baring his breast in the teeth of the wind and in spite of my remonstrances for i thought it was enough to kill him he swore horribly whenever he remembered but more like a silly schoolboy than a man and boasted of many wild and bad things that he had done stealthy thefts false accusations ay and even murder but all with such a dearth of likelihood in the details and such a weak and crazy swagger in the delivery as disposed me rather to pity than to believe him  i asked him of the brig which he declared was the finest ship that sailed and of captain hoseason in whose praises he was equally loud heasyoasy for so he still named the skipper was a man by his account that minded for nothing either in heaven or earth one that as people said would crack on all sail into the day of judgment rough fierce unscrupulous and brutal and all this my poor cabinboy had taught himself to admire as something seamanlike and manly he would only admit one flaw in his idol he aint no seaman he admitted thats mr shuan that navigates the brig hes the finest seaman in the trade only for drink and i tell you i believe it why look ere and turning down his stocking he showed me a great raw red wound that made my blood run cold he done thatmr shuan done it he said with an air of pride  what i cried do you take such savage usage at his hands why you are no slave to be so handled  no said the poor mooncalf changing his tune at once and so hell find see ere and he showed me a great caseknife which he told me was stolen o says he let me see him try i dare him to ill do for him o he aint the first and he confirmed it with a poor silly ugly oath  i have never felt such pity for any one in this wide world as i felt for that halfwitted creature and it began to come over me that the brig covenant for all her pious name was little better than a hell upon the seas  have you no friends said i  he said he had a father in some english seaport i forget which he was a fine man too he said but hes dead  in heavens name cried i can you find no reputable life on shore  o no says he winking and looking very sly they would put me to a trade i know a trick worth two of that i do  i asked him what trade could be so dreadful as the one he followed where he ran the continual peril of his life not alone from wind and sea but by the horrid cruelty of those who were his masters he said it was very true and then began to praise the life and tell what a pleasure it was to get on shore with money in his pocket and spend it like a man and buy apples and swagger and surprise what he called stickinthemud boys and then its not all as bad as that says he theres worse off than me theres the twentypounders o laws you should see them taking on why ive seen a man as old as you i dessayto him i seemed oldah and he had a beard toowell and as soon as we cleared out of the river and he had the drug out of his headmy how he cried and carried on i made a fine fool of him i tell you and then theres little uns too o little by me i tell you i keep them in order when we carry little uns i have a ropesend of my own to wollop em and so he ran on until it came in on me what he meant by twentypounders were those unhappy criminals who were sent overseas to slavery in north america or the still more unhappy innocents who were kidnapped or trepanned as the word went for private interest or vengeance  just then we came to the top of the hill and looked down on the ferry and the hope the firth of forth as is very well known narrows at this point to the width of a goodsized river which makes a convenient ferry going north and turns the upper reach into a landlocked haven for all manner of ships right in the midst of the narrows lies an islet with some ruins on the south shore they have built a pier for the service of the ferry and at the end of the pier on the other side of the road and backed against a pretty garden of hollytrees and hawthorns i could see the building which they call the hawes inn  the town of queensferry lies farther west and the neighbourhood of the inn looked pretty lonely at that time of day for the boat had just gone north with passengers a skiff however lay beside the pier with some seamen sleeping on the thwarts this as ransome told me was the brigs boat waiting for the captain and about half a mile off and all alone in the anchorage he showed me the covenant herself there was a seagoing bustle on board yards were swinging into place and as the wind blew from that quarter i could hear the song of the sailors as they pulled upon the ropes after all i had listened to upon the way i looked at that ship with an extreme abhorrence and from the bottom of my heart i pitied all poor souls that were condemned to sail in her  we had all three pulled up on the brow of the hill and now i marched across the road and addressed my uncle i think it right to tell you sir says i theres nothing that will bring me on board that covenant  he seemed to waken from a dream eh he said whats that  i told him over again  well well he said well have to please ye i suppose but what are we standing here for its perishing cold and if im no mistaken theyre busking the covenant for sea   footnotes    4 agent    5 unwilling     chapter vi  what befell at the queens ferry   as soon as we came to the inn ransome led us up the stair to a small room with a bed in it and heated like an oven by a great fire of coal at a table hard by the chimney a tall dark sober looking man sat writing in spite of the heat of the room he wore a thick seajacket buttoned to the neck and a tall hairy cap drawn down over his ears yet i never saw any man not even a judge upon the bench look cooler or more studious and selfpossessed than this shipcaptain  he got to his feet at once and coming forward offered his large hand to ebenezer i am proud to see you mr balfour said he in a fine deep voice and glad that ye are here in time the winds fair and the tide upon the turn well see the old coalbucket burning on the isle of may before tonight  captain hoseason returned my uncle you keep your room unco hot  its a habit i have mr balfour said the skipper im a coldrife man by my nature i have a cold blood sir theres neither fur nor flannelno sir nor hot rum will warm up what they call the temperature sir its the same with most men that have been carbonadoed as they call it in the tropic seas  well well captain replied my uncle we must all be the way were made  but it chanced that this fancy of the captains had a great share in my misfortunes for though i had promised myself not to let my kinsman out of sight i was both so impatient for a nearer look of the sea and so sickened by the closeness of the room that when he told me to run downstairs and play myself awhile i was fool enough to take him at his word  away i went therefore leaving the two men sitting down to a bottle and a great mass of papers and crossing the road in front of the inn walked down upon the beach with the wind in that quarter only little wavelets not much bigger than i had seen upon a lake beat upon the shore but the weeds were new to mesome green some brown and long and some with little bladders that crackled between my fingers even so far up the firth the smell of the seawater was exceedingly salt and stirring the covenant besides was beginning to shake out her sails which hung upon the yards in clusters and the spirit of all that i beheld put me in thoughts of far voyages and foreign places  i looked too at the seamen with the skiffbig brown fellows some in shirts some with jackets some with coloured handkerchiefs about their throats one with a brace of pistols stuck into his pockets two or three with knotty bludgeons and all with their caseknives i passed the time of day with one that looked less desperate than his fellows and asked him of the sailing of the brig he said they would get under way as soon as the ebb set and expressed his gladness to be out of a port where there were no taverns and fiddlers but all with such horrifying oaths that i made haste to get away from him  this threw me back on ransome who seemed the least wicked of that gang and who soon came out of the inn and ran to me crying for a bowl of punch i told him i would give him no such thing for neither he nor i was of an age for such indulgences but a glass of ale you may have and welcome said i he mopped and mowed at me and called me names but he was glad to get the ale for all that and presently we were set down at a table in the front room of the inn and both eating and drinking with a good appetite  here it occurred to me that as the landlord was a man of that county i might do well to make a friend of him i offered him a share as was much the custom in those days but he was far too great a man to sit with such poor customers as ransome and myself and he was leaving the room when i called him back to ask if he knew mr rankeillor  hoot ay says he and a very honest man and o by the by says he was it you that came in with ebenezer and when i had told him yes yell be no friend of his he asked meaning in the scottish way that i would be no relative  i told him no none  i thought not said he and yet ye have a kind of gliff6 of mr alexander  i said it seemed that ebenezer was illseen in the country  nae doubt said the landlord hes a wicked auld man and theres many would like to see him girning in a tow7 jennet clouston and mony mair that he has harried out of house and hame and yet he was ance a fine young fellow too but that was before the sough8 gaed abroad about mr alexander that was like the death of him  and what was it i asked  ou just that he had killed him said the landlord did ye never hear that  and what would he kill him for said i  and what for but just to get the place said he  the place said i the shaws  nae other place that i ken said he  ay man said i is that so was mywas alexander the eldest son  deed was he said the landlord what else would he have killed him for  and with that he went away as he had been impatient to do from the beginning  of course i had guessed it a long while ago but it is one thing to guess another to know and i sat stunned with my good fortune and could scarce grow to believe that the same poor lad who had trudged in the dust from ettrick forest not two days ago was now one of the rich of the earth and had a house and broad lands and might mount his horse tomorrow all these pleasant things and a thousand others crowded into my mind as i sat staring before me out of the inn window and paying no heed to what i saw only i remember that my eye lighted on captain hoseason down on the pier among his seamen and speaking with some authority and presently he came marching back towards the house with no mark of a sailors clumsiness but carrying his fine tall figure with a manly bearing and still with the same sober grave expression on his face i wondered if it was possible that ransomes stories could be true and half disbelieved them they fitted so ill with the mans looks but indeed he was neither so good as i supposed him nor quite so bad as ransome did for in fact he was two men and left the better one behind as soon as he set foot on board his vessel  the next thing i heard my uncle calling me and found the pair in the road together it was the captain who addressed me and that with an air very flattering to a young lad of grave equality  sir said he mr balfour tells me great things of you and for my own part i like your looks i wish i was for longer here that we might make the better friends but well make the most of what we have ye shall come on board my brig for half an hour till the ebb sets and drink a bowl with me  now i longed to see the inside of a ship more than words can tell but i was not going to put myself in jeopardy and i told him my uncle and i had an appointment with a lawyer  ay ay said he he passed me word of that but ye see the boatll set ye ashore at the town pier and thats but a penny stonecast from rankeillors house and here he suddenly leaned down and whispered in my ear take care of the old tod9 he means mischief come aboard till i can get a word with ye and then passing his arm through mine he continued aloud as he set off towards his boat but come what can i bring ye from the carolinas any friend of mr balfours can command a roll of tobacco indian featherwork a skin of a wild beast a stone pipe the mockingbird that mews for all the world like a cat the cardinalbird that is as red as bloodtake your pick and say your pleasure   by this time we were at the boatside and he was handing me in i did not dream of hanging back i thought the poor fool that i had found a good friend and helper and i was rejoiced to see the ship as soon as we were all set in our places the boat was thrust off from the pier and began to move over the waters and what with my pleasure in this new movement and my surprise at our low position and the appearance of the shores and the growing bigness of the brig as we drew near to it i could hardly understand what the captain said and must have answered him at random  as soon as we were alongside where i sat fairly gaping at the ships height the strong humming of the tide against its sides and the pleasant cries of the seamen at their work hoseason declaring that he and i must be the first aboard ordered a tackle to be sent down from the mainyard in this i was whipped into the air and set down again on the deck where the captain stood ready waiting for me and instantly slipped back his arm under mine there i stood some while a little dizzy with the unsteadiness of all around me perhaps a little afraid and yet vastly pleased with these strange sights the captain meanwhile pointing out the strangest and telling me their names and uses  but where is my uncle said i suddenly  ay said hoseason with a sudden grimness thats the point  i felt i was lost with all my strength i plucked myself clear of him and ran to the bulwarks sure enough there was the boat pulling for the town with my uncle sitting in the stern i gave a piercing cryhelp help murderso that both sides of the anchorage rang with it and my uncle turned round where he was sitting and showed me a face full of cruelty and terror  it was the last i saw already strong hands had been plucking me back from the ships side and now a thunderbolt seemed to strike me i saw a great flash of fire and fell senseless   footnotes    6 look    7 rope    8 report    9 fox     chapter vii  i go to sea in the brig covenant of dysart   i came to myself in darkness in great pain bound hand and foot and deafened by many unfamiliar noises there sounded in my ears a roaring of water as of a huge milldam the thrashing of heavy sprays the thundering of the sails and the shrill cries of seamen the whole world now heaved giddily up and now rushed giddily downward and so sick and hurt was i in body and my mind so much confounded that it took me a long while chasing my thoughts up and down and ever stunned again by a fresh stab of pain to realise that i must be lying somewhere bound in the belly of that unlucky ship and that the wind must have strengthened to a gale with the clear perception of my plight there fell upon me a blackness of despair a horror of remorse at my own folly and a passion of anger at my uncle that once more bereft me of my senses  when i returned again to life the same uproar the same confused and violent movements shook and deafened me and presently to my other pains and distresses there was added the sickness of an unused landsman on the sea in that time of my adventurous youth i suffered many hardships but none that was so crushing to my mind and body or lit by so few hopes as these first hours aboard the brig  i heard a gun fire and supposed the storm had proved too strong for us and we were firing signals of distress the thought of deliverance even by death in the deep sea was welcome to me yet it was no such matter but as i was afterwards told a common habit of the captains which i here set down to show that even the worst man may have his kindlier side we were then passing it appeared within some miles of dysart where the brig was built and where old mrs hoseason the captains mother had come some years before to live and whether outward or inward bound the covenant was never suffered to go by that place by day without a gun fired and colours shown  i had no measure of time day and night were alike in that illsmelling cavern of the ships bowels where i lay and the misery of my situation drew out the hours to double how long therefore i lay waiting to hear the ship split upon some rock or to feel her reel headforemost into the depths of the sea i have not the means of computation but sleep at length stole from me the consciousness of sorrow  i was wakened by the light of a handlantern shining in my face a small man of about thirty with green eyes and a tangle of fair hair stood looking down at me  well said he how goes it  i answered by a sob and my visitor then felt my pulse and temples and set himself to wash and dress the wound upon my scalp  ay said he a sore dunt10 what man cheer up the worlds no done youve made a bad start of it but youll make a better have you had any meat  i said i could not look at it and thereupon he gave me some brandy and water in a tin pannikin and left me once more to myself  the next time he came to see me i was lying betwixt sleep and waking my eyes wide open in the darkness the sickness quite departed but succeeded by a horrid giddiness and swimming that was almost worse to bear i ached besides in every limb and the cords that bound me seemed to be of fire the smell of the hole in which i lay seemed to have become a part of me and during the long interval since his last visit i had suffered tortures of fear now from the scurrying of the ships rats that sometimes pattered on my very face and now from the dismal imaginings that haunt the bed of fever  the glimmer of the lantern as a trap opened shone in like the heavens sunlight and though it only showed me the strong dark beams of the ship that was my prison i could have cried aloud for gladness the man with the green eyes was the first to descend the ladder and i noticed that he came somewhat unsteadily he was followed by the captain neither said a word but the first set to and examined me and dressed my wound as before while hoseason looked me in my face with an odd black look  now sir you see for yourself said the first a high fever no appetite no light no meat you see for yourself what that means  i am no conjurer mr riach said the captain  give me leave sir said riach youve a good head upon your shoulders and a good scots tongue to ask with but i will leave you no manner of excuse i want that boy taken out of this hole and put in the forecastle  what ye may want sir is a matter of concern to nobody but yoursel returned the captain but i can tell ye that which is to be here he is here he shall bide  admitting that you have been paid in a proportion said the other i will crave leave humbly to say that i have not paid i am and none too much to be the second officer of this old tub and you ken very well if i do my best to earn it but i was paid for nothing more  if ye could hold back your hand from the tin pan mr riach i would have no complaint to make of ye returned the skipper and instead of asking riddles i make bold to say that ye would keep your breath to cool your porridge well be required on deck he added in a sharper note and set one foot upon the ladder  but mr riach caught him by the sleeve  admitting that you have been paid to do a murder he began  hoseason turned upon him with a flash  whats that he cried what kind of talk is that  it seems it is the talk that you can understand said mr riach looking him steadily in the face  mr riach i have sailed with ye three cruises replied the captain in all that time sir ye should have learned to know me im a stiff man and a dour man but for what ye say the nowfie fieit comes from a bad heart and a black conscience if ye say the lad will die  ay will he said mr riach  well sir is not that enough said hoseason flit him where ye please  thereupon the captain ascended the ladder and i who had lain silent throughout this strange conversation beheld mr riach turn after him and bow as low as to his knees in what was plainly a spirit of derision even in my then state of sickness i perceived two things that the mate was touched with liquor as the captain hinted and that drunk or sober he was like to prove a valuable friend  five minutes afterwards my bonds were cut i was hoisted on a mans back carried up to the forecastle and laid in a bunk on some seablankets where the first thing that i did was to lose my senses  it was a blessed thing indeed to open my eyes again upon the daylight and to find myself in the society of men the forecastle was a roomy place enough set all about with berths in which the men of the watch below were seated smoking or lying down asleep the day being calm and the wind fair the scuttle was open and not only the good daylight but from time to time as the ship rolled a dusty beam of sunlight shone in and dazzled and delighted me i had no sooner moved moreover than one of the men brought me a drink of something healing which mr riach had prepared and bade me lie still and i should soon be well again there were no bones broken he explained a clour11 on the head was naething man said he it was me that gave it ye  here i lay for the space of many days a close prisoner and not only got my health again but came to know my companions they were a rough lot indeed as sailors mostly are being men rooted out of all the kindly parts of life and condemned to toss together on the rough seas with masters no less cruel there were some among them that had sailed with the pirates and seen things it would be a shame even to speak of some were men that had run from the kings ships and went with a halter round their necks of which they made no secret and all as the saying goes were at a word and a blow with their best friends yet i had not been many days shut up with them before i began to be ashamed of my first judgment when i had drawn away from them at the ferry pier as though they had been unclean beasts no class of man is altogether bad but each has its own faults and virtues and these shipmates of mine were no exception to the rule rough they were sure enough and bad i suppose but they had many virtues they were kind when it occurred to them simple even beyond the simplicity of a country lad like me and had some glimmerings of honesty  there was one man of maybe forty that would sit on my berthside for hours and tell me of his wife and child he was a fisher that had lost his boat and thus been driven to the deepsea voyaging well it is years ago now but i have never forgotten him his wife who was young by him as he often told me waited in vain to see her man return he would never again make the fire for her in the morning nor yet keep the bairn when she was sick indeed many of these poor fellows as the event proved were upon their last cruise the deep seas and cannibal fish received them and it is a thankless business to speak ill of the dead  among other good deeds that they did they returned my money which had been shared among them and though it was about a third short i was very glad to get it and hoped great good from it in the land i was going to the ship was bound for the carolinas and you must not suppose that i was going to that place merely as an exile the trade was even then much depressed since that and with the rebellion of the colonies and the formation of the united states it has of course come to an end but in those days of my youth white men were still sold into slavery on the plantations and that was the destiny to which my wicked uncle had condemned me  the cabinboy ransome from whom i had first heard of these atrocities came in at times from the roundhouse where he berthed and served now nursing a bruised limb in silent agony now raving against the cruelty of mr shuan it made my heart bleed but the men had a great respect for the chief mate who was as they said the only seaman of the whole jingbang and none such a bad man when he was sober indeed i found there was a strange peculiarity about our two mates that mr riach was sullen unkind and harsh when he was sober and mr shuan would not hurt a fly except when he was drinking i asked about the captain but i was told drink made no difference upon that man of iron  i did my best in the small time allowed me to make something like a man or rather i should say something like a boy of the poor creature ransome but his mind was scarce truly human he could remember nothing of the time before he came to sea only that his father had made clocks and had a starling in the parlour which could whistle the north countrie all else had been blotted out in these years of hardship and cruelties he had a strange notion of the dry land picked up from sailors stories that it was a place where lads were put to some kind of slavery called a trade and where apprentices were continually lashed and clapped into foul prisons in a town he thought every second person a decoy and every third house a place in which seamen would be drugged and murdered to be sure i would tell him how kindly i had myself been used upon that dry land he was so much afraid of and how well fed and carefully taught both by my friends and my parents and if he had been recently hurt he would weep bitterly and swear to run away but if he was in his usual crackbrain humour or still more if he had had a glass of spirits in the roundhouse he would deride the notion  it was mr riach heaven forgive him who gave the boy drink and it was doubtless kindly meant but besides that it was ruin to his health it was the pitifullest thing in life to see this unhappy unfriended creature staggering and dancing and talking he knew not what some of the men laughed but not all others would grow as black as thunder thinking perhaps of their own childhood or their own children and bid him stop that nonsense and think what he was doing as for me i felt ashamed to look at him and the poor child still comes about me in my dreams  all this time you should know the covenant was meeting continual headwinds and tumbling up and down against headseas so that the scuttle was almost constantly shut and the forecastle lighted only by a swinging lantern on a beam there was constant labour for all hands the sails had to be made and shortened every hour the strain told on the mens temper there was a growl of quarrelling all day long from berth to berth and as i was never allowed to set my foot on deck you can picture to yourselves how weary of my life i grew to be and how impatient for a change  and a change i was to get as you shall hear but i must first tell of a conversation i had with mr riach which put a little heart in me to bear my troubles getting him in a favourable stage of drink for indeed he never looked near me when he was sober i pledged him to secrecy and told him my whole story  he declared it was like a ballad that he would do his best to help me that i should have paper pen and ink and write one line to mr campbell and another to mr rankeillor and that if i had told the truth ten to one he would be able with their help to pull me through and set me in my rights  and in the meantime says he keep your heart up youre not the only one ill tell you that theres many a man hoeing tobacco overseas that should be mounting his horse at his own door at home many and many and life is all a variorum at the best look at me im a lairds son and more than half a doctor and here i am manjack to hoseason  i thought it would be civil to ask him for his story  he whistled loud  never had one said he i liked fun thats all and he skipped out of the forecastle   footnotes    10 stroke    11 blow     chapter viii  the roundhouse   one night about eleven oclock a man of mr riachs watch which was on deck came below for his jacket and instantly there began to go a whisper about the forecastle that shuan had done for him at last there was no need of a name we all knew who was meant but we had scarce time to get the idea rightly in our heads far less to speak of it when the scuttle was again flung open and captain hoseason came down the ladder he looked sharply round the bunks in the tossing light of the lantern and then walking straight up to me he addressed me to my surprise in tones of kindness  my man said he we want ye to serve in the roundhouse you and ransome are to change berths run away aft with ye  even as he spoke two seamen appeared in the scuttle carrying ransome in their arms and the ship at that moment giving a great sheer into the sea and the lantern swinging the light fell direct on the boys face it was as white as wax and had a look upon it like a dreadful smile the blood in me ran cold and i drew in my breath as if i had been struck  run away aft run away aft with ye cried hoseason  and at that i brushed by the sailors and the boy who neither spoke nor moved and ran up the ladder on deck  the brig was sheering swiftly and giddily through a long cresting swell she was on the starboard tack and on the left hand under the arched foot of the foresail i could see the sunset still quite bright this at such an hour of the night surprised me greatly but i was too ignorant to draw the true conclusionthat we were going northabout round scotland and were now on the high sea between the orkney and shetland islands having avoided the dangerous currents of the pentland firth for my part who had been so long shut in the dark and knew nothing of headwinds i thought we might be halfway or more across the atlantic and indeed beyond that i wondered a little at the lateness of the sunset light i gave no heed to it and pushed on across the decks running between the seas catching at ropes and only saved from going overboard by one of the hands on deck who had been always kind to me  the roundhouse for which i was bound and where i was now to sleep and serve stood some six feet above the decks and considering the size of the brig was of good dimensions inside were a fixed table and bench and two berths one for the captain and the other for the two mates turn and turn about it was all fitted with lockers from top to bottom so as to stow away the officers belongings and a part of the ships stores there was a second storeroom underneath which you entered by a hatchway in the middle of the deck indeed all the best of the meat and drink and the whole of the powder were collected in this place and all the firearms except the two pieces of brass ordnance were set in a rack in the aftermost wall of the roundhouse the most of the cutlasses were in another place  a small window with a shutter on each side and a skylight in the roof gave it light by day and after dark there was a lamp always burning it was burning when i entered not brightly but enough to show mr shuan sitting at the table with the brandybottle and a tin pannikin in front of him he was a tall man strongly made and very black and he stared before him on the table like one stupid  he took no notice of my coming in nor did he move when the captain followed and leant on the berth beside me looking darkly at the mate i stood in great fear of hoseason and had my reasons for it but something told me i need not be afraid of him just then and i whispered in his ear how is he he shook his head like one that does not know and does not wish to think and his face was very stern  presently mr riach came in he gave the captain a glance that meant the boy was dead as plain as speaking and took his place like the rest of us so that we all three stood without a word staring down at mr shuan and mr shuan on his side sat without a word looking hard upon the table  all of a sudden he put out his hand to take the bottle and at that mr riach started forward and caught it away from him rather by surprise than violence crying out with an oath that there had been too much of this work altogether and that a judgment would fall upon the ship and as he spoke the weather slidingdoors standing open he tossed the bottle into the sea  mr shuan was on his feet in a trice he still looked dazed but he meant murder ay and would have done it for the second time that night had not the captain stepped in between him and his victim  sit down roars the captain ye sot and swine do ye know what yeve done yeve murdered the boy  mr shuan seemed to understand for he sat down again and put up his hand to his brow  well he said he brought me a dirty pannikin  at that word the captain and i and mr riach all looked at each other for a second with a kind of frightened look and then hoseason walked up to his chief officer took him by the shoulder led him across to his bunk and bade him lie down and go to sleep as you might speak to a bad child the murderer cried a little but he took off his seaboots and obeyed  ah cried mr riach with a dreadful voice ye should have interfered lang syne its too late now  mr riach said the captain this nights work must never be kennt in dysart the boy went overboard sir thats what the story is and i would give five pounds out of my pocket it was true he turned to the table what made ye throw the good bottle away he added there was nae sense in that sirhere david draw me another theyre in the bottom locker and he tossed me a keyyell need a glass yourself sir he added to riach yon was an ugly thing to see  so the pair sat down and hobanobbed and while they did so the murderer who had been lying and whimpering in his berth raised himself upon his elbow and looked at them and at me  that was the first night of my new duties and in the course of the next day i had got well into the run of them i had to serve at the meals which the captain took at regular hours sitting down with the officer who was off duty all the day through i would be running with a dram to one or other of my three masters and at night i slept on a blanket thrown on the deck boards at the aftermost end of the roundhouse and right in the draught of the two doors it was a hard and a cold bed nor was i suffered to sleep without interruption for some one would be always coming in from deck to get a dram and when a fresh watch was to be set two and sometimes all three would sit down and brew a bowl together how they kept their health i know not any more than how i kept my own  and yet in other ways it was an easy service there was no cloth to lay the meals were either of oatmeal porridge or salt junk except twice a week when there was duff and though i was clumsy enough and not being firm on my sealegs sometimes fell with what i was bringing them both mr riach and the captain were singularly patient i could not but fancy they were making up leeway with their consciences and that they would scarce have been so good with me if they had not been worse with ransome  as for mr shuan the drink or his crime or the two together had certainly troubled his mind i cannot say i ever saw him in his proper wits he never grew used to my being there stared at me continually sometimes i could have thought with terror and more than once drew back from my hand when i was serving him i was pretty sure from the first that he had no clear mind of what he had done and on my second day in the roundhouse i had the proof of it we were alone and he had been staring at me a long time when all at once up he got as pale as death and came close up to me to my great terror but i had no cause to be afraid of him  you were not here before he asked  no sir said i  there was another boy he asked again and when i had answered him ah says he i thought that and went and sat down without another word except to call for brandy  you may think it strange but for all the horror i had i was still sorry for him he was a married man with a wife in leith but whether or no he had a family i have now forgotten i hope not  altogether it was no very hard life for the time it lasted which as you are to hear was not long i was as well fed as the best of them even their pickles which were the great dainty i was allowed my share of and had i liked i might have been drunk from morning to night like mr shuan i had company too and good company of its sort mr riach who had been to the college spoke to me like a friend when he was not sulking and told me many curious things and some that were informing and even the captain though he kept me at the sticks end the most part of the time would sometimes unbuckle a bit and tell me of the fine countries he had visited  the shadow of poor ransome to be sure lay on all four of us and on me and mr shuan in particular most heavily and then i had another trouble of my own here i was doing dirty work for three men that i looked down upon and one of whom at least should have hung upon a gallows that was for the present and as for the future i could only see myself slaving alongside of negroes in the tobaccofields mr riach perhaps from caution would never suffer me to say another word about my story the captain whom i tried to approach rebuffed me like a dog and would not hear a word and as the days came and went my heart sank lower and lower till i was even glad of the work which kept me from thinking     chapter ix  the man with the belt of gold   more than a week went by in which the illluck that had hitherto pursued the covenant upon this voyage grew yet more strongly marked some days she made a little way others she was driven actually back at last we were beaten so far to the south that we tossed and tacked to and fro the whole of the ninth day within sight of cape wrath and the wild rocky coast on either hand of it there followed on that a council of the officers and some decision which i did not rightly understand seeing only the result that we had made a fair wind of a foul one and were running south  the tenth afternoon there was a falling swell and a thick wet white fog that hid one end of the brig from the other all afternoon when i went on deck i saw men and officers listening hard over the bulwarksfor breakers they said and though i did not so much as understand the word i felt danger in the air and was excited  maybe about ten at night i was serving mr riach and the captain at their supper when the ship struck something with a great sound and we heard voices singing out my two masters leaped to their feet  shes struck said mr riach  no sir said the captain weve only run a boat down  and they hurried out  the captain was in the right of it we had run down a boat in the fog and she had parted in the midst and gone to the bottom with all her crew but one this man as i heard afterwards had been sitting in the stern as a passenger while the rest were on the benches rowing at the moment of the blow the stern had been thrown into the air and the man having his hands free and for all he was encumbered with a frieze overcoat that came below his knees had leaped up and caught hold of the brigs bowsprit it showed he had luck and much agility and unusual strength that he should have thus saved himself from such a pass and yet when the captain brought him into the roundhouse and i set eyes on him for the first time he looked as cool as i did  he was smallish in stature but well set and as nimble as a goat his face was of a good open expression but sunburnt very dark and heavily freckled and pitted with the smallpox his eyes were unusually light and had a kind of dancing madness in them that was both engaging and alarming and when he took off his greatcoat he laid a pair of fine silvermounted pistols on the table and i saw that he was belted with a great sword his manners besides were elegant and he pledged the captain handsomely altogether i thought of him at the first sight that here was a man i would rather call my friend than my enemy  the captain too was taking his observations but rather of the mans clothes than his person and to be sure as soon as he had taken off the greatcoat he showed forth mighty fine for the roundhouse of a merchant brig having a hat with feathers a red waistcoat breeches of black plush and a blue coat with silver buttons and handsome silver lace costly clothes though somewhat spoiled with the fog and being slept in  im vexed sir about the boat says the captain  there are some pretty men gone to the bottom said the stranger that i would rather see on the dry land again than half a score of boats  friends of yours said hoseason  you have none such friends in your country was the reply they would have died for me like dogs  well sir said the captain still watching him there are more men in the world than boats to put them in  and thats true too cried the other and ye seem to be a gentleman of great penetration  i have been in france sir says the captain so that it was plain he meant more by the words than showed upon the face of them  well sir says the other and so has many a pretty man for the matter of that  no doubt sir says the captain and fine coats  oho says the stranger is that how the wind sets and he laid his hand quickly on his pistols  dont be hasty said the captain dont do a mischief before ye see the need of it yeve a french soldiers coat upon your back and a scots tongue in your head to be sure but so has many an honest fellow in these days and i daresay none the worse of it  so said the gentleman in the fine coat are ye of the honest party meaning was he a jacobite for each side in these sort of civil broils takes the name of honesty for its own  why sir replied the captain i am a trueblue protestant and i thank god for it it was the first word of any religion i had ever heard from him but i learnt afterwards he was a great churchgoer while on shore but for all that says he i can be sorry to see another man with his back to the wall  can ye so indeed asked the jacobite well sir to be quite plain with ye i am one of those honest gentlemen that were in trouble about the years fortyfive and six and to be still quite plain with ye if i got into the hands of any of the redcoated gentry its like it would go hard with me now sir i was for france and there was a french ship cruising here to pick me up but she gave us the goby in the fogas i wish from the heart that ye had done yoursel and the best that i can say is this if ye can set me ashore where i was going i have that upon me will reward you highly for your trouble  in france says the captain no sir that i cannot do but where ye come fromwe might talk of that  and then unhappily he observed me standing in my corner and packed me off to the galley to get supper for the gentleman i lost no time i promise you and when i came back into the roundhouse i found the gentleman had taken a moneybelt from about his waist and poured out a guinea or two upon the table the captain was looking at the guineas and then at the belt and then at the gentlemans face and i thought he seemed excited  half of it he cried and im your man  the other swept back the guineas into the belt and put it on again under his waistcoat i have told ye sir said he that not one doit of it belongs to me it belongs to my chieftain and here he touched his hatand while i would be but a silly messenger to grudge some of it that the rest might come safe i should show myself a hound indeed if i bought my own carcass any too dear thirty guineas on the seaside or sixty if ye set me on the linnhe loch take it if ye will if not ye can do your worst  ay said hoseason and if i give ye over to the soldiers  ye would make a fools bargain said the other my chief let me tell you sir is forfeited like every honest man in scotland his estate is in the hands of the man they call king george and it is his officers that collect the rents or try to collect them but for the honour of scotland the poor tenant bodies take a thought upon their chief lying in exile and this money is a part of that very rent for which king george is looking now sir ye seem to me to be a man that understands things bring this money within the reach of government and how much of itll come to you  little enough to be sure said hoseason and then if they knew he added drily but i think if i was to try that i could hold my tongue about it  ah but ill begowk12 ye there cried the gentleman play me false and ill play you cunning if a hands laid upon me they shall ken what money it is  well returned the captain what must be must sixty guineas and done heres my hand upon it  and heres mine said the other  and thereupon the captain went out rather hurriedly i thought and left me alone in the roundhouse with the stranger  at that period so soon after the fortyfive there were many exiled gentlemen coming back at the peril of their lives either to see their friends or to collect a little money and as for the highland chiefs that had been forfeited it was a common matter of talk how their tenants would stint themselves to send them money and their clansmen outface the soldiery to get it in and run the gauntlet of our great navy to carry it across all this i had of course heard tell of and now i had a man under my eyes whose life was forfeit on all these counts and upon one more for he was not only a rebel and a smuggler of rents but had taken service with king louis of france and as if all this were not enough he had a belt full of golden guineas round his loins whatever my opinions i could not look on such a man without a lively interest  and so youre a jacobite said i as i set meat before him  ay said he beginning to eat and you by your long face should be a whig13  betwixt and between said i not to annoy him for indeed i was as good a whig as mr campbell could make me  and thats naething said he but im saying mr betwixtandbetween he added this bottle of yours is dry and its hard if im to pay sixty guineas and be grudged a dram upon the back of it  ill go and ask for the key said i and stepped on deck  the fog was as close as ever but the swell almost down they had laid the brig to not knowing precisely where they were and the wind what little there was of it not serving well for their true course some of the hands were still hearkening for breakers but the captain and the two officers were in the waist with their heads together it struck me i dont know why that they were after no good and the first word i heard as i drew softly near more than confirmed me  it was mr riach crying out as if upon a sudden thought  couldnt we wile him out of the roundhouse  hes better where he is returned hoseason he hasnt room to use his sword  well thats true said riach but hes hard to come at  hut said hoseason we can get the man in talk one upon each side and pin him by the two arms or if thatll not hold sir we can make a run by both the doors and get him under hand before he has the time to draw  at this hearing i was seized with both fear and anger at these treacherous greedy bloody men that i sailed with my first mind was to run away my second was bolder  captain said i the gentleman is seeking a dram and the bottles out will you give me the key  they all started and turned about  why heres our chance to get the firearms riach cried and then to me hark ye david he said do ye ken where the pistols are  ay ay put in hoseason david kens davids a good lad ye see david my man yon wild hielandman is a danger to the ship besides being a rank foe to king george god bless him  i had never been so bedavided since i came on board but i said yes as if all i heard were quite natural  the trouble is resumed the captain that all our firelocks great and little are in the roundhouse under this mans nose likewise the powder now if i or one of the officers was to go in and take them he would fall to thinking but a lad like you david might snap up a horn and a pistol or two without remark and if ye can do it cleverly ill bear it in mind when itll be good for you to have friends and thats when we come to carolina  here mr riach whispered him a little  very right sir said the captain and then to myself and see here david yon man has a beltful of gold and i give you my word that you shall have your fingers in it  i told him i would do as he wished though indeed i had scarce breath to speak with and upon that he gave me the key of the spiritlocker and i began to go slowly back to the roundhouse what was i to do they were dogs and thieves they had stolen me from my own country they had killed poor ransome and was i to hold the candle to another murder but then upon the other hand there was the fear of death very plain before me for what could a boy and a man if they were as brave as lions against a whole ships company  i was still arguing it back and forth and getting no great clearness when i came into the roundhouse and saw the jacobite eating his supper under the lamp and at that my mind was made up all in a moment i have no credit by it it was by no choice of mine but as if by compulsion that i walked right up to the table and put my hand on his shoulder  do ye want to be killed said i  he sprang to his feet and looked a question at me as clear as if he had spoken  o cried i theyre all murderers here its a ship full of them theyve murdered a boy already now its you  ay ay said he but they havent got me yet and then looking at me curiously will ye stand with me  that will i said i i am no thief nor yet murderer ill stand by you  why then said he whats your name  david balfour said i and then thinking that a man with so fine a coat must like fine people i added for the first time of shaws  it never occurred to him to doubt me for a highlander is used to see great gentlefolk in great poverty but as he had no estate of his own my words nettled a very childish vanity he had  my name is stewart he said drawing himself up alan breck they call me a kings name is good enough for me though i bear it plain and have the name of no farmmidden to clap to the hindend of it  and having administered this rebuke as though it were something of a chief importance he turned to examine our defences  the roundhouse was built very strong to support the breaching of the seas of its five apertures only the skylight and the two doors were large enough for the passage of a man the doors besides could be drawn close they were of stout oak and ran in grooves and were fitted with hooks to keep them either shut or open as the need arose the one that was already shut i secured in this fashion but when i was proceeding to slide to the other alan stopped me  david said hefor i canna bring to mind the name of your landed estate and so will make so bold as to call you davidthat door being open is the best part of my defences  it would be yet better shut says i  not so david says he ye see i have but one face but so long as that door is open and my face to it the best part of my enemies will be in front of me where i would aye wish to find them  then he gave me from the rack a cutlass of which there were a few besides the firearms choosing it with great care shaking his head and saying he had never in all his life seen poorer weapons and next he set me down to the table with a powderhorn a bag of bullets and all the pistols which he bade me charge  and that will be better work let me tell you said he for a gentleman of decent birth than scraping plates and raxing14 drams to a wheen tarry sailors  thereupon he stood up in the midst with his face to the door and drawing his great sword made trial of the room he had to wield it in  i must stick to the point he said shaking his head and thats a pity too it doesnt set my genius which is all for the upper guard and now said he do you keep on charging the pistols and give heed to me  i told him i would listen closely my chest was tight my mouth dry the light dark to my eyes the thought of the numbers that were soon to leap in upon us kept my heart in a flutter and the sea which i heard washing round the brig and where i thought my dead body would be cast ere morning ran in my mind strangely  first of all said he how many are against us  i reckoned them up and such was the hurry of my mind i had to cast the numbers twice fifteen said i  alan whistled well said he that cant be cured and now follow me it is my part to keep this door where i look for the main battle in that ye have no hand and mind and dinna fire to this side unless they get me down for i would rather have ten foes in front of me than one friend like you cracking pistols at my back  i told him indeed i was no great shot  and thats very bravely said he cried in a great admiration of my candour theres many a pretty gentleman that wouldna dare to say it  but then sir said i there is the door behind you which they may perhaps break in  ay said he and that is a part of your work no sooner the pistols charged than ye must climb up into yon bed where yere handy at the window and if they lift hand against the door yere to shoot but thats not all lets make a bit of a soldier of ye david what else have ye to guard  theres the skylight said i but indeed mr stewart i would need to have eyes upon both sides to keep the two of them for when my face is at the one my back is to the other  and thats very true said alan but have ye no ears to your head  to be sure cried i i must hear the bursting of the glass  ye have some rudiments of sense said alan grimly   footnotes    12 befool    13 whig or whigamore was the cant name for those who were loyal to     king george    14 reaching     chapter x  the siege of the roundhouse   but now our time of truce was come to an end those on deck had waited for my coming till they grew impatient and scarce had alan spoken when the captain showed face in the open door  stand cried alan and pointed his sword at him  the captain stood indeed but he neither winced nor drew back a foot  a naked sword says he this is a strange return for hospitality  do ye see me said alan i am come of kings i bear a kings name my badge is the oak do ye see my sword it has slashed the heads off mair whigamores than you have toes upon your feet call up your vermin to your back sir and fall on the sooner the clash begins the sooner yell taste this steel throughout your vitals  the captain said nothing to alan but he looked over at me with an ugly look david said he ill mind this and the sound of his voice went through me with a jar  next moment he was gone  and now said alan let your hand keep your head for the grip is coming  alan drew a dirk which he held in his left hand in case they should run in under his sword i on my part clambered up into the berth with an armful of pistols and something of a heavy heart and set open the window where i was to watch it was a small part of the deck that i could overlook but enough for our purpose the sea had gone down and the wind was steady and kept the sails quiet so that there was a great stillness in the ship in which i made sure i heard the sound of muttering voices a little after and there came a clash of steel upon the deck by which i knew they were dealing out the cutlasses and one had been let fall and after that silence again  i do not know if i was what you call afraid but my heart beat like a birds both quick and little and there was a dimness came before my eyes which i continually rubbed away and which continually returned as for hope i had none but only a darkness of despair and a sort of anger against all the world that made me long to sell my life as dear as i was able i tried to pray i remember but that same hurry of my mind like a man running would not suffer me to think upon the words and my chief wish was to have the thing begin and be done with it  it came all of a sudden when it did with a rush of feet and a roar and then a shout from alan and a sound of blows and some one crying out as if hurt i looked back over my shoulder and saw mr shuan in the doorway crossing blades with alan  thats him that killed the boy i cried  look to your window said alan and as i turned back to my place i saw him pass his sword through the mates body  it was none too soon for me to look to my own part for my head was scarce back at the window before five men carrying a spare yard for a batteringram ran past me and took post to drive the door in i had never fired with a pistol in my life and not often with a gun far less against a fellowcreature but it was now or never and just as they swang the yard i cried out take that and shot into their midst  i must have hit one of them for he sang out and gave back a step and the rest stopped as if a little disconcerted before they had time to recover i sent another ball over their heads and at my third shot which went as wide as the second the whole party threw down the yard and ran for it  then i looked round again into the deckhouse the whole place was full of the smoke of my own firing just as my ears seemed to be burst with the noise of the shots but there was alan standing as before only now his sword was running blood to the hilt and himself so swelled with triumph and fallen into so fine an attitude that he looked to be invincible right before him on the floor was mr shuan on his hands and knees the blood was pouring from his mouth and he was sinking slowly lower with a terrible white face and just as i looked some of those from behind caught hold of him by the heels and dragged him bodily out of the roundhouse i believe he died as they were doing it  theres one of your whigs for ye cried alan and then turning to me he asked if i had done much execution  i told him i had winged one and thought it was the captain  and ive settled two says he no theres not enough blood let theyll be back again to your watch david this was but a dram before meat  i settled back to my place recharging the three pistols i had fired and keeping watch with both eye and ear  our enemies were disputing not far off upon the deck and that so loudly that i could hear a word or two above the washing of the seas  it was shuan bauchled15 it i heard one say  and another answered him with a wheesht man hes paid the piper  after that the voices fell again into the same muttering as before only now one person spoke most of the time as though laying down a plan and first one and then another answered him briefly like men taking orders by this i made sure they were coming on again and told alan  its what we have to pray for said he unless we can give them a good distaste of us and done with it therell be nae sleep for either you or me but this time mind theyll be in earnest  by this my pistols were ready and there was nothing to do but listen and wait while the brush lasted i had not the time to think if i was frighted but now when all was still again my mind ran upon nothing else the thought of the sharp swords and the cold steel was strong in me and presently when i began to hear stealthy steps and a brushing of mens clothes against the roundhouse wall and knew they were taking their places in the dark i could have found it in my mind to cry out aloud  all this was upon alans side and i had begun to think my share of the fight was at an end when i heard some one drop softly on the roof above me  then there came a single call on the seapipe and that was the signal a knot of them made one rush of it cutlass in hand against the door and at the same moment the glass of the skylight was dashed in a thousand pieces and a man leaped through and landed on the floor before he got his feet i had clapped a pistol to his back and might have shot him too only at the touch of him and him alive my whole flesh misgave me and i could no more pull the trigger than i could have flown  he had dropped his cutlass as he jumped and when he felt the pistol whipped straight round and laid hold of me roaring out an oath and at that either my courage came again or i grew so much afraid as came to the same thing for i gave a shriek and shot him in the midst of the body he gave the most horrible ugly groan and fell to the floor the foot of a second fellow whose legs were dangling through the skylight struck me at the same time upon the head and at that i snatched another pistol and shot this one through the thigh so that he slipped through and tumbled in a lump on his companions body there was no talk of missing any more than there was time to aim i clapped the muzzle to the very place and fired  i might have stood and stared at them for long but i heard alan shout as if for help and that brought me to my senses  he had kept the door so long but one of the seamen while he was engaged with others had run in under his guard and caught him about the body alan was dirking him with his left hand but the fellow clung like a leech another had broken in and had his cutlass raised the door was thronged with their faces i thought we were lost and catching up my cutlass fell on them in flank  but i had not time to be of help the wrestler dropped at last and alan leaping back to get his distance ran upon the others like a bull roaring as he went they broke before him like water turning and running and falling one against another in their haste the sword in his hands flashed like quicksilver into the huddle of our fleeing enemies and at every flash there came the scream of a man hurt i was still thinking we were lost when lo they were all gone and alan was driving them along the deck as a sheepdog chases sheep  yet he was no sooner out than he was back again being as cautious as he was brave and meanwhile the seamen continued running and crying out as if he was still behind them and we heard them tumble one upon another into the forecastle and clapto the hatch upon the top  the roundhouse was like a shambles three were dead inside another lay in his deathagony across the threshold and there were alan and i victorious and unhurt  he came up to me with open arms come to my arms he cried and embraced and kissed me hard upon both cheeks david said he i love you like a brother and o man he cried in a kind of ecstasy am i no a bonny fighter  thereupon he turned to the four enemies passed his sword clean through each of them and tumbled them out of doors one after the other as he did so he kept humming and singing and whistling to himself like a man trying to recall an air only what he was trying was to make one all the while the flush was in his face and his eyes were as bright as a fiveyearold childs with a new toy and presently he sat down upon the table sword in hand the air that he was making all the time began to run a little clearer and then clearer still and then out he burst with a great voice into a gaelic song  i have translated it here not in verse of which i have no skill but at least in the kings english he sang it often afterwards and the thing became popular so that i have heard it and had it explained to me manys the time    this is the song of the sword of alan   the smith made it   the fire set it   now it shines in the hand of alan breck    their eyes were many and bright   swift were they to behold   many the hands they guided   the sword was alone    the dun deer troop over the hill   they are many the hill is one   the dun deer vanish   the hill remains    come to me from the hills of heather   come from the isles of the sea   o farbeholding eagles   here is your meat  now this song which he made both words and music in the hour of our victory is something less than just to me who stood beside him in the tussle mr shuan and five more were either killed outright or thoroughly disabled but of these two fell by my hand the two that came by the skylight four more were hurt and of that number one and he not the least important got his hurt from me so that altogether i did my fair share both of the killing and the wounding and might have claimed a place in alans verses but poets have to think upon their rhymes and in good prose talk alan always did me more than justice  in the meanwhile i was innocent of any wrong being done me for not only i knew no word of the gaelic but what with the long suspense of the waiting and the scurry and strain of our two spirts of fighting and more than all the horror i had of some of my own share in it the thing was no sooner over than i was glad to stagger to a seat there was that tightness on my chest that i could hardly breathe the thought of the two men i had shot sat upon me like a nightmare and all upon a sudden and before i had a guess of what was coming i began to sob and cry like any child  alan clapped my shoulder and said i was a brave lad and wanted nothing but a sleep  ill take the first watch said he yeve done well by me david first and last and i wouldnt lose you for all appinno nor for breadalbane  so i made up my bed on the floor and he took the first spell pistol in hand and sword on knee three hours by the captains watch upon the wall then he roused me up and i took my turn of three hours before the end of which it was broad day and a very quiet morning with a smooth rolling sea that tossed the ship and made the blood run to and fro on the roundhouse floor and a heavy rain that drummed upon the roof all my watch there was nothing stirring and by the banging of the helm i knew they had even no one at the tiller indeed as i learned afterwards there were so many of them hurt or dead and the rest in so ill a temper that mr riach and the captain had to take turn and turn like alan and me or the brig might have gone ashore and nobody the wiser it was a mercy the night had fallen so still for the wind had gone down as soon as the rain began even as it was i judged by the wailing of a great number of gulls that went crying and fishing round the ship that she must have drifted pretty near the coast or one of the islands of the hebrides and at last looking out of the door of the roundhouse i saw the great stone hills of skye on the right hand and a little more astern the strange isle of rum   footnote    15 bungled     chapter xi  the captain knuckles under   alan and i sat down to breakfast about six of the clock the floor was covered with broken glass and in a horrid mess of blood which took away my hunger in all other ways we were in a situation not only agreeable but merry having ousted the officers from their own cabin and having at command all the drink in the shipboth wine and spiritsand all the dainty part of what was eatable such as the pickles and the fine sort of bread this of itself was enough to set us in good humour but the richest part of it was this that the two thirstiest men that ever came out of scotland mr shuan being dead were now shut in the forepart of the ship and condemned to what they hated mostcold water  and depend upon it alan said we shall hear more of them ere long ye may keep a man from the fighting but never from his bottle  we made good company for each other alan indeed expressed himself most lovingly and taking a knife from the table cut me off one of the silver buttons from his coat  i had them says he from my father duncan stewart and now give ye one of them to be a keepsake for last nights work and wherever ye go and show that button the friends of alan breck will come around you  he said this as if he had been charlemagne and commanded armies and indeed much as i admired his courage i was always in danger of smiling at his vanity in danger i say for had i not kept my countenance i would be afraid to think what a quarrel might have followed  as soon as we were through with our meal he rummaged in the captains locker till he found a clothesbrush and then taking off his coat began to visit his suit and brush away the stains with such care and labour as i supposed to have been only usual with women to be sure he had no other and besides as he said it belonged to a king and so behoved to be royally looked after  for all that when i saw what care he took to pluck out the threads where the button had been cut away i put a higher value on his gift  he was still so engaged when we were hailed by mr riach from the deck asking for a parley and i climbing through the skylight and sitting on the edge of it pistol in hand and with a bold front though inwardly in fear of broken glass hailed him back again and bade him speak out he came to the edge of the roundhouse and stood on a coil of rope so that his chin was on a level with the roof and we looked at each other a while in silence mr riach as i do not think he had been very forward in the battle so he had got off with nothing worse than a blow upon the cheek but he looked out of heart and very weary having been all night afoot either standing watch or doctoring the wounded  this is a bad job said he at last shaking his head  it was none of our choosing said i  the captain says he would like to speak with your friend they might speak at the window  and how do we know what treachery he means cried i  he means none david returned mr riach and if he did ill tell ye the honest truth we couldna get the men to follow  is that so said i  ill tell ye more than that said he its not only the men its me im frichened davie and he smiled across at me no he continued what we want is to be shut of him  thereupon i consulted with alan and the parley was agreed to and parole given upon either side but this was not the whole of mr riachs business and he now begged me for a dram with such instancy and such reminders of his former kindness that at last i handed him a pannikin with about a gill of brandy he drank a part and then carried the rest down upon the deck to share it i suppose with his superior  a little after the captain came as was agreed to one of the windows and stood there in the rain with his arm in a sling and looking stern and pale and so old that my heart smote me for having fired upon him  alan at once held a pistol in his face  put that thing up said the captain have i not passed my word sir or do you seek to affront me  captain says alan i doubt your word is a breakable last night ye haggled and arglebargled like an applewife and then passed me your word and gave me your hand to back it and ye ken very well what was the upshot be damned to your word says he  well well sir said the captain yell get little good by swearing and truly that was a fault of which the captain was quite free but we have other things to speak he continued bitterly yeve made a sore hash of my brig i havent hands enough left to work her and my first officer whom i could ill spare has got your sword throughout his vitals and passed without speech there is nothing left me sir but to put back into the port of glasgow after hands and there by your leave ye will find them that are better able to talk to you  ay said alan and faith ill have a talk with them mysel unless theres naebody speaks english in that town i have a bonny tale for them fifteen tarry sailors upon the one side and a man and a halfling boy upon the other o man its peetiful  hoseason flushed red  no continued alan thatll no do yell just have to set me ashore as we agreed  ay said hoseason but my first officer is deadye ken best how theres none of the rest of us acquaint with this coast sir and its one very dangerous to ships  i give ye your choice says alan set me on dry ground in appin or ardgour or in morven or arisaig or morar or in brief where ye please within thirty miles of my own country except in a country of the campbells thats a broad target if ye miss that ye must be as feckless at the sailoring as i have found ye at the fighting why my poor countrypeople in their bit cobles16 pass from island to island in all weathersay and by night too for the matter of that  a cobles not a ship sir said the captain it has nae draught of water  well then to glasgow if ye list says alan well have the laugh of ye at the least  my mind runs little upon laughing said the captain but all this will cost money sir  well sir says alan i am nae weathercock thirty guineas if ye land me on the seaside and sixty if ye put me in the linnhe loch  but see sir where we lie we are but a few hours sail from ardnamurchan said hoseason give me sixty and ill set ye there  and im to wear my brogues and run jeopardy of the redcoats to please you cries alan no sir if ye want sixty guineas earn them and set me in my own country  its to risk the brig sir said the captain and your own lives along with her  take it or want it says alan  could ye pilot us at all asked the captain who was frowning to himself  well its doubtful said alan im more of a fighting man as ye have seen for yoursel than a sailorman but i have been often enough picked up and set down upon this coast and should ken something of the lie of it  the captain shook his head still frowning  if i had lost less money on this unchancy cruise says he i would see you in a ropesend before i risked my brig sir but be it as ye will as soon as i get a slant of wind and theres some coming or im the more mistaken ill put it in hand but theres one thing more we may meet in with a kings ship and she may lay us aboard sir with no blame of mine they keep the cruisers thick upon this coast ye ken who for now sir if that was to befall ye might leave the money  captain says alan if ye see a pennant it shall be your part to run awayand now as i hear youre a little short of brandy in the forepart ill offer ye a change a bottle of brandy against two buckets of water  that was the last clause of the treaty and was duly executed on both sides so that alan and i could at last wash out the roundhouse and be quit of the memorials of those whom we had slain and the captain and mr riach could be happy again in their own way the name of which was drink   footnote    16 coble a small boat used in fishing     chapter xii  i hear of the red fox   before we had done cleaning out the roundhouse a breeze sprang up from a little to the east of north this blew off the rain and brought out the sun  and here i must explain and the reader would do well to look at a map on the day when the fog fell and we ran down alans boat we had been running through the little minch at dawn after the battle we lay becalmed to the west of the isle of canna or between that and isle eriska in the chain of the long island now to get from there to the linnhe loch the straight course was through the narrows of the sound of mull but the captain had no chart he was afraid to trust his brig so deep among the islands and the wind serving well he preferred to go by west of tiree and come up under the southern coast of the great isle of mull  all day the breeze held in the same point and rather freshened than died down and towards afternoon a swell began to set in from round the outer hebrides our course to go round about the inner isles was to the west of south so that at first we had this swell upon our beam and were much rolled about but after nightfall when we had turned the end of tiree and began to head more to the east the sea came right astern  meanwhile the early part of the day before the swell came up was very pleasant sailing as we were in a bright sunshine and with many mountainous islands upon different sides alan and i sat in the roundhouse with the doors open on each side the wind being straight astern and smoked a pipe or two of the captains fine tobacco it was at this time we heard each others stories which was the more important to me as i gained some knowledge of that wild highland country on which i was so soon to land in those days so close on the back of the great rebellion it was needful a man should know what he was doing when he went upon the heather  it was i that showed the example telling him all my misfortune which he heard with great goodnature only when i came to mention that good friend of mine mr campbell the minister alan fired up and cried out that he hated all that were of that name  why said i he is a man you should be proud to give your hand to  i know nothing i would help a campbell to says he unless it was a leaden bullet i would hunt all of that name like blackcocks if i lay dying i would crawl upon my knees to my chamber window for a shot at one  why alan i cried what ails ye at the campbells  well says he ye ken very well that i am an appin stewart and the campbells have long harried and wasted those of my name ay and got lands of us by treacherybut never with the sword he cried loudly and with the word brought down his fist upon the table but i paid the less attention to this for i knew it was usually said by those who have the underhand theres more than that he continued and all in the same story lying words lying papers tricks fit for a peddler and the show of whats legal over all to make a man the more angry  you that are so wasteful of your buttons said i i can hardly think you would be a good judge of business  ah says he falling again to smiling i got my wastefulness from the same man i got the buttons from and that was my poor father duncan stewart grace be to him he was the prettiest man of his kindred and the best swordsman in the hielands david and that is the same as to say in all the world i should ken for it was him that taught me he was in the black watch when first it was mustered and like other gentleman privates had a gillie at his back to carry his firelock for him on the march well the king it appears was wishful to see hieland swordsmanship and my father and three more were chosen out and sent to london town to let him see it at the best so they were had into the palace and showed the whole art of the sword for two hours at a stretch before king george and queen carline and the butcher cumberland and many more of whom i havena mind and when they were through the king for all he was a rank usurper spoke them fair and gave each man three guineas in his hand now as they were going out of the palace they had a porters lodge to go by and it came in on my father as he was perhaps the first private hieland gentleman that had ever gone by that door it was right he should give the poor porter a proper notion of their quality so he gives the kings three guineas into the mans hand as if it was his common custom the three others that came behind him did the same and there they were on the street never a penny the better for their pains some say it was one that was the first to fee the kings porter and some say it was another but the truth of it is that it was duncan stewart as i am willing to prove with either sword or pistol and that was the father that i had god rest him  i think he was not the man to leave you rich said i  and thats true said alan he left me my breeks to cover me and little besides and that was how i came to enlist which was a black spot upon my character at the best of times and would still be a sore job for me if i fell among the redcoats  what cried i were you in the english army  that was i said alan but i deserted to the right side at prestonpansand thats some comfort  i could scarcely share this view holding desertion under arms for an unpardonable fault in honour but for all i was so young i was wiser than say my thought dear dear says i the punishment is death  ay said he if they got hands on me it would be a short shrift and a lang tow for alan but i have the king of frances commission in my pocket which would aye be some protection  i misdoubt it much said i  i have doubts mysel said alan drily  and good heaven man cried i you that are a condemned rebel and a deserter and a man of the french kingswhat tempts ye back into this country its a braving of providence  tut says alan i have been back every year since fortysix  and what brings ye man cried i  well ye see i weary for my friends and country said he france is a braw place nae doubt but i weary for the heather and the deer and then i have bit things that i attend to whiles i pick up a few lads to serve the king of france recruits ye see and thats aye a little money but the heart of the matter is the business of my chief ardshiel  i thought they called your chief appin said i  ay but ardshiel is the captain of the clan said he which scarcely cleared my mind ye see david he that was all his life so great a man and come of the blood and bearing the name of kings is now brought down to live in a french town like a poor and private person he that had four hundred swords at his whistle i have seen with these eyes of mine buying butter in the marketplace and taking it home in a kaleleaf this is not only a pain but a disgrace to us of his family and clan there are the bairns forbye the children and the hope of appin that must be learned their letters and how to hold a sword in that far country now the tenants of appin have to pay a rent to king george but their hearts are staunch they are true to their chief and what with love and a bit of pressure and maybe a threat or two the poor folk scrape up a second rent for ardshiel well david im the hand that carries it and he struck the belt about his body so that the guineas rang  do they pay both cried i  ay david both says he  what two rents i repeated  ay david says he i told a different tale to yon captain man but this is the truth of it and its wonderful to me how little pressure is needed but thats the handiwork of my good kinsman and my fathers friend james of the glens james stewart that is ardshiels halfbrother he it is that gets the money in and does the management  this was the first time i heard the name of that james stewart who was afterwards so famous at the time of his hanging but i took little heed at the moment for all my mind was occupied with the generosity of these poor highlanders  i call it noble i cried im a whig or little better but i call it noble  ay said he yere a whig but yere a gentleman and thats what does it now if ye were one of the cursed race of campbell ye would gnash your teeth to hear tell of it if ye were the red fox and at that name his teeth shut together and he ceased speaking i have seen many a grim face but never a grimmer than alans when he had named the red fox  and who is the red fox i asked daunted but still curious  who is he cried alan well and ill tell you that when the men of the clans were broken at culloden and the good cause went down and the horses rode over the fetlocks in the best blood of the north ardshiel had to flee like a poor deer upon the mountainshe and his lady and his bairns a sair job we had of it before we got him shipped and while he still lay in the heather the english rogues that couldna come at his life were striking at his rights they stripped him of his powers they stripped him of his lands they plucked the weapons from the hands of his clansmen that had borne arms for thirty centuries ay and the very clothes off their backsso that its now a sin to wear a tartan plaid and a man may be cast into a gaol if he has but a kilt about his legs one thing they couldna kill that was the love the clansmen bore their chief these guineas are the proof of it and now in there steps a man a campbell redheaded colin of glenure  is that him you call the red fox said i  will ye bring me his brush cries alan fiercely ay thats the man in he steps and gets papers from king george to be socalled kings factor on the lands of appin and at first he sings small and is hailfellowwellmet with sheamusthats james of the glens my chieftains agent but byandby that came to his ears that i have just told you how the poor commons of appin the farmers and the crofters and the boumen were wringing their very plaids to get a second rent and send it overseas for ardshiel and his poor bairns what was it ye called it when i told ye  i called it noble alan said i  and you little better than a common whig cries alan but when it came to colin roy the black campbell blood in him ran wild he sat gnashing his teeth at the winetable what should a stewart get a bite of bread and him not be able to prevent it ah red fox if ever i hold you at a guns end the lord have pity upon ye alan stopped to swallow down his anger well david what does he do he declares all the farms to let and thinks he in his black heart ill soon get other tenants thatll overbid these stewarts and maccolls and macrobs for these are all names in my clan david and then thinks he ardshiel will have to hold his bonnet on a french roadside  well said i what followed  alan laid down his pipe which he had long since suffered to go out and set his two hands upon his knees  ay said he yell never guess that for these same stewarts and maccolls and macrobs that had two rents to pay one to king george by stark force and one to ardshiel by natural kindness offered him a better price than any campbell in all broad scotland and far he sent seeking themas far as to the sides of clyde and the cross of edinburghseeking and fleeching and begging them to come where there was a stewart to be starved and a redheaded hound of a campbell to be pleasured  well alan said i that is a strange story and a fine one too and whig as i may be i am glad the man was beaten  him beaten echoed alan its little ye ken of campbells and less of the red fox him beaten no nor will be till his bloods on the hillside but if the day comes david man that i can find time and leisure for a bit of hunting there grows not enough heather in all scotland to hide him from my vengeance  man alan said i ye are neither very wise nor very christian to blow off so many words of anger they will do the man ye call the fox no harm and yourself no good tell me your tale plainly out what did he next  and thats a good observe david said alan troth and indeed they will do him no harm the mores the pity and barring that about christianity of which my opinion is quite otherwise or i would be nae christian i am much of your mind  opinion here or opinion there said i its a kennt thing that christianity forbids revenge  ay said he its well seen it was a campbell taught ye it would be a convenient world for them and their sort if there was no such a thing as a lad and a gun behind a heather bush but thats nothing to the point this is what he did  ay said i come to that  well david said he since he couldna be rid of the loyal commons by fair means he swore he would be rid of them by foul ardshiel was to starve that was the thing he aimed at and since them that fed him in his exile wouldna be bought outright or wrong he would drive them out therefore he sent for lawyers and papers and redcoats to stand at his back and the kindly folk of that country must all pack and tramp every fathers son out of his fathers house and out of the place where he was bred and fed and played when he was a callant and who are to succeed them bareleggit beggars king george is to whistle for his rents he maun dow with less he can spread his butter thinner what cares red colin if he can hurt ardshiel he has his wish if he can pluck the meat from my chieftains table and the bit toys out of his childrens hands he will gang hame singing to glenure  let me have a word said i be sure if they take less rents be sure government has a finger in the pie its not this campbells fault manits his orders and if ye killed this colin tomorrow what better would ye be there would be another factor in his shoes as fast as spur can drive  yere a good lad in a fight said alan but man ye have whig blood in ye  he spoke kindly enough but there was so much anger under his contempt that i thought it was wise to change the conversation i expressed my wonder how with the highlands covered with troops and guarded like a city in a siege a man in his situation could come and go without arrest  its easier than ye would think said alan a bare hillside ye see is like all one road if theres a sentry at one place ye just go by another and then the heathers a great help and everywhere there are friends houses and friends byres and haystacks and besides when folk talk of a country covered with troops its but a kind of a byword at the best a soldier covers nae mair of it than his bootsoles i have fished a water with a sentry on the other side of the brae and killed a fine trout and i have sat in a heather bush within six feet of another and learned a real bonny tune from his whistling this was it said he and whistled me the air  and then besides he continued its no sae bad now as it was in fortysix the hielands are what they call pacified small wonder with never a gun or a sword left from cantyre to cape wrath but what tenty17 folk have hidden in their thatch but what i would like to ken david is just how long not long ye would think with men like ardshiel in exile and men like the red fox sitting birling the wine and oppressing the poor at home but its a kittle thing to decide what folkll bear and what they will not or why would red colin be riding his horse all over my poor country of appin and never a pretty lad to put a bullet in him  and with this alan fell into a muse and for a long time sate very sad and silent  i will add the rest of what i have to say about my friend that he was skilled in all kinds of music but principally pipemusic was a wellconsidered poet in his own tongue had read several books both in french and english was a dead shot a good angler and an excellent fencer with the small sword as well as with his own particular weapon for his faults they were on his face and i now knew them all but the worst of them his childish propensity to take offence and to pick quarrels he greatly laid aside in my case out of regard for the battle of the roundhouse but whether it was because i had done well myself or because i had been a witness of his own much greater prowess is more than i can tell for though he had a great taste for courage in other men yet he admired it most in alan breck   footnote    17 careful     chapter xiii  the loss of the brig   it was already late at night and as dark as it ever would be at that season of the year and that is to say it was still pretty bright when hoseason clapped his head into the roundhouse door  here said he come out and see if ye can pilot  is this one of your tricks asked alan  do i look like tricks cries the captain i have other things to think ofmy brigs in danger  by the concerned look of his face and above all by the sharp tones in which he spoke of his brig it was plain to both of us he was in deadly earnest and so alan and i with no great fear of treachery stepped on deck  the sky was clear it blew hard and was bitter cold a great deal of daylight lingered and the moon which was nearly full shone brightly the brig was closehauled so as to round the southwest corner of the island of mull the hills of which and ben more above them all with a wisp of mist upon the top of it lay full upon the larboard bow though it was no good point of sailing for the covenant she tore through the seas at a great rate pitching and straining and pursued by the westerly swell  altogether it was no such ill night to keep the seas in and i had begun to wonder what it was that sat so heavily upon the captain when the brig rising suddenly on the top of a high swell he pointed and cried to us to look away on the lee bow a thing like a fountain rose out of the moonlit sea and immediately after we heard a low sound of roaring  what do ye call that asked the captain gloomily  the sea breaking on a reef said alan and now ye ken where it is and what better would ye have  ay said hoseason if it was the only one  and sure enough just as he spoke there came a second fountain farther to the south  there said hoseason ye see for yourself if i had kennt of these reefs if i had had a chart or if shuan had been spared its not sixty guineas no nor six hundred would have made me risk my brig in sic a stoneyard but you sir that was to pilot us have ye never a word  im thinking said alan thesell be what they call the torran rocks  are there many of them says the captain  truly sir i am nae pilot said alan but it sticks in my mind there are ten miles of them  mr riach and the captain looked at each other  theres a way through them i suppose said the captain  doubtless said alan but where but it somehow runs in my mind once more that it is clearer under the land  so said hoseason well have to haul our wind then mr riach well have to come as near in about the end of mull as we can take her sir and even then well have the land to kep the wind off us and that stoneyard on our lee well were in for it now and may as well crack on  with that he gave an order to the steersman and sent riach to the foretop there were only five men on deck counting the officers these being all that were fit or at least both fit and willing for their work so as i say it fell to mr riach to go aloft and he sat there looking out and hailing the deck with news of all he saw  the sea to the south is thick he cried and then after a while it does seem clearer in by the land  well sir said hoseason to alan well try your way of it but i think i might as well trust to a blind fiddler pray god youre right  pray god i am says alan to me but where did i hear it well well it will be as it must  as we got nearer to the turn of the land the reefs began to be sown here and there on our very path and mr riach sometimes cried down to us to change the course sometimes indeed none too soon for one reef was so close on the brigs weatherboard that when a sea burst upon it the lighter sprays fell upon her deck and wetted us like rain  the brightness of the night showed us these perils as clearly as by day which was perhaps the more alarming it showed me too the face of the captain as he stood by the steersman now on one foot now on the other and sometimes blowing in his hands but still listening and looking and as steady as steel neither he nor mr riach had shown well in the fighting but i saw they were brave in their own trade and admired them all the more because i found alan very white  ochone david says he this is no the kind of death i fancy  what alan i cried youre not afraid  no said he wetting his lips but youll allow yourself its a cold ending  by this time now and then sheering to one side or the other to avoid a reef but still hugging the wind and the land we had got round iona and begun to come alongside mull the tide at the tail of the land ran very strong and threw the brig about two hands were put to the helm and hoseason himself would sometimes lend a help and it was strange to see three strong men throw their weight upon the tiller and it like a living thing struggle against and drive them back this would have been the greater danger had not the sea been for some while free of obstacles mr riach besides announced from the top that he saw clear water ahead  ye were right said hoseason to alan ye have saved the brig sir ill mind that when we come to clear accounts and i believe he not only meant what he said but would have done it so high a place did the covenant hold in his affections  but this is matter only for conjecture things having gone otherwise than he forecast  keep her away a point sings out mr riach reef to windward  and just at the same time the tide caught the brig and threw the wind out of her sails she came round into the wind like a top and the next moment struck the reef with such a dunch as threw us all flat upon the deck and came near to shake mr riach from his place upon the mast  i was on my feet in a minute the reef on which we had struck was close in under the southwest end of mull off a little isle they call earraid which lay low and black upon the larboard sometimes the swell broke clean over us sometimes it only ground the poor brig upon the reef so that we could hear her beat herself to pieces and what with the great noise of the sails and the singing of the wind and the flying of the spray in the moonlight and the sense of danger i think my head must have been partly turned for i could scarcely understand the things i saw  presently i observed mr riach and the seamen busy round the skiff and still in the same blank ran over to assist them and as soon as i set my hand to work my mind came clear again it was no very easy task for the skiff lay amidships and was full of hamper and the breaking of the heavier seas continually forced us to give over and hold on but we all wrought like horses while we could  meanwhile such of the wounded as could move came clambering out of the forescuttle and began to help while the rest that lay helpless in their bunks harrowed me with screaming and begging to be saved  the captain took no part it seemed he was struck stupid he stood holding by the shrouds talking to himself and groaning out aloud whenever the ship hammered on the rock his brig was like wife and child to him he had looked on day by day at the mishandling of poor ransome but when it came to the brig he seemed to suffer along with her  all the time of our working at the boat i remember only one other thing that i asked alan looking across at the shore what country it was and he answered it was the worst possible for him for it was the land of the campbells  we had one of the wounded men told off to keep a watch upon the seas and cry us warning well we had the boat about ready to be launched when this man sang out pretty shrill for gods sake hold on we knew by his tone that it was something more than ordinary and sure enough there followed a sea so huge that it lifted the brig right up and canted her over on her beam whether the cry came too late or my hold was too weak i know not but at the sudden tilting of the ship i was cast clean over the bulwarks into the sea  i went down and drank my fill and then came up and got a blink of the moon and then down again they say a man sinks a third time for good i cannot be made like other folk then for i would not like to write how often i went down or how often i came up again all the while i was being hurled along and beaten upon and choked and then swallowed whole and the thing was so distracting to my wits that i was neither sorry nor afraid  presently i found i was holding to a spar which helped me somewhat and then all of a sudden i was in quiet water and began to come to myself  it was the spare yard i had got hold of and i was amazed to see how far i had travelled from the brig i hailed her indeed but it was plain she was already out of cry she was still holding together but whether or not they had yet launched the boat i was too far off and too low down to see  while i was hailing the brig i spied a tract of water lying between us where no great waves came but which yet boiled white all over and bristled in the moon with rings and bubbles sometimes the whole tract swung to one side like the tail of a live serpent sometimes for a glimpse it would all disappear and then boil up again what it was i had no guess which for the time increased my fear of it but i now know it must have been the roost or tide race which had carried me away so fast and tumbled me about so cruelly and at last as if tired of that play had flung out me and the spare yard upon its landward margin  i now lay quite becalmed and began to feel that a man can die of cold as well as of drowning the shores of earraid were close in i could see in the moonlight the dots of heather and the sparkling of the mica in the rocks  well thought i to myself if i cannot get as far as that its strange  i had no skill of swimming essen water being small in our neighbourhood but when i laid hold upon the yard with both arms and kicked out with both feet i soon began to find that i was moving hard work it was and mortally slow but in about an hour of kicking and splashing i had got well in between the points of a sandy bay surrounded by low hills  the sea was here quite quiet there was no sound of any surf the moon shone clear and i thought in my heart i had never seen a place so desert and desolate but it was dry land and when at last it grew so shallow that i could leave the yard and wade ashore upon my feet i cannot tell if i was more tired or more grateful both at least i was tired as i never was before that night and grateful to god as i trust i have been often though never with more cause     chapter xiv  the islet   with my stepping ashore i began the most unhappy part of my adventures it was halfpast twelve in the morning and though the wind was broken by the land it was a cold night i dared not sit down for i thought i should have frozen but took off my shoes and walked to and fro upon the sand barefoot and beating my breast with infinite weariness there was no sound of man or cattle not a cock crew though it was about the hour of their first waking only the surf broke outside in the distance which put me in mind of my perils and those of my friend to walk by the sea at that hour of the morning and in a place so desertlike and so lonesome struck me with a kind of fear  as soon as the day began to break i put on my shoes and climbed a hillthe ruggedest scramble i ever undertookfalling the whole way between big blocks of granite or leaping from one to another when i got to the top the dawn was come there was no sign of the brig which must have lifted from the reef and sunk the boat too was nowhere to be seen there was never a sail upon the ocean and in what i could see of the land was neither house nor man  i was afraid to think what had befallen my shipmates and afraid to look longer at so empty a scene what with my wet clothes and weariness and my belly that now began to ache with hunger i had enough to trouble me without that so i set off eastward along the south coast hoping to find a house where i might warm myself and perhaps get news of those i had lost and at the worst i considered the sun would soon rise and dry my clothes  after a little my way was stopped by a creek or inlet of the sea which seemed to run pretty deep into the land and as i had no means to get across i must needs change my direction to go about the end of it it was still the roughest kind of walking indeed the whole not only of earraid but of the neighbouring part of mull which they call the ross is nothing but a jumble of granite rocks with heather in among at first the creek kept narrowing as i had looked to see but presently to my surprise it began to widen out again at this i scratched my head but had still no notion of the truth until at last i came to a rising ground and it burst upon me all in a moment that i was cast upon a little barren isle and cut off on every side by the salt seas  instead of the sun rising to dry me it came on to rain with a thick mist so that my case was lamentable  i stood in the rain and shivered and wondered what to do till it occurred to me that perhaps the creek was fordable back i went to the narrowest point and waded in but not three yards from shore i plumped in head over ears and if ever i was heard of more it was rather by gods grace than my own prudence i was no wetter for that could hardly be but i was all the colder for this mishap and having lost another hope was the more unhappy  and now all at once the yard came in my head what had carried me through the roost would surely serve me to cross this little quiet creek in safety with that i set off undaunted across the top of the isle to fetch and carry it back it was a weary tramp in all ways and if hope had not buoyed me up i must have cast myself down and given up whether with the sea salt or because i was growing fevered i was distressed with thirst and had to stop as i went and drink the peaty water out of the hags  i came to the bay at last more dead than alive and at the first glance i thought the yard was something farther out than when i left it in i went for the third time into the sea the sand was smooth and firm and shelved gradually down so that i could wade out till the water was almost to my neck and the little waves splashed into my face but at that depth my feet began to leave me and i durst venture in no farther as for the yard i saw it bobbing very quietly some twenty feet beyond  i had borne up well until this last disappointment but at that i came ashore and flung myself down upon the sands and wept  the time i spent upon the island is still so horrible a thought to me that i must pass it lightly over in all the books i have read of people cast away they had either their pockets full of tools or a chest of things would be thrown upon the beach along with them as if on purpose my case was very different i had nothing in my pockets but money and alans silver button and being inland bred i was as much short of knowledge as of means  i knew indeed that shellfish were counted good to eat and among the rocks of the isle i found a great plenty of limpets which at first i could scarcely strike from their places not knowing quickness to be needful there were besides some of the little shells that we call buckies i think periwinkle is the english name of these two i made my whole diet devouring them cold and raw as i found them and so hungry was i that at first they seemed to me delicious  perhaps they were out of season or perhaps there was something wrong in the sea about my island but at least i had no sooner eaten my first meal than i was seized with giddiness and retching and lay for a long time no better than dead a second trial of the same food indeed i had no other did better with me and revived my strength but as long as i was on the island i never knew what to expect when i had eaten sometimes all was well and sometimes i was thrown into a miserable sickness nor could i ever distinguish what particular fish it was that hurt me  all day it streamed rain the island ran like a sop there was no dry spot to be found and when i lay down that night between two boulders that made a kind of roof my feet were in a bog  the second day i crossed the island to all sides there was no one part of it better than another it was all desolate and rocky nothing living on it but game birds which i lacked the means to kill and the gulls which haunted the outlying rocks in a prodigious number but the creek or strait that cut off the isle from the main land of the ross opened out on the north into a bay and the bay again opened into the sound of iona and it was the neighbourhood of this place that i chose to be my home though if i had thought upon the very name of home in such a spot i must have burst out weeping  i had good reasons for my choice there was in this part of the isle a little hut of a house like a pigs hut where fishers used to sleep when they came there upon their business but the turf roof of it had fallen entirely in so that the hut was of no use to me and gave me less shelter than my rocks what was more important the shellfish on which i lived grew there in great plenty when the tide was out i could gather a peck at a time and this was doubtless a convenience but the other reason went deeper i had become in no way used to the horrid solitude of the isle but still looked round me on all sides like a man that was hunted between fear and hope that i might see some human creature coming now from a little up the hillside over the bay i could catch a sight of the great ancient church and the roofs of the peoples houses in iona and on the other hand over the low country of the ross i saw smoke go up morning and evening as if from a homestead in a hollow of the land  i used to watch this smoke when i was wet and cold and had my head half turned with loneliness and think of the fireside and the company till my heart burned it was the same with the roofs of iona altogether this sight i had of mens homes and comfortable lives although it put a point on my own sufferings yet it kept hope alive and helped me to eat my raw shellfish which had soon grown to be a disgust and saved me from the sense of horror i had whenever i was quite alone with dead rocks and fowls and the rain and the cold sea  i say it kept hope alive and indeed it seemed impossible that i should be left to die on the shores of my own country and within view of a church tower and the smoke of mens houses but the second day passed and though as long as the light lasted i kept a bright lookout for boats on the sound or men passing on the ross no help came near me it still rained and i turned in to sleep as wet as ever and with a cruel sore throat but a little comforted perhaps by having said goodnight to my next neighbours the people of iona  charles the second declared a man could stay outdoors more days in the year in the climate of england than in any other this was very like a king with a palace at his back and changes of dry clothes but he must have had better luck on his flight from worcester than i had on that miserable isle it was the height of the summer yet it rained for more than twentyfour hours and did not clear until the afternoon of the third day  this was the day of incidents in the morning i saw a red deer a buck with a fine spread of antlers standing in the rain on the top of the island but he had scarce seen me rise from under my rock before he trotted off upon the other side i supposed he must have swum the strait though what should bring any creature to earraid was more than i could fancy  a little after as i was jumping about after my limpets i was startled by a guineapiece which fell upon a rock in front of me and glanced off into the sea when the sailors gave me my money again they kept back not only about a third of the whole sum but my fathers leather purse so that from that day out i carried my gold loose in a pocket with a button i now saw there must be a hole and clapped my hand to the place in a great hurry but this was to lock the stabledoor after the steed was stolen i had left the shore at queensferry with near on fifty pounds now i found no more than two guineapieces and a silver shilling  it is true i picked up a third guinea a little after where it lay shining on a piece of turf that made a fortune of three pounds and four shillings english money for a lad the rightful heir of an estate and now starving on an isle at the extreme end of the wild highlands  this state of my affairs dashed me still further and indeed my plight on that third morning was truly pitiful my clothes were beginning to rot my stockings in particular were quite worn through so that my shanks went naked my hands had grown quite soft with the continual soaking my throat was very sore my strength had much abated and my heart so turned against the horrid stuff i was condemned to eat that the very sight of it came near to sicken me  and yet the worst was not yet come  there is a pretty high rock on the northwest of earraid which because it had a flat top and overlooked the sound i was much in the habit of frequenting not that ever i stayed in one place save when asleep my misery giving me no rest indeed i wore myself down with continual and aimless goings and comings in the rain  as soon however as the sun came out i lay down on the top of that rock to dry myself the comfort of the sunshine is a thing i cannot tell it set me thinking hopefully of my deliverance of which i had begun to despair and i scanned the sea and the ross with a fresh interest on the south of my rock a part of the island jutted out and hid the open ocean so that a boat could thus come quite near me upon that side and i be none the wiser  well all of a sudden a coble with a brown sail and a pair of fishers aboard of it came flying round that corner of the isle bound for iona i shouted out and then fell on my knees on the rock and reached up my hands and prayed to them they were near enough to heari could even see the colour of their hair and there was no doubt but they observed me for they cried out in the gaelic tongue and laughed but the boat never turned aside and flew on right before my eyes for iona  i could not believe such wickedness and ran along the shore from rock to rock crying on them piteously even after they were out of reach of my voice i still cried and waved to them and when they were quite gone i thought my heart would have burst all the time of my troubles i wept only twice once when i could not reach the yard and now the second time when these fishers turned a deaf ear to my cries but this time i wept and roared like a wicked child tearing up the turf with my nails and grinding my face in the earth if a wish would kill men those two fishers would never have seen morning and i should likely have died upon my island  when i was a little over my anger i must eat again but with such loathing of the mess as i could now scarce control sure enough i should have done as well to fast for my fishes poisoned me again i had all my first pains my throat was so sore i could scarce swallow i had a fit of strong shuddering which clucked my teeth together and there came on me that dreadful sense of illness which we have no name for either in scots or english i thought i should have died and made my peace with god forgiving all men even my uncle and the fishers and as soon as i had thus made up my mind to the worst clearness came upon me i observed the night was falling dry my clothes were dried a good deal truly i was in a better case than ever before since i had landed on the isle and so i got to sleep at last with a thought of gratitude  the next day which was the fourth of this horrible life of mine i found my bodily strength run very low but the sun shone the air was sweet and what i managed to eat of the shellfish agreed well with me and revived my courage  i was scarce back on my rock where i went always the first thing after i had eaten before i observed a boat coming down the sound and with her head as i thought in my direction  i began at once to hope and fear exceedingly for i thought these men might have thought better of their cruelty and be coming back to my assistance but another disappointment such as yesterdays was more than i could bear i turned my back accordingly upon the sea and did not look again till i had counted many hundreds the boat was still heading for the island the next time i counted the full thousand as slowly as i could my heart beating so as to hurt me and then it was out of all question she was coming straight to earraid  i could no longer hold myself back but ran to the seaside and out from one rock to another as far as i could go it is a marvel i was not drowned for when i was brought to a stand at last my legs shook under me and my mouth was so dry i must wet it with the seawater before i was able to shout  all this time the boat was coming on and now i was able to perceive it was the same boat and the same two men as yesterday this i knew by their hair which the one had of a bright yellow and the other black but now there was a third man along with them who looked to be of a better class  as soon as they were come within easy speech they let down their sail and lay quiet in spite of my supplications they drew no nearer in and what frightened me most of all the new man teeheed with laughter as he talked and looked at me  then he stood up in the boat and addressed me a long while speaking fast and with many wavings of his hand i told him i had no gaelic and at this he became very angry and i began to suspect he thought he was talking english listening very close i caught the word whateffer several times but all the rest was gaelic and might have been greek and hebrew for me  whatever said i to show him i had caught a word  yes yesyes yes says he and then he looked at the other men as much as to say i told you i spoke english and began again as hard as ever in the gaelic  this time i picked out another word tide then i had a flash of hope i remembered he was always waving his hand towards the mainland of the ross  do you mean when the tide is out i cried and could not finish  yes yes said he tide  at that i turned tail upon their boat where my adviser had once more begun to teehee with laughter leaped back the way i had come from one stone to another and set off running across the isle as i had never run before in about half an hour i came out upon the shores of the creek and sure enough it was shrunk into a little trickle of water through which i dashed not above my knees and landed with a shout on the main island  a seabred boy would not have stayed a day on earraid which is only what they call a tidal islet and except in the bottom of the neaps can be entered and left twice in every twentyfour hours either dryshod or at the most by wading even i who had the tide going out and in before me in the bay and even watched for the ebbs the better to get my shellfisheven i i say if i had sat down to think instead of raging at my fate must have soon guessed the secret and got free it was no wonder the fishers had not understood me the wonder was rather that they had ever guessed my pitiful illusion and taken the trouble to come back i had starved with cold and hunger on that island for close upon one hundred hours but for the fishers i might have left my bones there in pure folly and even as it was i had paid for it pretty dear not only in past sufferings but in my present case being clothed like a beggarman scarce able to walk and in great pain of my sore throat  i have seen wicked men and fools a great many of both and i believe they both get paid in the end but the fools first     chapter xv  the lad with the silver button through the isle of mull   the ross of mull which i had now got upon was rugged and trackless like the isle i had just left being all bog and briar and big stone there may be roads for them that know that country well but for my part i had no better guide than my own nose and no other landmark than ben more  i aimed as well as i could for the smoke i had seen so often from the island and with all my great weariness and the difficulty of the way came upon the house in the bottom of a little hollow about five or six at night it was low and longish roofed with turf and built of unmortared stones and on a mound in front of it an old gentleman sat smoking his pipe in the sun  with what little english he had he gave me to understand that my shipmates had got safe ashore and had broken bread in that very house on the day after  was there one i asked dressed like a gentleman  he said they all wore rough greatcoats but to be sure the first of them the one that came alone wore breeches and stockings while the rest had sailors trousers  ah said i and he would have a feathered hat  he told me no that he was bareheaded like myself  at first i thought alan might have lost his hat and then the rain came in my mind and i judged it more likely he had it out of harms way under his greatcoat this set me smiling partly because my friend was safe partly to think of his vanity in dress  and then the old gentleman clapped his hand to his brow and cried out that i must be the lad with the silver button  why yes said i in some wonder  well then said the old gentleman i have a word for you that you are to follow your friend to his country by torosay  he then asked me how i had fared and i told him my tale a southcountry man would certainly have laughed but this old gentleman i call him so because of his manners for his clothes were dropping off his back heard me all through with nothing but gravity and pity when i had done he took me by the hand led me into his hut it was no better and presented me before his wife as if she had been the queen and i a duke  the good woman set oatbread before me and a cold grouse patting my shoulder and smiling to me all the time for she had no english and the old gentleman not to be behind brewed me a strong punch out of their country spirit all the while i was eating and after that when i was drinking the punch i could scarce come to believe in my good fortune and the house though it was thick with the peatsmoke and as full of holes as a colander seemed like a palace  the punch threw me in a strong sweat and a deep slumber the good people let me lie and it was near noon of the next day before i took the road my throat already easier and my spirits quite restored by good fare and good news the old gentleman although i pressed him hard would take no money and gave me an old bonnet for my head though i am free to own i was no sooner out of view of the house than i very jealously washed this gift of his in a wayside fountain  thought i to myself if these are the wild highlanders i could wish my own folk wilder  i not only started late but i must have wandered nearly half the time true i met plenty of people grubbing in little miserable fields that would not keep a cat or herding little kine about the bigness of asses the highland dress being forbidden by law since the rebellion and the people condemned to the lowland habit which they much disliked it was strange to see the variety of their array some went bare only for a hanging cloak or greatcoat and carried their trousers on their backs like a useless burthen some had made an imitation of the tartan with little particoloured stripes patched together like an old wifes quilt others again still wore the highland philabeg but by putting a few stitches between the legs transformed it into a pair of trousers like a dutchmans all those makeshifts were condemned and punished for the law was harshly applied in hopes to break up the clan spirit but in that outoftheway seabound isle there were few to make remarks and fewer to tell tales  they seemed in great poverty which was no doubt natural now that rapine was put down and the chiefs kept no longer an open house and the roads even such a wandering country bytrack as the one i followed were infested with beggars and here again i marked a difference from my own part of the country for our lowland beggarseven the gownsmen themselves who beg by patenthad a louting flattering way with them and if you gave them a plack and asked change would very civilly return you a boddle but these highland beggars stood on their dignity asked alms only to buy snuff by their account and would give no change  to be sure this was no concern of mine except in so far as it entertained me by the way what was much more to the purpose few had any english and these few unless they were of the brotherhood of beggars not very anxious to place it at my service i knew torosay to be my destination and repeated the name to them and pointed but instead of simply pointing in reply they would give me a screed of the gaelic that set me foolish so it was small wonder if i went out of my road as often as i stayed in it  at last about eight at night and already very weary i came to a lone house where i asked admittance and was refused until i bethought me of the power of money in so poor a country and held up one of my guineas in my finger and thumb thereupon the man of the house who had hitherto pretended to have no english and driven me from his door by signals suddenly began to speak as clearly as was needful and agreed for five shillings to give me a nights lodging and guide me the next day to torosay  i slept uneasily that night fearing i should be robbed but i might have spared myself the pain for my host was no robber only miserably poor and a great cheat he was not alone in his poverty for the next morning we must go five miles about to the house of what he called a rich man to have one of my guineas changed this was perhaps a rich man for mull he would have scarce been thought so in the south for it took all he hadthe whole house was turned upside down and a neighbour brought under contribution before he could scrape together twenty shillings in silver the odd shilling he kept for himself protesting he could ill afford to have so great a sum of money lying locked up for all that he was very courteous and well spoken made us both sit down with his family to dinner and brewed punch in a fine china bowl over which my rascal guide grew so merry that he refused to start  i was for getting angry and appealed to the rich man hector maclean was his name who had been a witness to our bargain and to my payment of the five shillings but maclean had taken his share of the punch and vowed that no gentleman should leave his table after the bowl was brewed so there was nothing for it but to sit and hear jacobite toasts and gaelic songs till all were tipsy and staggered off to the bed or the barn for their nights rest  next day the fourth of my travels we were up before five upon the clock but my rascal guide got to the bottle at once and it was three hours before i had him clear of the house and then as you shall hear only for a worse disappointment  as long as we went down a heathery valley that lay before mr macleans house all went well only my guide looked constantly over his shoulder and when i asked him the cause only grinned at me no sooner however had we crossed the back of a hill and got out of sight of the house windows than he told me torosay lay right in front and that a hilltop which he pointed out was my best landmark  i care very little for that said i since you are going with me  the impudent cheat answered me in the gaelic that he had no english  my fine fellow i said i know very well your english comes and goes tell me what will bring it back is it more money you wish  five shillings mair said he and hersel will bring ye there  i reflected a while and then offered him two which he accepted greedily and insisted on having in his hands at oncefor luck as he said but i think it was rather for my misfortune  the two shillings carried him not quite as many miles at the end of which distance he sat down upon the wayside and took off his brogues from his feet like a man about to rest  i was now redhot ha said i have you no more english  he said impudently no  at that i boiled over and lifted my hand to strike him and he drawing a knife from his rags squatted back and grinned at me like a wild cat at that forgetting everything but my anger i ran in upon him put aside his knife with my left and struck him in the mouth with the right i was a strong lad and very angry and he but a little man and he went down before me heavily by good luck his knife flew out of his hand as he fell  i picked up both that and his brogues wished him a good morning and set off upon my way leaving him barefoot and disarmed i chuckled to myself as i went being sure i was done with that rogue for a variety of reasons first he knew he could have no more of my money next the brogues were worth in that country only a few pence and lastly the knife which was really a dagger it was against the law for him to carry  in about half an hour of walk i overtook a great ragged man moving pretty fast but feeling before him with a staff he was quite blind and told me he was a catechist which should have put me at my ease but his face went against me it seemed dark and dangerous and secret and presently as we began to go on alongside i saw the steel butt of a pistol sticking from under the flap of his coatpocket to carry such a thing meant a fine of fifteen pounds sterling upon a first offence and transportation to the colonies upon a second nor could i quite see why a religious teacher should go armed or what a blind man could be doing with a pistol  i told him about my guide for i was proud of what i had done and my vanity for once got the heels of my prudence at the mention of the five shillings he cried out so loud that i made up my mind i should say nothing of the other two and was glad he could not see my blushes  was it too much i asked a little faltering  too much cries he why i will guide you to torosay myself for a dram of brandy and give you the great pleasure of my company me that is a man of some learning in the bargain  i said i did not see how a blind man could be a guide but at that he laughed aloud and said his stick was eyes enough for an eagle  in the isle of mull at least says he where i knew every stone and heatherbush by mark of head see now he said striking right and left as if to make sure down there a burn is running and at the head of it there stands a bit of a small hill with a stone cocked upon the top of that and its hard at the foot of the hill that the way runs by to torosay and the way here being for droves is plainly trodden and will show grassy through the heather  i had to own he was right in every feature and told my wonder  ha says he thats nothing would ye believe me now that before the act came out and when there were weepons in this country i could shoot ay could i cries he and then with a leer if ye had such a thing as a pistol here to try with i would show you how its done  i told him i had nothing of the sort and gave him a wider berth if he had known his pistol stuck at that time quite plainly out of his pocket and i could see the sun twinkle on the steel of the butt but by the better luck for me he knew nothing thought all was covered and lied on in the dark  he then began to question me cunningly where i came from whether i was rich whether i could change a fiveshilling piece for him which he declared he had that moment in his sporran and all the time he kept edging up to me and i avoiding him we were now upon a sort of green cattletrack which crossed the hills towards torosay and we kept changing sides upon that like dancers in a reel i had so plainly the upper hand that my spirits rose and indeed i took a pleasure in this game of blindmansbuff but the catechist grew angrier and angrier and at last began to swear in gaelic and to strike for my legs with his staff  then i told him that sure enough i had a pistol in my pocket as well as he and if he did not strike across the hill due south i would even blow his brains out  he became at once very polite and after trying to soften me for some time but quite in vain he cursed me once more in gaelic and took himself off i watched him striding along through bog and briar tapping with his stick until he turned the end of a hill and disappeared in the next hollow then i struck on again for torosay much better pleased to be alone than to travel with that man of learning this was an unlucky day and these two of whom i had just rid myself one after the other were the two worst men i met with in the highlands  at torosay on the sound of mull and looking over to the mainland of morven there was an inn with an innkeeper who was a maclean it appeared of a very high family for to keep an inn is thought even more genteel in the highlands than it is with us perhaps as partaking of hospitality or perhaps because the trade is idle and drunken he spoke good english and finding me to be something of a scholar tried me first in french where he easily beat me and then in the latin in which i dont know which of us did best this pleasant rivalry put us at once upon friendly terms and i sat up and drank punch with him or to be more correct sat up and watched him drink it until he was so tipsy that he wept upon my shoulder  i tried him as if by accident with a sight of alans button but it was plain he had never seen or heard of it indeed he bore some grudge against the family and friends of ardshiel and before he was drunk he read me a lampoon in very good latin but with a very ill meaning which he had made in elegiac verses upon a person of that house  when i told him of my catechist he shook his head and said i was lucky to have got clear off that is a very dangerous man he said duncan mackiegh is his name he can shoot by the ear at several yards and has been often accused of highway robberies and once of murder  the cream of it is says i that he called himself a catechist  and why should he not says he when that is what he is it was maclean of duart gave it to him because he was blind but perhaps it was a peety says my host for he is always on the road going from one place to another to hear the young folk say their religion and doubtless that is a great temptation to the poor man  at last when my landlord could drink no more he showed me to a bed and i lay down in very good spirits having travelled the greater part of that big and crooked island of mull from earraid to torosay fifty miles as the crow flies and with my wanderings much nearer a hundred in four days and with little fatigue indeed i was by far in better heart and health of body at the end of that long tramp than i had been at the beginning     chapter xvi  the lad with the silver button across morven   there is a regular ferry from torosay to kinlochaline on the mainland both shores of the sound are in the country of the strong clan of the macleans and the people that passed the ferry with me were almost all of that clan the skipper of the boat on the other hand was called neil roy macrob and since macrob was one of the names of alans clansmen and alan himself had sent me to that ferry i was eager to come to private speech of neil roy  in the crowded boat this was of course impossible and the passage was a very slow affair there was no wind and as the boat was wretchedly equipped we could pull but two oars on one side and one on the other the men gave way however with a good will the passengers taking spells to help them and the whole company giving the time in gaelic boatsongs and what with the songs and the seaair and the goodnature and spirit of all concerned and the bright weather the passage was a pretty thing to have seen  but there was one melancholy part in the mouth of loch aline we found a great seagoing ship at anchor and this i supposed at first to be one of the kings cruisers which were kept along that coast both summer and winter to prevent communication with the french as we got a little nearer it became plain she was a ship of merchandise and what still more puzzled me not only her decks but the seabeach also were quite black with people and skiffs were continually plying to and fro between them yet nearer and there began to come to our ears a great sound of mourning the people on board and those on the shore crying and lamenting one to another so as to pierce the heart  then i understood this was an emigrant ship bound for the american colonies  we put the ferryboat alongside and the exiles leaned over the bulwarks weeping and reaching out their hands to my fellowpassengers among whom they counted some near friends how long this might have gone on i do not know for they seemed to have no sense of time but at last the captain of the ship who seemed near beside himself and no great wonder in the midst of this crying and confusion came to the side and begged us to depart  thereupon neil sheered off and the chief singer in our boat struck into a melancholy air which was presently taken up both by the emigrants and their friends upon the beach so that it sounded from all sides like a lament for the dying i saw the tears run down the cheeks of the men and women in the boat even as they bent at the oars and the circumstances and the music of the song which is one called lochaber no more were highly affecting even to myself  at kinlochaline i got neil roy upon one side on the beach and said i made sure he was one of appins men  and what for no said he  i am seeking somebody said i and it comes in my mind that you will have news of him alan breck stewart is his name and very foolishly instead of showing him the button i sought to pass a shilling in his hand  at this he drew back i am very much affronted he said and this is not the way that one shentleman should behave to another at all the man you ask for is in france but if he was in my sporran says he and your belly full of shillings i would not hurt a hair upon his body  i saw i had gone the wrong way to work and without wasting time upon apologies showed him the button lying in the hollow of my palm  aweel aweel said neil and i think ye might have begun with that end of the stick whatever but if ye are the lad with the silver button all is well and i have the word to see that ye come safe but if ye will pardon me to speak plainly says he there is a name that you should never take into your mouth and that is the name of alan breck and there is a thing that ye would never do and that is to offer your dirty money to a hieland shentleman  it was not very easy to apologise for i could scarce tell him what was the truth that i had never dreamed he would set up to be a gentleman until he told me so neil on his part had no wish to prolong his dealings with me only to fulfil his orders and be done with it and he made haste to give me my route this was to lie the night in kinlochaline in the public inn to cross morven the next day to ardgour and lie the night in the house of one john of the claymore who was warned that i might come the third day to be set across one loch at corran and another at balachulish and then ask my way to the house of james of the glens at aucharn in duror of appin there was a good deal of ferrying as you hear the sea in all this part running deep into the mountains and winding about their roots it makes the country strong to hold and difficult to travel but full of prodigious wild and dreadful prospects  i had some other advice from neil to speak with no one by the way to avoid whigs campbells and the redsoldiers to leave the road and lie in a bush if i saw any of the latter coming for it was never chancy to meet in with them and in brief to conduct myself like a robber or a jacobite agent as perhaps neil thought me  the inn at kinlochaline was the most beggarly vile place that ever pigs were styed in full of smoke vermin and silent highlanders i was not only discontented with my lodging but with myself for my mismanagement of neil and thought i could hardly be worse off but very wrongly as i was soon to see for i had not been half an hour at the inn standing in the door most of the time to ease my eyes from the peatsmoke when a thunderstorm came close by the springs broke in a little hill on which the inn stood and one end of the house became a running water places of public entertainment were bad enough all over scotland in those days yet it was a wonder to myself when i had to go from the fireside to the bed in which i slept wading over the shoes  early in my next days journey i overtook a little stout solemn man walking very slowly with his toes turned out sometimes reading in a book and sometimes marking the place with his finger and dressed decently and plainly in something of a clerical style  this i found to be another catechist but of a different order from the blind man of mull being indeed one of those sent out by the edinburgh society for propagating christian knowledge to evangelise the more savage places of the highlands his name was henderland he spoke with the broad southcountry tongue which i was beginning to weary for the sound of and besides common countryship we soon found we had a more particular bond of interest for my good friend the minister of essendean had translated into the gaelic in his bytime a number of hymns and pious books which henderland used in his work and held in great esteem indeed it was one of these he was carrying and reading when we met  we fell in company at once our ways lying together as far as to kingairloch as we went he stopped and spoke with all the wayfarers and workers that we met or passed and though of course i could not tell what they discoursed about yet i judged mr henderland must be well liked in the countryside for i observed many of them to bring out their mulls and share a pinch of snuff with him  i told him as far in my affairs as i judged wise as far that is as they were none of alans and gave balachulish as the place i was travelling to to meet a friend for i thought aucharn or even duror would be too particular and might put him on the scent  on his part he told me much of his work and the people he worked among the hiding priests and jacobites the disarming act the dress and many other curiosities of the time and place he seemed moderate blaming parliament in several points and especially because they had framed the act more severely against those who wore the dress than against those who carried weapons  this moderation put it in my mind to question him of the red fox and the appin tenants questions which i thought would seem natural enough in the mouth of one travelling to that country  he said it was a bad business its wonderful said he where the tenants find the money for their life is mere starvation ye dont carry such a thing as snuff do ye mr balfour no well im better wanting it but these tenants as i was saying are doubtless partly driven to it james stewart in duror thats him they call james of the glens is halfbrother to ardshiel the captain of the clan and he is a man much looked up to and drives very hard and then theres one they call alan breck  ah cried i what of him  what of the wind that bloweth where it listeth said henderland hes here and awa here today and gone tomorrow a fair heathercat he might be glowering at the two of us out of yon whinbush and i wouldna wonder yell no carry such a thing as snuff will ye  i told him no and that he had asked the same thing more than once  its highly possible said he sighing but it seems strange ye shouldna carry it however as i was saying this alan breck is a bold desperate customer and well kennt to be jamess right hand his life is forfeit already he would boggle at naething and maybe if a tenantbody was to hang back he would get a dirk in his wame  you make a poor story of it all mr henderland said i if it is all fear upon both sides i care to hear no more of it  na said mr henderland but theres love too and selfdenial that should put the like of you and me to shame theres something fine about it no perhaps christian but humanly fine even alan breck by all that i hear is a chield to be respected theres many a lying sneckdraw sits close in kirk in our own part of the country and stands well in the worlds eye and maybe is a far worse man mr balfour than yon misguided shedder of mans blood ay ay we might take a lesson by themyell perhaps think ive been too long in the hielands he added smiling to me  i told him not at all that i had seen much to admire among the highlanders and if he came to that mr campbell himself was a highlander  ay said he thats true its a fine blood  and what is the kings agent about i asked  colin campbell says henderland putting his head in a bees byke  he is to turn the tenants out by force i hear said i  yes says he but the business has gone back and forth as folks say first james of the glens rode to edinburgh and got some lawyer a stewart nae doubtthey all hing together like bats in a steeple and had the proceedings stayed and then colin campbell cam in again and had the upper hand before the barons of exchequer and now they tell me the first of the tenants are to flit tomorrow its to begin at duror under jamess very windows which doesna seem wise by my humble way of it  do you think theyll fight i asked  well says henderland theyre disarmedor supposed to befor theres still a good deal of cold iron lying by in quiet places and then colin campbell has the sogers coming but for all that if i was his lady wife i wouldna be well pleased till i got him home again theyre queer customers the appin stewarts  i asked if they were worse than their neighbours  no they said he and thats the worst part of it for if colin roy can get his business done in appin he has it all to begin again in the next country which they call mamore and which is one of the countries of the camerons hes kings factor upon both and from both he has to drive out the tenants and indeed mr balfour to be open with ye its my belief that if he escapes the one lot hell get his death by the other  so we continued talking and walking the great part of the day until at last mr henderland after expressing his delight in my company and satisfaction at meeting with a friend of mr campbells whom says he i will make bold to call that sweet singer of our covenanted zion proposed that i should make a short stage and lie the night in his house a little beyond kingairloch to say truth i was overjoyed for i had no great desire for john of the claymore and since my double misadventure first with the guide and next with the gentleman skipper i stood in some fear of any highland stranger accordingly we shook hands upon the bargain and came in the afternoon to a small house standing alone by the shore of the linnhe loch the sun was already gone from the desert mountains of ardgour upon the hither side but shone on those of appin on the farther the loch lay as still as a lake only the gulls were crying round the sides of it and the whole place seemed solemn and uncouth  we had no sooner come to the door of mr henderlands dwelling than to my great surprise for i was now used to the politeness of highlanders he burst rudely past me dashed into the room caught up a jar and a small horn spoon and began ladling snuff into his nose in most excessive quantities then he had a hearty fit of sneezing and looked round upon me with a rather silly smile  its a vow i took says he i took a vow upon me that i wouldna carry it doubtless its a great privation but when i think upon the martyrs not only to the scottish covenant but to other points of christianity i think shame to mind it  as soon as we had eaten and porridge and whey was the best of the good mans diet he took a grave face and said he had a duty to perform by mr campbell and that was to inquire into my state of mind towards god i was inclined to smile at him since the business of the snuff but he had not spoken long before he brought the tears into my eyes there are two things that men should never weary of goodness and humility we get none too much of them in this rough world among cold proud people but mr henderland had their very speech upon his tongue and though i was a good deal puffed up with my adventures and with having come off as the saying is with flying colours yet he soon had me on my knees beside a simple poor old man and both proud and glad to be there  before we went to bed he offered me sixpence to help me on my way out of a scanty store he kept in the turf wall of his house at which excess of goodness i knew not what to do but at last he was so earnest with me that i thought it the more mannerly part to let him have his way and so left him poorer than myself     chapter xvii  the death of the red fox   the next day mr henderland found for me a man who had a boat of his own and was to cross the linnhe loch that afternoon into appin fishing him he prevailed on to take me for he was one of his flock and in this way i saved a long days travel and the price of the two public ferries i must otherwise have passed  it was near noon before we set out a dark day with clouds and the sun shining upon little patches the sea was here very deep and still and had scarce a wave upon it so that i must put the water to my lips before i could believe it to be truly salt the mountains on either side were high rough and barren very black and gloomy in the shadow of the clouds but all silverlaced with little watercourses where the sun shone upon them it seemed a hard country this of appin for people to care as much about as alan did  there was but one thing to mention a little after we had started the sun shone upon a little moving clump of scarlet close in along the waterside to the north it was much of the same red as soldiers coats every now and then too there came little sparks and lightnings as though the sun had struck upon bright steel  i asked my boatman what it should be and he answered he supposed it was some of the redsoldiers coming from fort william into appin against the poor tenantry of the country well it was a sad sight to me and whether it was because of my thoughts of alan or from something prophetic in my bosom although this was but the second time i had seen king georges troops i had no good will to them  at last we came so near the point of land at the entering in of loch leven that i begged to be set on shore my boatman who was an honest fellow and mindful of his promise to the catechist would fain have carried me on to balachulish but as this was to take me farther from my secret destination i insisted and was set on shore at last under the wood of lettermore or lettervore for i have heard it both ways in alans country of appin  this was a wood of birches growing on a steep craggy side of a mountain that overhung the loch it had many openings and ferny howes and a road or bridletrack ran north and south through the midst of it by the edge of which where was a spring i sat down to eat some oatbread of mr henderlands and think upon my situation  here i was not only troubled by a cloud of stinging midges but far more by the doubts of my mind what i ought to do why i was going to join myself with an outlaw and a wouldbe murderer like alan whether i should not be acting more like a man of sense to tramp back to the south country direct by my own guidance and at my own charges and what mr campbell or even mr henderland would think of me if they should ever learn my folly and presumption these were the doubts that now began to come in on me stronger than ever  as i was so sitting and thinking a sound of men and horses came to me through the wood and presently after at the turning of the road i saw four travellers come into view the way was in this part so rough and narrow that they came single and led their horses by the reins the first was a great redheaded gentleman of an imperious and flushed face who carried his hat in his hand and fanned himself for he was in a breathing heat the second by his decent black garb and white wig i correctly took to be a lawyer the third was a servant and wore some part of his clothes in tartan which showed that his master was of a highland family and either an outlaw or else in singular good odour with the government since the wearing of tartan was against the act if i had been better versed in these things i would have known the tartan to be of the argyle or campbell colours this servant had a goodsized portmanteau strapped on his horse and a net of lemons to brew punch with hanging at the saddlebow as was often enough the custom with luxurious travellers in that part of the country  as for the fourth who brought up the tail i had seen his like before and knew him at once to be a sheriffs officer  i had no sooner seen these people coming than i made up my mind for no reason that i can tell to go through with my adventure and when the first came alongside of me i rose up from the bracken and asked him the way to aucharn  he stopped and looked at me as i thought a little oddly and then turning to the lawyer mungo said he theres many a man would think this more of a warning than two pyats here am i on my road to duror on the job ye ken and here is a young lad starts up out of the bracken and speers if i am on the way to aucharn  glenure said the other this is an ill subject for jesting  these two had now drawn close up and were gazing at me while the two followers had halted about a stonecast in the rear  and what seek ye in aucharn said colin roy campbell of glenure him they called the red fox for he it was that i had stopped  the man that lives there said i  james of the glens says glenure musingly and then to the lawyer is he gathering his people think ye  anyway says the lawyer we shall do better to bide where we are and let the soldiers rally us  if you are concerned for me said i i am neither of his people nor yours but an honest subject of king george owing no man and fearing no man  why very well said replies the factor but if i may make so bold as ask what does this honest man so far from his country and why does he come seeking the brother of ardshiel i have power here i must tell you i am kings factor upon several of these estates and have twelve flies of soldiers at my back  i have heard a waif word in the country said i a little nettled that you were a hard man to drive  he still kept looking at me as if in doubt  well said he at last your tongue is bold but i am no unfriend to plainness if ye had asked me the way to the door of james stewart on any other day but this i would have set ye right and bidden ye godspeed but todayeh mungo and he turned again to look at the lawyer  but just as he turned there came the shot of a firelock from higher up the hill and with the very sound of it glenure fell upon the road  o i am dead he cried several times over  the lawyer had caught him up and held him in his arms the servant standing over and clasping his hands and now the wounded man looked from one to another with scared eyes and there was a change in his voice that went to the heart  take care of yourselves says he i am dead  he tried to open his clothes as if to look for the wound but his fingers slipped on the buttons with that he gave a great sigh his head rolled on his shoulder and he passed away  the lawyer said never a word but his face was as sharp as a pen and as white as the dead mans the servant broke out into a great noise of crying and weeping like a child and i on my side stood staring at them in a kind of horror the sheriffs officer had run back at the first sound of the shot to hasten the coming of the soldiers  at last the lawyer laid down the dead man in his blood upon the road and got to his own feet with a kind of stagger  i believe it was his movement that brought me to my senses for he had no sooner done so than i began to scramble up the hill crying out the murderer the murderer  so little a time had elapsed that when i got to the top of the first steepness and could see some part of the open mountain the murderer was still moving away at no great distance he was a big man in a black coat with metal buttons and carried a long fowlingpiece  here i cried i see him  at that the murderer gave a little quick look over his shoulder and began to run the next moment he was lost in a fringe of birches then he came out again on the upper side where i could see him climbing like a jackanapes for that part was again very steep and then he dipped behind a shoulder and i saw him no more  all this time i had been running on my side and had got a good way up when a voice cried upon me to stand  i was at the edge of the upper wood and so now when i halted and looked back i saw all the open part of the hill below me  the lawyer and the sheriffs officer were standing just above the road crying and waving on me to come back and on their left the redcoats musket in hand were beginning to struggle singly out of the lower wood  why should i come back i cried come you on  ten pounds if ye take that lad cried the lawyer hes an accomplice he was posted here to hold us in talk  at that word which i could hear quite plainly though it was to the soldiers and not to me that he was crying it my heart came in my mouth with quite a new kind of terror indeed it is one thing to stand the danger of your life and quite another to run the peril of both life and character the thing besides had come so suddenly like thunder out of a clear sky that i was all amazed and helpless  the soldiers began to spread some of them to run and others to put up their pieces and cover me and still i stood  jouk18 in here among the trees said a voice close by  indeed i scarce knew what i was doing but i obeyed and as i did so i heard the firelocks bang and the balls whistle in the birches  just inside the shelter of the trees i found alan breck standing with a fishingrod he gave me no salutation indeed it was no time for civilities only come says he and set off running along the side of the mountain towards balachulish and i like a sheep to follow him  now we ran among the birches now stooping behind low humps upon the mountain side now crawling on allfours among the heather the pace was deadly my heart seemed bursting against my ribs and i had neither time to think nor breath to speak with only i remember seeing with wonder that alan every now and then would straighten himself to his full height and look back and every time he did so there came a great faraway cheering and crying of the soldiers  quarter of an hour later alan stopped clapped down flat in the heather and turned to me  now said he its earnest do as i do for your life  at the same speed but now with infinitely more precaution we traced back again across the mountain side by the same way that we had come only perhaps higher till at last alan threw himself down in the upper wood of lettermore where i had found him at the first and lay with his face in the bracken panting like a dog  my own sides so ached my head so swam my tongue so hung out of my mouth with heat and dryness that i lay beside him like one dead   footnote    18 duck     chapter xviii  i talk with alan in the wood of lettermore   alan was the first to come round he rose went to the border of the wood peered out a little and then returned and sat down  well said he yon was a hot burst david  i said nothing nor so much as lifted my face i had seen murder done and a great ruddy jovial gentleman struck out of life in a moment the pity of that sight was still sore within me and yet that was but a part of my concern here was murder done upon the man alan hated here was alan skulking in the trees and running from the troops and whether his was the hand that fired or only the head that ordered signified but little by my way of it my only friend in that wild country was bloodguilty in the first degree i held him in horror i could not look upon his face i would have rather lain alone in the rain on my cold isle than in that warm wood beside a murderer  are ye still wearied he asked again  no said i still with my face in the bracken no i am not wearied now and i can speak you and me must twine19 i said i liked you very well alan but your ways are not mine and theyre not gods and the short and the long of it is just that we must twine  i will hardly twine from ye david without some kind of reason for the same said alan mighty gravely if ye ken anything against my reputation its the least thing that ye should do for old acquaintance sake to let me hear the name of it and if ye have only taken a distaste to my society it will be proper for me to judge if im insulted  alan said i what is the sense of this ye ken very well yon campbell man lies in his blood upon the road  he was silent for a little then says he did ever ye hear tell of the story of the man and the good peopleby which he meant the fairies  no said i nor do i want to hear it  with your permission mr balfour i will tell it you whatever says alan the man ye should ken was cast upon a rock in the sea where it appears the good people were in use to come and rest as they went through to ireland the name of this rock is called the skerryvore and its not far from where we suffered shipwreck well it seems the man cried so sore if he could just see his little bairn before he died that at last the king of the good people took peety upon him and sent one flying that brought back the bairn in a poke20 and laid it down beside the man where he lay sleeping so when the man woke there was a poke beside him and something into the inside of it that moved well it seemed he was one of these gentry that think aye the worst of things and for greater security he stuck his dirk throughout that poke before he opened it and there was his bairn dead i am thinking to myself mr balfour that you and the man are very much alike  do you mean you had no hand in it cried i sitting up  i will tell you first of all mr balfour of shaws as one friend to another said alan that if i were going to kill a gentleman it would not be in my own country to bring trouble on my clan and i would not go wanting sword and gun and with a long fishingrod upon my back  well said i thats true  and now continued alan taking out his dirk and laying his hand upon it in a certain manner i swear upon the holy iron i had neither art nor part act nor thought in it  i thank god for that cried i and offered him my hand  he did not appear to see it  and here is a great deal of work about a campbell said he they are not so scarce that i ken  at least said i you cannot justly blame me for you know very well what you told me in the brig but the temptation and the act are different i thank god again for that we may all be tempted but to take a life in cold blood alan and i could say no more for the moment and do you know who did it i added do you know that man in the black coat  i have nae clear mind about his coat said alan cunningly but it sticks in my head that it was blue  blue or black did ye know him said i  i couldna just conscientiously swear to him says alan he gaed very close by me to be sure but its a strange thing that i should just have been tying my brogues  can you swear that you dont know him alan i cried half angered half in a mind to laugh at his evasions  no yet says he but ive a grand memory for forgetting david  and yet there was one thing i saw clearly said i and that was that you exposed yourself and me to draw the soldiers  its very likely said alan and so would any gentleman you and me were innocent of that transaction  the better reason since we were falsely suspected that we should get clear i cried the innocent should surely come before the guilty  why david said he the innocent have aye a chance to get assoiled in court but for the lad that shot the bullet i think the best place for him will be the heather them that havena dipped their hands in any little difficulty should be very mindful of the case of them that have and that is the good christianity for if it was the other way round about and the lad whom i couldna just clearly see had been in our shoes and we in his as might very well have been i think we would be a good deal obliged to him oursels if he would draw the soldiers  when it came to this i gave alan up but he looked so innocent all the time and was in such clear good faith in what he said and so ready to sacrifice himself for what he deemed his duty that my mouth was closed mr henderlands words came back to me that we ourselves might take a lesson by these wild highlanders well here i had taken mine alans morals were all tailfirst but he was ready to give his life for them such as they were  alan said i ill not say its the good christianity as i understand it but its good enough and here i offer ye my hand for the second time  whereupon he gave me both of his saying surely i had cast a spell upon him for he could forgive me anything then he grew very grave and said we had not much time to throw away but must both flee that country he because he was a deserter and the whole of appin would now be searched like a chamber and every one obliged to give a good account of himself and i because i was certainly involved in the murder  o says i willing to give him a little lesson i have no fear of the justice of my country  as if this was your country said he or as if ye would be tried here in a country of stewarts  its all scotland said i  man i whiles wonder at ye said alan this is a campbell thats been killed well itll be tried in inverara the campbells head place with fifteen campbells in the jurybox and the biggest campbell of all and thats the duke sitting cocking on the bench justice david the same justice by all the world as glenure found a while ago at the roadside  this frighted me a little i confess and would have frighted me more if i had known how nearly exact were alans predictions indeed it was but in one point that he exaggerated there being but eleven campbells on the jury though as the other four were equally in the dukes dependence it mattered less than might appear still i cried out that he was unjust to the duke of argyle who for all he was a whig was yet a wise and honest nobleman  hoot said alan the mans a whig nae doubt but i would never deny he was a good chieftain to his clan and what would the clan think if there was a campbell shot and naebody hanged and their own chief the justicegeneral but i have often observed says alan that you lowcountry bodies have no clear idea of whats right and wrong  at this i did at last laugh out aloud when to my surprise alan joined in and laughed as merrily as myself  na na said he were in the hielands david and when i tell ye to run take my word and run nae doubt its a hard thing to skulk and starve in the heather but its harder yet to lie shackled in a redcoat prison  i asked him whither we should flee and as he told me to the lowlands i was a little better inclined to go with him for indeed i was growing impatient to get back and have the upper hand of my uncle besides alan made so sure there would be no question of justice in the matter that i began to be afraid he might be right of all deaths i would truly like least to die by the gallows and the picture of that uncanny instrument came into my head with extraordinary clearness as i had once seen it engraved at the top of a pedlars ballad and took away my appetite for courts of justice  ill chance it alan said i ill go with you  but mind you said alan its no small thing ye maun lie bare and hard and brook many an empty belly your bed shall be the muircocks and your life shall be like the hunted deers and ye shall sleep with your hand upon your weapons ay man ye shall taigle many a weary foot or we get clear i tell ye this at the start for its a life that i ken well but if ye ask what other chance ye have i answer nane either take to the heather with me or else hang  and thats a choice very easily made said i and we shook hands upon it  and now lets take another keek at the redcoats says alan and he led me to the northeastern fringe of the wood  looking out between the trees we could see a great side of mountain running down exceeding steep into the waters of the loch it was a rough part all hanging stone and heather and bit scrogs of birchwood and away at the far end towards balachulish little wee red soldiers were dipping up and down over hill and howe and growing smaller every minute there was no cheering now for i think they had other uses for what breath was left them but they still stuck to the trail and doubtless thought that we were close in front of them  alan watched them smiling to himself  ay said he theyll be gey weary before theyve got to the end of that employ and so you and me david can sit down and eat a bite and breathe a bit longer and take a dram from my bottle then well strike for aucharn the house of my kinsman james of the glens where i must get my clothes and my arms and money to carry us along and then david well cry forth fortune and take a cast among the heather  so we sat again and ate and drank in a place whence we could see the sun going down into a field of great wild and houseless mountains such as i was now condemned to wander in with my companion partly as we so sat and partly afterwards on the way to aucharn each of us narrated his adventures and i shall here set down so much of alans as seems either curious or needful  it appears he ran to the bulwarks as soon as the wave was passed saw me and lost me and saw me again as i tumbled in the roost and at last had one glimpse of me clinging on the yard it was this that put him in some hope i would maybe get to land after all and made him leave those clues and messages which had brought me for my sins to that unlucky country of appin  in the meantime those still on the brig had got the skiff launched and one or two were on board of her already when there came a second wave greater than the first and heaved the brig out of her place and would certainly have sent her to the bottom had she not struck and caught on some projection of the reef when she had struck first it had been bowson so that the stern had hitherto been lowest but now her stern was thrown in the air and the bows plunged under the sea and with that the water began to pour into the forescuttle like the pouring of a milldam  it took the colour out of alans face even to tell what followed for there were still two men lying impotent in their bunks and these seeing the water pour in and thinking the ship had foundered began to cry out aloud and that with such harrowing cries that all who were on deck tumbled one after another into the skiff and fell to their oars they were not two hundred yards away when there came a third great sea and at that the brig lifted clean over the reef her canvas filled for a moment and she seemed to sail in chase of them but settling all the while and presently she drew down and down as if a hand was drawing her and the sea closed over the covenant of dysart  never a word they spoke as they pulled ashore being stunned with the horror of that screaming but they had scarce set foot upon the beach when hoseason woke up as if out of a muse and bade them lay hands upon alan they hung back indeed having little taste for the employment but hoseason was like a fiend crying that alan was alone that he had a great sum about him that he had been the means of losing the brig and drowning all their comrades and that here was both revenge and wealth upon a single cast it was seven against one in that part of the shore there was no rock that alan could set his back to and the sailors began to spread out and come behind him  and then said alan the little man with the red headi havena mind of the name that he is called  riach said i  ay said alan riach well it was him that took up the clubs for me asked the men if they werena feared of a judgment and says he dod ill put my back to the hielandmans mysel thats none such an entirely bad little man yon little man with the red head said alan he has some spunks of decency  well said i he was kind to me in his way  and so he was to alan said he and by my troth i found his way a very good one but ye see david the loss of the ship and the cries of these poor lads sat very ill upon the man and im thinking that would be the cause of it  well i would think so says i for he was as keen as any of the rest at the beginning but how did hoseason take it  it sticks in my mind that he would take it very ill says alan but the little man cried to me to run and indeed i thought it was a good observe and ran the last that i saw they were all in a knot upon the beach like folk that were not agreeing very well together  what do you mean by that said i  well the fists were going said alan and i saw one man go down like a pair of breeks but i thought it would be better no to wait ye see theres a strip of campbells in that end of mull which is no good company for a gentleman like me if it hadna been for that i would have waited and looked for ye mysel let alone giving a hand to the little man it was droll how alan dwelt on mr riachs stature for to say the truth the one was not much smaller than the other so says he continuing i set my best foot forward and whenever i met in with anyone i cried out there was a wreck ashore man they didna stop to fash with me ye should have seen them linking for the beach and when they got there they found they had had the pleasure of a run which is aye good for a campbell im thinking it was a judgment on the clan that the brig went down in the lump and didna break but it was a very unlucky thing for you that same for if any wreck had come ashore they would have hunted high and low and would soon have found ye   footnotes    19 part    20 bag     chapter xix  the house of fear   night fell as we were walking and the clouds which had broken up in the afternoon settled in and thickened so that it fell for the season of the year extremely dark the way we went was over rough mountain sides and though alan pushed on with an assured manner i could by no means see how he directed himself  at last about halfpast ten of the clock we came to the top of a brae and saw lights below us it seemed a housedoor stood open and let out a beam of fire and candlelight and all round the house and steading five or six persons were moving hurriedly about each carrying a lighted brand  james must have tint his wits said alan if this was the soldiers instead of you and me he would be in a bonny mess but i daresay hell have a sentry on the road and he would ken well enough no soldiers would find the way that we came  hereupon he whistled three times in a particular manner it was strange to see how at the first sound of it all the moving torches came to a stand as if the bearers were affrighted and how at the third the bustle began again as before  having thus set folks minds at rest we came down the brae and were met at the yard gate for this place was like a welldoing farm by a tall handsome man of more than fifty who cried out to alan in gaelic  james stewart said alan i will ask ye to speak in scots for here is a young gentleman with me that has nane of the other this is him he added putting his arm through mine a young gentleman of the lowlands and a laird in his country too but i am thinking it will be better for his health if we give his name the goby  james of the glens turned to me for a moment and greeted me courteously enough the next he had turned to alan  this has been a dreadful accident he cried it will bring trouble on the country and he wrung his hands  hoots said alan ye must take the sour with the sweet man colin roy is dead and be thankful for that  ay said james and by my troth i wish he was alive again its all very fine to blow and boast beforehand but now its done alan and whos to bear the wyte21 of it the accident fell out in appinmind ye that alan its appin that must pay and i am a man that has a family  while this was going on i looked about me at the servants some were on ladders digging in the thatch of the house or the farm buildings from which they brought out guns swords and different weapons of war others carried them away and by the sound of mattock blows from somewhere farther down the brae i suppose they buried them though they were all so busy there prevailed no kind of order in their efforts men struggled together for the same gun and ran into each other with their burning torches and james was continually turning about from his talk with alan to cry out orders which were apparently never understood the faces in the torchlight were like those of people overborne with hurry and panic and though none spoke above his breath their speech sounded both anxious and angry  it was about this time that a lassie came out of the house carrying a pack or bundle and it has often made me smile to think how alans instinct awoke at the mere sight of it  whats that the lassie has he asked  were just setting the house in order alan said james in his frightened and somewhat fawning way theyll search appin with candles and we must have all things straight were digging the bit guns and swords into the moss ye see and these i am thinking will be your ain french clothes well be to bury them i believe  bury my french clothes cried alan troth no and he laid hold upon the packet and retired into the barn to shift himself recommending me in the meanwhile to his kinsman  james carried me accordingly into the kitchen and sat down with me at table smiling and talking at first in a very hospitable manner but presently the gloom returned upon him he sat frowning and biting his fingers only remembered me from time to time and then gave me but a word or two and a poor smile and back into his private terrors his wife sat by the fire and wept with her face in her hands his eldest son was crouched upon the floor running over a great mass of papers and now and again setting one alight and burning it to the bitter end all the while a servant lass with a red face was rummaging about the room in a blind hurry of fear and whimpering as she went and every now and again one of the men would thrust in his face from the yard and cry for orders  at last james could keep his seat no longer and begged my permission to be so unmannerly as walk about i am but poor company altogether sir says he but i can think of nothing but this dreadful accident and the trouble it is like to bring upon quite innocent persons  a little after he observed his son burning a paper which he thought should have been kept and at that his excitement burst out so that it was painful to witness he struck the lad repeatedly  are you gone gyte22 he cried do you wish to hang your father and forgetful of my presence carried on at him a long time together in the gaelic the young man answering nothing only the wife at the name of hanging throwing her apron over her face and sobbing out louder than before  this was all wretched for a stranger like myself to hear and see and i was right glad when alan returned looking like himself in his fine french clothes though to be sure they were now grown almost too battered and withered to deserve the name of fine i was then taken out in my turn by another of the sons and given that change of clothing of which i had stood so long in need and a pair of highland brogues made of deerleather rather strange at first but after a little practice very easy to the feet  by the time i came back alan must have told his story for it seemed understood that i was to fly with him and they were all busy upon our equipment they gave us each a sword and pistols though i professed my inability to use the former and with these and some ammunition a bag of oatmeal an iron pan and a bottle of right french brandy we were ready for the heather money indeed was lacking i had about two guineas left alans belt having been despatched by another hand that trusty messenger had no more than seventeenpence to his whole fortune and as for james it appears he had brought himself so low with journeys to edinburgh and legal expenses on behalf of the tenants that he could only scrape together threeandfivepencehalfpenny the most of it in coppers  thisll no do said alan  ye must find a safe bit somewhere near by said james and get word sent to me ye see yell have to get this business prettily off alan this is no time to be stayed for a guinea or two theyre sure to get wind of ye sure to seek ye and by my way of it sure to lay on ye the wyte of this days accident if it falls on you it falls on me that am your near kinsman and harboured ye while ye were in the country and if it comes on me he paused and bit his fingers with a white face it would be a painful thing for our friends if i was to hang said he  it would be an ill day for appin says alan  its a day that sticks in my throat said james o man man manman alan you and me have spoken like two fools he cried striking his hand upon the wall so that the house rang again  well and thats true too said alan and my friend from the lowlands here nodding at me gave me a good word upon that head if i would only have listened to him  but see here said james returning to his former manner if they lay me by the heels alan its then that youll be needing the money for with all that i have said and that you have said it will look very black against the two of us do ye mark that well follow me out and yell see that ill have to get a paper out against ye mysel ill have to offer a reward for ye ay will i its a sore thing to do between such near friends but if i get the dirdum23 of this dreadful accident ill have to fend for myself man do ye see that  he spoke with a pleading earnestness taking alan by the breast of the coat  ay said alan i see that  and yell have to be clear of the country alanay and clear of scotlandyou and your friend from the lowlands too for ill have to paper your friend from the lowlands ye see that alansay that ye see that  i thought alan flushed a bit this is unco hard on me that brought him here james said he throwing his head back its like making me a traitor  now alan man cried james look things in the face hell be papered anyway mungo campbellll be sure to paper him what matters if i paper him too and then alan i am a man that has a family and then after a little pause on both sides and alan itll be a jury of campbells said he  theres one thing said alan musingly that naebody kens his name  nor yet they shallna alan theres my hand on that cried james for all the world as if he had really known my name and was foregoing some advantage but just the habit he was in and what he looked like and his age and the like i couldna well do less  i wonder at your fathers son cried alan sternly would ye sell the lad with a gift would ye change his clothes and then betray him  no no alan said james no no the habit he took offthe habit mungo saw him in but i thought he seemed crestfallen indeed he was clutching at every straw and all the time i daresay saw the faces of his hereditary foes on the bench and in the jurybox and the gallows in the background  well sir says alan turning to me what say ye to that ye are here under the safeguard of my honour and its my part to see nothing done but what shall please you  i have but one word to say said i for to all this dispute i am a perfect stranger but the plain commonsense is to set the blame where it belongs and that is on the man that fired the shot paper him as ye call it set the hunt on him and let honest innocent folk show their faces in safety  but at this both alan and james cried out in horror bidding me hold my tongue for that was not to be thought of and asking me what the camerons would think which confirmed me it must have been a cameron from mamore that did the act and if i did not see that the lad might be caught ye havena surely thought of that said they with such innocent earnestness that my hands dropped at my side and i despaired of argument  very well then said i paper me if you please paper alan paper king george were all three innocent and that seems to be whats wanted but at least sir said i to james recovering from my little fit of annoyance i am alans friend and if i can be helpful to friends of his i will not stumble at the risk  i thought it best to put a fair face on my consent for i saw alan troubled and besides thinks i to myself as soon as my back is turned they will paper me as they call it whether i consent or not but in this i saw i was wrong for i had no sooner said the words than mrs stewart leaped out of her chair came running over to us and wept first upon my neck and then on alans blessing god for our goodness to her family  as for you alan it was no more than your bounden duty she said but for this lad that has come here and seen us at our worst and seen the goodman fleeching like a suitor him that by rights should give his commands like any kingas for you my lad she says my heart is wae not to have your name but i have your face and as long as my heart beats under my bosom i will keep it and think of it and bless it and with that she kissed me and burst once more into such sobbing that i stood abashed  hoot hoot said alan looking mighty silly the day comes unco soon in this month of july and tomorrow therell be a fine todo in appin a fine riding of dragoons and crying of cruachan24 and running of redcoats and it behoves you and me to the sooner be gone  thereupon we said farewell and set out again bending somewhat eastwards in a fine mild dark night and over much the same broken country as before   footnotes    21 blame    22 mad    23 blame    24 the rallylngword of the campbells     chapter xx  the flight in the heather the rocks   sometimes we walked sometimes ran and as it drew on to morning walked ever the less and ran the more though upon its face that country appeared to be a desert yet there were huts and houses of the people of which we must have passed more than twenty hidden in quiet places of the hills when we came to one of these alan would leave me in the way and go himself and rap upon the side of the house and speak awhile at the window with some sleeper awakened this was to pass the news which in that country was so much of a duty that alan must pause to attend to it even while fleeing for his life and so well attended to by others that in more than half of the houses where we called they had heard already of the murder in the others as well as i could make out standing back at a distance and hearing a strange tongue the news was received with more of consternation than surprise  for all our hurry day began to come in while we were still far from any shelter it found us in a prodigious valley strewn with rocks and where ran a foaming river wild mountains stood around it there grew there neither grass nor trees and i have sometimes thought since then that it may have been the valley called glencoe where the massacre was in the time of king william but for the details of our itinerary i am all to seek our way lying now by short cuts now by great détours our pace being so hurried our time of journeying usually by night and the names of such places as i asked and heard being in the gaelic tongue and the more easily forgotten  the first peep of morning then showed us this horrible place and i could see alan knit his brow  this is no fit place for you and me he said this is a place theyre bound to watch  and with that he ran harder than ever down to the waterside in a part where the river was split in two among three rocks it went through with a horrid thundering that made my belly quake and there hung over the lynn a little mist of spray alan looked neither to the right nor to the left but jumped clean upon the middle rock and fell there on his hands and knees to check himself for that rock was small and he might have pitched over on the far side i had scarce time to measure the distance or to understand the peril before i had followed him and he had caught and stopped me  so there we stood side by side upon a small rock slippery with spray a far broader leap in front of us and the river dinning upon all sides when i saw where i was there came on me a deadly sickness of fear and i put my hand over my eyes alan took me and shook me i saw he was speaking but the roaring of the falls and the trouble of my mind prevented me from hearing only i saw his face was red with anger and that he stamped upon the rock the same look showed me the water raging by and the mist hanging in the air and with that i covered my eyes again and shuddered  the next minute alan had set the brandy bottle to my lips and forced me to drink about a gill which sent the blood into my head again then putting his hands to his mouth and his mouth to my ear he shouted hang or drown and turning his back upon me leaped over the farther branch of the stream and landed safe  i was now alone upon the rock which gave me the more room the brandy was singing in my ears i had this good example fresh before me and just wit enough to see that if i did not leap at once i should never leap at all i bent low on my knees and flung myself forth with that kind of anger of despair that has sometimes stood me in stead of courage sure enough it was but my hands that reached the full length these slipped caught again slipped again and i was sliddering back into the lynn when alan seized me first by the hair then by the collar and with a great strain dragged me into safety  never a word he said but set off running again for his life and i must stagger to my feet and run after him i had been weary before but now i was sick and bruised and partly drunken with the brandy i kept stumbling as i ran i had a stitch that came near to overmaster me and when at last alan paused under a great rock that stood there among a number of others it was none too soon for david balfour  a great rock i have said but by rights it was two rocks leaning together at the top both some twenty feet high and at the first sight inaccessible even alan though you may say he had as good as four hands failed twice in an attempt to climb them and it was only at the third trial and then by standing on my shoulders and leaping up with such force as i thought must have broken my collarbone that he secured a lodgment once there he let down his leathern girdle and with the aid of that and a pair of shallow footholds in the rock i scrambled up beside him  then i saw why we had come there for the two rocks being both somewhat hollow on the top and sloping one to the other made a kind of dish or saucer where as many as three or four men might have lain hidden  all this while alan had not said a word and had run and climbed with such a savage silent frenzy of hurry that i knew that he was in mortal fear of some miscarriage even now we were on the rock he said nothing nor so much as relaxed the frowning look upon his face but clapped flat down and keeping only one eye above the edge of our place of shelter scouted all round the compass the dawn had come quite clear we could see the stony sides of the valley and its bottom which was bestrewed with rocks and the river which went from one side to another and made white falls but nowhere the smoke of a house nor any living creature but some eagles screaming round a cliff  then at last alan smiled  ay said he now we have a chance and then looking at me with some amusement yere no very gleg25 at the jumping said he  at this i suppose i coloured with mortification for he added at once hoots small blame to ye to be feared of a thing and yet to do it is what makes the prettiest kind of a man and then there was water there and waters a thing that dauntons even me no no said alan its no you thats to blame its me  i asked him why  why said he i have proved myself a gomeril this night for first of all i take a wrong road and that in my own country of appin so that the day has caught us where we should never have been and thanks to that we lie here in some danger and mair discomfort and next which is the worst of the two for a man that has been so much among the heather as myself i have come wanting a waterbottle and here we lie for a long summers day with naething but neat spirit ye may think that a small matter but before it comes night david yell give me news of it  i was anxious to redeem my character and offered if he would pour out the brandy to run down and fill the bottle at the river  i wouldna waste the good spirit either says he its been a good friend to you this night or in my poor opinion ye would still be cocking on yon stone and whats mair says he ye may have observed you thats a man of so much penetration that alan breck stewart was perhaps walking quicker than his ordinar  you i cried you were running fit to burst  was i so said he well then ye may depend upon it there was nae time to be lost and now here is enough said gang you to your sleep lad and ill watch  accordingly i lay down to sleep a little peaty earth had drifted in between the top of the two rocks and some bracken grew there to be a bed to me the last thing i heard was still the crying of the eagles  i daresay it would be nine in the morning when i was roughly awakened and found alans hand pressed upon my mouth  wheesht he whispered ye were snoring  well said i surprised at his anxious and dark face and why not  he peered over the edge of the rock and signed to me to do the like  it was now high day cloudless and very hot the valley was as clear as in a picture about half a mile up the water was a camp of redcoats a big fire blazed in their midst at which some were cooking and near by on the top of a rock about as high as ours there stood a sentry with the sun sparkling on his arms all the way down along the riverside were posted other sentries here near together there widelier scattered some planted like the first on places of command some on the ground level and marching and countermarching so as to meet halfway higher up the glen where the ground was more open the chain of posts was continued by horsesoldiers whom we could see in the distance riding to and fro lower down the infantry continued but as the stream was suddenly swelled by the confluence of a considerable burn they were more widely set and only watched the fords and steppingstones  i took but one look at them and ducked again into my place it was strange indeed to see this valley which had lain so solitary in the hour of dawn bristling with arms and dotted with the red coats and breeches  ye see said alan this was what i was afraid of davie that they would watch the burnside they began to come in about two hours ago and man but yere a grand hand at the sleeping were in a narrow place if they get up the sides of the hill they could easy spy us with a glass but if theyll only keep in the foot of the valley well do yet the posts are thinner down the water and come night well try our hand at getting by them  and what are we to do till night i asked  lie here says he and birstle  that one good scots word birstle was indeed the most of the story of the day that we had now to pass you are to remember that we lay on the bare top of a rock like scones upon a girdle the sun beat upon us cruelly the rock grew so heated a man could scarce endure the touch of it and the little patch of earth and fern which kept cooler was only large enough for one at a time we took turn about to lie on the naked rock which was indeed like the position of that saint that was martyred on a gridiron and it ran in my mind how strange it was that in the same climate and at only a few days distance i should have suffered so cruelly first from cold upon my island and now from heat upon this rock  all the while we had no water only raw brandy for a drink which was worse than nothing but we kept the bottle as cool as we could burying it in the earth and got some relief by bathing our breasts and temples  the soldiers kept stirring all day in the bottom of the valley now changing guard now in patrolling parties hunting among the rocks these lay round in so great a number that to look for men among them was like looking for a needle in a bottle of hay and being so hopeless a task it was gone about with the less care yet we could see the soldiers pike their bayonets among the heather which sent a cold thrill into my vitals and they would sometimes hang about our rock so that we scarce dared to breathe  it was in this way that i first heard the right english speech one fellow as he went by actually clapping his hand upon the sunny face of the rock on which we lay and plucking it off again with an oath i tell you its ot says he and i was amazed at the clipping tones and the odd singsong in which he spoke and no less at that strange trick of dropping out the letter h to be sure i had heard ransome but he had taken his ways from all sorts of people and spoke so imperfectly at the best that i set down the most of it to childishness my surprise was all the greater to hear that manner of speaking in the mouth of a grown man and indeed i have never grown used to it nor yet altogether with the english grammar as perhaps a very critical eye might here and there spy out even in these memoirs  the tediousness and pain of these hours upon the rock grew only the greater as the day went on the rock getting still the hotter and the sun fiercer there were giddiness and sickness and sharp pangs like rheumatism to be supported i minded then and have often minded since on the lines in our scots psalm    the moon by night thee shall not smite      nor yet the sun by day  and indeed it was only by gods blessing that we were neither of us sunsmitten  at last about two it was beyond mens bearing and there was now temptation to resist as well as pain to thole for the sun being now got a little into the west there came a patch of shade on the east side of our rock which was the side sheltered from the soldiers  as well one death as another said alan and slipped over the edge and dropped on the ground on the shadowy side  i followed him at once and instantly fell all my length so weak was i and so giddy with that long exposure here then we lay for an hour or two aching from head to foot as weak as water and lying quite naked to the eye of any soldier who should have strolled that way none came however all passing by on the other side so that our rock continued to be our shield even in this new position  presently we began again to get a little strength and as the soldiers were now lying closer along the riverside alan proposed that we should try a start i was by this time afraid of but one thing in the world and that was to be set back upon the rock anything else was welcome to me so we got ourselves at once in marching order and began to slip from rock to rock one after the other now crawling flat on our bellies in the shade now making a run for it heart in mouth  the soldiers having searched this side of the valley after a fashion and being perhaps somewhat sleepy with the sultriness of the afternoon had now laid by much of their vigilance and stood dozing at their posts or only kept a lookout along the banks of the river so that in this way keeping down the valley and at the same time towards the mountains we drew steadily away from their neighbourhood but the business was the most wearing i had ever taken part in a man had need of a hundred eyes in every part of him to keep concealed in that uneven country and within cry of so many and scattered sentries when we must pass an open place quickness was not all but a swift judgment not only of the lie of the whole country but of the solidity of every stone on which we must set foot for the afternoon was now fallen so breathless that the rolling of a pebble sounded abroad like a pistolshot and would start the echo calling among the hills and cliffs  by sundown we had made some distance even by our slow rate of progress though to be sure the sentry on the rock was still plainly in our view but now we came on something that put all fears out of season and that was a deep rushing burn that tore down in that part to join the glen river at the sight of this we cast ourselves on the ground and plunged head and shoulders in the water and i cannot tell which was the more pleasant the great shock as the cool stream went over us or the greed with which we drank of it  we lay there for the banks hid us drank again and again bathed our chests let our wrists trail in the running water till they ached with the chill and at last being wonderfully renewed we got out the mealbag and made drammach in the iron pan this though it is but cold water mingled with oatmeal yet makes a good enough dish for a hungry man and where there are no means of making fire or as in our case good reason for not making one it is the chief standby of those who have taken to the heather  as soon as the shadow of the night had fallen we set forth again at first with the same caution but presently with more boldness standing our full height and stepping out at a good pace of walking the way was very intricate lying up the steep sides of mountains and along the brows of cliffs clouds had come in with the sunset and the night was dark and cool so that i walked without much fatigue but in continual fear of falling and rolling down the mountains and with no guess at our direction  the moon rose at last and found us still on the road it was in its last quarter and was long beset with clouds but after a while shone out and showed me many dark heads of mountains and was reflected far underneath us on the narrow arm of a sealoch  at this sight we both paused i struck with wonder to find myself so high and walking as it seemed to me upon clouds alan to make sure of his direction  seemingly he was well pleased and he must certainly have judged us out of earshot of all our enemies for throughout the rest of our nightmarch he beguiled the way with whistling of many tunes warlike merry plaintive reel tunes that made the foot go faster tunes of my own south country that made me fain to be home from my adventures and all these on the great dark desert mountains making company upon the way   footnote    25 brisk     chapter xxi  the flight in the heather the heugh of corrynakiegh   early as day comes in the beginning of july it was still dark when we reached our destination a cleft in the head of a great mountain with a water running through the midst and upon the one hand a shallow cave in a rock birches grew there in a thin pretty wood which a little farther on was changed into a wood of pines the burn was full of trout the wood of cushatdoves on the open side of the mountain beyond whaups would be always whistling and cuckoos were plentiful from the mouth of the cleft we looked down upon a part of mamore and on the sealoch that divides that country from appin and this from so great a height as made it my continual wonder and pleasure to sit and behold them  the name of the cleft was the heugh of corrynakiegh and although from its height and being so near upon the sea it was often beset with clouds yet it was on the whole a pleasant place and the five days we lived in it went happily  we slept in the cave making our bed of heather bushes which we cut for that purpose and covering ourselves with alans greatcoat there was a low concealed place in a turning of the glen where we were so bold as to make fire so that we could warm ourselves when the clouds set in and cook hot porridge and grill the little trouts that we caught with our hands under the stones and overhanging banks of the burn this was indeed our chief pleasure and business and not only to save our meal against worse times but with a rivalry that much amused us we spent a great part of our days at the waterside stripped to the waist and groping about or as they say guddling for these fish the largest we got might have been a quarter of a pound but they were of good flesh and flavour and when broiled upon the coals lacked only a little salt to be delicious  in any bytime alan must teach me to use my sword for my ignorance had much distressed him and i think besides as i had sometimes the upper hand of him in the fishing he was not sorry to turn to an exercise where he had so much the upper hand of me he made it somewhat more of a pain than need have been for he stormed at me all through the lessons in a very violent manner of scolding and would push me so close that i made sure he must run me through the body i was often tempted to turn tail but held my ground for all that and got some profit of my lessons if it was but to stand on guard with an assured countenance which is often all that is required so though i could never in the least please my master i was not altogether displeased with myself  in the meanwhile you are not to suppose that we neglected our chief business which was to get away  it will be many a long day alan said to me on our first morning before the redcoats think upon seeking corrynakiegh so now we must get word sent to james and he must find the siller for us  and how shall we send that word says i we are here in a desert place which yet we dare not leave and unless ye get the fowls of the air to be your messengers i see not what we shall be able to do  ay said alan yere a man of small contrivance david  thereupon he fell in a muse looking in the embers of the fire and presently getting a piece of wood he fashioned it in a cross the four ends of which he blackened on the coals then he looked at me a little shyly  could ye lend me my button says he it seems a strange thing to ask a gift again but i own i am laith to cut another  i gave him the button whereupon he strung it on a strip of his greatcoat which he had used to bind the cross and tying in a little sprig of birch and another of fir he looked upon his work with satisfaction  now said he there is a little clachan what is called a hamlet in the english not very far from corrynakiegh and it has the name of koalisnacoan there there are living many friends of mine whom i could trust with my life and some that i am no just so sure of ye see david there will be money set upon our heads james himsel is to set money on them and as for the campbells they would never spare siller where there was a stewart to be hurt if it was otherwise i would go down to koalisnacoan whatever and trust my life into these peoples hands as lightly as i would trust another with my glove  but being so said i  being so said he i would as lief they didna see me theres bad folk everywhere and whats far worse weak ones so when it comes dark again i will steal down into that clachan and set this that i have been making in the window of a good friend of mine john breck maccoll a bouman26 of appins  with all my heart says i and if he finds it what is he to think  well says alan i wish he was a man of more penetration for by my troth i am afraid he will make little enough of it but this is what i have in my mind this cross is something in the nature of the crosstarrie or fiery cross which is the signal of gathering in our clans yet he will know well enough the clan is not to rise for there it is standing in his window and no word with it so he will say to himsel the clan is not to rise but there is something then he will see my button and that was duncan stewarts and then he will say to himsel the son of duncan is in the heather and has need of me  well said i it may be but even supposing so there is a good deal of heather between here and the forth  and that is a very true word says alan but then john breck will see the sprig of birch and the sprig of pine and he will say to himsel if he is a man of any penetration at all which i misdoubt alan will be lying in a wood which is both of pines and birches then he will think to himsel that is not so very rife hereabout and then he will come and give us a look up in corrynakiegh and if he does not david the devil may fly away with him for what i care for he will no be worth the salt to his porridge  eh man said i drolling with him a little youre very ingenious but would it not be simpler for you to write him a few words in black and white  and that is an excellent observe mr balfour of shaws says alan drolling with me and it would certainly be much simpler for me to write to him but it would be a sore job for john breck to read it he would have to go to the school for twothree years and its possible we might be wearied waiting on him  so that night alan carried down his fiery cross and set it in the boumans window he was troubled when he came back for the dogs had barked and the folk run out from their houses and he thought he had heard a clatter of arms and seen a redcoat come to one of the doors on all accounts we lay the next day in the borders of the wood and kept a close lookout so that if it was john breck that came we might be ready to guide him and if it was the redcoats we should have time to get away  about noon a man was to be spied straggling up the open side of the mountain in the sun and looking round him as he came from under his hand no sooner had alan seen him than he whistled the man turned and came a little towards us then alan would give another peep and the man would come still nearer and so by the sound of whistling he was guided to the spot where we lay  he was a ragged wild bearded man about forty grossly disfigured with the smallpox and looked both dull and savage although his english was very bad and broken yet alan according to his very handsome use whenever i was by would suffer him to speak no gaelic perhaps the strange language made him appear more backward than he really was but i thought he had little goodwill to serve us and what he had was the child of terror  alan would have had him carry a message to james but the bouman would hear of no message she was forget it he said in his screaming voice and would either have a letter or wash his hands of us  i thought alan would be gravelled at that for we lacked the means of writing in that desert but he was a man of more resources than i knew searched the wood until he found a quill of a cushatdove which he shaped into a pen made himself a kind of ink with gunpowder from his horn and water from the running stream and tearing a corner from his french military commission which he carried in his pocket like a talisman to keep him from the gallows he sat down and wrote as follows    dear kinsmanplease send money by the bearer to the place he kens   of      your affectionate cousin                                   a s  this he intrusted to the bouman who promised to make what manner of speed he best could and carried it off with him down the hill  he was three full days gone but about five in the evening of the third we heard a whistling in the wood which alan answered and presently the bouman came up the waterside looking for us right and left he seemed less sulky than before and indeed he was no doubt well pleased to have got to the end of such a dangerous commission  he gave us the news of the country that it was alive with redcoats that arms were being found and poor folk brought in trouble daily and that james and some of his servants were already clapped in prison at fort william under strong suspicion of complicity it seemed it was noised on all sides that alan breck had fired the shot and there was a bill issued both for him and me with one hundred pounds reward  this was all as bad as could be and the little note the bouman had carried us from mrs stewart was of a miserable sadness in it she besought alan not to let himself be captured assuring him if he fell in the hands of the troops both he and james were no better than dead men the money she had sent was all that she could beg or borrow and she prayed heaven we could be doing with it lastly she said she enclosed us one of the bills in which we were described  this we looked upon with great curiosity and not a little fear partly as a man may look in a mirror partly as he might look into the barrel of an enemys gun to judge if it be truly aimed alan was advertised as a small pockmarked active man of thirtyfive or thereby dressed in a feathered hat a french sidecoat of blue with silver buttons and lace a great deal tarnished a red waistcoat and breeches of black shag and i as a tall strong lad of about eighteen wearing an old blue coat very ragged an old highland bonnet a long homespun waistcoat blue breeches his legs bare lowcountry shoes wanting the toes speaks like a lowlander and has no beard  alan was well enough pleased to see his finery so fully remembered and set down only when he came to the word tarnished he looked upon his lace like one a little mortified as for myself i thought i cut a miserable figure in the bill and yet was well enough pleased too for since i had changed these rags the description had ceased to be a danger and become a source of safety  alan said i you should change your clothes  na troth said alan i have nae others a fine sight i would be if i went back to france in a bonnet  this put a second reflection in my mind that if i were to separate from alan and his telltale clothes i should be safe against arrest and might go openly about my business nor was this all for suppose i was arrested when i was alone there was little against me but suppose i was taken in company with the reputed murderer my case would begin to be grave for generositys sake i dared not speak my mind upon this head but i thought of it none the less  i thought of it all the more too when the bouman brought out a green purse with four guineas in gold and the best part of another in small change true it was more than i had but then alan with less than five guineas had to get as far as france i with my less than two not beyond queensferry so that taking things in their proportion alans society was not only a peril to my life but a burden on my purse  but there was no thought of the sort in the honest head of my companion he believed he was serving helping and protecting me and what could i do but hold my peace and chafe and take my chance of it  its little enough said alan putting the purse in his pocket but itll do my business and now john breck if ye will hand me over my button this gentleman and me will be for taking the road  but the bouman after feeling about in a hairy purse that hung in front of him in the highland manner though he wore otherwise the lowland habit with seatrousers began to roll his eyes strangely and at last said her nainsel will loss it meaning he thought he had lost it  what cried alan you will lose my button that was my fathers before me now i will tell you what is in my mind john breck it is in my mind this is the worst days work that ever ye did since ye were born  and as alan spoke he set his hands on his knees and looked at the bouman with a smiling mouth and that dancing light in his eyes that meant mischief to his enemies  perhaps the bouman was honest enough perhaps he had meant to cheat and then finding himself alone with two of us in a desert place cast back to honesty as being safer at least and all at once he seemed to find that button and handed it to alan  well and it is a good thing for the honour of the maccolls said alan and then to me here is my button back again and i thank you for parting with it which is of a piece with all your friendships to me then he took the warmest parting of the bouman for says he ye have done very well by me and set your neck at a venture and i will always give you the name of a good man  lastly the bouman took himself off by one way and alan and i getting our chattels together struck into another to resume our flight   footnote    26 a bouman is a tenant who takes stock from the landlord and shares     with him the increase     chapter xxii  the flight in the heather the moor   some seven hours incessant hard travelling brought us early in the morning to the end of a range of mountains in front of us there lay a piece of low broken desert land which we must now cross the sun was not long up and shone straight in our eyes a little thin mist went up from the face of the moorland like a smoke so that as alan said there might have been twenty squadron of dragoons there and we none the wiser  we sat down therefore in a howe of the hillside till the mist should have risen and made ourselves a dish of drammach and held a council of war  david said alan this is the kittle bit shall we lie here till it comes night or shall we risk it and stave on ahead  well said i i am tired indeed but i could walk as far again if that was all  ay but it isna said alan nor yet the half this is how we stand appins fair death to us to the south its all campbells and no to be thought of to the north well theres no muckle to be gained by going north neither for you that wants to get to queensferry nor yet for me that wants to get to france well then well can strike east  east be it says i quite cheerily but i was thinking in to myself o man if you would only take one point of the compass and let me take any other it would be the best for both of us  well then east ye see we have the muirs said alan once there david its mere pitchandtoss out on yon bald naked flat place where can a body turn to let the redcoats come over a hill they can spy you miles away and the sorrows in their horses heels they would soon ride you down its no good place david and im free to say its worse by daylight than by dark  alan said i hear my way of it appins death for us we have none too much money nor yet meal the longer they seek the nearer they may guess where we are its all a risk and i give my word to go ahead until we drop  alan was delighted there are whiles said he when ye are altogether too canny and whiggish to be company for a gentleman like me but there come other whiles when ye show yersel a mettle spark and its then david that i love ye like a brother  the mist rose and died away and showed us that country lying as waste as the sea only the moorfowl and the peewees crying upon it and far over to the east a herd of deer moving like dots much of it was red with heather much of the rest broken up with bogs and hags and peaty pools some had been burnt black in a heathfire and in another place there was quite a forest of dead firs standing like skeletons a wearierlooking desert man never saw but at least it was clear of troops which was our point  we went down accordingly into the waste and began to make our toilsome and devious travel towards the eastern verge there were the tops of mountains all round you are to remember from whence we might be spied at any moment so it behoved us to keep in the hollow parts of the moor and when these turned aside from our direction to move upon its naked face with infinite care sometimes for half an hour together we must crawl from one heather bush to another as hunters do when they are hard upon the deer it was a clear day again with a blazing sun the water in the brandybottle was soon gone and altogether if i had guessed what it would be to crawl half the time upon my belly and to walk much of the rest stooping nearly to the knees i should certainly have held back from such a killing enterprise  toiling and resting and toiling again we wore away the morning and about noon lay down in a thick bush of heather to sleep alan took the first watch and it seemed to me i had scarce closed my eyes before i was shaken up to take the second we had no clock to go by and alan stuck a sprig of heath in the ground to serve instead so that as soon as the shadow of the bush should fall so far to the east i might know to rouse him but i was by this time so weary that i could have slept twelve hours at a stretch i had the taste of sleep in my throat my joints slept even when my mind was waking the hot smell of the heather and the drone of the wild bees were like possets to me and every now and again i would give a jump and find i had been dozing  the last time i woke i seemed to come back from farther away and thought the sun had taken a great start in the heavens i looked at the sprig of heath and at that i could have cried aloud for i saw i had betrayed my trust my head was nearly turned with fear and shame and at what i saw when i looked out around me on the moor my heart was like dying in my body for sure enough a body of horsesoldiers had come down during my sleep and were drawing near to us from the southeast spread out in the shape of a fan and riding their horses to and fro in the deep parts of the heather  when i waked alan he glanced first at the soldiers then at the mark and the position of the sun and knitted his brows with a sudden quick look both ugly and anxious which was all the reproach i had of him  what are we to do now i asked  well have to play at being hares said he do ye see yon mountain pointing to one on the northeastern sky  ay said i  well then says he let us strike for that its name is ben alder its a wild desert mountain full of hills and hollows and if we can win to it before the morn we may do yet  but alan cried i that will take us across the very coming of the soldiers  i ken that fine said he but if we are driven back on appin we are two dead men so now david man be brisk  with that he began to run forward on his hands and knees with incredible quickness as though it were his natural way of going all the time too he kept winding in and out in the lower parts of the moorland where we were the best concealed some of these had been burned or at least scathed with fire and there rose in our faces which were close to the ground a blinding choking dust as fine as smoke the water was long out and this posture of running on the hands and knees brings an overmastering weakness and weariness so that the joints ache and the wrists faint under your weight  now and then indeed where was a big bush of heather we lay awhile and panted and putting aside the leaves looked back at the dragoons they had not spied us for they held straight on a halftroop i think covering about two miles of ground and beating it mighty thoroughly as they went i had awakened just in time a little later and we must have fled in front of them instead of escaping on one side even as it was the least misfortune might betray us and now and again when a grouse rose out of the heather with a clap of wings we lay as still as the dead and were afraid to breathe  the aching and faintness of my body the labouring of my heart the soreness of my hands and the smarting of my throat and eyes in the continual smoke of dust and ashes had soon grown to be so unbearable that i would gladly have given up nothing but the fear of alan lent me enough of a false kind of courage to continue as for himself and you are to bear in mind that he was cumbered with a greatcoat he had first turned crimson but as time went on the redness began to be mingled with patches of white his breath cried and whistled as it came and his voice when he whispered his observations in my ear during our halts sounded like nothing human yet he seemed in no way dashed in spirits nor did he at all abate in his activity so that i was driven to marvel at the mans endurance  at length in the first gloaming of the night we heard a trumpet sound and looking back from among the heather saw the troop beginning to collect a little after they had built a fire and camped for the night about the middle of the waste  at this i begged and besought that we might lie down and sleep  there shall be no sleep the night said alan from now on these weary dragoons of yours will keep the crown of the muirland and none will get out of appin but winged fowls we got through in the nick of time and shall we jeopard what weve gained na na when the day comes it shall find you and me in a fast place on ben alder  alan i said its not the want of will its the strength that i want if i could i would but as sure as im alive i cannot  very well then said alan ill carry ye  i looked to see if he were jesting but no the little man was in dead earnest and the sight of so much resolution shamed me  lead away said i ill follow  he gave me one look as much as to say well done david and off he set again at his top speed  it grew cooler and even a little darker but not much with the coming of the night the sky was cloudless it was still early in july and pretty far north in the darkest part of that night you would have needed pretty good eyes to read but for all that i have often seen it darker in a winter midday heavy dew fell and drenched the moor like rain and this refreshed me for a while when we stopped to breathe and i had time to see all about me the clearness and sweetness of the night the shapes of the hills like things asleep and the fire dwindling away behind us like a bright spot in the midst of the moor anger would come upon me in a clap that i must still drag myself in agony and eat the dust like a worm  by what i have read in books i think few that have held a pen were ever really wearied or they would write of it more strongly i had no care of my life neither past nor future and i scarce remembered there was such a lad as david balfour i did not think of myself but just of each fresh step which i was sure would be my last with despairand of alan who was the cause of it with hatred alan was in the right trade as a soldier this is the officers part to make men continue to do things they know not wherefore and when if the choice was offered they would lie down where they were and be killed and i daresay i would have made a good enough private for in these last hours it never occurred to me that i had any choice but just to obey as long as i was able and die obeying  day began to come in after years i thought and by that time we were past the greatest danger and could walk upon our feet like men instead of crawling like brutes but dear heart have mercy what a pair we must have made going double like old grandfathers stumbling like babes and as white as dead folk never a word passed between us each set his mouth and kept his eyes in front of him and lifted up his foot and set it down again like people lifting weights at a country play27 all the while with the moorfowl crying peep in the heather and the light coming slowly clearer in the east  i say alan did as i did not that ever i looked at him for i had enough ado to keep my feet but because it is plain he must have been as stupid with weariness as myself and looked as little where we were going or we should not have walked into an ambush like blind men  it fell in this way we were going down a heathery brae alan leading and i following a pace or two behind like a fiddler and his wife when upon a sudden the heather gave a rustle three or four ragged men leaped out and the next moment we were lying on our backs each with a dirk at his throat  i dont think i cared the pain of this rough handling was quite swallowed up by the pains of which i was already full and i was too glad to have stopped walking to mind about a dirk i lay looking up in the face of the man that held me and i mind his face was black with the sun and his eyes very light but i was not afraid of him i heard alan and another whispering in the gaelic and what they said was all one to me  then the dirks were put up our weapons were taken away and we were set face to face sitting in the heather  they are clunys men said alan we couldna have fallen better were just to bide here with these which are his outsentries till they can get word to the chief of my arrival  now cluny macpherson the chief of the clan vourich had been one of the leaders of the great rebellion six years before there was a price on his life and i had supposed him long ago in france with the rest of the heads of that desperate party even tired as i was the surprise of what i heard half wakened me  what i cried is cluny still here  ay is he so said alan still in his own country and kept by his own clan king george can do no more  i think i would have asked further but alan gave me the putoff i am rather wearied he said and i would like fine to get a sleep and without more words he rolled on his face in a deep heather bush and seemed to sleep at once  there was no such thing possible for me you have heard grasshoppers whirring in the grass in the summertime well i had no sooner closed my eyes than my body and above all my head belly and wrists seemed to be filled with whirring grasshoppers and i must open my eyes again at once and tumble and toss and sit up and lie down and look at the sky which dazzled me or at clunys wild and dirty sentries peering out over the top of the brae and chattering to each other in the gaelic  that was all the rest i had until the messenger returned when as it appeared that cluny would be glad to receive us we must get once more upon our feet and set forward alan was in excellent good spirits much refreshed by his sleep very hungry and looking pleasantly forward to a dram and a dish of hot collops of which it seems the messenger had brought him word for my part it made me sick to hear of eating i had been deadheavy before and now i felt a kind of dreadful lightness which would not suffer me to walk i drifted like a gossamer the ground seemed to me a cloud the hills a featherweight the air to have a current like a running burn which carried me to and fro with all that a sort of horror of despair sat on my mind so that i could have wept at my own helplessness  i saw alan knitting his brows at me and supposed it was in anger and that gave me a pang of lightheaded fear like what a child may have i remember too that i was smiling and could not stop smiling hard as i tried for i thought it was out of place at such a time but my good companion had nothing in his mind but kindness and the next moment two of the gillies had me by the arms and i began to be carried forward with great swiftness or so it appeared to me although i daresay it was slowly enough in truth through a labyrinth of dreary glens and hollows and into the heart of that dismal mountain of ben alder   footnote    27 village fair     chapter xxiii  clunys cage   we came at last to the foot of an exceeding steep wood which scrambled up a craggy hillside and was crowned by a naked precipice  its here said one of the guides and we struck up hill  the trees clung upon the slope like sailors on the shrouds of a ship and their trunks were like the rounds of a ladder by which we mounted  quite at the top and just before the rocky face of the cliff sprang above the foliage we found that strange house which was known in the country as clunys cage the trunks of several trees had been wattled across the intervals strengthened with stakes and the ground behind this barricade levelled up with earth to make the floor a tree which grew out from the hillside was the living centrebeam of the roof the walls were of wattle and covered with moss the whole house had something of an eggshape and it half hung half stood in that steep hillside thicket like a wasps nest in a green hawthorn  within it was large enough to shelter five or six persons with some comfort a projection of the cliff had been cunningly employed to be the fireplace and the smoke rising against the face of the rock and being not dissimilar in colour readily escaped notice from below  this was but one of clunys hidingplaces he had caves besides and underground chambers in several parts of his country and following the reports of his scouts he moved from one to another as the soldiers drew near or moved away by this manner of living and thanks to the affection of his clan he had not only stayed all this time in safety while so many others had fled or been taken and slain but stayed four or five years longer and only went to france at last by the express command of his master there he soon died and it is strange to reflect that he may have regretted his cage upon ben alder  when we came to the door he was seated by his rock chimney watching a gillie about some cookery he was mighty plainly habited with a knitted nightcap drawn over his ears and smoked a foul cutty pipe for all that he had the manners of a king and it was quite a sight to see him rise out of his place to welcome us  well mr stewart come awa sir said he and bring in your friend that as yet i dinna ken the name of  and how is yourself cluny said alan i hope ye do brawly sir and i am proud to see ye and to present to ye my friend the laird of shaws mr david balfour  alan never referred to my estate without a touch of a sneer when we were alone but with strangers he rang the words out like a herald  step in by the both of ye gentlemen says cluny i make ye welcome to my house which is a queer rude place for certain but one where i have entertained a royal personage mr stewartye doubtless ken the personage i have in my eye well take a dram for luck and as soon as this handless man of mine has the collops ready well dine and take a hand at the cartes as gentlemen should my life is a bit dreigh says he pouring out the brandy i see little company and sit and twirl my thumbs and mind upon a great day that is gone by and weary for another great day that we all hope will be upon the road and so heres a toast to ye the restoration  thereupon we all touched glasses and drank i am sure i wished no ill to king george and if he had been there himself in proper person its like he would have done as i did no sooner had i taken out the dram than i felt hugely better and could look on and listen still a little mistily perhaps but no longer with the same groundless horror and distress of mind  it was certainly a strange place and we had a strange host in his long hiding cluny had grown to have all manner of precise habits like those of an old maid he had a particular place where no one else must sit the cage was arranged in a particular way which none must disturb cookery was one of his chief fancies and even while he was greeting us in he kept an eye to the collops  it appears he sometimes visited or received visits from his wife and one or two of his nearest friends under the cover of night but for the more part lived quite alone and communicated only with his sentinels and the gillies that waited on him in the cage the first thing in the morning one of them who was a barber came and shaved him and gave him the news of the country of which he was immoderately greedy there was no end to his questions he put them as earnestly as a child and at some of the answers laughed out of all bounds of reason and would break out again laughing at the mere memory hours after the barber was gone  to be sure there might have been a purpose in his questions for though he was thus sequestered and like the other landed gentlemen of scotland stripped by the late act of parliament of legal powers he still exercised a patriarchal justice in his clan disputes were brought to him in his hidinghole to be decided and the men of his country who would have snapped their fingers at the court of session laid aside revenge and paid down money at the bare word of this forfeited and hunted outlaw when he was angered which was often enough he gave his commands and breathed threats of punishment like any king and his gillies trembled and crouched away from him like children before a hasty father with each of them as he entered he ceremoniously shook hands both parties touching their bonnets at the same time in a military manner altogether i had a fair chance to see some of the inner workings of a highland clan and this with a proscribed fugitive chief his country conquered the troops riding upon all sides in quest of him sometimes within a mile of where he lay and when the least of the ragged fellows whom he rated and threatened could have made a fortune by betraying him  on that first day as soon as the collops were ready cluny gave them with his own hand a squeeze of a lemon for he was well supplied with luxuries and bade us draw into our meal  they said he meaning the collops are such as i gave his royal highness in this very house bating the lemon juice for at that time we were glad to get the meat and never fashed for kitchen28 indeed there were mair dragoons than lemons in my country in the year fortysix  i do not know if the collops were truly very good but my heart rose against the sight of them and i could eat but little all the while cluny entertained us with stories of prince charlies stay in the cage giving us the very words of the speakers and rising from his place to show us where they stood by these i gathered the prince was a gracious spirited boy like the son of a race of polite kings but not so wise as solomon i gathered too that while he was in the cage he was often drunk so the fault that has since by all accounts made such a wreck of him had even then begun to show itself  we were no sooner done eating than cluny brought out an old thumbed greasy pack of cards such as you may find in a mean inn and his eyes brightened in his face as he proposed that we should fall to playing  now this was one of the things i had been brought up to eschew like disgrace it being held by my father neither the part of a christian nor yet of a gentleman to set his own livelihood and fish for that of others on the cast of painted pasteboard to be sure i might have pleaded my fatigue which was excuse enough but i thought it behoved that i should bear a testimony i must have got very red in the face but i spoke steadily and told them i had no call to be a judge of others but for my own part it was a matter in which i had no clearness  cluny stopped mingling the cards what in the deils name is this says he what kind of whiggish canting talk is this for the house of cluny macpherson  i will put my hand in the fire for mr balfour says alan he is an honest and a mettle gentleman and i would have ye bear in mind who says it i bear a kings name says he cocking his hat and i and any that i call friend are company for the best but the gentleman is tired and should sleep if he has no mind to the cartes it will never hinder you and me and im fit and willing sir to play ye any game that ye can name  sir says cluny in this poor house of mine i would have you to ken that any gentleman may follow his pleasure if your friend would like to stand on his head he is welcome and if either he or you or any other man is not preceesely satisfied i will be proud to step outside with him  i had no will that these two friends should cut their throats for my sake  sir said i i am very wearied as alan says and whats more as you are a man that likely has sons of your own i may tell you it was a promise to my father  say nae mair say nae mair said cluny and pointed me to a bed of heather in a corner of the cage for all that he was displeased enough looked at me askance and grumbled when he looked and indeed it must be owned that both my scruples and the words in which i had declared them smacked somewhat of the covenanter and were little in their place among wild highland jacobites  what with the brandy and the venison a strange heaviness had come over me and i had scarce lain down upon the bed before i fell into a kind of trance in which i continued almost the whole time of our stay in the cage sometimes i was broad awake and understood what passed sometimes i only heard voices or men snoring like the voice of a silly river and the plaids upon the wall dwindled down and swelled out again like firelight shadows on the roof i must sometimes have spoken or cried out for i remember i was now and then amazed at being answered yet i was conscious of no particular nightmare only of a general black abiding horrora horror of the place i was in and the bed i lay on and the plaids on the wall and the voices and the fire and myself  the barbergillie who was a doctor too was called in to prescribe for me but as he spoke in the gaelic i understood not a word of his opinion and was too sick even to ask for a translation i knew well enough i was ill and that was all i cared about  i paid little heed while i lay in this poor pass but alan and cluny were most of the time at the cards and i am clear that alan must have begun by winning for i remember sitting up and seeing them hard at it and a great glittering pile of as much as sixty or a hundred guineas on the table it looked strange enough to see all this wealth in a nest upon a cliffside wattled about growing trees and even then i thought it seemed deep water for alan to be riding who had no better battlehorse than a green purse and a matter of five pounds  the luck it seems changed on the second day about noon i was wakened as usual for dinner and as usual refused to eat and was given a dram with some bitter infusion which the barber had prescribed the sun was shining in at the open door of the cage and this dazzled and offended me cluny sat at the table biting the pack of cards alan had stooped over the bed and had his face close to my eyes to which troubled as they were with the fever it seemed of the most shocking bigness  he asked me for a loan of my money  what for said i  o just for a loan said he  but why i repeated i dont see  hut david said alan ye wouldna grudge me a loan  i would though if i had had my senses but all i thought of then was to get his face away and i handed him my money  on the morning of the third day when we had been fortyeight hours in the cage i awoke with a great relief of spirits very weak and weary indeed but seeing things of the right size and with their honest everyday appearance i had a mind to eat moreover rose from my bed of my own movement and as soon as we had breakfasted stepped to the entry of the cage and sat down outside in the top of the wood it was a grey day with a cool mild air and i sat in a dream all morning only disturbed by the passing by of clunys scouts and servants coming with provisions and reports for as the coast was at that time clear you might almost say he held court openly  when i returned he and alan had laid the cards aside and were questioning a gillie and the chief turned about and spoke to me in the gaelic  i have no gaelic sir said i  now since the card question everything i said or did had the power of annoying cluny your name has more sense than yourself then said he angrily for its good gaelic but the point is this my scout reports all clear in the south and the question is have ye the strength to go  i saw cards on the table but no gold only a heap of little written papers and these all on clunys side alan besides had an odd look like a man not very well content and i began to have a strong misgiving  i do not know if i am as well as i should be said i looking at alan but the little money we have has a long way to carry us  alan took his underlip into his mouth and looked upon the ground  david says he at last ive lost it theres the naked truth  my money too said i  your money too says alan with a groan ye shouldna have given it me im daft when i get to the cartes  hoottoot hoottoot said cluny it was all daffing its all nonsense of course youll have your money back again and the double of it if yell make so free with me it would be a singular thing for me to keep it its not to be supposed that i would be any hindrance to gentlemen in your situation that would be a singular thing cries he and began to pull gold out of his pocket with a mighty red face  alan said nothing only looked on the ground  will you step to the door with me sir said i  cluny said he would be very glad and followed me readily enough but he looked flustered and put out  and now sir says i i must first acknowledge your generosity  nonsensical nonsense cries cluny wheres the generosity this is just a most unfortunate affair but what would ye have me doboxed up in this beeskep of a cage of minebut just set my friends to the cartes when i can get them and if they lose of course its not to be supposed and here he came to a pause  yes said i if they lose you give them back their money and if they win they carry away yours in their pouches i have said before that i grant your generosity but to me sir its a very painful thing to be placed in this position  there was a little silence in which cluny seemed always as if he was about to speak but said nothing all the time he grew redder and redder in the face  i am a young man said i and i ask your advice advise me as you would your son my friend fairly lost this money after having fairly gained a far greater sum of yours can i accept it back again would that be the right part for me to play whatever i do you can see for yourself it must be hard upon a man of any pride  its rather hard on me too mr balfour said cluny and ye give me very much the look of a man that has entrapped poor people to their hurt i wouldna have my friends come to any house of mine to accept affronts no he cried with a sudden heat of anger nor yet to give them  and so you see sir said i there is something to be said upon my side and this gambling is a very poor employ for gentlefolks but i am still waiting your opinion  i am sure if ever cluny hated any man it was david balfour he looked me all over with a warlike eye and i saw the challenge at his lips but either my youth disarmed him or perhaps his own sense of justice certainly it was a mortifying matter for all concerned and not least for cluny the more credit that he took it as he did  mr balfour said he i think you are too nice and covenanting but for all that you have the spirit of a very pretty gentleman upon my honest word ye may take this moneyits what i would tell my sonand heres my hand along with it   footnote    28 condiment     chapter xxiv  the flight in the heather the quarrel   alan and i were put across loch errocht under cloud of night and went down its eastern shore to another hidingplace near the head of loch rannoch whither we were led by one of the gillies from the cage this fellow carried all our luggage and alans greatcoat in the bargain trotting along under the burthen far less than the half of which used to weigh me to the ground like a stout hillpony with a feather yet he was a man that in plain contest i could have broken on my knee  doubtless it was a great relief to walk disencumbered and perhaps without that relief and the consequent sense of liberty and lightness i could not have walked at all i was but new risen from a bed of sickness and there was nothing in the state of our affairs to hearten me for much exertion travelling as we did over the most dismal deserts in scotland under a cloudy heaven and with divided hearts among the travellers  for long we said nothing marching alongside or one behind the other each with a set countenance i angry and proud and drawing what strength i had from these two violent and sinful feelings alan angry and ashamedashamed that he had lost my money angry that i should take it so ill  the thought of a separation ran always the stronger in my mind and the more i approved of it the more ashamed i grew of my approval it would be a fine handsome generous thing indeed for alan to turn round and say to me go i am in the most danger and my company only increases yours but for me to turn to the friend who certainly loved me and say to him you are in great danger i am in but little your friendship is a burden go take your risks and bear your hardships alone no that was impossible and even to think of it privily to myself made my cheeks to burn  and yet alan had behaved like a child and what is worse a treacherous child wheedling my money from me while i lay halfconscious was scarce better than theft and yet here he was trudging by my side without a penny to his name and by what i could see quite blithe to sponge upon the money he had driven me to beg true i was ready to share it with him but it made me rage to see him count upon my readiness  these were the two things uppermost in my mind and i could open my mouth upon neither without black ungenerosity so i did the next worst and said nothing nor so much as looked once at my companion save with the tail of my eye  at last upon the other side of loch errocht going over a smooth rushy place where the walking was easy he could bear it no longer and came close to me  david says he this is no way for two friends to take a small accident i have to say that im sorry and so thats said and now if you have anything yed better say it  o says i i have nothing  he seemed disconcerted at which i was meanly pleased  no said he with rather a trembling voice but when i say i was to blame  why of course ye were to blame said i coolly and you will bear me out that i have never reproached you  never says he but ye ken very well that yeve done worse are we to part ye said so once before are ye to say it again theres hills and heather enough between here and the two seas david and i will own im no very keen to stay where im no wanted  this pierced me like a sword and seemed to lay bare my private disloyalty  alan breck i cried and then do you think i am one to turn my back on you in your chief need you durstnt say it to my face my whole conducts there to give the lie to it its true i fell asleep upon the muir but that was from weariness and you do wrong to cast it up to me  which is what i never did said alan  but aside from that i continued what have i done that you should even me to dogs by such a supposition i never yet failed a friend and its not likely ill begin with you there are things between us that i can never forget even if you can  i will only say this to ye david said alan very quietly that i have long been owing ye my life and now i owe ye money ye should try to make that burden light for me  this ought to have touched me and in a manner it did but the wrong manner i felt i was behaving badly and was now not only angry with alan but angry with myself in the bargain and it made me the more cruel  you asked me to speak said i well then i will you own yourself that you have done me a disservice i have had to swallow an affront i have never reproached you i never named the thing till you did and now you blame me cried i because i canna laugh and sing as if i was glad to be affronted the next thing will be that im to go down upon my knees and thank you for it ye should think more of others alan breck if ye thought more of others ye would perhaps speak less about yourself and when a friend that likes you very well has passed over an offence without a word you would be blithe to let it lie instead of making it a stick to break his back with by your own way of it it was you that was to blame then it shouldna be you to seek the quarrel  aweel said alan say nae mair  and we fell back into our former silence and came to our journeys end and supped and lay down to sleep without another word  the gillie put us across loch rannoch in the dusk of the next day and gave us his opinion as to our best route this was to get us up at once into the tops of the mountains to go round by a circuit turning the heads of glen lyon glen lochay and glen dochart and come down upon the lowlands by kippen and the upper waters of the forth alan was little pleased with a route which led us through the country of his bloodfoes the glenorchy campbells he objected that by turning to the east we should come almost at once among the athole stewarts a race of his own name and lineage although following a different chief and come besides by a far easier and swifter way to the place whither we were bound but the gillie who was indeed the chief man of clunys scouts had good reasons to give him on all hands naming the force of troops in every district and alleging finally as well as i could understand that we should nowhere be so little troubled as in a country of the campbells  alan gave way at last but with only half a heart its one of the dowiest countries in scotland said he theres naething there that i ken but heath and crows and campbells but i see that yere a man of some penetration ind be it as ye please  we set forth accordingly by this itinerary and for the best part of three nights travelled on eerie mountains and among the wellheads of wild rivers often buried in mist almost continually blown and rained upon and not once cheered by any glimpse of sunshine by day we lay and slept in the drenching heather by night incessantly clambered upon breakneck hills and among rude crags we often wandered we were often so involved in fog that we must lie quiet till it lightened a fire was never to be thought of our only food was drammach and a portion of cold meat that we had carried from the cage and as for drink heaven knows we had no want of water  this was a dreadful time rendered the more dreadful by the gloom of the weather and the country i was never warm my teeth chattered in my head i was troubled with a very sore throat such as i had on the isle i had a painful stitch in my side which never left me and when i slept in my wet bed with the rain beating above and the mud oozing below me it was to live over again in fancy the worst part of my adventuresto see the tower of shaws lit by lightning ransome carried below on the mens backs shuan dying on the roundhouse floor or colin campbell grasping at the bosom of his coat from such broken slumbers i would be aroused in the gloaming to sit up in the same puddle where i had slept and sup cold drammach the rain driving sharp in my face or running down my back in icy trickles the mist enfolding us like as in a gloomy chamberor perhaps if the wind blew falling suddenly apart and showing us the gulf of some dark valley where the streams were crying aloud  the sound of an infinite number of rivers came up from all round in this steady rain the springs of the mountain were broken up every glen gushed water like a cistern every stream was in high spate and had filled and overflowed its channel during our night tramps it was solemn to hear the voice of them below in the valleys now booming like thunder now with an angry cry i could well understand the story of the water kelpie that demon of the streams who is fabled to keep wailing and roaring at the ford until the coming of the doomed traveller alan i saw believed it or half believed it and when the cry of the river rose more than usually sharp i was little surprised though of course i would still be shocked to see him cross himself in the manner of the catholics  during all these horrid wanderings we had no familiarity scarcely even that of speech the truth is that i was sickening for my grave which is my best excuse but besides that i was of an unforgiving disposition from my birth slow to take offence slower to forget it and now incensed both against my companion and myself for the best part of two days he was unweariedly kind silent indeed but always ready to help and always hoping as i could very well see that my displeasure would blow by for the same length of time i stayed in myself nursing my anger roughly refusing his services and passing him over with my eyes as if he had been a bush or a stone  the second night or rather the peep of the third day found us upon a very open hill so that we could not follow our usual plan and lie down immediately to eat and sleep before we had reached a place of shelter the grey had come pretty clear for though it still rained the clouds ran higher and alan looking in my face showed some marks of concern  ye had better let me take your pack said he for perhaps the ninth time since we had parted from the scout beside loch rannoch  i do very well i thank you said i as cold as ice  alan flushed darkly ill not offer it again he said im not a patient man david  i never said you were said i which was exactly the rude silly speech of a boy of ten  alan made no answer at the time but his conduct answered for him henceforth it is to be thought he quite forgave himself for the affair at clunys cocked his hat again walked jauntily whistled airs and looked at me upon one side with a provoking smile  the third night we were to pass through the western end of the country of balquhidder it came clear and cold with a touch in the air like frost and a northerly wind that blew the clouds away and made the stars bright the streams were full of course and still made a great noise among the hills but i observed that alan thought no more upon the kelpie and was in high good spirits as for me the change of weather came too late i had lain in the mire so long that as the bible has it my very clothes abhorred me i was dead weary deadly sick and full of pains and shiverings the chill of the wind went through me and the sound of it confused my ears in this poor state i had to bear from my companion something in the nature of a persecution he spoke a good deal and never without a taunt whig was the best name he had to give me here he would say heres a dub for ye to jump my whiggie i ken youre a fine jumper and so on all the time with a gibing voice and face  i knew it was my own doing and no one elses but i was too miserable to repent i felt i could drag myself but little farther pretty soon i must lie down and die on these wet mountains like a sheep or a fox and my bones must whiten there like the bones of a beast my head was light perhaps but i began to love the prospect i began to glory in the thought of such a death alone in the desert with the wild eagles besieging my last moments alan would repent then i thought he would remember when i was dead how much he owed me and the remembrance would be torture so i went like a sick silly and badhearted schoolboy feeding my anger against a fellowman when i would have been better on my knees crying on god for mercy and at each of alans taunts i hugged myself ah thinks i to myself i have a better taunt in readiness when i lie down and die you will feel it like a buffet in your face ah what a revenge ah how you will regret your ingratitude and cruelty  all the while i was growing worse and worse once i had fallen my legs simply doubling under me and this had struck alan for the moment but i was afoot so briskly and set off again with such a natural manner that he soon forgot the incident flushes of heat went over me and then spasms of shuddering the stitch in my side was hardly bearable at last i began to feel that i could trail myself no farther and with that there came on me all at once the wish to have it out with alan let my anger blaze and be done with my life in a more sudden manner he had just called me whig i stopped  mr stewart said i in a voice that quivered like a fiddlestring you are older than i am and should know your manners do you think it either very wise or very witty to cast my politics in my teeth i thought where folk differed it was the part of gentlemen to differ civilly and if i did not i may tell you i could find a better taunt than some of yours  alan had stopped opposite to me his hat cocked his hands in his breeches pockets his head a little on one side he listened smiling evilly as i could see by the starlight and when i had done he began to whistle a jacobite air it was the air made in mockery of general copes defeat at prestonpans    hey johnnie cope are ye waukin yet    and are your drums abeatin yet  and it came in my mind that alan on the day of that battle had been engaged upon the royal side  why do ye take that air mr stewart said i is that to remind me you have been beaten on both sides  the air stopped on alans lips david said he  but its time these manners ceased i continued and i mean you shall henceforth speak civilly of my king and my good friends the campbells  i am a stewart began alan  o says i i ken ye bear a kings name but you are to remember since i have been in the highlands i have seen a good many of those that bear it and the best i can say of them is this that they would be none the worse of washing  do you know that you insult me said alan very low  i am sorry for that said i for i am not done and if you distaste the sermon i doubt the pirliecue29 will please you as little you have been chased in the field by the grown men of my party it seems a poor kind of pleasure to outface a boy both the campbells and the whigs have beaten you you have run before them like a hare it behoves you to speak of them as of your betters  alan stood quite still the tails of his greatcoat clapping behind him in the wind  this is a pity he said at last there are things said that cannot be passed over  i never asked you to said i i am as ready as yourself  ready said he  ready i repeated i am no blower and boaster like some that i could name come on and drawing my sword i fell on guard as alan himself had taught me  david he cried are ye daft i canna draw upon ye david its fair murder  that was your lookout when you insulted me said i  its the truth cried alan and he stood for a moment wringing his mouth in his hand like a man in sore perplexity its the bare truth he said and drew his sword but before i could touch his blade with mine he had thrown it from him and fallen to the ground na na he kept saying na nai canna i canna  at this the last of my anger oozed all out of me and i found myself only sick and sorry and blank and wondering at myself i would have given the world to take back what i had said but a word once spoken who can recapture it i minded me of all alans kindness and courage in the past how he had helped and cheered and borne with me in our evil days and then recalled my own insults and saw that i had lost for ever that doughty friend at the same time the sickness that hung upon me seemed to redouble and the pang in my side was like a sword for sharpness i thought i must have swooned where i stood  this it was that gave me a thought no apology could blot out what i had said it was needless to think of one none could cover the offence but where an apology was vain a mere cry for help might bring alan back to my side i put my pride away from me alan i said if you canna help me i must just die here  he started up sitting and looked at me  its true said i im by with it o let me get into the bield of a housei can die there easier i had no need to pretend whether i chose or not i spoke in a weeping voice that would have melted a heart of stone  can ye walk asked alan  no said i not without help this last hour my legs have been fainting under me ive a stitch in my side like a redhot iron i canna breathe right if i die yell can forgive me alan in my heart i liked ye fineeven when i was the angriest  wheesht wheesht cried alan dinna say that david man ye ken he shut his mouth upon a sob let me get my arm about ye he continued thats the way now lean upon me hard gude kens where theres a house were in balwhidder too there should be no want of houses no nor friends houses here do ye gang easier so davie  ay said i i can be doing this way and i pressed his arm with my hand  again he came near sobbing davie said he im no a right man at all i have neither sense nor kindness i couldna remember ye were just a bairn i couldna see ye were dying on your feet davie yell have to try and forgive me  o man lets say no more about it said i were neither one of us to mend the otherthats the truth we must just bear and forbear man alano but my stitch is sore is there nae house  ill find a house to ye david he said stoutly well follow down the burn where theres bound to be houses my poor man will ye no be better on my back  o alan says i and me a good twelve inches taller  yere no such a thing cried alan with a start there may be a trifling matter of an inch or two im no saying im just exactly what ye would call a tall man whatever and i daresay he added his voice tailing off in a laughable manner now when i come to think of it i daresay yell be just about right ay itll be a foot or nearhand or maybe even mair  it was sweet and laughable to hear alan eat his words up in the fear of some fresh quarrel i could have laughed had not my stitch caught me so hard but if i had laughed i think i must have wept too  alan cried i what makes ye so good to me what makes ye care for such a thankless fellow  deed and i dont know said alan for just precisely what i thought i liked about ye was that ye never quarrelledand now i like ye better   footnote    29 a second sermon     chapter xxv  in balquhidder   at the door of the first house we came to alan knocked which was no very safe enterprise in such a part of the highlands as the braes of balquhidder no great clan held rule there it was filled and disputed by small septs and broken remnants and what they call chiefless folk driven into the wild country about the springs of forth and teith by the advance of the campbells here were stewarts and maclarens which came to the same thing for the maclarens followed alans chief in war and made but one clan with appin here too were many of that old proscribed nameless redhanded clan of the macgregors they had always been illconsidered and now worse than ever having credit with no side or party in the whole country of scotland their chief macgregor of macgregor was in exile the more immediate leader of that part of them about balquhidder james more rob roys eldest son lay waiting his trial in edinburgh castle they were in illblood with highlander and lowlander with the grahames the maclarens and the stewarts and alan who took up the quarrel of any friend however distant was extremely wishful to avoid them  chance served us very well for it was a household of maclarens that we found where alan was not only welcome for his names sake but known by reputation here then i was got to bed without delay and a doctor fetched who found me in a sorry plight but whether because he was a very good doctor or i a very young strong man i lay bedridden for no more than a week and before a month i was able to take the road again with a good heart  all this time alan would not leave me though i often pressed him and indeed his foolhardiness in staying was a common subject of outcry with the two or three friends that were let into the secret he hid by day in a hole of the braes under a little wood and at night when the coast was clear would come into the house to visit me i need not say if i was pleased to see him mrs maclaren our hostess thought nothing good enough for such a guest and as duncan dhu which was the name of our host had a pair of pipes in his house and was much of a lover of music the time of my recovery was quite a festival and we commonly turned night into day  the soldiers let us be although once a party of two companies and some dragoons went by in the bottom of the valley where i could see them through the window as i lay in bed what was much more astonishing no magistrate came near me and there was no question put of whence i came or whither i was going and in that time of excitement i was as free of all inquiry as though i had lain in a desert yet my presence was known before i left to all the people in balquhidder and the adjacent parts many coming about the house on visits and these after the custom of the country spreading the news among their neighbours the bills too had now been printed there was one pinned near the foot of my bed where i could read my own not very flattering portrait and in larger characters the amount of the bloodmoney that had been set upon my life duncan dhu and the rest that knew that i had come there in alans company could have entertained no doubt of who i was and many others must have had their guess for though i had changed my clothes i could not change my age or person and lowland boys of eighteen were not so rife in these parts of the world and above all about that time that they could fail to put one thing with another and connect me with the bill so it was at least other folk keep a secret among two or three near friends and somehow it leaks out but among these clansmen it is told to a whole countryside and they will keep it for a century  there was but one thing happened worth narrating and that is the visit i had of robin oig one of the sons of the notorious rob roy he was sought upon all sides on the charge of carrying a young woman from balfron and marrying her as was alleged by force yet he stepped about balquhidder like a gentleman in his own walled policy it was he who had shot james maclaren at the ploughstilts a quarrel never satisfied yet he walked into the house of his blood enemies as a rider30 might into a public inn  duncan had time to pass me word of who it was and we looked at one another in concern you should understand it was then close upon the time of alans coming the two were little likely to agree and yet if we sent word or sought to make a signal it was sure to arouse suspicion in a man under so dark a cloud as the macgregor  he came in with a great show of civility but like a man among inferiors took off his bonnet to mrs maclaren but clapped it on his head again to speak to duncan and having thus set himself as he would have thought in a proper light came to my bedside and bowed  i am given to know sir says he that your name is balfour  they call me david balfour said i at your service  i would give ye my name in return sir he replied but its one somewhat blown upon of late days and itll perhaps suffice if i tell ye that i am own brother to james more drummond or macgregor of whom ye will scarce have failed to hear  no sir said i a little alarmed nor yet of your father macgregorcampbell and i sat up and bowed in bed for i thought best to compliment him in case he was proud of having had an outlaw to his father  he bowed in return but what i am come to say sir he went on is this in the year fortyfive my brother raised a part of the gregara and marched six companies to strike a stroke for the good side and the surgeon that marched with our clan and cured my brothers leg when it was broken in the brush at prestonpans was a gentleman of the same name precisely as yourself he was brother to balfour of baith and if you are in any reasonable degree of nearness one of that gentlemans kin i have come to put myself and my people at your command  you are to remember that i knew no more of my descent than any cadgers dog my uncle to be sure had prated of some of our high connections but nothing to the present purpose and there was nothing left me but that bitter disgrace of owning that i could not tell  robin told me shortly he was sorry he had put himself about turned his back upon me without a sign of salutation and as he went towards the door i could hear him telling duncan that i was only some kinless loon that didnt know his own father angry as i was at these words and ashamed of my own ignorance i could scarce keep from smiling that a man who was under the lash of the law and was indeed hanged some three years later should be so nice as to the descent of his acquaintances  just in the door he met alan coming in and the two drew back and looked at each other like strange dogs they were neither of them big men but they seemed fairly to swell out with pride each wore a sword and by a movement of his haunch thrust clear the hilt of it so that it might be the more readily grasped and the blade drawn  mr stewart i am thinking says robin  troth mr macgregor its not a name to be ashamed of answered alan  i did not know ye were in my country sir says robin  it sticks in my mind that i am in the country of my friends the maclarens says alan  thats a kittle point returned the other there may be two words to say to that but i think i will have heard that you are a man of your sword  unless ye were born deaf mr macgregor ye will have heard a good deal more than that says alan i am not the only man that can draw steel in appin and when my kinsman and captain ardshiel had a talk with a gentleman of your name not so many years back i could never hear that the macgregor had the best of it  do ye mean my father sir says robin  well i wouldna wonder said alan the gentleman i have in my mind had the illtaste to clap campbell to his name  my father was an old man returned robin the match was unequal you and me would make a better pair sir  i was thinking that said alan  i was half out of bed and duncan had been hanging at the elbow of these fightingcocks ready to intervene upon the least occasion but when that word was uttered it was a case of now or never and duncan with something of a white face to be sure thrust himself between  gentlemen said he i will have been thinking of a very different matter whateffer here are my pipes and here are you two gentlemen who are baith acclaimed pipers its an auld dispute which one of yes the best here will be a braw chance to settle it  why sir said alan still addressing robin from whom indeed he had not so much as shifted his eyes nor yet robin from him why sir says alan i think i will have heard some sough31 of the sort have ye music as folk say are ye a bit of a piper  i can pipe like a macrimmon cries robin  and that is a very bold word quoth alan  i have made bolder words good before now returned robin and that against better adversaries  it is easy to try that says alan  duncan dhu made haste to bring out the pair of pipes that was his principal possession and to set before his guests a muttonham and a bottle of that drink which they call athole brose and which is made of old whisky strained honey and sweet cream slowly beaten together in the right order and proportion the two enemies were still on the very breach of a quarrel but down they sat one upon each side of the peat fire with a mighty show of politeness maclaren pressed them to taste his muttonham and the wifes brose reminding them the wife was out of athole and had a name far and wide for her skill in that confection but robin put aside these hospitalities as bad for the breath  i would have ye to remark sir said alan that i havena broken bread for near upon ten hours which will be worse for the breath than any brose in scotland  i will take no advantages mr stewart replied robin eat and drink ill follow you  each ate a small portion of the ham and drank a glass of the brose to mrs maclaren and then after a great number of civilities robin took the pipes and played a little spring in a very ranting manner  ay ye can blow said alan and taking the instrument from his rival he first played the same spring in a manner identical with robins and then wandered into variations which as he went on he decorated with a perfect flight of gracenotes such as pipers love and call the warblers  i had been pleased with robins playing alans ravished me  thats no very bad mr stewart said the rival but ye show a poor device in your warblers  me cried alan the blood starting to his face i give ye the lie  do ye own yourself beaten at the pipes then said robin that ye seek to change them for the sword  and thats very well said mr macgregor returned alan and in the meantime laying a strong accent on the word i take back the lie i appeal to duncan  indeed ye need apply to naebody said robin yere a far better judge than any maclaren in balquhidder for its a gods truth that youre a very creditable piper for a stewart hand me the pipes  alan did as he asked and robin proceeded to imitate and correct some part of alans variations which it seemed that he remembered perfectly  ay ye have music said alan gloomily  and now be the judge yourself mr stewart said robin and taking up the variations from the beginning he worked them throughout to so new a purpose with such ingenuity and sentiment and with so odd a fancy and so quick a knack in the gracenotes that i was amazed to hear him  as for alan his face grew dark and hot and he sat and gnawed his fingers like a man under some deep affront enough he cried ye can blow the pipesmake the most of that and he made as if to rise  but robin only held out his hand as if to ask for silence and struck into the slow measure of a pibroch it was a fine piece of music in itself and nobly played but it seems besides it was a piece peculiar to the appin stewarts and a chief favourite with alan the first notes were scarce out before there came a change in his face when the time quickened he seemed to grow restless in his seat and long before that piece was at an end the last signs of his anger died from him and he had no thought but for the music  robin oig he said when it was done ye are a great piper i am not fit to blow in the same kingdom with ye body of me ye have mair music in your sporran than i have in my head and though it still sticks in my mind that i could maybe show ye another of it with the cold steel i warn ye beforehanditll no be fair it would go against my heart to haggle a man that can blow the pipes as you can  thereupon that quarrel was made up all night long the brose was going and the pipes changing hands and the day had come pretty bright and the three men were none the better for what they had been taking before robin as much as thought upon the road   footnotes    30 commercial traveller    31 rumour     chapter xxvi  end of the flight we pass the forth   the month as i have said was not yet out but it was already far through august and beautiful warm weather with every sign of an early and great harvest when i was pronounced able for my journey our money was now run to so low an ebb that we must think first of all on speed for if we came not soon to mr rankeillors or if when we came there he should fail to help me we must surely starve in alans view besides the hunt must have now greatly slackened and the line of the forth and even stirling bridge which is the main pass over that river would be watched with little interest  its a chief principle in military affairs said he to go where ye are least expected forth is our trouble ye ken the saying forth bridles the wild hielandman well if we seek to creep round about the head of that river and come down by kippen or balfron its just precisely there that theyll be looking to lay hands on us but if we stave on straight to the auld brig of stirling ill lay my sword they let us pass unchallenged  the first night accordingly we pushed to the house of a maclaren in strathire a friend of duncans where we slept the twentyfirst of the month and whence we set forth again about the fall of night to make another easy stage the twentysecond we lay in a heather bush on the hillside in uam var within view of a herd of deer the happiest ten hours of sleep in a fine breathing sunshine and on bonedry ground that i have ever tasted that night we struck allan water and followed it down and coming to the edge of the hills saw the whole carse of stirling underfoot as flat as a pancake with the town and castle on a hill in the midst of it and the moon shining on the links of forth  now said alan i kenna if ye care but yere in your own land again we passed the hieland line in the first hour and now if we could but pass yon crooked water we might cast our bonnets in the air  in allan water near by where it falls into the forth we found a little sandy islet overgrown with burdock butterbur and the like low plants that would just cover us if we lay flat here it was we made our camp within plain view of stirling castle whence we could hear the drums beat as some part of the garrison paraded shearers worked all day in a field on one side of the river and we could hear the stones going on the hooks and the voices and even the words of the men talking it behoved to lie close and keep silent but the sand of the little isle was sunwarm the green plants gave us shelter for our heads we had food and drink in plenty and to crown all we were within sight of safety  as soon as the shearers quit their work and the dusk began to fall we waded ashore and struck for the bridge of stirling keeping to the fields and under the field fences  the bridge is close under the castle hill an old high narrow bridge with pinnacles along the parapet and you may conceive with how much interest i looked upon it not only as a place famous in history but as the very doors of salvation to alan and myself the moon was not yet up when we came there a few lights shone along the front of the fortress and lower down a few lighted windows in the town but it was all mighty still and there seemed to be no guard upon the passage  i was for pushing straight across but alan was more wary  it looks unco quiet said he but for all that well lie down here cannily behind a dyke and make sure  so we lay for about a quarter of an hour whiles whispering whiles lying still and hearing nothing earthly but the washing of the water on the piers at last there came by an old hobbling woman with a crutch stick who first stopped a little close to where we lay and bemoaned herself and the long way she had travelled and then set forth again up the steep spring of the bridge the woman was so little and the night still so dark that we soon lost sight of her only heard the sound of her steps and her stick and a cough that she had by fits draw slowly farther away  shes bound to be across now i whispered  na said alan her foot still sounds boss32 upon the bridge  and just thenwho goes cried a voice and we heard the butt of a musket rattle on the stones i must suppose the sentry had been sleeping so that had we tried we might have passed unseen but he was awake now and the chance forfeited  thisll never do said alan thisll never never do for us david  and without another word he began to crawl away through the fields and a little after being well out of eyeshot got to his feet again and struck along a road that led to the eastward i could not conceive what he was doing and indeed i was so sharply cut by the disappointment that i was little likely to be pleased with anything a moment back and i had seen myself knocking at mr rankeillors door to claim my inheritance like a hero in a ballad and here was i back again a wandering hunted blackguard on the wrong side of forth  well said i  well said alan what would ye have theyre none such fools as i took them for we have still the forth to pass davieweary fall the rains that fed and the hillsides that guided it  and why go east said i  ou just upon the chance said he if we canna pass the river well have to see what we can do for the firth  there are fords upon the river and none upon the firth said i  to be sure there are fords and a bridge forbye quoth alan and of what service when they are watched  well said i but a river can be swum  by them that have the skill of it returned he but i have yet to hear that either you or me is much of a hand at that exercise and for my own part i swim like a stone  im not up to you in talking back alan i said but i can see were making bad worse if its hard to pass a river it stands to reason it must be worse to pass a sea  but theres such a thing as a boat says alan or im the more deceived  ay and such a thing as money says i but for us that have neither one nor other they might just as well not have been invented  ye think so said alan  i do that said i  david says he yere a man of small invention and less faith but let me set my wits upon the hone and if i canna beg borrow nor yet steal a boat ill make one  i think i see ye said i and whats more than all that if ye pass a bridge it can tell no tales but if we pass the firth theres the boat on the wrong sidesomebody must have brought itthe countryside will all be in a bizz  man cried alan if i make a boat ill make a body to take it back again so deave me with no more of your nonsense but walk for thats what youve got to doand let alan think for ye  all night then we walked through the north side of the carse under the high line of the ochil mountains and by alloa and clackmannan and culross all of which we avoided and about ten in the morning mighty hungry and tired came to the little clachan of limekilns this is a place that sits near in by the waterside and looks across the hope to the town of the queens ferry smoke went up from both of these and from other villages and farms upon all hands the fields were being reaped two ships lay anchored and boats were coming and going on the hope it was altogether a right pleasant sight to me and i could not take my fill of gazing at these comfortable green cultivated hills and the busy people both of the field and sea  for all that there was mr rankeillors house on the south shore where i had no doubt wealth awaited me and here was i upon the north clad in poor enough attire of an outlandish fashion with three silver shillings left to me of all my fortune a price set upon my head and an outlawed man for my sole company  o alan said i to think of it over there theres all that heart could want waiting me and the birds go over and the boats go overall that please can go but just me only o man but its a heartbreak  in limekilns we entered a small changehouse which we only knew to be a public by the wand over the door and bought some bread and cheese from a goodlooking lass that was the servant this we carried with us in a bundle meaning to sit and eat it in a bush of wood on the seashore that we saw some third part of a mile in front as we went i kept looking across the water and sighing to myself and though i took no heed of it alan had fallen into a muse at last he stopped in the way  did ye take heed of the lass we bought this of says he tapping on the bread and cheese  to be sure said i and a bonny lass she was  ye thought that cries he man david thats good news  in the name of all thats wonderful why so says i what good can that do  well said alan with one of his droll looks i was rather in hopes it would maybe get us that boat  if it were the other way about it would be liker it said i  thats all that you ken ye see said alan i dont want the lass to fall in love with ye i want her to be sorry for ye david to which end there is no manner of need that she should take you for a beauty let me see looking me curiously over i wish ye were a wee thing paler but apart from that yell do fine for my purposeye have a fine hangdog ragandtatter clappermaclaw kind of a look to ye as if ye had stolen the coat from a potatobogle come right about and back to the changehouse for that boat of ours  i followed him laughing  david balfour said he yere a very funny gentleman by your way of it and this is a very funny employ for ye no doubt for all that if ye have any affection for my neck to say nothing of your own ye will perhaps be kind enough to take this matter responsibly i am going to do a bit of playacting the bottom ground of which is just exactly as serious as the gallows for the pair of us so bear it if ye please in mind and conduct yourself according  well well said i have it as you will  as we got near the clachan he made me take his arm and hang upon it like one almost helpless with weariness and by the time he pushed open the changehouse door he seemed to be half carrying me the maid appeared surprised as well she might be at our speedy return but alan had no words to spare for her in explanation helped me to a chair called for a tass of brandy with which he fed me in little sips and then breaking up the bread and cheese helped me to eat it like a nurserylass the whole with that grave concerned affectionate countenance that might have imposed upon a judge it was small wonder if the maid were taken with the picture we presented of a poor sick overwrought lad and his most tender comrade she drew quite near and stood leaning with her back on the next table  whats like wrong with him said she at last  alan turned upon her to my great wonder with a kind of fury wrong cries he hes walked more hundreds of miles than he has hairs upon his chin and slept oftener in wet heather than dry sheets wrong quo she wrong enough i would think wrong indeed and he kept grumbling to himself as he fed me like a man illpleased  hes young for the like of that said the maid  ower young said alan with his back to her  he would be better riding says she  and where could i get a horse to him cried alan turning on her with the same appearance of fury would ye have me steal  i thought this roughness would have sent her off in dudgeon as indeed it closed her mouth for the time but my companion knew very well what he was doing and for as simple as he was in some things of life had a great fund of roguishness in such affairs as these  ye needna tell me she said at lastyere gentry  well said alan softened a little i believe against his will by this artless comment and suppose we were did ever you hear that gentrice put money in folks pockets  she sighed at this as if she were herself some disinherited great lady no says she thats true indeed  i was all this while chafing at the part i played and sitting tonguetied between shame and merriment but somehow at this i could hold in no longer and bade alan let me be for i was better already my voice stuck in my throat for i ever hated to take part in lies but my very embarrassment helped on the plot for the lass no doubt set down my husky voice to sickness and fatigue  has he nae friends said she in a tearful voice  that has he so cried alan if we could but win to themfriends and rich friends beds to lie in food to eat doctors to see to himand here he must tramp in the dubs and sleep in the heather like a beggarman  and why that says the lass  my dear said alan i canna very safely say but ill tell ye what ill do instead says he ill whistle ye a bit tune and with that he leaned pretty far over the table and in a mere breath of a whistle but with a wonderful pretty sentiment gave her a few bars of charlie is my darling  wheesht says she and looked over her shoulder to the door  thats it said alan  and him so young cries the lass  hes old enough to and alan struck his forefinger on the back part of his neck meaning that i was old enough to lose my head  it would be a black shame she cried flushing nigh  its what will be though said alan unless we manage the better  at this the lass turned and ran out of that part of the house leaving us alone togetheralan in high good humour at the furthering of his schemes and i in bitter dudgeon at being called a jacobite and treated like a child  alan i cried i can stand no more of this  yell have to sit it then davie said he for if ye upset the pot now ye may scrape your own life out of the fire but alan breck is a dead man  this was so true that i could only groan and even my groan served alans purpose for it was overheard by the lass as she came flying in again with a dish of white puddings and a bottle of strong ale  poor lamb says she and had no sooner set the meat before us than she touched me on the shoulder with a little friendly touch as much as to bid me cheer up then she told us to fallto and there would be no more to pay for the inn was her own or at least her fathers and he was gone for the day to pittencrieff we waited for no second bidding for bread and cheese is but cold comfort and the puddings smelt excellently well and while we sat and ate she took up that same place by the next table looking on and thinking and frowning to herself and drawing the string of her apron through her hand  im thinking ye have rather a long tongue she said at last to alan  ay said alan but ye see i ken the folk i speak to  i would never betray ye said she if ye mean that  no said he yere not that kind but ill tell ye what ye would do ye would help  i couldna said she shaking her head na i couldna  no said he but if ye could  she answered him nothing  look here my lass said alan there are boats in the kingdom of fife for i saw two no less upon the beach as i came in by your towns end now if we could have the use of a boat to pass under cloud of night into lothian and some secret decent kind of a man to bring that boat back again and keep his counsel there would be two souls savedmine to all likelihoodhis to a dead surety if we lack that boat we have but three shillings left in this wide world and where to go and how to do and what other place there is for us except the chains of a gibbeti give you my naked word i kenna shall we go wanting lassie are ye to lie in your warm bed and think upon us when the wind gowls in the chimney and the rain tirls on the roof are ye to eat your meat by the cheeks of a red fire and think upon this poor sick lad of mine biting his fingerends on a blae muir for cauld and hunger sick or sound he must aye be moving with the deathgrapple at his throat he must aye be trailing in the rain on the lang roads and when he gants his last on a rickle of cauld stanes there will be nae friends near him but only me and god  at this appeal i could see the lass was in great trouble of mind being tempted to help us and yet in some fear she might be helping malefactors and so now i determined to step in myself and to allay her scruples with a portion of the truth  did ever you hear said i of mr rankeillor of the ferry  rankeillor the writer said she i daursay that  well said i its to his door that i am bound so you may judge by that if i am an illdoer and i will tell you more that though i am indeed by a dreadful error in some peril of my life king george has no truer friend in all scotland than myself  her face cleared up mightily at this although alans darkened  thats more than i would ask said she mr rankeillor is a kennt man and she bade us finish our meat get clear of the clachan as soon as might be and lie close in the bit wood on the sea beach and ye can trust me says she ill find some means to put you over  at this we waited for no more but shook hands with her upon the bargain made short work of the puddings and set forth again from limekilns as far as to the wood it was a small piece of perhaps a score of elders and hawthorns and a few young ashes not thick enough to veil us from passersby upon the road or beach here we must lie however making the best of the brave warm weather and the good hopes we now had of a deliverance and planning more particularly what remained for us to do  we had but one trouble all day when a strolling piper came and sat in the same wood with us a rednosed bleareyed drunken dog with a great bottle of whisky in his pocket and a long story of wrongs that had been done him by all sorts of persons from the lord president of the court of session who had denied him justice down to the bailies of inverkeithing who had given him more of it than he desired it was impossible but he should conceive some suspicion of two men lying all day concealed in a thicket and having no business to allege as long as he stayed there he kept us in hot water with prying questions and after he was gone as he was a man not very likely to hold his tongue we were in the greater impatience to be gone ourselves  the day came to an end with the same brightness the night fell quiet and clear lights came out in houses and hamlets and then one after another began to be put out but it was past eleven and we were long since strangely tortured with anxieties before we heard the grinding of oars upon the rowingpins at that we looked out and saw the lass herself coming rowing to us in a boat she had trusted no one with our affairs not even her sweetheart if she had one but as soon as her father was asleep had left the house by a window stolen a neighbours boat and come to our assistance singlehanded  i was abashed how to find expression for my thanks but she was no less abashed at the thought of hearing them begged us to lose no time and to hold our peace saying very properly that the heart of our matter was in haste and silence and so what with one thing and another she had set us on the lothian shore not far from carriden had shaken hands with us and was out again at sea and rowing for limekilns before there was one word said either of her service or our gratitude  even after she was gone we had nothing to say as indeed nothing was enough for such a kindness only alan stood a great while upon the shore shaking his head  it is a very fine lass he said at last david it is a very fine lass and a matter of an hour later as we were lying in a den on the seashore and i had been already dozing he broke out again in commendations of her character for my part i could say nothing she was so simple a creature that my heart smote me both with remorse and fear remorse because we had traded upon her ignorance and fear lest we should have any way involved her in the dangers of our situation   footnote    32 hollow     chapter xxvii  i come to mr rankeillor   the next day it was agreed that alan should fend for himself till sunset but as soon as it began to grow dark he should lie in the fields by the roadside near to newhalls and stir for naught until he heard me whistling at first i proposed i should give him for a signal the bonnie house of airlie which was a favourite of mine but he objected that as the piece was very commonly known any ploughman might whistle it by accident and taught me instead a little fragment of a highland air which has run in my head from that day to this and will likely run in my head when i lie dying every time it comes to me it takes me off to that last day of my uncertainty with alan sitting up in the bottom of the den whistling and beating the measure with a finger and the grey of the dawn coming on his face  i was in the long street of queensferry before the sun was up it was a fairly built burgh the houses of good stone many slated the townhall not so fine i thought as that of peebles nor yet the street so noble but take it altogether it put me to shame for my foul tatters  as the morning went on and the fires began to be kindled and the windows to open and the people to appear out of the houses my concern and despondency grew ever the blacker i saw now that i had no grounds to stand upon and no clear proof of my rights nor so much as of my own identity if it was all a bubble i was indeed sorely cheated and left in a sore pass even if things were as i conceived it would in all likelihood take time to establish my contentions and what time had i to spare with less than three shillings in my pocket and a condemned hunted man upon my hands to ship out of the country truly if my hope broke with me it might come to the gallows yet for both of us and as i continued to walk up and down and saw people looking askance at me upon the street or out of windows and nudging or speaking to one another with smiles i began to take a fresh apprehension that it might be no easy matter even to come to speech of the lawyer far less to convince him of my story  for the life of me i could not muster up the courage to address any of these reputable burghers i thought shame even to speak with them in such a pickle of rags and dirt and if i had asked for the house of such a man as mr rankeillor i supposed they would have burst out laughing in my face so i went up and down and through the street and down to the harbourside like a dog that has lost its master with a strange gnawing in my inwards and every now and then a movement of despair it grew to be high day at last perhaps nine in the forenoon and i was worn with these wanderings and chanced to have stopped in front of a very good house on the landward side a house with beautiful clear glass windows flowering knots upon the sills the walls newharled33 and a chasedog sitting yawning on the step like one that was at home well i was even envying this dumb brute when the door fell open and there issued forth a shrewd ruddy kindly consequential man in a wellpowdered wig and spectacles i was in such a plight that no one set eyes on me once but he looked at me again and this gentleman as it proved was so much struck with my poor appearance that he came straight up to me and asked me what i did  i told him i was come to the queens ferry on business and taking heart of grace asked him to direct me to the house of mr rankeillor  why said he that is his house that i have just come out of and for a rather singular chance i am that very man  then sir said i i have to beg the favour of an interview  i do not know your name said he nor yet your face  my name is david balfour said i  david balfour he repeated in rather a high tone like one surprised and where have you come from mr david balfour he asked looking me pretty drily in the face  i have come from a great many strange places sir said i but i think it would be as well to tell you where and how in a more private manner  he seemed to muse a while holding his lip in his hand and looking now at me and now upon the causeway of the street  yes says he that will be the best no doubt and he led me back with him into his house cried out to some one whom i could not see that he would be engaged all morning and brought me into a little dusty chamber full of books and documents here he sat down and bade me be seated though i thought he looked a little ruefully from his clean chair to my muddy rags and now says he if you have any business pray be brief and come swiftly to the point nec gemino bellum trojanum orditur ab ovodo you understand that says he with a keen look  i will even do as horace says sir i answered smiling and carry you in medias res he nodded as if he was well pleased and indeed his scrap of latin had been set to test me for all that and though i was somewhat encouraged the blood came in my face when i added i have reason to believe myself some rights on the estate of shaws  he got a paper book out of a drawer and set it before him open well said he  but i had shot my bolt and sat speechless  come come mr balfour said he you must continue where were you born  in essendean sir said i the year 1733 the 12th of march  he seemed to follow this statement in his paper book but what that meant i knew not your father and mother said he  my father was alexander balfour schoolmaster of that place said i and my mother grace pitarrow i think her people were from angus  have you any papers proving your identity asked mr rankeillor  no sir said i but they are in the hands of mr campbell the minister and could be readily produced mr campbell too would give me his word and for that matter i do not think my uncle would deny me  meaning mr ebenezer balfour says he  the same said i  whom you have seen he asked  by whom i was received into his own house i answered  did you ever meet a man of the name of hoseason asked mr rankeillor  i did so sir for my sins said i for it was by his means and the procurement of my uncle that i was kidnapped within sight of this town carried to sea suffered shipwreck and a hundred other hardships and stand before you today in this poor accoutrement  you say you were shipwrecked said rankeillor where was that  off the south end of the isle of mull said i the name of the isle on which i was cast up is the island earraid  ah says he smiling you are deeper than me in the geography but so far i may tell you this agrees pretty exactly with other informations that i hold but you say you were kidnapped in what sense  in the plain meaning of the word sir said i i was on my way to your house when i was trepanned on board the brig cruelly struck down thrown below and knew no more of anything till we were far at sea i was destined for the plantations a fate that in gods providence i have escaped  the brig was lost on june the 27th says he looking in his book and we are now at august the 24th here is a considerable hiatus mr balfour of near upon two months it has already caused a vast amount of trouble to your friends and i own i shall not be very well contented until it is set right  indeed sir said i these months are very easily filled up but yet before i told my story i would be glad to know that i was talking to a friend  this is to argue in a circle said the lawyer i cannot be convinced till i have heard you i cannot be your friend till i am properly informed if you were more trustful it would better befit your time of life and you know mr balfour we have a proverb in the country that evildoers are aye evildreaders  you are not to forget sir said i that i have already suffered by my trustfulness and was shipped off to be a slave by the very man that if i rightly understand is your employer  all this while i had been gaining ground with mr rankeillor and in proportion as i gained ground gaining confidence but at this sally which i made with something of a smile myself he fairly laughed aloud  no no said he it is not so bad as that fui non sum i was indeed your uncles man of business but while you imberbis juvenis custode remoto were gallivanting in the west a good deal of water has run under the bridges and if your ears did not sing it was not for lack of being talked about on the very day of your sea disaster mr campbell stalked into my office demanding you from all the winds i had never heard of your existence but i had known your father and from matters in my competence to be touched upon hereafter i was disposed to fear the worst mr ebenezer admitted having seen you declared what seemed improbable that he had given you considerable sums and that you had started for the continent of europe intending to fulfil your education which was probable and praiseworthy interrogated how you had come to send no word to mr campbell he deponed that you had expressed a great desire to break with your past life further interrogated where you now were protested ignorance but believed you were in leyden that is a close sum of his replies i am not exactly sure that any one believed him continued mr rankeillor with a smile and in particular he so much disrelished some expressions of mine that in a word he showed me to the door we were then at a full stand for whatever shrewd suspicions we might entertain we had no shadow of probation in the very article comes captain hoseason with the story of your drowning whereupon all fell through with no consequences but concern to mr campbell injury to my pocket and another blot upon your uncles character which could very ill afford it and now mr balfour said he you understand the whole process of these matters and can judge for yourself to what extent i may be trusted  indeed he was more pedantic than i can represent him and placed more scraps of latin in his speech but it was all uttered with a fine geniality of eye and manner which went far to conquer my distrust moreover i could see he now treated me as if i was myself beyond a doubt so that first point of my identity seemed fully granted  sir said i if i tell you my story i must commit a friends life to your discretion pass me your word it shall be sacred and for what touches myself i will ask no better guarantee than just your face  he passed me his word very seriously but said he these are rather alarming prolocutions and if there are in your story any little jostles to the law i would beg you to bear in mind that i am a lawyer and pass lightly  thereupon i told him my story from the first he listening with his spectacles thrust up and his eyes closed so that i sometimes feared he was asleep but no such matter he heard every word as i found afterward with such quickness of hearing and precision of memory as often surprised me even strange outlandish gaelic names heard for that time only he remembered and would remind me of years after yet when i called alan breck in full we had an odd scene the name of alan had of course rung through scotland with the news of the appin murder and the offer of the reward and it had no sooner escaped me than the lawyer moved in his seat and opened his eyes  i would name no unnecessary names mr balfour said he above all of highlanders many of whom are obnoxious to the law  well it might have been better not said i but since i have let it slip i may as well continue  not at all said mr rankeillor i am somewhat dull of hearing as you may have remarked and i am far from sure i caught the name exactly we will call your friend if you please mr thomsonthat there may be no reflections and in future i would take some such way with any highlander that you may have to mentiondead or alive  by this i saw he must have heard the name all too clearly and had already guessed i might be coming to the murder if he chose to play this part of ignorance it was no matter of mine so i smiled said it was no very highlandsounding name and consented through all the rest of my story alan was mr thomson which amused me the more as it was a piece of policy after his own heart james stewart in like manner was mentioned under the style of mr thomsons kinsman colin campbell passed as a mr glen and to cluny when i came to that part of my tale i gave the name of mr jameson a highland chief it was truly the most open farce and i wondered that the lawyer should care to keep it up but after all it was quite in the taste of that age when there were two parties in the state and quiet persons with no very high opinions of their own sought out every cranny to avoid offence to either  well well said the lawyer when i had quite done this is a great epic a great odyssey of yours you must tell it sir in a sound latinity when your scholarship is riper or in english if you please though for my part i prefer the stronger tongue you have rolled much quæ regio in terriswhat parish in scotland to make a homely translation has not been filled with your wanderings you have shown besides a singular aptitude for getting into false positions and yes upon the whole for behaving well in them this mr thomson seems to me a gentleman of some choice qualities though perhaps a trifle bloodyminded it would please me none the worse if with all his merits he were soused in the north sea for the man mr david is a sore embarrassment but you are doubtless quite right to adhere to him indubitably he adhered to you it comeswe may sayhe was your true companion nor less paribus curis vestigia figit for i daresay you would both take an orra thought upon the gallows well well these days are fortunately by and i think speaking humanly that you are near the end of your troubles  as he thus moralised on my adventures he looked upon me with so much humour and benignity that i could scarce contain my satisfaction i had been so long wandering with lawless people and making my bed upon the hills and under the bare sky that to sit once more in a clean covered house and to talk amicably with a gentleman in broadcloth seemed mighty elevations even as i thought so my eye fell on my unseemly tatters and i was once more plunged in confusion but the lawyer saw and understood me he rose called over the stair to lay another plate for mr balfour would stay to dinner and led me into a bedroom in the upper part of the house here he set before me water and soap and a comb and laid out some clothes that belonged to his son and here with another apposite tag he left me to my toilet   footnote    33 newly roughcast     chapter xxviii  i go in quest of my inheritance   i made what change i could in my appearance and blithe was i to look in the glass and find the beggarman a thing of the past and david balfour come to life again and yet i was ashamed of the change too and above all of the borrowed clothes when i had done mr rankeillor caught me on the stair made me his compliments and had me again into the cabinet  sit ye down mr david said he and now that you are looking a little more like yourself let me see if i can find you any news you will be wondering no doubt about your father and your uncle to be sure it is a singular tale and the explanation is one that i blush to have to offer you for says he really with embarrassment the matter hinges on a loveaffair  truly said i i cannot very well join that notion with my uncle  but your uncle mr david was not always old replied the lawyer and what may perhaps surprise you more not always ugly he had a fine gallant air people stood in their doors to look after him as he went by upon a mettle horse i have seen it with these eyes and i ingenuously confess not altogether without envy for i was a plain lad myself and a plain mans son and in those days it was a case of odi te qui bellus es sabelle  it sounds like a dream said i  ay ay said the lawyer that is how it is with youth and age nor was that all but he had a spirit of his own that seemed to promise great things in the future in 1715 what must he do but run away to join the rebels it was your father that pursued him found him in a ditch and brought him back multum gementem to the mirth of the whole country however majora canamusthe two lads fell in love and that with the same lady mr ebenezer who was the admired and the beloved and the spoiled one made no doubt mighty certain of the victory and when he found he had deceived himself screamed like a peacock the whole country heard of it now he lay sick at home with his silly family standing round the bed in tears now he rode from publichouse to publichouse and shouted his sorrows into the lug of tom dick and harry your father mr david was a kind gentleman but he was weak dolefully weak took all this folly with a long countenance and one dayby your leaveresigned the lady she was no such fool however its from her you must inherit your excellent good sense and she refused to be bandied from one to another both got upon their knees to her and the upshot of the matter for that while was that she showed both of them the door that was in august dear me the same year i came from college the scene must have been highly farcical  i thought myself it was a silly business but i could not forget my father had a hand in it surely sir it had some note of tragedy said i  why no sir not at all returned the lawyer for tragedy implies some ponderable matter in dispute some dignus vindice nodus and this piece of work was all about the petulance of a young ass that had been spoiled and wanted nothing so much as to be tied up and soundly belted however that was not your fathers view and the end of it was that from concession to concession on your fathers part and from one height to another of squalling sentimental selfishness upon your uncles they came at last to drive a sort of bargain from whose ill results you have recently been smarting the one man took the lady the other the estate now mr david they talk a great deal of charity and generosity but in this disputable state of life i often think the happiest consequences seem to flow when a gentleman consults his lawyer and takes all the law allows him anyhow this piece of quixotry on your fathers part as it was unjust in itself has brought forth a monstrous family of injustices your father and mother lived and died poor folk you were poorly reared and in the meanwhile what a time it has been for the tenants on the estate of shaws and i might add if it was a matter i cared much about what a time for mr ebenezer  and yet that is certainly the strangest part of all said i that a mans nature should thus change  true said mr rankeillor and yet i imagine it was natural enough he could not think that he had played a handsome part those who knew the story gave him the cold shoulder those who knew it not seeing one brother disappear and the other succeed in the estate raised a cry of murder so that upon all sides he found himself evited money was all he got by his bargain well he came to think the more of money he was selfish when he was young he is selfish now that he is old and the latter end of all these pretty manners and fine feelings you have seen for yourself  well sir said i and in all this what is my position  the estate is yours beyond a doubt replied the lawyer it matters nothing what your father signed you are the heir of entail but your uncle is a man to fight the indefensible and it would be likely your identity that he would call in question a lawsuit is always expensive and a family lawsuit always scandalous besides which if any of your doings with your friend mr thomson were to come out we might find that we had burned our fingers the kidnapping to be sure would be a court card upon our side if we could only prove it but it may be difficult to prove and my advice upon the whole is to make a very easy bargain with your uncle perhaps even leaving him at shaws where he has taken root for a quarter of a century and contenting yourself in the meanwhile with a fair provision  i told him i was very willing to be easy and that to carry family concerns before the public was a step from which i was naturally much averse in the meantime thinking to myself i began to see the outlines of that scheme on which we afterwards acted  the great affair i asked is to bring home to him the kidnapping  surely said mr rankeillor and if possible out of court for mark you here mr david we could no doubt find some men of the covenant who would swear to your reclusion but once they were in the box we could no longer check their testimony and some word of your friend mr thomson must certainly crop outwhich from what you have let fall i cannot think to be desirable  well sir said i here is my way of it and i opened my plot to him  but this would seem to involve my meeting the man thomson says he when i had done  i think so indeed sir said i  dear doctor cries he rubbing his brow dear doctor no mr david i am afraid your scheme is inadmissible i say nothing against your friend mr thomson i know nothing against him and if i didmark this mr davidit would be my duty to lay hands on him now i put it to you is it wise to meet he may have matters to his charge he may not have told you all his name may not be even thomson cries the lawyer twinkling for some of these fellows will pick up names by the roadside as another would gather haws  you must be the judge sir said i  but it was clear my plan had taken hold upon his fancy for he kept musing to himself till we were called to dinner and the company of mrs rankeillor and that lady had scarce left us again to ourselves and a bottle of wine ere he was back harping on my proposal when and where was i to meet my friend mr thomson was i sure of mr ts discretion supposing we could catch the old fox tripping would i consent to such and such a term of an agreementthese and the like questions he kept asking at long intervals while he thoughtfully rolled his wine upon his tongue when i had answered all of them seemingly to his contentment he fell into a still deeper muse even the claret being now forgotten then he got a sheet of paper and a pencil and set to work writing and weighing every word and at last touched a bell and had his clerk into the chamber  torrance said he i must have this written out fair against tonight and when it is done you will be so kind as put on your hat and be ready to come along with this gentleman and me for you will probably be wanted as a witness  what sir cried i as soon as the clerk was gone are you to venture it  why so it would appear says he filling his glass but let us speak no more of business the very sight of torrance brings in my head a little droll matter of some years ago when i had made a tryst with the poor oaf at the cross of edinburgh each had gone his proper errand and when it came four oclock torrance had been taking a glass and did not know his master and i who had forgot my spectacles was so blind without them that i give you my word i did not know my own clerk and thereupon he laughed heartily  i said it was an odd chance and smiled out of politeness but what held me all the afternoon in wonder he kept returning and dwelling on this story and telling it again with fresh details and laughter so that i began at last to be quite out of countenance and feel ashamed for my friends folly  towards the time i had appointed with alan we set out from the house mr rankeillor and i arm in arm and torrance following behind with the deed in his pocket and a covered basket in his hand all through the town the lawyer was bowing right and left and continually being buttonholed by gentlemen on matters of burgh or private business and i could see he was one greatly looked up to in the county at last we were clear of the houses and began to go along the side of the haven and towards the hawes inn and the ferry pier the scene of my misfortune i could not look upon the place without emotion recalling how many that had been there with me that day were now no more ransome taken i could hope from the evil to come shuan passed where i dared not follow him and the poor souls that had gone down with the brig in her last plunge all these and the brig herself i had outlived and come through these hardships and fearful perils without scathe my only thought should have been of gratitude and yet i could not behold the place without sorrow for others and a chill of recollected fear  i was so thinking when upon a sudden mr rankeillor cried out clapped his hand to his pockets and began to laugh  why he cries if this be not a farcical adventure after all that i said i have forgot my glasses  at that of course i understood the purpose of his anecdote and knew that if he had left his spectacles at home it had been done on purpose so that he might have the benefit of alans help without the awkwardness of recognising him and indeed it was well thought upon for now suppose things to go the very worst how could rankeillor swear to my friends identity or how be made to bear damaging evidence against myself for all that he had been a long while finding out his want and had spoken to and recognised a good few persons as we came through the town and i had little doubt myself that he saw reasonably well  as soon as we were past the hawes where i recognised the landlord smoking his pipe in the door and was amazed to see him look no older mr rankeillor changed the order of march walking behind with torrance and sending me forward in the manner of a scout i went up the hill whistling from time to time my gaelic air and at length i had the pleasure to hear it answered and to see alan rise from behind a bush he was somewhat dashed in spirits having passed a long day alone skulking in the country and made but a poor meal in an alehouse near dundas but at the mere sight of my clothes he began to brighten up and as soon as i had told him in what a forward state our matters were and the part i looked to him to play in what remained he sprang into a new man  and that is a very good notion of yours says he and i dare to say that you could lay your hands upon no better man to put it through than alan breck it is not a thing mark ye that any one could do but takes a gentleman of penetrationbut it sticks in my head your lawyerman will be somewhat wearying to see me says alan  accordingly i cried and waved on mr rankeillor who came up alone and was presented to my friend mr thomson  mr thomson i am pleased to meet you said he but i have forgotten my glasses and our friend mr david here clapping me on the shoulder will tell you that i am little better than blind and that you must not be surprised if i pass you by tomorrow  this he said thinking that alan would be pleased but the highlandmans vanity was ready to startle at a less matter than that  why sir says he stiffly i would say it mattered the less as we are met here for a particular end to see justice done to mr balfour and by what i can see not very likely to have much else in common but i accept your apology which was a very proper one to make  and that is more than i could look for mr thomson said rankeillor heartily and now as you and i are the chief actors in this enterprise i think we should come into a nice agreement to which end i propose that you should lend me your arm for what with the dusk and the want of my glasses i am not very clear as to the path and as for you mr david you will find torrance a pleasant kind of body to speak with only let me remind you its quite needless he should hear more of your adventures or those ofahemmr thomson  accordingly these two went on ahead in very close talk and torrance and i brought up the rear  night was quite come when we came in view of the house of shaws ten had been gone some time it was dark and mild with a pleasant rustling wind in the southwest that covered the sound of our approach as we drew near we saw no glimmer of light in any portion of the building it seemed my uncle was already in bed which was indeed the best thing for our arrangements we made our last whispered consultation some fifty yards away and then the lawyer and torrance and i crept quietly up and crouched down beside the corner of the house and as soon as we were in our places alan strode to the door without concealment and began to knock     chapter xxix  i come into my kingdom   for some time alan volleyed upon the door and his knocking only roused the echoes of the house and neighbourhood at last however i could hear the noise of a window gently thrust up and knew that my uncle had come to his observatory by what light there was he would see alan standing like a dark shadow on the steps the three witnesses were hidden quite out of his view so that there was nothing to alarm an honest man in his own house for all that he studied his visitor a while in silence and when he spoke his voice had a quaver of misgiving  whats this says he this is nae kind of time of night for decent folk and i hae nae trokings34 wi nighthawks what brings ye here i have a blunderbush  is that yoursel mr balfour returned alan stepping back and looking up into the darkness have a care of that blunderbuss theyre nasty things to burst  what brings ye here and whae are ye says my uncle angrily  i have no manner of inclination to rowt out my name to the countryside said alan but what brings me here is another story being more of your affairs than mine and if yere sure its what ye would like ill set it to a tune and sing it to you  and what ist asked my uncle  david says alan  what was that cried my uncle in a mighty changed voice  shall i give ye the rest of the name then said alan  there was a pause and then im thinking ill better let ye in says my uncle doubtfully  i daresay that said alan but the point is would i go now i will tell you what i am thinking i am thinking that it is here upon this doorstep that we must confer upon this business and it shall be here or nowhere at all whatever for i would have you to understand that i am as stiffnecked as yoursel and a gentleman of better family  this change of note disconcerted ebenezer he was a little while digesting it and then says he weel weel what must be must and shut the window but it took him a long time to get downstairs and a still longer to undo the fastenings repenting i daresay and taken with fresh claps of fear at every second step and every bolt and bar at last however we heard the creak of the hinges and it seems my uncle slipped gingerly out and seeing that alan had stepped back a pace or two sate him down on the top doorstep with the blunderbuss ready in his hands  and now says he mind i have my blunderbush and if ye take a step nearer yere as good as deid  and a very civil speech says alan to be sure  na says my uncle but this is no a very chancy kind of a proceeding and im bound to be prepared and now that we understand each other yell can name your business  why says alan you that are a man of so much understanding will doubtless have perceived that i am a hieland gentleman my name has nae business in my story but the county of my friends is no very far from the isle of mull of which ye will have heard it seems there was a ship lost in those parts and the next day a gentleman of my family was seeking wreckwood for his fire along the sands when he came upon a lad that was half drowned well he brought him to and he and some other gentlemen took and clapped him in an auld ruined castle where from that day to this he has been a great expense to my friends my friends are a wee wildlike and not so particular about the law as some that i could name and finding that the lad owned some decent folk and was your born nephew mr balfour they asked me to give ye a bit call and to confer upon the matter and i may tell ye at the offgo unless we can agree upon some terms ye are little likely to set eyes upon him for my friends added alan simply are no very well off  my uncle cleared his throat im no very caring says he he wasna a good lad at the best of it and ive nae call to interfere  ay ay said alan i see what ye would be at pretending ye dont care to make the ransom smaller  na said my uncle its the mere truth i take nae manner of interest in the lad and ill pay nae ransom and ye can make a kirk and a mill of him for what i care  hoot sir says alan bloods thicker than water in the deils name ye canna desert your brothers son for the fair shame of it and if ye did and it came to be kennt ye wouldna be very popular in your countryside or im the more deceived  im no just very popular the way it is returned ebenezer and i dinna see how it would come to be kennt no by me onyway nor yet by you or your friends so thats idle talk my buckie says he  then itll have to be david that tells it said alan  how that says my uncle sharply  ou just this way says alan my friends would doubtless keep your nephew as long as there was any likelihood of siller to be made of it but if there was nane i am clearly of opinion they would let him gang where he pleased and be damned to him  ay but im no very caring about that either said my uncle i wouldna be muckle made up with that  i was thinking that said alan  and what for why asked ebenezer  why mr balfour replied alan by all that i could hear there were two ways of it either ye liked david and would pay to get him back or else ye had very good reasons for not wanting him and would pay for us to keep him it seems its not the first well then its the second and blithe am i to ken it for it should be a pretty penny in my pocket and the pockets of my friends  i dinna follow ye there said my uncle  no said alan well see here you dinna want the lad back well what do ye want done with him and how much will ye pay  my uncle made no answer but shifted uneasily on his seat  come sir cried alan i would have ye to ken that i am a gentleman i bear a kings name i am nae rider to kick my shanks at your halldoor either give me an answer in civility and that out of hand or by the top of glencoe i will ram three feet of iron through your vitals  eh man cried my uncle scrambling to his feet give me a meenit whats like wrong with ye im just a plain man and nae dancingmaster and im trying to be as ceevil as its morally possible as for that wild talk its fair disrepitable vitals says you and where would i be with my blunderbush he snarled  powder and your auld hands are but as the snail to the swallow against the bright steel in the hands of alan said the other before your jottering finger could find the trigger the hilt would dirl on your breastbane  eh man whaes denying it said my uncle pit it as ye please haet your ain way ill do naething to cross ye just tell me what like yell be wanting and yell see that well can agree fine  troth sir said alan i ask for nothing but plain dealing in two words do ye want the lad killed or kept  o sirs cried ebenezer o sirs me thats no kind of language  killed or kept repeated alan  o keepit keepit wailed my uncle well have nae bloodshed if you please  well says alan as ye please thatll be the dearer  the dearer cries ebenezer would ye fyle your hands wi crime  hoot said alan theyre baith crime whatever and the killings easier and quicker and surer keeping the ladll be a fashious35 job a fashious kittle business  ill have him keepit though returned my uncle i never had naething to do with onything morally wrong and im no gaun to begin to pleasure a wild hielandman  yere unco scrupulous sneered alan  im a man o principle said ebenezer simply and if i have to pay for it ill have to pay for it and besides says he ye forget the lads my brothers son  well well said alan and now about the price its no very easy for me to set a name upon it i would first have to ken some small matters i would have to ken for instance what ye gave hoseason at the first offgo  hoseason cries my uncle struck aback what for  for kidnapping david says alan  its a lee its a black lee cried my uncle he was never kidnapped he leed in his throat that tauld ye that kidnapped he never was  thats no fault of mine nor yet of yours said alan nor yet of hoseasons if hes a man that can be trusted  what do ye mean cried ebenezer did hoseason tell ye  why ye donnered auld runt how else would i ken cried alan hoseason and me are partners we gang shares so ye can see for yoursel what good ye can do leeing and i must plainly say ye drove a fools bargain when ye let a man like the sailorman so far forward in your private matters but thats past praying for and ye must lie on your bed the way ye made it and the point in hand is just this what did ye pay him  has he tauld ye himsel asked my uncle  thats my concern said alan  weel said my uncle i dinna care what he said he leed and the solemn gods truth is this that i gave him twenty pound but ill be perfecly honest with ye forbye that he was to have the selling of the lad in caroliny whilk would be as muckle mair but no from my pocket ye see  thank you mr thomson that will do excellently well said the lawyer stepping forward and then mighty civilly goodevening mr balfour said he  and goodevening uncle ebenezer said i  and its a braw nicht mr balfour added torrance  never a word said my uncle neither black nor white but just sat where he was on the top doorstep and stared upon us like a man turned to stone alan filched away his blunderbuss and the lawyer taking him by the arm plucked him up from the doorstep led him into the kitchen whither we all followed and set him down in a chair beside the hearth where the fire was out and only a rushlight burning  there we all looked upon him for a while exulting greatly in our success but yet with a sort of pity for the mans shame  come come mr ebenezer said the lawyer you must not be downhearted for i promise you we shall make easy terms in the meanwhile give us the cellar key and torrance shall draw us a bottle of your fathers wine in honour of the event then turning to me and taking me by the hand mr david says he i wish you all joy in your good fortune which i believe to be deserved and then to alan with a spice of drollery mr thomson i pay you my compliment it was most artfully conducted but in one point you somewhat outran my comprehension do i understand your name to be james or charles or is it george perhaps  and why should it be any of the three sir quoth alan drawing himself up like one who smelt an offence  only sir that you mentioned a kings name replied rankeillor and as there has never yet been a king thomson or his fame at least has never come my way i judged you must refer to that you had in baptism  this was just the stab that alan would feel keenest and i am free to confess he took it very ill not a word would he answer but stepped off to the far end of the kitchen and sat down and sulked and it was not till i stepped after him and gave him my hand and thanked him by title as the chief spring of my success that he began to smile a bit and was at last prevailed upon to join our party  by that time we had the fire lighted and a bottle of wine uncorked a good supper came out of the basket to which torrance and i and alan set ourselves down while the lawyer and my uncle passed into the next chamber to consult they stayed there closeted about an hour at the end of which period they had come to a good understanding and my uncle and i set our hands to the agreement in a formal manner by the terms of this my uncle bound himself to satisfy rankeillor as to his intromissions and to pay me two clear thirds of the yearly income of shaws  so the beggar in the ballad had come home and when i lay down that night on the kitchen chests i was a man of means and had a name in the country alan and torrance and rankeillor slept and snored on their hard beds but for me who had lain out under heaven and upon dirt and stones so many days and nights and often with an empty belly and in fear of death this good change in my case unmanned me more than any of the former evil ones and i lay till dawn looking at the fire on the roof and planning the future   footnotes    34 dealings    35 troublesome     chapter xxx  goodbye   so far as i was concerned myself i had come to port but i had still alan to whom i was so much beholden on my hands and i felt besides a heavy charge in the matter of the murder and james of the glens on both these heads i unbosomed to rankeillor the next morning walking to and fro about six of the clock before the house of shaws and with nothing in view but the fields and woods that had been my ancestors and were now mine even as i spoke on these grave subjects my eye would take a glad bit of a run over the prospect and my heart jump with pride  about my clear duty to my friend the lawyer had no doubt i must help him out of the country at whatever risk but in the case of james he was of a different mind  mr thomson says he is one thing mr thomsons kinsman quite another i know little of the facts but i gather that a great noble whom we will call if you like the d of a36 has some concern and is even supposed to feel some animosity in the matter the d of a is doubtless an excellent nobleman but mr david timeo qui nocuere deos if you interfere to baulk his vengeance you should remember there is one way to shut your testimony out and that is to put you in the dock there you would be in the same pickle as mr thomsons kinsman you will object that you are innocent well but so is he and to be tried for your life before a highland jury on a highland quarrel and with a highland judge upon the bench would be a brief transition to the gallows  now i had made all these reasonings before and found no very good reply to them so i put on all the simplicity i could in that case sir said i i would just have to be hangedwould i not  my dear boy cries he go in gods name and do what you think is right it is a poor thought that at my time of life i should be advising you to choose the safe and shameful and i take it back with an apology go and do your duty and be hanged if you must like a gentleman there are worse things in the world than to be hanged  not many sir said i smiling  why yes sir he cried very many and it would be ten times better for your uncle to go no farther afield if he were dangling decently upon a gibbet  thereupon he turned into the house still in a great fervour of mind so that i saw i had pleased him heartily and there he wrote me two letters making his comments on them as he wrote  this says he is to my bankers the british linen company placing a credit to your name consult mr thomson he will know of ways and you with this credit can supply the means i trust you will be a good husband of your money but in the affair of a friend like mr thomson i would be even prodigal then for his kinsman there is no better way than that you should seek the advocate tell him your tale and offer testimony whether he may take it or not is quite another matter and will turn on the d of a now that you may reach the lord advocate well recommended i give you here a letter to a namesake of your own the learned mr balfour of pilrig a man whom i esteem it will look better that you should be presented by one of your own name and the laird of pilrig is much looked up to in the faculty and stands well with lord advocate grant i would not trouble him if i were you with any particulars and do you know i think it would be needless to refer to mr thomson form yourself upon the laird he is a good model when you deal with the advocate be discreet and in all these matters may the lord guide you mr david  thereupon he took his farewell and set out with torrance for the ferry while alan and i turned our faces for the city of edinburgh as we went by the footpath and beside the gateposts and the unfinished lodge we kept looking back at the house of my fathers it stood there bare and great and smokeless like a place not lived in only in one of the top windows there was the peak of a nightcap bobbing up and down and back and forward like the head of a rabbit from a burrow i had little welcome when i came and less kindness while i stayed but at least i was watched as i went away  alan and i went slowly forward upon our way having little heart either to walk or speak the same thought was uppermost in both that we were near the time of our parting and remembrance of all the bygone days sate upon us sorely we talked indeed of what should be done and it was resolved that alan should keep to the country biding now here now there but coming once in the day to a particular place where i might be able to communicate with him either in my own person or by messenger in the meanwhile i was to seek out a lawyer who was an appin stewart and a man therefore to be wholly trusted and it should be his part to find a ship and to arrange for alans safe embarkation no sooner was this business done than the words seemed to leave us and though i would seek to jest with alan under the name of mr thomson and he with me on my new clothes and my estate you could feel very well that we were nearer tears than laughter  we came the byway over the hill of corstorphine and when we got near to the place called restandbethankful and looked down on corstorphine bogs and over to the city and the castle on the hill we both stopped for we both knew without a word said that we had come to where our ways parted here he repeated to me once again what had been agreed upon between us the address of the lawyer the daily hour at which alan might be found and the signals that were to be made by any that came seeking him then i gave him what money i had a guinea or two of rankeillors so that he should not starve in the meanwhile and then we stood a space and looked over at edinburgh in silence  well goodbye said alan and held out his left hand  goodbye said i and gave the hand a little grasp and went off down the hill  neither one of us looked the other in the face nor so long as he was in my view did i take one back glance at the friend i was leaving but as i went on my way to the city i felt so lost and lonesome that i could have found it in my heart to sit down by the dyke and cry and weep like any baby  it was coming near noon when i passed in by the west kirk and the grassmarket into the streets of the capital the huge height of the buildings running up to ten and fifteen stories the narrow arched entries that continually vomited passengers the wares of the merchants in their windows the hubbub and endless stir the foul smells and the fine clothes and a hundred other particulars too small to mention struck me into a kind of stupor of surprise so that i let the crowd carry me to and fro and yet all the time what i was thinking of was alan at restandbethankful and all the time although you would think i would not choose but be delighted with these braws and novelties there was a cold gnawing in my inside like a remorse for something wrong  the hand of providence brought me in my drifting to the very doors of the british linen companys bank
