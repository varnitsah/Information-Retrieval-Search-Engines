79562284	literature and lifethe man of letters as a man of business  by william dean howells   bibliographical  perhaps the reader may not feel in these papers that inner solidarity which the writer is conscious of and it is in this doubt that the writer wishes to offer a word of explanation he owns as he must that they have every appearance of a group of desultory sketches and essays without palpable relation to one another or superficial allegiance to any central motive yet he ventures to hope that the reader who makes his way through them will be aware in the retrospect of something like this relation and this allegiance  for my own part if i am to identify myself with the writer who is here on his defence i have never been able to see much difference between what seemed to me literature and what seemed to me life if i did not find life in what professed to be literature i disabled its profession and possibly from this habit now inveterate with me i am never quite sure of life unless i find literature in it unless the thing seen reveals to me an intrinsic poetry and puts on phrases that clothe it pleasingly to the imagination i do not much care for it but if it will do this i do not mind how poor or common or squalid it shows at first glance it challenges my curiosity and keeps my sympathy instantly i love it and wish to share my pleasure in it with some one else or as many ones else as i can get to look or listen if the thing is something read rather than seen i am not anxious about the matter if it is like life i know that it is poetry and take it to my heart there can be no offence in it for which its truth will not make me amends  out of this way of thinking and feeling about these two great things about literature and life there may have arisen a confusion as to which is which but i do not wish to part them and in their union i have found since i learned my letters a joy in them both which i hope will last till i forget my letters         so was it when my life began         so is it now i am a man         so be it when i shall grow old  it is the rainbow in the sky for me and i have seldom seen a sky without some bit of rainbow in it sometimes i can make others see it sometimes not but i always like to try and if i fail i harbor no worse thought of them than that they have not had their eyes examined and fitted with glasses which would at least have helped their vision  as to the where and when of the different papers in which i suppose their bibliography properly lies i need not be very exact the man of letters as a man of business was written in a hotel at lakewood in the may of 1892 or 1893 and pretty promptly printed in scribners magazine confessions of a summer colonist was done at york harbor in the fall of 1898 for the atlantic monthly and was a study of life at that pleasant resort as it was livedin the idyllic times of the earlier settlement long before motors and almost before private carriages american literary centres american literature in exile puritanism in american fiction politics of american authors were with three or four other papers the endeavors of the american correspondent of the london timess literary supplement to enlighten the british understanding as to our ways of thinking and writing eleven years ago and are here left to bear the defects of the qualities of their obsolete actuality in the year 1899 most of the studies and sketches are from an extinct department of life and letters which i invented for harpers weekly and operated for a year or so toward the close of the nineteenth century notable among these is the last days in a dutch hotel which was written at paris in 1897 it is rather a favorite of mine perhaps because i liked holland so much others which more or less personally recognize effects of sojourn in new york or excursions into new england are from the same department several may be recalled by the longer memoried reader as papers from the editors easy chair in harpers monthly wild flowers of the asphalt is the review of an ever delightful book which i printed in harpers bazar the editors relations with the young contributor was my endeavor in youths companion to shed a kindly light from my experience in both seats upon the toooften and too needlessly embittered souls of literary beginners  so it goes as to the motives and origins of the collection which may persist in disintegrating under the readers eye in spite of my well meant endeavors to establish a solidarity for it the group at least attests even in this event the wide the wild variety of my literary production in time and space from the beginning the journalists independence of the scholars solitude and seclusion has remained with me and though i am fond enough of a bookish entourage of the serried volumes of the library shelves and the inviting breadth of the library table i am not disabled by the hard conditions of a bedroom in a summer hotel or the narrow possibilities of a candlestand without a dictionary in the whole house or a book of reference even in the running brooks outside                        w d howells                    literature and life    the man of letters as a man of business  i think that every man ought to work for his living without exception and that when he has once avouched his willingness to work society should provide him with work and warrant him a living i do not think any man ought to live by an art a mans art should be his privilege when he has proven his fitness to exercise it and has otherwise earned his daily bread and its results should be free to all there is an instinctive sense of this even in the midst of the grotesque confusion of our economic being people feel that there is something profane something impious in taking money for a picture or a poem or a statue most of all the artist himself feels this he puts on a bold front with the world to be sure and brazens it out as business but he knows very well that there is something false and vulgar in it and that the work which cannot be truly priced in money cannot be truly paid in money he can of course say that the priest takes money for reading the marriage service for christening the newborn babe and for saying the last office for the dead that the physician sells healing that justice itself is paid for and that he is merely a party to the thing that is and must be he can say that as the thing is unless he sells his art he cannot live that society will leave him to starve if he does not hit its fancy in a picture or a poem or a statue and all this is bitterly true he is and he must be only too glad if there is a market for his wares without a market for his wares he must perish or turn to making something that will sell better than pictures or poems or statues all the same the sin and the shame remain and the averted eye sees them still with its inward vision many will make believe otherwise but i would rather not make believe otherwise and in trying to write of literature as business i am tempted to begin by saying that business is the opprobrium of literature   i  literature is at once the most intimate and the most articulate of the arts it cannot impart its effect through the senses or the nerves as the other arts can it is beautiful only through the intelligence it is the mind speaking to the mind until it has been put into absolute terms of an invariable significance it does not exist at all it cannot awaken this emotion in one and that in another if it fails to express precisely the meaning of the author if it does not say him it says nothing and is nothing so that when a poet has put his heart much or little into a poem and sold it to a magazine the scandal is greater than when a painter has sold a picture to a patron or a sculptor has modelled a statue to order these are artists less articulate and less intimate than the poet they are more exterior to their work they are less personally in it they part with less of themselves in the dicker it does not change the nature of the case to say that tennyson and longfellow and emerson sold the poems in which they couched the most mystical messages their genius was charged to bear mankind they submitted to the conditions which none can escape but that does not justify the conditions which are none the less the conditions of hucksters because they are imposed upon poets if it will serve to make my meaning a little clearer we will suppose that a poet has been crossed in love or has suffered some real sorrow like the loss of a wife or child he pours out his broken heart in verse that shall bring tears of sacred sympathy from his readers and an editor pays him a hundred dollars for the right of bringing his verse to their notice it is perfectly true that the poem was not written for these dollars but it is perfectly true that it was sold for them the poet must use his emotions to pay his provision bills he has no other means society does not propose to pay his bills for him yet and at the end of the ends the unsophisticated witness finds the transaction ridiculous finds it repulsive finds it shabby somehow he knows that if our huckstering civilization did not at every moment violate the eternal fitness of things the poets song would have been given to the world and the poet would have been cared for by the whole human brotherhood as any man should be who does the duty that every man owes it  the instinctive sense of the dishonor which moneypurchase does to art is so strong that sometimes a man of letters who can pay his way otherwise refuses pay for his work as lord byron did for a while from a noble pride and as count tolstoy has tried to do from a noble conscience but byrons publisher profited by a generosity which did not reach his readers and the countess tolstoy collects the copyright which her husband foregoes so that these two eminent instances of protest against business in literature may be said not to have shaken its money basis i know of no others but there may be many that i am culpably ignorant of still i doubt if there are enough to affect the fact that literature is business as well as art and almost as soon at present business is the only human solidarity we are all bound together with that chain whatever interests and tastes and principles separate us and i feel quite sure that in writing of the man of letters as a man of business i shall attract far more readers than i should in writing of him as an artist besides as an artist he has been done a great deal already and a commercial state like ours has really more concern in him as a business man perhaps it may sometime be different i do not believe it will till the conditions are different and that is a long way off     ii  in the mean time i confidently appeal to the readers imagination with the fact that there are several men of letters among us who are such good men of business that they can command a hundred dollars a thousand words for all they write it is easy to write a thousand words a day and supposing one of these authors to work steadily it can be seen that his net earnings during the year would come to some such sum as the president of the united states gets for doing far less work of a much more perishable sort if the man of letters were wholly a business man this is what would happen he would make his forty or fifty thousand dollars a year and be able to consort with bank presidents and railroad officials and rich tradesmen and other flowers of our plutocracy on equal terms but unfortunately from a business point of view he is also an artist and the very qualities that enable him to delight the public disable him from delighting it uninterruptedly no rose blooms right along as the english boys at oxford made an american collegian say in a theme which they imagined for him in his national parlance and the man of letters as an artist is apt to have times and seasons when he cannot blossom very often it shall happen that his mind will lie fallow between novels or stories for weeks and months at a stretch when the suggestions of the friendly editor shall fail to fruit in the essays or articles desired when the muse shall altogether withhold herself or shall respond only in a feeble dribble of verse which he might sell indeed but which it would not be good business for him to put on the market but supposing him to be a very diligent and continuous worker and so happy as to have fallen on a theme that delights him and bears him along he may please himself so ill with the result of his labors that he can do nothing less in artistic conscience than destroy a days work a weeks work a months work i know one man of letters who wrote today and tore up tomorrow for nearly a whole summer but even if part of the mistaken work may be saved because it is good work out of place and not intrinsically bad the task of reconstruction wants almost as much time as the production and then when all seems done comes the anxious and endless process of revision these drawbacks reduce the earning capacity of what i may call the highcost man of letters in such measure that an author whose name is known everywhere and whose reputation is commensurate with the boundaries of his country if it does not transcend them shall have the income say of a rising young physician known to a few people in a subordinate city  in view of this fact so humiliating to an author in the presence of a nation of business men like ours i do not know that i can establish the man of letters in the popular esteem as very much of a business man after all he must still have a low rank among practical people and he will be regarded by the great mass of americans as perhaps a little off a little funny a little soft perhaps not and yet i would rather not have a consensus of public opinion on the question i think i am more comfortable without it   iii  there is this to be said in defence of men of letters on the business side that literature is still an infant industry with us and so far from having been protected by our laws it was exposed for ninety years after the foundation of the republic to the vicious competition of stolen goods it is true that we now have the international copyright law at last and we can at least begin to forget our shame but literary property has only fortytwo years of life under our unjust statutes and if it is attacked by robbers the law does not seek out the aggressors and punish them as it would seek out and punish the trespassers upon any other kind of property it leaves the aggrieved owner to bring suit against them and recover damages if he can this may be right enough in itself but i think then that all property should be defended by civil suit and should become public after fortytwo years of private tenure the constitution guarantees us all equality before the law but the lawmakers seem to have forgotten this in the case of our literary industry so long as this remains the case we cannot expect the best business talent to go into literature and the man of letters must keep his present low grade among business men  as i have hinted it is but a little while that he has had any standing at all i may say that it is only since the civil war that literature has become a business with us before that time we had authors and very good ones it is astonishing how good they were but i do not remember any of them who lived by literature except edgar a poe perhaps and we all know how he lived it was largely upon loans they were either men of fortune or they were editors or professors with salaries or incomes apart from the small gains of their pens or they were helped out with public offices one need not go over their names or classify them some of them must have made money by their books but i question whether any one could have lived even very simply upon the money his books brought him no one could do that now unless he wrote a book that we could not recognize as a work of literature but many authors live now and live prettily enough by the sale of the serial publication of their writings to the magazines they do not live so nicely as successful tradespeople of course or as men in the other professions when they begin to make themselves names the high state of brokers bankers railroad operators and the like is in the nature of the case beyond their fondest dreams of pecuniary affluence and social splendor perhaps they do not want the chief seats in the synagogue it is certain they do not get them still they do very fairly well as things go and several have incomes that would seem riches to the great mass of worthy americans who work with their hands for a livingwhen they can get the work their incomes are mainly from serial publication in the different magazines and the prosperity of the magazines has given a whole class existence which as a class was wholly unknown among us before the civil war it is not only the famous or fully recognized authors who live in this way but the much larger number of clever people who are as yet known chiefly to the editors and who may never make themselves a public but who do well a kind of acceptable work these are the sort who do not get reprinted from the periodicals but the better recognized authors do get reprinted and then their serial work in its completed form appeals to the readers who say they do not read serials the multitude of these is not great and if an author rested his hopes upon their favor he would be a much more imbittered man than he now generally is but he understands perfectly well that his reward is in the serial and not in the book the return from that he may count as so much money found in the roada few hundreds a very few thousands at the most unless he is the author of an historical romance   iv  i doubt indeed whether the earnings of literary men are absolutely as great as they were earlier in the century in any of the englishspeaking countries relatively they are nothing like as great scott had forty thousand dollars for woodstock which was not a very large novel and was by no means one of his best and forty thousand dollars then had at least the purchasing power of sixty thousand now moore had three thousand guineas for lalla rookh but what publisher would be rash enough to pay fifteen thousand dollars for the masterpiece of a minor poet now the book except in very rare instances makes nothing like the return to the author that the magazine makes and there are few leading authors who find their account in that form of publication those who do those who sell the most widely in book form are often not at all desired by editors with difficulty they get a serial accepted by any principal magazine on the other hand there are authors whose books compared with those of the popular favorites do not sell and yet they are eagerly sought for by editors they are paid the highest prices and nothing that they offer is refused these are literary artists and it ought to be plain from what i am saying that in belleslettres at least most of the best literature now first sees the light in the magazines and most of the secondbest appears first in book form the oldfashioned people who flatter themselves upon their distinction in not reading magazine fiction or magazine poetry make a great mistake and simply class themselves with the public whose taste is so crude that they cannot enjoy the best of course this is true mainly if not merely of belleslettres history science politics metaphysics in spite of the many excellent articles and papers in these sorts upon what used to be called various emergent occasions are still to be found at their best in books the most monumental example of literature at once light and good which has first reached the public in book form is in the different publications of mark twain but mr clemens has of late turned to the magazines too and now takes their mintmark before he passes into general circulation all this may change again but at present the magazineswe have no longer any reviews form the most direct approach to that part of our reading public which likes the highest things in literary art their readers if we may judge from the quality of the literature they get are more refined than the book readers in our community and their taste has no doubt been cultivated by that of the disciplined and experienced editors so far as i have known these they are men of aesthetic conscience and of generous sympathy they have their preferences in the different kinds and they have their theory of what kind will be most acceptable to their readers but they exercise their selective function with the wish to give them the best things they can i do not know one of themand it has been my good fortune to know them nearly allwho would print a wholly inferior thing for the sake of an inferior class of readers though they may sometimes decline a good thing because for one reason or another they believe it would not be liked still even this does not often happen they would rather chance the good thing they doubted of than underrate their readers judgment  the young author who wins recognition in a firstclass magazine has achieved a double success first with the editor and then with the best reading public many factitious and fallacious literary reputations have been made through books but very few have been made through the magazines which are not only the best means of living but of outliving with the author they are both bread and fame to him if i insist a little upon the high office which this modern form of publication fulfils in the literary world it is because i am impatient of the antiquated and ignorant prejudice which classes the magazines as ephemeral they are ephemeral in form but in substance they are not ephemeral and what is best in them awaits its resurrection in the book which as the first form is so often a lasting death an interesting proof of the value of the magazine to literature is the fact that a good novel will often have wider acceptance as a book from having been a magazine serial   v  under the regime of the great literary periodicals the prosperity of literary men would be much greater than it actually is if the magazines were altogether literary but they are not and this is one reason why literature is still the hungriest of the professions twothirds of the magazines are made up of material which however excellent is without literary quality very probably this is because even the highest class of readers who are the magazine readers have small love of pure literature which seems to have been growing less and less in all classes i say seems because there are really no means of ascertaining the fact and it may be that the editors are mistaken in making their periodicals twothirds popular science politics economics and the timely topics which i will call contemporanics but however that may be their efforts in this direction have narrowed the field of literary industry and darkened the hope of literary prosperity kindled by the unexampled prosperity of their periodicals they pay very well indeed for literature they pay from five or six dollars a thousand words for the work of the unknown writer to a hundred and fifty dollars a thousand words for that of the most famous or the most popular if there is a difference between fame and popularity but they do not altogether want enough literature to justify the best business talent in devoting itself to belleslettres to fiction or poetry or humorous sketches of travel or light essays business talent can do far better in dry goods groceries drugs stocks real estate railroads and the like i do not think there is any danger of a ruinous competition from it in the field which though narrow seems so rich to us poor fellows whose business talent is small at the best  the most of the material contributed to the magazines is the subject of agreement between the editor and the author it is either suggested by the author or is the fruit of some suggestion from the editor in any case the price is stipulated beforehand and it is no longer the custom for a wellknown contributor to leave the payment to the justice or the generosity of the publisher that was never a fair thing to either nor ever a wise thing usually the price is so much a thousand words a truly odious method of computing literary value and one well calculated to make the author feel keenly the hatefulness of selling his art at all it is as if a painter sold his picture at so much a square inch or a sculptor bargained away a group of statuary by the pound but it is a custom that you cannot always successfully quarrel with and most writers gladly consent to it if only the price a thousand words is large enough the sale to the editor means the sale of the serial rights only but if the publisher of the magazine is also a publisher of books the republication of the material is supposed to be his right unless there is an understanding to the contrary the terms for this are another affair formerly something more could be got for the author by the simultaneous appearance of his work in an english magazine but now the great american magazines which pay far higher prices than any others in the world have a circulation in england so much exceeding that of any english periodical that the simultaneous publication can no longer be arranged for from this side though i believe it is still done here from the other side   vi  i think this is the case of authorship as it now stands with regard to the magazines i am not sure that the case is in every way improved for young authors the magazines all maintain a staff for the careful examination of manuscripts but as most of the material they print has been engaged the number of volunteer contributions that they can use is very small one of the greatest of them i know does not use fifty in the course of a year the new writer then must be very good to be accepted and when accepted he may wait long before he is printed the pressure is so great in these avenues to the public favor that one two three years are no uncommon periods of delay if the young writer has not the patience for this or has a soul above cooling his heels in the courts of fame or must do his best to earn something at once the book is his immediate hope how slight a hope the book is i have tried to hint already but if a book is vulgar enough in sentiment and crude enough in taste and flashy enough in incident or better or worse still if it is a bit hot in the mouth and promises impropriety if not indecency there is a very fair chance of its success i do not mean success with a selfrespecting publisher but with the public which does not personally put its name to it and is not openly smirched by it i will not talk of that kind of book however but of the book which the young author has written out of an unspoiled heart and an untainted mind such as most young men and women write and i will suppose that it has found a publisher it is human nature as competition has deformed human nature for the publisher to wish the author to take all the risks and he possibly proposes that the author shall publish it at his own expense and let him have a percentage of the retail price for managing it if not that he proposes that the author shall pay for the stereotype plates and take fifteen per cent of the price of the book or if this will not go if the author cannot rather than will not do it he is commonly only too glad to do any thing he can then the publisher offers him ten per cent of the retail price after the first thousand copies have been sold but if he fully believes in the book he will give ten per cent from the first copy sold and pay all the costs of publication himself the book is to be retailed for a dollar and a half and the publisher is not displeased with a new book that sells fifteen hundred copies whether the author has as much reason to be pleased is a question but if the book does not sell more he has only himself to blame and had better pocket in silence the two hundred and twentyfive dollars he gets for it and bless his publisher and try to find work somewhere at five dollars a week the publisher has not made any more if quite as much as the author and until a book has sold two thousand copies the division is fair enough after that the heavier expenses of manufacturing have been defrayed and the book goes on advertising itself there is merely the cost of paper printing binding and marketing to be met and the arrangement becomes fairer and fairer for the publisher the author has no right to complain of this in the case of his first book which he is only too grateful to get accepted at all if it succeeds he has himself to blame for making the same arrangement for his second or third it is his fault or else it is his necessity which is practically the same thing it will be business for the publisher to take advantage of his necessity quite the same as if it were his fault but i do not say that he will always do so i believe he will very often not do so  at one time there seemed a probability of the enlargement of the authors gains by subscription publication and one very wellknown american author prospered fabulously in that way the percentage offered by the subscription houses was only about half as much as that paid by the trade but the sales were so much greater that the author could very well afford to take it where the bookdealer sold ten the bookagent sold a hundred or at least he did so in the case of mark twains books and we all thought it reasonable he could do so with ours such of us as made experiment of him however found the facts illogical no book of literary quality was made to go by subscription except mr clemenss books and i think these went because the subscription public never knew what good literature they were this sort of readers or buyers were so used to getting something worthless for their money that they would not spend it for artistic fiction or indeed for any fiction at all except mr clemenss which they probably supposed bad some good books of travel had a measurable success through the bookagents but not at all the success that had been hoped for and i believe now the subscription trade again publishes only compilations or such works as owe more to the skill of the editor than the art of the writer mr clemens himself no longer offers his books to the public in that way  it is not common i think in this country to publish on the half profits system but it is very common in england where owing probably to the moisture in the air which lends a fairy outline to every prospect it seems to be peculiarly alluring one of my own early books was published there on these terms which i accepted with the insensate joy of the young author in getting any terms from a publisher the book sold sold every copy of the small first edition and in due time the publishers statement came i did not think my half of the profits was very great but it seemed a fair division after every imaginable cost had been charged up against my poor book and that frail venture had been made to pay the expenses of composition corrections paper printing binding advertising and editorial copies the wonder ought to have been that there was anything at all coming to me but i was young and greedy then and i really thought there ought to have been more i was disappointed but i made the best of it of course and took the account to the junior partner of the house which employed me and said that i should like to draw on him for the sum due me from the london publishers he said certainly but after a glance at the account he smiled and said he supposed i knew how much the sum was i answered yes it was eleven pounds nine shillings was not it but i owned at the same time that i never was good at figures and that i found english money peculiarly baffling he laughed now and said it was eleven shillings and ninepence in fact after all those charges for composition corrections paper printing binding advertising and editorial copies there was a most ingenious and wholly surprising charge of ten per cent commission on sales which reduced my half from pounds to shillings and handsomely increased the publishers half in proportion i do not now dispute the justice of the charge it was not the fault of the half profits system it was the fault of the glad young author who did not distinctly inform himself of its mysterious nature in agreeing to it and had only to reproach himself if he was finally disappointed  but there is always something disappointing in the accounts of publishers which i fancy is because authors are strangely constituted rather than because publishers are so i will confess that i have such inordinate expectations of the sale of my books which i hope i think modestly of that the sales reported to me never seem great enough the copyright due me no matter how handsome it is appears deplorably mean and i feel impoverished for several days after i get it but then i ought to add that my balance in the bank is always much less than i have supposed it to be and my own checks when they come back to me have the air of having been in a conspiracy to betray me  no we literary men must learn no matter how we boast ourselves in business that the distress we feel from our publishers accounts is simply idiopathic and i for one wish to bear my witness to the constant good faith and uprightness of publishers it is supposed that because they have the affair altogether in their hands they are apt to take advantage in it but this does not follow and as a matter of fact they have the affair no more in their own hands than any other business man you have an open account with there is nothing to prevent you from looking at their books except your own innermost belief and fear that their books are correct and that your literature has brought you so little because it has sold so little  the author is not to blame for his superficial delusion to the contrary especially if he has written a book that has set every one talking because it is of a vital interest it may be of a vital interest without being at all the kind of book people want to buy it may be the kind of book that they are content to know at second hand there are such fatal books but hearing so much and reading so much about it the author cannot help hoping that it has sold much more than the publisher says the publisher is undoubtedly honest however and the author had better put away the comforting question of his integrity  the english writers seem largely to suspect their publishers but i believe that american authors when not flown with flattering reviews as largely trust theirs of course there are rogues in every walk of life i will not say that i ever personally met them in the flowery paths of literature but i have heard of other people meeting them there just as i have heard of people seeing ghosts and i have to believe in both the rogues and the ghosts without the witness of my own senses i suppose upon such grounds mainly that there are wicked publishers but in the case of our books that do not sell i am afraid that it is the graceless and inappreciative public which is far more to blame than the wickedest of the publishers it is true that publishers will drive a hard bargain when they can or when they must but there is nothing to hinder an author from driving a hard bargain too when he can or when he must and it is to be said of the publisher that he is always more willing to abide by the bargain when it is made than the author is perhaps because he has the best of it but he has not always the best of it i have known publishers too generous to take advantage of the innocence of authors and i fancy that if publishers had to do with any race less diffident than authors they would have won a repute for unselfishness that they do now now enjoy it is certain that in the long period when we flew the black flag of piracy there were many among our corsairs on the high seas of literature who paid a fair price for the stranger craft they seized still oftener they removed the cargo and released their capture with several weeks provision and although there was undoubtedly a good deal of actual throatcutting and scuttling still i feel sure that there was less of it than there would have been in any other line of business released to the unrestricted plunder of the neighbor there was for a long time even a comity among these amiable buccaneers who agreed not to interfere with each other and so were enabled to pay over to their victims some portion of the profit from their stolen goods of all business men publishers are probably the most faithful and honorable and are only surpassed in virtue when men of letters turn business men   vii  publishers have their little theories their little superstitions and their blind faith in the great god chance which we all worship these things lead them into temptation and adversity but they seem to do fairly well as business men even in their own behalf they do not make above the usual ninetyfive per cent of failures and more publishers than authors get rich  some theories or superstitions publishers and authors share together one of these is that it is best to keep your books all in the hands of one publisher if you can because then he can give them more attention and sell more of them but my own experience is that when my books were in the hands of three publishers they sold quite as well as when one had them and a fellowauthor whom i approached in question of this venerable belief laughed at it this bold heretic held that it was best to give each new book to a new publisher for then the fresh man put all his energies into pushing it but if you had them all together the publisher rested in a vain security that one book would sell another and that the fresh venture would revive the public interest in the stale ones i never knew this to happen and i must class it with the superstitions of the trade it may be so in other and more constant countries but in our fickle republic each last book has to fight its own way to public favor much as if it had no sort of literary lineage of course this is stating it rather largely and the truth will be found inside rather than outside of my statement but there is at least truth enough in it to give the young author pause while one is preparing to sell his basket of glass he may as well ask himself whether it is better to part with all to one dealer or not and if he kicks it over in spurning the imaginary customer who asks the favor of taking the entire stock that will be his fault and not the fault of the customer  however the most important question of all with the man of letters as a man of business is what kind of book will sell the best of itself because at the end of the ends a book sells itself or does not sell at all kissing after long ages of reasoning and a great deal of culture still goes by favor and though innumerable generations of horses have been led to the water not one horse has yet been made to drink with the best or the worst will in the world no publisher can force a book into acceptance advertising will not avail and reviewing is notoriously futile if the book does not strike the popular fancy or deal with some universal interest which need by no means be a profound or important one the drums and the cymbals shall be beaten in vain the book may be one of the best and wisest books in the world but if it has not this sort of appeal in it the readers of it and worse yet the purchasers will remain few though fit the secret of this like most other secrets of a rather ridiculous world is in the awful keeping of fate and we can only hope to surprise it by some lucky chance to plan a surprise of it to aim a book at the public favor is the most hopeless of all endeavors as it is one of the unworthiest and i can neither as a man of letters nor as a man of business counsel the young author to do it the best that you can do is to write the book that it gives you the most pleasure to write to put as much heart and soul as you have about you into it and then hope as hard as you can to reach the heart and soul of the great multitude of your fellowmen that and that alone is good business for a man of letters  the man of letters must make up his mind that in the united states the fate of a book is in the hands of the women it is the women with us who have the most leisure and they read the most books they are far better educated for the most part than our men and their tastes if not their minds are more cultivated our men read the newspapers but our women read the books the more refined among them read the magazines if they do not always know what is good they do know what pleases them and it is useless to quarrel with their decisions for there is no appeal from them to go from them to the men would be going from a higher to a lower court which would be honestly surprised and bewildered if the thing were possible as i say the author of light literature and often the author of solid literature must resign himself to obscurity unless the ladies choose to recognize him yet it would be impossible to forecast their favor for this kind or that who could prophesy it for another who guess it for himself we must strive blindly for it and hope somehow that our best will also be our prettiest but we must remember at the same time that it is not the ladies man who is the favorite of the ladies  there are of course a few a very few of our greatest authors who have striven forward to the first place in our valhalla without the help of the largest readingclass among us but i should say that these were chiefly the humorists for whom women are said nowhere to have any warm liking and who have generally with us come up through the newspapers and have never lost the favor of the newspaper readers they have become literary men as it were without the newspaper readers knowing it but those who have approached literature from another direction have won fame in it chiefly by grace of the women who first read them and then made their husbands and fathers read them perhaps then and as a matter of business it would be well for a serious author when he finds that he is not pleasing the women and probably never will please them to turn humorous author and aim at the countenance of the men except as a humorist he certainly never will get it for your american when he is not making money or trying to do it is making a joke or trying to do it   viii  i hope that i have not been hinting that the author who approaches literature through journalism is not as fine and high a literary man as the author who comes directly to it or through some other avenue i have not the least notion of condemning myself by any such judgment but i think it is pretty certain that fewer and fewer authors are turning from journalism to literature though the entente cordiale between the two professions seems as great as ever i fancy though i may be as mistaken in this as i am in a good many other things that most journalists would have been literary men if they could at the beginning and that the kindness they almost always show to young authors is an effect of the selfpity they feel for their own thwarted wish to be authors when an author is once warm in the saddle and is riding his winged horse to glory the case is different they have then often no sentiment about him he is no longer the image of their own young aspiration and they would willingly see pegasus buck under him or have him otherwise brought to grief and shame they are apt to gird at him for his unhallowed gains and they would be quite right in this if they proposed any way for him to live without them as i have allowed at the outset the gains are unhallowed apparently it is unseemly for two or three authors to be making half as much by their pens as popular ministers often receive in salary the public is used to the pecuniary prosperity of some of the clergy and at least sees nothing droll in it but the paragrapher can always get a smile out of his readers at the gross disparity between the ten thousand dollars jones gets for his novel and the five pounds milton got for his epic i have always thought milton was paid too little but i will own that he ought not to have been paid at all if it comes to that again i say that no man ought to live by any art it is a shame to the art if not to the artist but as yet there is no means of the artists living otherwise and continuing an artist  the literary man has certainly no complaint to make of the newspaper man generally speaking i have often thought with amazement of the kindness shown by the press to our whole unworthy craft and of the help so lavishly and freely given to rising and even risen authors to put it coarsely brutally i do not suppose that any other business receives so much gratuitous advertising except the theatre it is enormous the space given in the newspapers to literary notes literary announcements reviews interviews personal paragraphs biographies and all the rest not to mention the vigorous and incisive attacks made from time to time upon different authors for their opinions of romanticism realism capitalism socialism catholicism and sandemanianism i have sometimes doubted whether the public cared for so much of it all as the editors gave them but i have always said this under my breath and i have thankfully taken my share of the common bounty a curious fact however is that this vast newspaper publicity seems to have very little to do with an authors popularity though ever so much with his notoriety some of those strange subterranean fellows who never come to the surface in the newspapers except for a contemptuous paragraph at long intervals outsell the famousest of the celebrities and secretly have their horses and yachts and country seats while immodest merit is left to get about on foot and look up summerboard at the cheaper hotels that is probably right or it would not happen it seems to be in the general scheme like millionairism and pauperism but it becomes a question then whether the newspapers with all their friendship for literature and their actual generosity to literary men can really help one much to fortune however much they help one to fame such a question is almost too dreadful and though i have asked it i will not attempt to answer it i would much rather consider the question whether if the newspapers can make an author they can also unmake him and i feel pretty safe in saying that i do not think they can the afreet once out of the bottle can never be coaxed back or cudgelled back and the author whom the newspapers have made cannot be unmade by the newspapers perhaps he could if they would let him alone but the art of letting alone the creature of your favor when he has forfeited your favor is yet in its infancy with the newspapers they consign him to oblivion with a rumor that fills the land and they keep visiting him there with an uproar which attracts more and more notice to him an author who has long enjoyed their favor suddenly and rather mysteriously loses it through his opinions on certain matters of literary taste say for the space of five or six years he is denounced with a unanimity and an incisive vigor that ought to convince him there is something wrong if he thinks it is his censors he clings to his opinions with an abiding constancy while ridicule obloquy caricature burlesque critical refutation and personal detraction follow unsparingly upon every expression for instance of his belief that romantic fiction is the highest form of fiction and that the base sordid photographic commonplace school of tolstoy tourgunief zola hardy and james is unworthy a moments comparison with the school of rider haggard all this ought certainly to unmake the author in question but this is not really the effect slowly but surely the clamor dies away and the author without relinquishing one of his wicked opinions or in any wise showing himself repentant remains apparently whole and he even returns in a measure to the old kindnessnot indeed to the earlier day of perfectly smooth things but certainly to as much of it as he merits  i would not have the young author from this imaginary case believe that it is well either to court or to defy the good opinion of the press in fact it will not only be better taste but it will be better business for him to keep it altogether out of his mind there is only one whom he can safely try to please and that is himself if he does this he will very probably please other people but if he does not please himself he may be sure that he will not please them the book which he has not enjoyed writing no one will enjoy reading still i would not have him attach too little consequence to the influence of the press i should say let him take the celebrity it gives him gratefully but not too seriously let him reflect that he is often the necessity rather than the ideal of the paragrapher and that the notoriety the journalists bestow upon him is not the measure of their acquaintance with his work far less his meaning they are good fellows those hardpushed poor fellows of the press but the very conditions of their censure friendly or unfriendly forbid it thoroughness and it must often have more zeal than knowledge in it   ix  there are some sorts of light literature once greatly in demand but now apparently no longer desired by magazine editors who ought to know what their readers desire among these is the travel sketch to me a very agreeable kind and really to be regretted in its decline there are some reasons for its decline besides a change of taste in readers and a possible surfeit travel itself has become so universal that everybody in a manner has been everywhere and the foreign scene has no longer the charm of strangeness we do not think the old world either so romantic or so ridiculous as we used and perhaps from an instinctive perception of this altered mood writers no longer appeal to our sentiment or our humor with sketches of outlandish people and places of course this can hold true only in a general way the thing is still done but not nearly so much done as formerly when one thinks of the long line of american writers who have greatly pleased in this sort and who even got their first fame in it one must grieve to see it obsolescent irving curtis bayard taylor herman melville ross browne warner ik marvell longfellow lowell story mr james mr aldrich mr hay mrs hunt mr c w stoddard mark twain and many others whose names will not come to me at the moment have in their several ways richly contributed to our pleasure in it but i cannot now fancy a young author finding favor with an editor in a sketch of travel or a study of foreign manners and customs his work would have to be of the most signal importance and brilliancy to overcome the editors feeling that the thing had been done already and i believe that a publisher if offered a book of such things would look at it askance and plead the wellknown quiet of the trade still i may be mistaken  i am rather more confident about the decline of another literary species namely the light essay we have essays enough and to spare of certain soberer and severer sorts such as grapple with problems and deal with conditions but the kind that i mean the slightly humorous gentle refined and humane kind seems no longer to abound as it once did i do not know whether the editor discourages them knowing his readers frame or whether they do not offer themselves but i seldom find them in the magazines i certainly do not believe that if any one were now to write essays such as warners backlog studies an editor would refuse them and perhaps nobody really writes them nobody seems to write the sort that colonel higginson formerly contributed to the periodicals or such as emerson wrote without a great name behind it i am afraid that a volume of essays would find few buyers even after the essays had made a public in the magazines there are of course instances to the contrary but they are not so many or so striking as to make me think that the essay could be offered as a good opening for business talent  i suspect that good poetry by wellknown hands was never better paid in the magazines than it is now i must say too that i think the quality of the minor poetry of our day is better than that of twentyfive or thirty years ago i could name half a score of young poets whose work from time to time gives me great pleasure by the reality of its feeling and the delicate perfection of its art but i will not name them for fear of passing over half a score of others equally meritorious we have certainly no reason to be discouraged whatever reason the poets themselves have to be so and i do not think that even in the short story our younger writers are doing better work than they are doing in the slighter forms of verse yet the notion of inviting business talent into this field would be as preposterous as that of asking it to devote itself to the essay what book of verse by a recent poet if we except some such peculiarly gifted poet as mr whitcomb riley has paid its expenses not to speak of any profit to the author of course it would be rather more offensive and ridiculous that it should do so than that any other form of literary art should do so and yet there is no more provision in our economic system for the support of the poet apart from his poems than there is for the support of the novelist apart from his novel one could not make any more money by writing poetry than by writing history but it is a curious fact that while the historians have usually been rich men and able to afford the luxury of writing history the poets have usually been poor men with no pecuniary justification in their devotion to a calling which is so seldom an election  to be sure it can be said for them that it costs far less to set up poet than to set up historian there is no outlay for copying documents or visiting libraries or buying books in fact except as historian the man of letters in whatever walk has not only none of the expenses of other men of business but none of the expenses of other artists he has no such outlay to make for materials or models or studio rent as the painter or the sculptor has and his income such as it is is immediate if he strikes the fancy of the editor with the first thing he offers as he very well may it is as well with him as with other men after long years of apprenticeship although he will always be the better for an apprenticeship and the longer apprenticeship the better he may practically need none at all such are the strange conditions of his acceptance with the public that he may please better without it than with it an authors first book is too often not only his luckiest but really his best it has a brightness that dies out under the school he puts himself to but a painter or a sculptor is only the gainer by all the school he can give himself   x  in view of this fact it becomes again very hard to establish the authors status in the business world and at moments i have grave question whether he belongs there at all except as a novelist there is of course no outlay for him in this sort any more than in any other sort of literature but it at least supposes and exacts some measure of preparation a young writer may produce a brilliant and very perfect romance just as he may produce a brilliant and very perfect poem but in the field of realistic fiction or in what we used to call the novel of manners a writer can only produce an inferior book at the outset for this work he needs experience and observation not so much of others as of himself for ultimately his characters will all come out of himself and he will need to know motive and character with such thoroughness and accuracy as he can acquire only through his own heart a man remains in a measure strange to himself as long as he lives and the very sources of novelty in his work will be within himself he can continue to give it freshness in no other way than by knowing himself better and better but a young writer and an untrained writer has not yet begun to be acquainted even with the lives of other men the world around him remains a secret as well as the world within him and both unfold themselves simultaneously to that experience of joy and sorrow that can come only with the lapse of time until he is well on towards forty he will hardly have assimilated the materials of a great novel although he may have amassed them the novelist then is a man of letters who is like a man of business in the necessity of preparation for his calling though he does not pay storerent and may carry all his affairs under his hat as the phrase is he alone among men of letters may look forward to that sort of continuous prosperity which follows from capacity and diligence in other vocations for storytelling is now a fairly recognized trade and the storyteller has a moneystanding in the economic world it is not a very high standing i think and i have expressed the belief that it does not bring him the respect felt for men in other lines of business still our people cannot deny some consideration to a man who gets a hundred dollars a thousand words or whose book sells five hundred thousand copies or less that is a fact appreciable to business and the man of letters in the line of fiction may reasonably feel that his place in our civilization though he may owe it to the women who form the great mass of his readers has something of the character of a vested interest in the eyes of men there is indeed as yet no conspiracy law which will avenge the attempt to injure him in his business a critic or a dark conjuration of critics may damage him at will and to the extent of their power and he has no recourse but to write better books or worse the law will do nothing for him and a boycott of his books might be preached with immunity by any class of men not liking his opinions on the question of industrial slavery or antipaedobaptism still the market for his wares is steadier than the market for any other kind of literary wares and the prices are better the historian who is a kind of inferior realist has something like the same steadiness in the market but the prices he can command are much lower and the two branches of the novelists trade are not to be compared in a business way as for the essayist the poet the traveller the popular scientist they are nowhere in the competition for the favor of readers the reviewer indeed has a pretty steady call for his work but i fancy the reviewers who get a hundred dollars a thousand words could all stand upon the point of a needle without crowding one another i should rather like to see them doing it another gratifying fact of the situation is that the best writers of fiction who are most in demand with the magazines probably get nearly as much money for their work as the inferior novelists who outsell them by tens of thousands and who make their appeal to the innumerable multitude of the less educated and less cultivated buyers of fiction in book form i think they earn their money but if i did not think all of the higher class of novelists earned so much money as they get i should not be so invidious as to single out for reproach those who did not  the difficulty about payment as i have hinted is that literature has no objective value really but only a subjective value if i may so express it a poem an essay a novel even a paper on political economy may be worth gold untold to one reader and worth nothing whatever to another it may be precious to one mood of the reader and worthless to another mood of the same reader how then is it to be priced and how is it to be fairly marketed all people must be fed and all people must be clothed and all people must be housed and so meat raiment and shelter are things of positive and obvious necessity which may fitly have a market price put upon them but there is no such positive and obvious necessity i am sorry to say for fiction or not for the higher sort of fiction the sort of fiction which corresponds in literature to the circus and the variety theatre in the showbusiness seems essential to the spiritual health of the masses but the most cultivated of the classes can get on from time to time without an artistic novel this is a great pity and i should bevery willing that readers might feel something like the pangs of hunger and cold when deprived of their finer fiction but apparently they never do their dumb and passive need is apt only to manifest itself negatively or in the form of weariness of this author or that the publisher of books can ascertain the fact through the declining sales of a writer but the editor of a magazine who is the best customer of the best writers must feel the market with a much more delicate touch sometimes it may be years before he can satisfy himself that his readers are sick of smith and are pining for jones even then he cannot know how long their mood will last and he is by no means safe in cutting down smiths price and putting up joness with the best will in the world to pay justly he cannot smith who has been boring his readers to death for a year may write tomorrow a thing that will please them so much that he will at once be a prime favorite again and jones whom they have been asking for may do something so uncharacteristic and alien that it will be a flat failure in the magazine the only thing that gives either writer positive value is his acceptance with the reader but the acceptance is from month to month wholly uncertain authors are largely matters of fashion like this style of bonnet or that shape of gown last spring the dresses were all made with lace berthas and smith was read this year the butterfly capes are worn and jones is the favorite author who shall forecast the fall and winter modes   xi  in this inquiry it is always the author rather than the publisher always the contributor rather than the editor whom i am concerned for i study the difficulties of the publisher and editor only because they involve the author and the contributor if they did not i will not say with how hard a heart i should turn from them my only pang now in scrutinizing the business conditions of literature is for the makers of literature not the purveyors of it  after all and in spite of my vaunting title is the man of letters ever am business man i suppose that strictly speaking he never is except in those rare instances where through need or choice he is the publisher as well as the author of his books then he puts something on the market and tries to sell it there and is a man of business but otherwise he is an artist merely and is allied to the great mass of wageworkers who are paid for the labor they have put into the thing done or the thing made who live by doing or making a thing and not by marketing a thing after some other man has done it or made it the quality of the thing has nothing to do with the economic nature of the case the author is in the last analysis merely a workingman and is under the rule that governs the workingmans life if he is sick or sad and cannot work if he is lazy or tipsy and will not then he earns nothing he cannot delegate his business to a clerk or a manager it will not go on while he is sleeping the wage he can command depends strictly upon his skill and diligence  i myself am neither sorry nor ashamed for this i am glad and proud to be of those who eat their bread in the sweat of their own brows and not the sweat of other mens brows i think my bread is the sweeter for it in the mean time i have no blame for business men they are no more of the condition of things than we workingmen are they did no more to cause it or create it but i would rather be in my place than in theirs and i wish that i could make all my fellowartists realize that economically they are the same as mechanics farmers daylaborers it ought to be our glory that we produce something that we bring into the world something that was not choately there before that at least we fashion or shape something anew and we ought to feel the tie that binds us to all the toilers of the shop and field not as a galling chain but as a mystic bond also uniting us to him who works hitherto and evermore i know very well that to the vast multitude of our fellowworkingmen we artists are the shadows of names or not even the shadows i like to look the facts in the face for though their lineaments are often terrible yet there is light nowhere else and i will not pretend in this light that the masses care any more for us than we care for the masses or so much nevertheless and most distinctly we are not of the classes except in our work they have no use for us if now and then they fancy qualifying their material splendor or their spiritual dulness with some artistic presence the attempt is always a failure that bruises and abashes in so far as the artist is a man of the world he is the less an artist and if he fashions himself upon fashion he deforms his art we all know that ghastly type it is more absurd even than the figure which is really of the world which was born and bred in it and conceives of nothing outside of it or above it in the social world as well as in the business world the artist is anomalous in the actual conditions and he is perhaps a little ridiculous  yet he has to be somewhere poor fellow and i think that he will do well to regard himself as in a transition state he is really of the masses but they do not know it and what is worse they do not know him as yet the common people do not hear him gladly or hear him at all he is apparently of the classes they know him and they listen to him he often amuses them very much but he is not quite at ease among them whether they know it or not he knows that he is not of their kind perhaps he will never be at home anywhere in the world as long as there are masses whom he ought to consort with and classes whom he cannot consort with the prospect is not brilliant for any artist now living but perhaps the artist of the future will see in the flesh the accomplishment of that human equality of which the instinct has been divinely planted in the human soul     pg editors bookmarks      artist has seasons as trees when he cannot blossom     book that they are content to know at second hand     business to take advantage of his necessity     competition has deformed human nature     conditions of hucksters imposed upon poets     fate of a book is in the hands of the women     god of chance leads them into temptation and adversity     historian who is a kind of inferior realist     i do not think any man ought to live by an art     if he has not enjoyed writing no one will enjoy reading     impropriety if not indecency promises literary success     literature beautiful only through the intelligence     literature has no objective value     literature is business as well as art     man is strange to himself as long as he lives     men read the newspapers but our women read the books     more zeal than knowledge in it     most journalists would have been literary men if they could     never quite sure of life unless i find literature in it     no man ought to live by any art     no rose blooms right along     our huckstering civilization     public whose taste is so crude that they cannot enjoy the best     results of art should be free to all     reviewers     reward is in the serial and not in the book19th
