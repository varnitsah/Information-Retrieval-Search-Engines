10719017	the evil shepherd   by e philips oppenheim      chapter i   francis ledsam alert wellsatisfied with himself and the world the echo of a little buzz of congratulations still in his ears paused on the steps of the modern temple of justice to light a cigarette before calling for a taxi to take him to his club visions of a whisky and sodahis throat was a little parchedand a rubber of easygoing bridge at his favourite table were already before his eyes a woman who had followed him from the court touched him on the shoulder  can i speak to you for a moment mr ledsam  the barrister frowned slightly as he swung around to confront his questioner it was such a familiar form of address  what do you want he asked a little curtly  a few minutes conversation with you was the calm reply the matter is important  the womans tone and manner notwithstanding her plain inconspicuous clothes commanded attention francis ledsam was a little puzzled small things meant much to him in life and he had been looking forward almost with the zest of a schoolboy to that hour of relaxation at his club he was impatient of even a brief delay a sentiment which he tried to express in his response  what do you want to speak to me about he repeated bluntly i shall be in my rooms in the temple tomorrow morning any time after eleven  it is necessary for me to speak to you now she insisted there is a teashop across the way please accompany me there  ledsam a little surprised at the coolness of her request subjected his accoster to a closer scrutiny as he did so his irritation diminished he shrugged his shoulders slightly  if you really have business with me he said i will give you a few minutes  they crossed the street together the woman selfpossessed negative wholly without the embarrassment of one performing an unusual action her companion felt the awakening of curiosity zealously though she had to all appearance endeavoured to conceal the fact she was without a doubt personable her voice and manner lacked nothing of refinement yet her attraction to francis ledsam who although a perfectly normal human being was no seeker after promiscuous adventures did not lie in these externals as a barrister whose success at the criminal bar had been phenomenal he had attained to a certain knowledge of human nature he was able at any rate to realise that this woman was no imposter he knew that she had vital things to say  they passed into the teashop and found an empty corner ledsam hung up his hat and gave an order the woman slowly began to remove her gloves when she pushed back her veil her visavis received almost a shock she was quite as goodlooking as he had imagined but she was far youngershe was indeed little more than a girl her eyes were of a deep shade of hazel brown her eyebrows were delicately marked her features and poise admirable yet her skin was entirely colourless she was as pale as one whose eyes have been closed in death her lips although in no way highly coloured were like streaks of scarlet blossom upon a marble image the contrast between her appearance and that of her companion was curiously marked francis ledsam conformed in no way to the accepted physical type of his profession he was over six feet in height broadshouldered and powerfully made his features were cast in a large mould he was of fair almost sandy complexion even his mouth was more humourous than incisive his eyes alone grey and exceedingly magnetic suggested the gifts which without a doubt lay behind his massive forehead  i am anxious to avoid any possible mistake she began your name is francis ledsam  it is he admitted  you are the very successful criminal barrister she continued who has just been paid an extravagant fee to defend oliver hilditch  i might take exception to the term extravagant ledsam observed drily otherwise your information appears to be singularly correct i do not know whether you have heard the verdict if not you may be interested to know that i succeeded in obtaining the mans acquittal  i know that you did the woman replied i was in the court when the verdict was brought in it has since occurred to me that i should like you to understand exactly what you have done the responsibility you have incurred  ledsam raised his eyebrows  responsibility he repeated what i have done is simple enough i have earned a very large fee and won my case  you have secured the acquittal of oliver hilditch she persisted he is by this time a free man now i am going to speak to you of that responsibility i am going to tell you a little about the man who owes his freedom to your eloquence  it was exactly twenty minutes after their entrance into the teashop when the woman finished her monologue she began to draw on her gloves again before them were two untasted cups of tea and an untouched plate of bread and butter from a corner of the room the waitress was watching them curiously  good god francis ledsam exclaimed at last suddenly realising his whereabouts do you mean to affirm solemnly that what you have been telling me is the truth  the woman continued to button her gloves it is the truth she said  ledsam sat up and looked around him he was a little dazed he had almost the feeling of a man recovering from the influence of some anaesthetic before his eyes were still passing visions of terrible deeds of naked ugly passion of mans unscrupulous savagery during those few minutes he had been transported to new york and paris london and rome crimes had been spoken of which made the murder for which oliver hilditch had just been tried seem like a trifling indiscretion hard though his mentality sternly matteroffact as was his outlook he was still unable to fully believe in himself his surroundings or in this woman who had just dropped a veil over her ashen cheeks reason persisted in asserting itself  but if you knew all this he demanded why on earth didnt you come forward and give evidence  because she answered calmly as she rose to her feet my evidence would not have been admissible i am oliver hilditchs wife     chapter ii   francis ledsam arrived at his club the sheridan an hour later than he had anticipated he nodded to the veteran hallporter hung up his hat and stick and climbed the great staircase to the cardroom without any distinct recollection of performing any of these simple and reasonable actions in the cardroom he exchanged a few greetings with friends accepted without comment or without the slightest tinge of gratification a little chorus of chafing congratulations upon his latest triumph and left the room without any inclination to play although there was a vacant place at his favourite table from sheer purposelessness he wandered back again into the hall and here came his first gleam of returning sensation he came face to face with his most intimate friend andrew wilmore the latter who had just hung up his coat and hat greeted him with a growl of welcome  so youve brought it off again francis  touch and go the barrister remarked i managed to squeak home  wilmore laid his hand upon his friends shoulder and led the way towards two easychairs in the lounge  i tell you what it is old chap he confided youll be making yourself unpopular before long another criminal at large thanks to that glib tongue and subtle brain of yours the crooks of london will present you with a testimonial when youre made a judge  so you think that oliver hilditch was guilty then francis asked curiously  my dear fellow how do i know or care was the indifferent reply i shouldnt have thought that there had been any doubt about it you probably know anyway  thats just what i didnt when i got up to make my speech francis assured his friend emphatically the fellow was given an opportunity of making a clean breast of it of coursewensley his lawyer advised him to in factbut the story he told me was precisely the story he told at the inquest  they were established now in their easychairs and wilmore summoned a waiter  two large whiskies and sodas he ordered francis he went on studying his companion intently whats the matter with you you dont look as though your few days in the country last week had done you any good  francis glanced around as though to be sure that they were alone  i was all right when i came up andrew he muttered this case has upset me  upset you but why the dickens should it the other demanded in a puzzled tone it was quite an ordinary case in its way and you won it  i won it francis admitted  your defence was the most ingenious thing i ever heard  mostly suggested now i come to think of it the barrister remarked grimly by the prisoner himself  but why are you upset about it anyway wilmore persisted  francis rose to his feet shook himself and with his elbow resting upon the mantelpiece leaned down towards his friend he could not rid himself altogether of this sense of unreality he had the feeling that he had passed through one of the great crises of his life  ill tell you andrew youre about the only man in the world i could tell ive gone crazy  i thought you looked as though youd been seeing spooks wilmore murmured sympathetically  i have seen a spook francis rejoined with almost passionate seriousness a spook who lifted an invisible curtain with invisible fingers and pointed to such a drama of horrors as de quincey poe and sue combined could never have imagined oliver hilditch was guilty andrew he murdered the man jordanmurdered him in cold blood  im not surprised to hear that was the somewhat puzzled reply  he was guilty andrew not only of the murder of this man his partner but of innumerable other crimes and brutalities francis went on he is a fiend in human form if ever there was one and i have set him loose once more to prey upon society i am morally responsible for his next robbery his next murder the continued purgatory of those forced to associate with him  youre dotty francis his friend declared shortly  i told you i was crazy was the desperate reply so would you be if youd sat opposite that woman for halfanhour and heard her story  what woman wilmore demanded leaning forward in his chair and gazing at his friend with increasing uneasiness  a woman who met me outside the court and told me the story of oliver hilditchs life  a stranger  a complete stranger to me it transpired that she was his wife  wilmore lit a cigarette  believe her  there are times when one doesnt believe or disbelieve francis answered one knows  wilmore nodded  all the same youre crazy he declared even if you did save the fellow from the gallows you were only doing your job doing your duty to the best of poor ability you had no reason to believe him guilty  thats just as it happened francis pointed out i really didnt care at the time whether he was or not i had to proceed on the assumption that he was not of course but on the other hand i should have fought just as hard for him if i had known him to be guilty  and you wouldnt nowtomorrow say  never again  because of that womans story  because of the woman  there was a short silence then wilmore asked a very obvious question  what sort of a person was she  francis ledsam was several moments before he replied the question was one which he had been expecting one which he had already asked himself many times yet he was unprepared with any definite reply  i wish i could answer you andrew his friend confessed as a matter of fact i cant i can only speak of the impression she left upon me and you are about the only person breathing to whom i could speak of that  wilmore nodded sympathetically he knew that man of the world though francis ledsam appeared he was nevertheless a highly imaginative person something of an idealist as regards women unwilling as a rule to discuss them keeping them in a general way outside his daily life  go ahead old fellow he invited you know i understand  she left the impression upon me francis continued quietly of a woman who had ceased to live she was young she was beautiful she had all the giftsculture poise and breedingbut she had ceased to live we sat with a marble table between us and a few feet of oilcovered floor those few feet andrew were like an impassable gulf she spoke from the shores of another world i listened and answered spoke and listened again and when she told her story she went i cant shake off the effect she had upon me andrew i feel as though i had taken a step to the right or to the left over the edge of the world  andrew wilmore studied his friend thoughtfully  he was full of sympathy and understanding his one desire at that moment was not to make a mistake he decided to leave unasked the obvious question  i know he said simply are you dining anywhere  i thought of staying on here was the indifferent reply  we wont do anything of the sort wilmore insisted theres scarcely a soul in tonight and the place is too humpy for a man whos been seeing spooks get back to your rooms and change ill wait here  what about you  i have some clothes in my locker dont be long and bythebye which shall it bebohemia or mayfair ill telephone for a table londons so infernally full these days  francis hesitated  i really dont care he confessed now i think of it i shall be glad to get away from here though i dont want any more congratulations on saving oliver hilditchs life lets go where we are least likely to meet any one we know  respectability and a starched shirtfront then wilmore decided well go to claridges     chapter iii   the two men occupied a table set against the wall not far from the entrance to the restaurant and throughout the progress of the earlier part of their meal were able to watch the constant incoming stream of their fellowguests they were in their way an interesting contrast physically neither of them goodlooking according to ordinary standards but both with many pleasant characteristics andrew wilmore slight and dark with sallow cheeks and brown eyes looked very much what he wasa moderately successful journalist and writer of stories a keen golfer a bachelor who preferred a pipe to cigars and lived at richmond because he could not find a flat in london which he could afford large enough for his somewhat expansive habits francis ledsam was of a sturdier type with features perhaps better known to the world owing to the constant activities of the cartoonist his reputation during the last few years had carried him notwithstanding his comparative youthhe was only thirtyfive years of ageinto the very front ranks of his profession and his income was one of which men spoke with bated breath he came of a family of landed proprietors whose younger sons for generations had drifted always either to the bar or the law and his name was well known in the purlieus of lincolns inn before he himself had made it famous he was a persistent refuser of invitations and his acquaintances in the fashionable world were comparatively few yet every now and then he felt a mild interest in the people whom his companion assiduously pointed out to him  a fashionable restaurant francis is rather like your law courtsit levels people up the latter remarked louis the headwaiter is the judge and the position allotted in the room is the sentence i wonder who is going to have the little table next but one to us some favoured person evidently  francis glanced in the direction indicated without curiosity the table in question was laid for two and was distinguished by a wonderful cluster of red roses  why is it the novelist continued speculatively that whenever we take another mans wife out we think it necessary to order red roses  and why is it francis queried a little grimly that a dear fellow like you andrew believes it his duty to talk of trifles for his pals sake when all the time he is thinking of something else i know youre dying to talk about the hilditch case arent you well go ahead  im only interested in this last development wilmore confessed of course i read the newspaper reports to tell you the truth for a murder trial it seemed to me to rather lack colour  it was a very simple and straightforward case francis said slowly oliver hilditch is the principal partner in an american financial company which has recently opened offices in the west end he seems to have arrived in england about two years ago to have taken a house in hill street and to have spent a great deal of money a month or so ago his partner from new york arrived in london a man named jordan of whom nothing was known it has since transpired however that his journey to europe was undertaken because he was unable to obtain certain figures relating to the business from hilditch oliver hilditch met him at southampton travelled with him to london and found him a room at the savoy the next day the whole of the time seems to have been spent in the office and it is certain from the evidence of the clerk that some disagreement took place between the two men they dined together however apparently on good terms at the cafe royal and parted in regent street soon after ten at twelve oclock jordans body was picked up on the pavement in hill street within a few paces of heidrichs door he had been stabbed through the heart with some needlelike weapon and was quite dead  was there any vital cause of quarrel between them wilmore enquired  impossible to say francis replied the financial position of the company depends entirely upon the value of a large quantity of speculative bonds but as there was only one clerk employed it was impossible to get at any figures hilditch declared that jordan had only a small share in the business from which he had drawn a considerable income for years and that he had not the slightest cause for complaint  what were hilditchs movements that evening wilmore asked  not a soul seems to have seen him after he left regent street was the somewhat puzzled answer his own story was quite straightforward and has never been contradicted he let himself into his house with a latchkey after his return from the cafe royal drank a whisky and soda in the library and went to bed before halfpast eleven the whole affair  francis broke off abruptly in the middle of his sentence he sat with his eyes fixed upon the door silent and speechless  what in heavens name is the matter old fellow wilmore demanded gazing at his companion in blank amazement  the latter pulled himself together with an effort the sight of the two new arrivals talking to louis on the threshold of the restaurant seemed for the moment to have drawn every scrap of colour from his cheeks nevertheless his recovery was almost instantaneous  if you want to know any more he said calmly you had better go and ask him to tell you the whole story himself there he is  and the woman with him wilmore exclaimed under his breath  his wife     chapter iv   to reach their table the one concerning which francis and his friend had been speculating the new arrivals piloted by louis had to pass within a few feet of the two men the woman serene coldly beautiful dressed like a frenchwoman in unrelieved black with extraordinary attention to details passed them by with a careless glance and subsided into the chair which louis was holding her companion however as he recognised francis hesitated his expression of somewhat austere gloom was lightened a pleasant but tentative smile parted his lips he ventured upon a salutation half a nod half a more formal bow a salutation which francis instinctively returned andrew wilmore looked on with curiosity  so that is oliver hilditch he murmured  that is the man francis observed of whom last evening half the people in this restaurant were probably asking themselves whether or not he was guilty of murder tonight they will be wondering what he is going to order for dinner it is a strange world  strange indeed wilmore assented this afternoon he was in the dock with his fate in the balancethe condemned cell or a favoured table at claridges and your meeting one can imagine him gripping your hands with tears in his eyes his voice broken with emotion sobbing out his thanks and instead you exchange polite bows i would not have missed this situation for anything  tradesman francis scoffed one can guess already at the plot of your next novel  he has courage wilmore declared he has also a very beautiful companion were you serious francis when you told me that that was his wife  she herself was my informant was the quiet reply  wilmore was puzzled  but she passed you just now without even a glance of recognition and i thought you told me at the club this afternoon that all your knowledge of his evil ways came from her besides she looks at least twenty years younger than he does  francis who had been watching his glass filled with champagne raised it to his lips and drank its contents steadily to the last drop  i can only tell you what i know andrew he said as he set down the empty glass the woman who is with him now is the woman who spoke to me outside the old bailey this afternoon we went to a teashop together she told me the story of his career i have never listened to so horrible a recital in my life  and yet they are here together dining teteatete on a night when it must have needed more than ordinary courage for either of them to have been seen in public at all wilmore pointed out  it is as astounding to me as it is to you francis confessed from the way she spoke i should never have dreamed that they were living together  and from his appearance wilmore remarked as he called the waiter to bring some cigarettes i should never have imagined that he was anything else save a highprincipled wellborn straightforward sort of chap i never saw a less criminal type of face  they each in turn glanced at the subject of their discussion oliver hilditchs goodlooks had been the subject of many press comments during the last few days they were certainly undeniable his face was a little lined but his hair was thick and brown his features were regular his forehead high and thoughtful his mouth a trifle thin but straight and shapely francis gazed at him like a man entranced the hours seemed to have slipped away he was back in the teashop listening to the woman who spoke of terrible things he felt again his shivering abhorrence of her cold clearly narrated story again he shrank from the horrors from which with merciless fingers she had stripped the coverings he seemed to see once more the agony in her white face to hear the eternal pain aching and throbbing in her monotonous tone he rose suddenly to his feet  andrew he begged tell the fellow to bring the bill outside well have our coffee and liqueurs there  wilmore acquiesced willingly enough but even as they turned towards the door francis realised what was in store for him oliver hilditch had risen to his feet with a courteous little gesture he intercepted the passerby francis found himself standing side by side with the man for whose life he had pleaded that afternoon within a few feet of the woman whose terrible story seemed to have poisoned the very atmosphere he breathed to have shown him a new horror in life to have temporarily at any rate undermined every joy and ambition he possessed  mr ledsam hilditch said speaking with quiet dignity i hope that you will forgive the liberty i take in speaking to you here i looked for you the moment i was free this afternoon but found that you had left the court i owe you my good name probably my life thanks are poor things but they must be spoken  you owe me nothing at all francis replied in a tone which even he found harsh i had a brief before me and a cause to plead it was a chapter out of my daily work  that work can be well done or ill the other reminded him gently in your case my presence here proves how well it was done i wish to present you to my wife who shares my gratitude  francis bowed to the woman who now at her husbands words raised her eyes for the first time he saw her smile it seemed to him that the effort made her less beautiful  your pleading was very wonderful mr ledsam she said a very subtle note of mockery faintly apparent in her tone we poor mortals find it difficult to understand that with you all that show of passionate earnestness is merelywhat did you call ita chapter in your days work it is a great gift to be able to argue from the brain and plead as though from the heart  we will not detain mr ledsam oliver hilditch interposed a little hastily he perhaps does not care to be addressed in public by a client who still carries with him the atmosphere of the prison my wife and i wondered mr ledsam whether you would be good enough to dine with us one night i think i could interest you by telling you more about my case than you know at present and it would give us a further opportunity and a more seemly one for expressing our gratitude  francis had recovered himself by this time he was after all a man of parts and though he still had the feeling that he had been through one of the most momentous days of his life his savoir faire was making its inevitable reappearance he knew very well that the idea of that dinner would be horrible to him he also knew that he would willingly cancel every engagement he had rather than miss it  you are very kind he murmured  are we fortunate enough to find you disengaged hilditch suggested tomorrow evening  i am quite free was the ready response  that suits you margaret hilditch asked turning courteously to his wife  for a single moment her eyes were fixed upon those of her prospective guest he read their message which pleaded for his refusal and he denied it  tomorrow evening will suit me as well as any other she acquiesced after a brief pause  at eight oclock thennumber 10 b hill street hilditch concluded  francis bowed and turned away with a murmured word of polite assent outside he found wilmore deep in the discussion of the merits of various old brandies with an interested maitre dhotel  any choice francis his host enquired  none whatever was the prompt reply only for gods sake give me a double one quickly  the two men were on the point of departure when oliver hilditch and his wife left the restaurant as though conscious that they had become the subject of discussion as indeed was the case thanks to the busy whispering of the various waiters they passed without lingering through the lounge into the entrance hall where francis and andrew wilmore were already waiting for a taxicab almost as they appeared a new arrival was ushered through the main entrance followed by porters carrying luggage he brushed past francis so closely that the latter looked into his face half attracted and half repelled by the waxenlike complexion the piercing eyes and the dignified carriage of the man whose arrival seemed to be creating some stir in the hotel a reception clerk and a deputy manager had already hastened forward the newcomer waved them back for a moment bareheaded he had taken margaret hilditchs hands in his and raised them to his lips  i came as quickly as i could he said there was the usual delay of course at marseilles and the trains on were terrible so all has ended well  oliver hilditch standing by remained speechless it seemed for a moment as though his selfcontrol were subjected to a severe strain  i had the good fortune he interposed in a low tone to be wonderfully defended mr ledsam here  he glanced around francis with some idea of what was coming obeyed an imaginary summons from the headporter touched andrew wilmore upon the shoulder and hastened without a backward glance through the swingdoors wilmore turned up his coatcollar and looked doubtfully up at the rain  i say old chap he protested you dont really mean to walk  francis thrust his hand through his friends arm and wheeled him round into davies street  i dont care what the mischief we do andrew he confided but couldnt you see what was going to happen oliver hilditch was going to introduce me as his preserver to the man who had just arrived  are you afflicted with modesty all of a sudden wilmore grumbled  no remorse was the terse reply     chapter v   indecision had never been one of francis ledsams faults but four times during the following day he wrote out a carefully worded telegraphic message to mrs oliver hilditch 10 b hill street regretting his inability to dine that night and each time he destroyed it he carried the first message around richmond golf course with him intending to dispatch his caddy with it immediately on the conclusion of the round the fresh air however and the concentration required by the game seemed to dispel the nervous apprehensions with which he had anticipated his visit and over an aperitif in the club bar he tore the telegram into small pieces and found himself even able to derive a certain halffearful pleasure from the thought of meeting again the woman who together with her terrible story had never for one moment been out of his thoughts andrew wilmore who had observed his action spoke of it as they settled down to lunch  so you are going to keep your engagement tonight francis he observed  the latter nodded  after all why not he asked a little defiantly it ought to be interesting  well theres nothing of the sordid criminal at any rate about oliver hilditch wilmore declared neither if one comes to think of it does his wife appear to be the prototype of suffering virtue i wonder if you are wise to go francis  why not the man who had asked himself that question a dozen times already demanded  because wilmore replied coolly underneath that steely hardness of manner for which your profession is responsible you have a vein of sentiment of chivalrous sentiment i should say which some day or other is bound to get you into trouble the woman is beautiful enough to turn any ones head as a matter of fact i believe that you are more than half in love with her already  francis ledsam sat where the sunlight fell upon his strong forceful face shone too upon the table with its simple but pleasant appointments upon the tankard of beer by his side upon the plate of roast beef to which he was already doing ample justice he laughed with the easy confidence of a man awakened from some haunting nightmare relieved to find his feet once more firm upon the ground  i have been a fool to take the whole matter so seriously andrew he declared i expect to walk back to clarges street tonight disillusioned the man will probably present me with a gold pencilcase and the woman  well what about the woman wilmore asked after a brief pause  oh i dont know francis declared a little impatiently the woman is the mystery of course probably my brain was a little overexcited when i came out of court and what i imagined to be an epic was nothing more than a tissue of exaggerations from a disappointed wife im sure im doing the right thing to go there what about a fourball this afternoon andrew  the fourball match was played and won in normal fashion the two men returned to town together afterwards wilmore to the club and francis to his rooms in clarges street to prepare for dinner at a few minutes to eight he rang the bell of number 10 b hill street and found his host and hostess awaiting him in the small drawingroom into which he was ushered it seemed to him that the woman still colourless again marvellously gowned greeted him coldly his host however was almost too effusive there was no other guest but the prompt announcement of dinner dispelled what might have been a few moments of embarrassment after oliver hilditchs almost too cordial greeting the woman laid her fingers upon her guests coatsleeve the trio crossed the little hall almost in silence  dinner was served in a small white georgian diningroom with every appurtenance of almost sybaritic luxury the only light in the room was thrown upon the table by two purpleshaded electric lamps and the servants who waited seemed to pass backwards and forwards like shadows in some mysterious twilighteven the faces of the three diners themselves were out of the little pool of light until they leaned forward the dinner was chosen with taste and restraint the wines were not only costly but rare a watchful butler attended now and then by a trim parlourmaid superintended the service only once when she ordered a bowl of flowers removed from the table did their mistress address either of them conversation after the first few amenities speedily became almost a monologue one man talked whilst the others listened and the man who talked was oliver hilditch he possessed the rare gift of imparting colour and actuality in a few phrases to the strange places of which he spoke of bringing the very thrill of strange happenings into the shadowy room it seemed that there was scarcely a country of the world which he had not visited a country that is to say where men congregate for he admitted from the first that he was a city worshipper that the empty places possessed no charm for him  i am not even a sportsman he confessed once half apologetically in reply to a question from his guest i have passed down the great rivers of the world without a thought of salmon and i have driven through the forest lands and across the mountains behind a giant locomotive without a thought of the beasts which might be lurking there waiting to be killed my only desire has been to reach the next place where men and women were  irrespective of nationality francis queried  absolutely i have never minded much of what racei have the trick of tongues rather strangely developedbut i like the feeling of human beings around me i like the smell and sound and atmosphere of a great city then all my senses are awake but life becomes almost turgid in my veins during the dreary hours of passing from one place to another  do you rule out scenery as well as sport from amongst the joys of travel francis enquired  i am ashamed to make such a confession his host answered but i have never lingered for a single unnecessary moment to look at the most wonderful landscape in the world on the other hand i have lounged for hours in the narrowest streets of pekin in the markets of shanghai along broadway in new york on the boulevards in paris outside the auditorium in chicago these are the obvious places where humanity presses the thickest but i know of others some day we will talk of them  francis too although that evening through sheer lack of sympathy he refused to admit it shared to some extent hilditchs passionate interest in his fellowcreatures and notwithstanding the strange confusion of thought into which he had been thrown during the last twentyfour hours he felt something of the pungency of life the thrill of new and appealing surroundings as he sat in his highbacked chair sipping his wonderful wine eating almost mechanically what was set before him fascinated through all his being by his strange company  for three days he had cast occasional glances at this man seated in the criminal dock with a gaoler on either side of him his fine nervous features gaining an added distinction from the sordidness of his surroundings now in the garb of civilisation seated amidst luxury to which he was obviously accustomed with a becoming light upon his face and this strange fascinating flow of words proceeding always from his lips the man from every external point of view seemed amongst the chosen ones of the world the contrast was in itself amazing and then the woman francis looked at her but seldom and when he did it was with a curious sense of mental disturbance poignant but unanalysable  it was amazing to see her here opposite the man of whom she had told him that ghastly story mistress of his house to all appearance his consort apparently engrossed in his polished conversation yet with that subtle withholding of her real self which francis rather imagined than felt and which somehow seemed to imply her fierce resentment of her husbands reentry into the arena of life it was a situation so strange that francis becoming more and more subject to its influence was inclined to wonder whether he had not met with some accident on his way from the court and whether this was not one of the heated nightmares following unconsciousness  tell me he asked his host during one of the brief pauses in the conversation have you ever tried to analyse this interest of yours in human beings and crowded cities this hatred of solitude and empty spaces  oliver hilditch smiled thoughtfully and gazed at a salted almond which he was just balancing between the tips of his fingers  i think he said simply it is because i have no soul     chapter vi   the three diners lingered for only a short time over their dessert afterwards they passed together into a very delightful library on the other side of the round stonepaved hall hilditch excused himself for a moment  i have some cigars which i keep in my dressingroom he explained and which i am anxious for you to try there is an electric stove there and i can regulate the temperature  he departed closing the door behind him francis came a little further into the room his hostess who had subsided into an easychair and was holding a screen between her face and the fire motioned him to seat himself opposite he did so without words he felt curiously and ridiculously tonguetied he fell to studying the woman instead of attempting the banality of pointless speech from the smooth gloss of her burnished hair to the daintiness of her low black brocaded shoes she represented so far as her physical and outward self were concerned absolute perfection no ornament was amiss no line or curve of her figure other than perfectly graceful yet even the fires glow which she had seemed to dread brought no flush of colour to her cheeks her appearance of complete lifelessness remained it was as though some sort of crust had formed about her being a condition which her very physical perfection seemed to render the more incomprehensible  you are surprised to see me here living with my husband after what i told you yesterday afternoon she said calmly breaking at last the silence which had reigned between them  i am he admitted  it seems unnatural to you i suppose  entirely  you still believe all that i told you  i must  she looked at the door and raised her head a little as though either listening or adjudging the time before her husband would return then she glanced across at him once more  hatred she said does not always drive away sometimes it attracts sometimes the person who hates can scarcely bear the other out of his sight that is where hate and love are somewhat alike  the room was warm but francis was conscious of shivering she raised her finger warningly it seemed typical of the woman somehow that the message could not be conveyed by any glance or gesture  he is coming she whispered  oliver hilditch reappeared carrying cigars wrapped in gold foil which he had brought with him from cuba the tobacco of which was a revelation to his guest the two men smoked and sipped their coffee and brandy the woman sat with halfclosed eyes it was obvious that hilditch was still in the mood for speech  i will tell you mr ledsam he said why i am so happy to have you here this evening in the first place i desire to tender you once more my thanks for your very brilliant efforts on my behalf the very fact that i am able to offer you hospitality at all is without a doubt due to these  i only did what i was paid to do francis insisted a little harshly you must remember that these things come in the days work with us  his host nodded  naturally he murmured there was another reason too why i was anxious to meet you mr ledsam he continued you have gathered already that i am something of a crank i have a profound detestation of all sentimentality and affected morals it is a relief to me to come into contact with a man who is free from that bourgeois incubus to modern enterprisea conscience  is that your estimate of me francis asked  why not you practise your profession in the criminal courts do you not  that is wellknown was the brief reply  what measure of conscience can a man have oliver hilditch argued blandly who pleads for the innocent and guilty alike with the same simulated fervour confess now mr ledsamthere is no object in being hypocritical in this matterhave you not often pleaded for the guilty as though you believed them innocent  that has sometimes been my duty francis acknowledged  hilditch laughed scornfully  it is all part of the great hypocrisy of society he proclaimed you have an extra glass of champagne for dinner at night and are congratulated by your friends because you have helped some poor devil to cheat the law while all the time you know perfectly well and so do your highminded friends that your whole attitude during those two hours of eloquence has been a lie that is what first attracted me to you mr ledsam  i am sorry to hear it francis commented coldly the ethics of my profession  his host stopped him with a little wave of the hand  spare me that he begged while we are on the subject though i have a question to ask you my lawyer told me directly after he had briefed you that although it would make no real difference to your pleading it would be just as well for me to keep up my bluff of being innocent even in private conversation with you why was that  for the very obvious reason francis told him that we are not all such rogues and vagabonds as you seem to think there is more satisfaction to me at any rate in saving an innocent mans life than a guilty ones  hilditch laughed as though amused  come he threatened i am going to be illnatured you have shown signs of smugness a quality which i detest i am going to rob you of some part of your selfsatisfaction of course i killed jordan i killed him in the very chair in which you are now sitting  there was a moments intense silence the woman was still fanning herself lazily francis leaned forward in his place  i do not wish to hear this he exclaimed harshly  dont be foolish his host replied rising to his feet and strolling across the room you know the whole trouble of the prosecution they couldnt discover the weapon or anything like it with which the deed was done now ill show you something ingenious  francis followed the others movements with fascinated eyes the woman scarcely turned her head hilditch paused at the further end of the room where there were a couple of gun cases some fishing rods and a bag of golf clubs from the latter he extracted a very ordinarylooking putter and with it in his hands strolled back to them  do you play golf ledsam he asked what do you think of that  francis took the putter into his hand it was a very ordinary club which had apparently seen a good deal of service so much indeed that the leather wrapping at the top was commencing to unroll the makers name was on the back of the blade also the name of the professional from whom it had been purchased francis swung the implement mechanically with his wrists  there seems to be nothing extraordinary about the club he pronounced it is very much like a cleek i putt with myself  yet it contains a secret which would most certainly have hanged me oliver hilditch declared pleasantly see  he held the shaft firmly in one hand and bent the blade away from it in a moment or two it yielded and he commenced to unscrew it a little exclamation escaped from francis lips the woman looked on with tired eyes  the join in the steel hilditch pointed out is so fine as to be undistinguishable by the naked eye yet when the blade comes off like this you see that although the weight is absolutely adjusted the inside is hollow the dagger itself is encased in this cotton wool to avoid any rattling i put it away in rather a hurry the last time i used it and as you see i forgot to clean it  francis staggered back and gripped at the mantelpiece his eyes were filled with horror very slowly and with the air of one engaged upon some interesting task oliver hilditch had removed the bloodstained sheath of cotton wool from around the thin blade of a marvellouslooking stiletto on which was also a long stain of encrusted blood  there is a handle he went on which is perhaps the most ingenious thing of all you touch a spring here and behold  he pressed down two tiny supports which opened upon hinges about four inches from the top of the handle there was now a complete hilt  with this little weapon he explained the point is so sharpened and the steel so wonderful that it is not necessary to stab it has the perfection of a surgical instrument you have only to lean it against a certain point in a mans anatomy lunge ever so little and the whole thing is done come here mr ledsam and i will show you the exact spot  francis made no movement his eyes were fixed upon the weapon  if i had only known he muttered  my dear fellow if you had the other protested soothingly you know perfectly well that it would not have made the slightest difference perhaps that little break in your voice would not have come quite so naturally the little sweep of your arm towards me the man whom a moments thoughtlessness might sweep into eternity would have been a little stiffer but what matter you would still have done your best and you would probably still have succeeded you dont care about trifling with eternity eh very well i will find the place for you  hilditchs fingers strayed along his shirtfront until he found a certain spot then he leaned the dagger against it his forefinger and second finger pressed against the hilt his eyes were fixed upon his guests he seemed genuinely interested francis glancing away for a moment was suddenly conscious of a new horror the woman had leaned a little forward in her easychair until she had attained almost a crouching position her eyes seemed to be measuring the distance from where she sat to that quivering thread of steel  you see ledsam his host went on that point driven now at that angle would go clean through the vital part of my heart and it needs no force eitherjust the slow pressure of these two fingers what did you say margaret he enquired breaking off abruptly  the woman was seated upon the very edge of her chair her eyes rivetted upon the dagger there was no change in her face not a tremor in her tone  i said nothing she replied i did not speak at all i was just watching  hilditch turned back to his guest  these two fingers he repeated and a flick of the wristvery little more than would be necessary for a thirty yard putt right across the green  francis had recovered himself had found his bearings to a certain extent  i am sorry that you have told me this mr hilditch he said a little stiffly  why was the puzzled reply i thought you would be interested  i am interested to this extent francis declared i shall accept no more cases such as yours unless i am convinced of my clients innocence i look upon your confession to me as being in the worst possible taste and i regret very much my efforts on your behalf  the woman was listening intently hilditchs expression was one of cynical wonder francis rose to his feet and moved across to his hostess  mrs hilditch he said will you allow me to make my apologies your husband and i have arrived at an understandingor perhaps i should say a misunderstandingwhich renders the acceptance of any further hospitality on my part impossible  she held out the tips of her fingers  i had no idea she observed with gentle sarcasm that you barristers were such purists morally i thought you were rather proud of being the last hope of the criminal classes  madam francis replied i am not proud of having saved the life of a selfconfessed murderer even though that man may be your husband  hilditch was laughing softly to himself as he escorted his departing guest to the door  you have a quaint sense of humour francis remarked  forgive me oliver hilditch begged but your last few words rather appealed to me you must be a person of very scanty perceptions if you could spend the evening here and not understand that my death is the one thing in the world which would make my wife happy  francis walked home with these last words ringing in his ears they seemed with him even in that brief period of troubled sleep which came to him when he had regained his rooms and turned in they were there in the middle of the night when he was awakened shivering by the shrill summons of his telephone bell he stood quaking before the instrument in his pajamas it was the voice which by reason of some ghastly premonition he had dreaded to hearlevel composed emotionless  mr ledsam she enquired  i am francis ledsam he assented who wants me  it is margaret hilditch speaking she announced i felt that i must ring up and tell you of a very strange thing which happened after you left this evening  go on he begged hoarsely  after you left she went on my husband persisted in playing with that curious dagger he laid it against his heart and seated himself in the chair which mr jordan had occupied in the same attitude it was what he called a reconstruction while he was holding it there i think that he must have had a fit or it may have been remorse we shall never know he called out and i hurried across the room to him i tried to snatch the dagger awayi did so in factbut i must have been too late he had already applied that slight movement of the fingers which was necessary the doctor has just left he says that death must have been instantaneous  but this is horrible francis cried out into the well of darkness  a person is on the way from scotland yard the voice continued without change or tremor when he has satisfied himself i am going to bed he is here now goodnight  francis tried to speak again but his words beat against a wall of silence he sat upon the edge of the bed shivering in that moment of agony he seemed to hear again the echo of oliver hilditchs mocking words  my death is the one thing in the world which would make my wife happy     chapter vii   there was a good deal of speculation at the sheridan club of which he was a popular and much envied member as to the cause for the complete disappearance from their midst of francis ledsam since the culmination of the hilditch tragedy  sent back four topping briefs to my knowledge last week one of the legal luminaries of the place announced to a little group of friends and fellowmembers over a beforedinner cocktail  griggs offered him the defence of william bull the chippenham murderer and he refused it another remarked griggs wrote him personally and the reply came from the brancaster golf club it isnt like ledsam to be taking golfing holidays in the middle of the session  theres nothing wrong with ledsam declared a gruff voice from the corner and dont gossip you fellows at the top of your voices like a lot of old women hell be calling here for me in a moment or two  they all looked around andrew wilmore rose slowly to his feet and emerged from behind the sheets of an evening paper he laid his hand upon the shoulder of a friend and glanced towards the door  ledsams had a touch of nerves he confided theres been nothing else the matter with him weve been down at the dormy house at brancaster and hes as right as a trivet now that hilditch affair did him in completely  i dont see why one of the bystanders observed he got hilditch off all right one of the finest addresses to a jury i ever heard  thats just the point wilmore explained you see ledsam had no idea that hilditch was really guilty and for two hours that afternoon he literally fought for his life and in the end wrested a verdict from the jury against the judges summing up by sheer magnetism or eloquence or whatever you fellows like to call it the very night after hilditch confesses his guilt and commits suicide  i still dont see where ledsams worry comes in the legal luminary remarked the fact that the man was guilty is rather a feather in the cap of his counsel shows how jolly good his pleading must have been  just so wilmore agreed but ledsam as you know is a very conscientious sort of fellow and very sensitive too the whole thing was a shock to him  it must have been a queer experience a novelist remarked from the outskirts of the group to dine with a man whose life you have juggled away from the law and then have him explain his crime to you and the exact manner of its accomplishment seems to bring one amongst the goats somehow  bit of a shock no doubt the lawyer assented but i still dont understand ledsams sending back all his briefs hes not going to chuck the profession is he  not by any means wilmore declared i think he has an idea though that he doesnt want to accept any briefs unless he is convinced that the person whom he has to represent is innocent and lawyers dont like that sort of thing you know you cant pick and choose even when you have leadsams gifts  the fact of it is the novelist commented francis ledsam isnt callous enough to be associated with you moneygrubbing dispensers of the law hed be all right as public prosecutor a sort of sir galahad waving the banner of virtue but he hates to stuff his pockets at the expense of the criminal classes  who the mischief are the criminal classes a police court magistrate demanded personally i call war profiteering criminal i call a good many stock exchange deals criminal and he added turning to a member of the committee who was hovering in the background i call it criminal to expect us to drink french vermouth like this  there is another point of view the latter retorted i call it a crime to expect a body of intelligent men to administer without emolument to the greed of such a crowd of rotters youll get the right stuff next week  the hallporter approached and addressed wilmore  mr ledsam is outside in a taxi sir he announced  outside in a taxi the lawyer repeated why on earth cant he come in  i never heard such rot another declared lets go and rope him in  mr ledsam desired me to say sir the hall porter continued to any of his friends who might be here that he will be in to lunch tomorrow  leave him to me till then wilmore begged hell be all right directly hes simply altering his bearings and taking his time about it if hes promised to lunch here tomorrow he will hes as near as possible through the wood coming up in the train he suggested a little conversation tonight and afterwards the normal life he means it too theres nothing neurotic about ledsam  the magistrate nodded  run along then my merry andrew he said but see that ledsam keeps his word about tomorrow   andrew wilmore plunged boldly into the forbidden subject later on that evening as the two men sat side by side at one of the wall tables in sotos famous club restaurant they had consumed an excellent dinner an empty champagne bottle had just been removed double liqueur brandies had taken its place francis with an air of complete and even exuberant humanity had lit a huge cigar the moment seemed propitious  francis his friend began they say at the club that you refused to be briefed in the chippenham affair  quite true was the calm reply i told griggs that i wouldnt have anything to do with it  wilmore knew then that all was well francis old air of strength and decision had returned his voice was firm his eyes were clear and bright his manner seemed even to invite questioning  i think i know why wilmore said but i should like you to tell me in your own words  francis glanced around as though to be sure that they were not overheard  because he replied dropping his voice a little but still speaking with great distinctness william bull is a cunning and dangerous criminal whom i should prefer to see hanged  you know that  i know that  it would be a great achievement to get him off wilmore persisted the evidence is very weak in places  i believe that i could get him off was the confident reply that is why i will not touch the brief i think francis continued that i have already conveyed it to you indirectly but here you are in plain words andrew i have made up my mind that i will defend no man in future unless i am convinced of his innocence  that means  it means practically the end of my career at the bar francis admitted i realise that absolutely fortunately as you know i am not dependent upon my earnings and i have had a wonderful ten years  this is all because of the hilditch affair i suppose  entirely  wilmore was still a little puzzled  you seem to imagine that you have something on your conscience as regards that business he said boldly  i have was the calm reply  come wilmore protested i dont quite follow your line of thought granted that hilditch was a desperate criminal whom by the exercise of your special gifts you saved from the law surely his tragic death balanced the account between you and society  it might have done francis admitted if he had really committed suicide  wilmore was genuinely startled he looked at his companion curiously  what the devil do you mean old chap he demanded your own evidence at the inquest was practically conclusive as to that  francis glanced around him with apparent indifference but in reality with keen and stealthy care on their right was a glass division through which the sound of their voices could not possibly penetrate on their left was an empty space and a table beyond was occupied by a wellknown cinema magnate engaged in testing the attractions in daily life of a wouldbe film star nevertheless francis voice was scarcely raised above a whisper  my evidence at the coroners inquest he confided was a subtly concocted tissue of lies i committed perjury freely that is the real reason why ive been a little on the nervy side lately and why i took these few months out of harness  good god wilmore exclaimed setting down untasted the glass of brandy which he had just raised to his lips  i want to finish this matter up francis continued calmly by making a clean breast of it to you because from tonight i am starting afresh with new interests in my life what will practically amount to a new career that is why i preferred not to dine at the club tonight although i am looking forward to seeing them all again i wanted instead to have this conversation with you i lied at the inquest when i said that the relations between oliver hilditch and his wife that night seemed perfectly normal i lied when i said that i knew of no cause for illwill between them i lied when i said that i left them on friendly terms i lied when i said that oliver hilditch seemed depressed and nervous i lied when i said that he expressed the deepest remorse for what he had done there was every indication that night of the hate which i happen to know existed between the woman and the man i have not the faintest doubt in my mind but that she murdered him in my judgment she was perfectly justified in doing so  there followed a brief but enforced silence as some late arrivals passed their table the room was wellventilated but andrew wilmore felt suddenly hot and choking a woman one of the little group of newcomers glanced towards francis curiously  francis ledsam the criminal barrister her companion whisperedthe man who got oliver hilditch off the man with him is andrew wilmore the novelist discussing a case i expect     chapter viii   the little party of late diners passed on their way to the further end of the room leaving a wave of artificiality behind or was it andrew wilmore wondered in a moment of halfdazed speculation that it was they and the rest of the gay company who represented the real things and he and his companion who were playing a sombre part in some unreal and gloomier world francis voice however when he recommenced his diatribe was calm and matteroffact enough  you see he continued argumentatively i was morally and actually responsible for the mans being brought back into society and far worse than that i was responsible for his being thrust back again upon his wife ergo i was also responsible for what she did that night the matter seems as plain as a pikestaff to me i did what i could to atone rightly or wrongly it doesnt matter because it is over and done with there you are old fellow now you know whats been making me nervy ive committed wholesale perjury but i acted according to my conscience and i think according to justice the thing has worried me i admit but it has passed and im glad its off my chest one more liqueur andrew and if you want to well talk about my plans for the future  the brandy was brought wilmore studied his friend curiously not without some relief francis had lost the harassed and nervous appearance upon which his club friends had commented which had been noticeable even to a diminishing extent upon the golf course at brancaster he was alert and eager he had the air of a man upon the threshold of some enterprise dear to his heart  i have been through a queer experience francis continued presently as he sipped his second liqueur not only had i rather less than twelve hours to make up my mind whether i should commit a serious offence against the law but a sensation which i always hoped that i might experience has come to me in what i suppose i must call most unfortunate fashion  the woman wilmore ventured  francis assented gloomily there was a moments silence wilmore the metaphysician saw then a strange thing he saw a light steal across his friends stern face he saw his eyes for a moment soften the hard mouth relax something incredible transforming shine as it were out of the mans soul in that moment of selfrevelation it was gone like the momentary passing of a strange gleam of sunshine across a leaden sea but those few seconds were sufficient wilmore knew well enough what had happened  oliver hilditchs wife francis went on after a few minutes pause presents an enigma which at present i cannot hope to solve the fact that she received her husband back again knowing what he was and what he was capable of is inexplicable to me the woman herself is a mystery i do not know what lies behind her extraordinary immobility feeling she must have and courage or she would never have dared to have ridded herself of the scourge of her life but beyond that my judgment tells me nothing i only know that sooner or later i shall seek her out i shall discover all that i want to know one way or the other it may be for happinessit may be the end of the things that count  i guessed this wilmore admitted with a little shiver which he was wholly unable to repress  francis nodded  then keep it to yourself my dear fellow he begged like everything else i am telling you tonight i have come out of my experience changed in many ways he continued but leaving out that one secret chapter this is the dominant factor which looms up before me i bring into life a new aversion almost a passion andrew born in a teashop in the city and ministered to by all that has happened since i have lost that sort of indifference which my profession engenders towards crime i am at war with the criminal sometimes i hope in the courts of justice but forever out of them i am no longer indifferent as to whether men do good or evil so long as they do not cross my path i am a hunter of sin i am out to destroy theres a touch of melodrama in this for you andrew he concluded with a little laugh but my god im in earnest  what does this mean so far as regards the routine of your daily life wilmore asked curiously  well it brings us to the point we discussed down at brancaster francis replied it will affect my work to this extent i shall not accept any brief unless after reading the evidence i feel convinced that the accused is innocent  thats all very well wilmore observed but you know what it will mean dont you lawyers arent likely to single you out for a brief without ever feeling sure whether you will accept it or not  that doesnt worry me francis declared i dont need the fees fortunately and i can always pick up enough work to keep me going by attending sessions one thing i can promise youi certainly shall not sit in my rooms and wait for things to happen mine is a militant spirit and it needs the outlet of action  action yes but how wilmore queried you cant be always hanging about the courts waiting for the chance of defending some poor devil whos been wrongfully accusedthere arent enough of them for one thing on the other hand you cant walk down regent street brandishing a twoedged sword and hunting for pickpockets  francis smiled  nothing so flamboyant i can assure you andrew he replied nor shall i play the amateur detective with his mouth open for mysteries but listen he went on earnestly ive had some experience as you know and notwithstanding the oliver hilditchs of the world i can generally tell a criminal when i meet him face to face there are plenty of them about too andrewas many in this place as any other i am not going to be content with a negative position as regards evildoers i am going to set my heel on as many of the human vermin of this city as i can find  a laudable a most exhilarating and delightful pursuit human vermin too is excellent it opens up a new and fascinating vista for the modern sportsman my congratulations  it was an interruption of peculiar and wonderful significance but francis did not for the moment appreciate the fact turning his head he simply saw a complete stranger seated unaccountably at the next table who had butted into a private conversation and whose tone of gentle sarcasm therefore was the more offensive  who the devil are you sir he demanded and where did you come from  the newcomer showed no resentment at francis little outburst he simply smiled with deprecating amiabilitya tall spare man with lean hard face complexion almost unnaturally white black hair plentifully besprinkled with grey a thin cynical mouth notwithstanding its distinctly humourous curve and keen almost brilliant dark eyes he was dressed in ordinary dinner garb his linen and jewellery was indeed in the best possible taste francis at his second glance was troubled with a vague sense of familiarity  let me answer your last question first sir the intruder begged i was seated alone several tables away when the couple next to you went out and having had pointed out to me the other evening at claridges hotel and knowing well by repute the great barrister mr francis ledsam and his friend the worldfamed novelist mr andrew wilmore ierunobtrusively made my way half a yard at a time in your directionand here i am i came stealthily you may object without a doubt if i had come in any other fashion i should have disturbed a conversation in which i was much interested  could you find it convenient francis asked with icy politeness to return to your own table stealthily or not as you choose  the newcomer showed no signs of moving  in after years he declared you would be the first to regret the fact if i did so this is a momentous meeting it gives me an opportunity of expressing my deep gratitude to you mr ledsam for the wonderful evidence you tendered at the inquest upon the body of my soninlaw oliver hilditch  francis turned in his place and looked steadily at this unsoughtfor companion learning nothing however from the halfmocking smile and imperturbable expression  your soninlaw he repeated do you mean to say that you are the father ofof oliver hilditchs wife  widow the other corrected gently i have that honour you will understand therefore that i feel myself on this the first opportunity compelled to tender my sincere thanks for evidence so chivalrously offered so flawlessly truthful  francis was a man accustomed to selfcontrol but he clenched his hands so that his finger nails dug into his flesh he was filled with an insane and unreasoning resentment against this man whose words were biting into his conscience nevertheless he kept his tone level  i do not desire your gratitude he said nor if you will permit me to say so your further acquaintance  the stranger shook his head regretfully  you are wrong he protested we were bound in any case to know one another shall i tell you why you have just declared yourself anxious to set your heel upon the criminals of the world i have the distinction of being perhaps the most famous patron of that maligned class now livingand my neck is at your service  you appear to me francis said suavely to be a buffoon  it might have been fancy but francis could have sworn that he saw the glitter of a sovereign malevolence in the others dark eyes if so it was but a passing weakness for a moment later the half goodnatured half cynical smile was back again upon the mans lips  if so i am at least a buffoon of parts was the prompt rejoinder i will if you choose prove myself  there was a moments silence wilmore was leaning forward in his place studying the newcomer earnestly an impatient invective was somehow stifled upon francis lips  within a few yards of this place sometime before the closing hour tonight the intruder continued earnestly yet with a curious absence of any human quality in his hard tone there will be a disturbance and probably what you would call a crime will be committed will you use your vaunted gifts to hunt down the desperate criminal and in your own picturesque phraseology set your heel upon his neck success may bring you fame and the trail may leadwell who knows where  afterwards both francis and andrew wilmore marvelled at themselves unable at any time to find any reasonable explanation of their conduct for they answered this man neither with ridicule rudeness nor civility they simply stared at him impressed with the convincing arrogance of his challenge and unable to find words of reply they received his mocking farewell without any form of reciprocation or sign of resentment they watched him leave the room a dignified distinguished figure sped on his way with marks of the deepest respect by waiters maitres dhotels and even the manager himself they behaved indeed as they both admitted afterwards like a couple of moonstruck idiots when he had finally disappeared however they looked at one another and the spell was broken  well im damned francis exclaimed soto come here at once  the manager hastened smilingly to their table  soto francis invoked tell us quicklytell us the name of the gentleman who has just gone out and who he is  soto was amazed  you dont know sir timothy brast sir he exclaimed why he is supposed to be one of the richest men in the world he spends money like water they say that when he is in england his place down the river alone costs a thousand pounds a week when he gives a party here we can find nothing good enough he is our most generous client  sir timothy brast wilmore repeated yes i have heard of him  why everybody knows sir timothy soto went on eloquently he is the greatest living patron of boxing he found the money for the last international fight  does he often come in alone like this francis asked curiously  either alone soto replied or with a very large party he entertains magnificently  ive seen his name in the paper in connection with something or other during the last few weeks wilmore remarked reflectively  probably about two months ago sir soto suggested he gave a donation of ten thousand pounds to the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals and they made him a vice president in one moment sir  the manager hurried away to receive a newlyarrived guest francis and his friend exchanged a wondering glance  father of oliver hilditchs wife wilmore observed the most munificent patron of boxing in the world vice president of the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals and selfconfessed archcriminal he pulled our legs pretty well  i suppose so francis assented absently  wilmore glanced at his watch  what about moving on somewhere he suggested we might go into the alhambra for halfanhour if you like the last act of the show is the best  francis shook his head  weve got to see this thing out he replied have you forgotten that our friend promised us a sensation before we left  wilmore began to laugh a little derisively then suddenly aware of some lack of sympathy between himself and his friend he broke off and glanced curiously at the latter  youre not taking him seriously are you he enquired  francis nodded  certainly i am he confessed  you dont believe that he was getting at us  not for a moment  you believe that something is going to happen here in this place or quite close  i am convinced of it was the calm reply  wilmore was silent for a moment he was troubled with his old fears as to his friends condition a glance however at francis set face and equable watchful air reassured him  we must see the thing through of course then he assented let us see if we can spot the actors in the coming drama     chapter ix   it happened that the two men waiting in the vestibule of the restaurant for francis car to crawl up to the entrance through the fog which had unexpectedly rolled up heard the slight altercation which was afterwards referred to as preceding the tragedy the two young people concerned were standing only a few feet away the girl pretty a little peevish an ordinary type her companion whose boyish features were marred with dissipation a very passable example of the young man about town going a little beyond his tether  its no good standing here victor the girl exclaimed frowning the commissionaires been gone ages already and there are two others before us for taxis  we cant walk her escort replied gloomily its a foul night nothing to do but wait what lets go back and have another drink  the girl stamped her satinshod foot impatiently  dont be silly she expostulated you know i promised clara wed be there early  all very well the young man grumbled but what can we do we shall have to wait our turn  why cant you slip out and look for a taxi yourself she suggested do victor she added squeezing his arm youre so clever at picking them up  he made a little grimace but lit a cigarette and turned up his coat collar  ill do my best he promised dont go on without me  try up towards charing cross road not the other way she advised earnestly  rightoh he replied which illuminative form of assent a word spoken as he plunged unwillingly into the thick obscurity on the other side of the revolving doors was probably the last he ever uttered on earth  left alone the girl began to shiver as though suddenly cold she turned around and glanced hurriedly back into the restaurant at that moment she met the steady questioning scrutiny of francis eyes she stood as though transfixed then came the sound which every one talked of for months afterwards the sound which no one who heard it ever forgotthe death cry of victor bidlake followed a second afterwards by a muffled report a strain of frenzied surprise seemed mingled with the horror afterwards silence  there was the sound of some commotion outside the sound of hurried footsteps and agitated voices then a terrible little procession appeared somethingit seemed to be a shapeless heap of clotheswas carried in and laid upon the floor in the little space between the revolving doors and the inner entrance two blueliveried attendants kept back the horrified but curious crowd francis vaguely recognised as being somehow or other connected with the law was one of the few people allowed to remain whilst a doctor fetched out from the dancingroom kneeled over the prostrate form he felt that he knew beforehand the horrible verdict which the latter whispered in his ear after his brief examination  quite dead a ghastly business  francis gazed at the hole in the shirtfront disfigured also by a scorching stain  a bullet he asked  the doctor nodded  fired within a foot of the poor fellows heart he whispered the murderer wasnt taking any chances whoever he was  have the police been sent for  the headporter stepped forward  there was a policeman within a few yards of the spot sir he replied hes gone down to keep every one away from the place where we found the body weve telephoned to scotland yard for an inspector  the doctor rose to his feet  nothing more can be done he pronounced keep the people out of here whilst i go and fetch my hat and coat afterwards ill take the body to the mortuary when the ambulance arrives  an attendant pushed his way through the crowd of people on the inner side of the door  miss daisy hyslop young lady who was with mr bidlake has just fainted in the ladies room sir he announced could you come  ill be there immediately the doctor promised  the rest of the proceedings followed a normal course the police arrived took various notes the ambulance followed a little later the body was removed and the little crowd of guests still infected with a sort of awed excitement were allowed to take their leave francis and wilmore drove almost in silence to the formers rooms in clarges street  come up and have a drink andrew francis invited  i need it was the halfchoked response  francis led the way in silence up the two flights of stairs into his sittingroom mixed whiskies and sodas from the decanter and syphon which stood upon the sideboard and motioned his friend to an easychair then he gave form to the thought which had been haunting them both  what about our friend sir timothy brast he enquired do you believe now that he was pulling our legs  wilmore dabbed his forehead with his handkerchief it was a chilly evening but there were drops of perspiration still standing there  francis he confessed its horrible i dont think realism like this attracts me its horrible what are we going to do  nothing for the present was the brief reply if we were to tell our story we should only be laughed at what there is to be done falls to my lot  had the police anything to say about it wilmore asked  only a few words francis replied shopland has it in hand a good man but unimaginative ive come across him in one or two cases lately youll find a little bit like this in the papers tomorrow the murder is believed to have been committed by one of the gang of desperadoes who have infested the westend during the last few months you remember the assault in the albany court yard and the sandbagging in shepherd market only last week  that seems to let sir timothy out wilmore remarked  there are many motives for crime besides robbery francis declared dont be afraid andrew that i am going to turn amateur detective and make the unravelment of this case all the more difficult for scotland yard if i interfere it will be on a certainty andrew dont think im mad but ive taken up the challenge our great philanthropist flung at me tonight ive very little interest in who killed this boy victor bidlake or why but im convinced of one thingbrast knew about it and if he is posing as a patron of crime on a great scale sooner or later i shall get him he may think himself safe and he may have the courage of beelzebubhe seems rather that typebut if my presentiment about himcomes true his numbers up i can almost divine the meaning of his breaking in upon our conversation tonight he needs an enemyhe is thirsting for danger he has found it  wilmore filled his pipe thoughtfully at the first whiff of tobacco he began to feel more normal  after all francis he said arent we a little overstrung tonight sir timothy brast is no adventurer he is a prince in the city a persona grata wherever he chooses to go he isnt a hangeron in society he isnt even dependent upon bohemia for his entertainment you cant seriously imagine that a man with his possessions is likely to risk his life and liberty in becoming the inspiration of a band of cutthroats  francis smiled he too had lit his pipe and had thrown himself into his favourite chair he smiled confidently across at his friend  a millionaire with brains he argued is just the one person in the world likely to weary of all ordinary forms of diversion i begin to remember things about him already havent you heard about his wonderful parties down at the walled house  wilmore struck the table by his side with his clenched fist  by george thats it he exclaimed who hasnt  i remember baker talking about one last year francis continued never any details but all kinds of mysterious hintsa sort of mixture between a roman orgy and a chapter from the arabian nightssingers from petrograd dancers from africa and fighting men from chicago  the fellows magnificent at any rate wilmore remarked  his host smoked furiously for a moment  thats the worst of these multimillionaires he declared they think they can rule the world traffic in human souls buy morals mock at the law we shall see  do you know the thing that i found most interesting about him wilmore asked  his black opals the other suggested youre by the way of being a collector arent you  wilmore shook his head  the fact that he is the father of oliver hilditchs widow  francis sat quite still for a moment there was a complete change in his expression he looked like a man who has received a shock  i forgot that he muttered     chapter x   francis met shopland one morning about a week later on his way from clarges street to his chambers in the temple the detective raised his hat and would have passed on but francis accosted him  any progress mr shopland he enquired  the detective fingered his small sandy moustache he was an insignificantlooking little man undersized with thin frame and watery eyes his mouth however was hard and there were some telltale little lines at its corners  none whatever i am sorry to say mr ledsam he admitted at present we are quite in the dark  you found the weapon i hear  shopland nodded  it was just an ordinary service revolver dating from the time of the war exactly like a hundred thousand others the enquiries we were able to make from it came to nothing  where was it picked up  in the middle of the waste plot of ground next to sotos the murderer evidently threw it there the moment he had discharged it he must have been wearing rubbersoled shoes for not a soul heard him go  francis nodded thoughtfully  i wonder he said after a slight pause whether it ever occurred to you to interview miss daisy hyslop the young lady who was with bidlake on the night of his murder  i called upon her the day afterwards the detective answered  she had nothing to say  nothing whatever  indirectly of course francis continued the poor girl was the cause of his death if she had not insisted upon his going out for a taxicab the man who was loitering about would probably have never got hold of him  the detective glanced up furtively at the speaker he seemed to reflect for a moment  i gathered he said in conversation with the commissionaire that miss hyslop was a little impatient that night it seems however that she was anxious to get to a ball which was being given down in kensington  there was a ball was there francis asked  without a doubt the detective replied it was given by a miss clara bultiwell she happens to remember urging miss hyslop to come on as early as possible  so thats that francis observed  just so mr ledsam the detective murmured  they were walking along the mall now eastwards the detective who seemed to have been just a saunterer had accommodated himself to francis destination  let me see there was nothing stolen from the young mans person was there francis asked presently  apparently nothing at all sir  and i gather that you have made every possible enquiry as to the young mans relations with his friends  so far as one can learn sir they seem to have been perfectly amicable  of course francis remarked presently this may have been quite a purposeless affair the deed may have been committed by a man who was practically a lunatic without any motive or reason whatever  precisely so sir the detective agreed  but all the same i dont think it was  neither do i sir  francis smiled slightly  shopland he said if there is no further external evidence to be collected i suggest that there is only one person likely to prove of assistance to you  and that one person sir  miss daisy hyslop  the young lady whom i have already seen  francis nodded  the young lady whom you have already seen he assented at the same time mr shopland we must remember this if miss hyslop has any knowledge of the facts which are behind mr bidlakes murder it is more likely to be to her interest to keep them to herself than to give them away to the police free gratis and for nothing do you follow me  precisely sir  that being so francis continued i am going to make a proposition to you for what it is worth where were you going when i met you this morning shopland  to call upon you in clarges street sir  what for  i was going to ask you if you would be so kind as to call upon miss daisy hyslop sir  francis smiled  great minds he murmured i will see the young lady this afternoon shopland  the detective raised his hat they had reached the spot where his companion turned off by the horse guards parade  i may hope to hear from you then sir  within the course of a day or two perhaps earlier francis promised   francis continued his walk along the embankment to his chambers in the temple he glanced in the outer office as he passed to his consulting room  anything fresh angrave he asked his headclerk  nothing whatever sir was the quiet reply  he passed on to his own dena bare room with long windows looking out over the gardens he glanced at the two or three letters which lay on his desk none of them of the least interest and leaning back in his chair commenced to fill his pipe there was a knock at the door fawsitt a young beginner at the bar in whom he had taken some interest and who deviled for him presented himself  can i have a word with you mr ledsam he asked  by all means was the prompt response sit down  fawsitt seated himself on the other side of the table he had a long thin face dark narrow eyes unwholesome complexion a slightly hooked nose and teeth discoloured through constant smoking his fingers too bore the telltale yellow stains  mr ledsam he said i think with your permission i should like to leave at the end of my next three months  francis glanced across at him  sorry to hear that fawsitt are you going to work for any one else  i havent made arrangements yet sir the young man replied i thought of offering myself to mr barnes  why do you want to leave me francis asked  there isnt enough for me to do sir  francis lit his pipe  its probably just a lull fawsitt he remarked  i dont think so sir  the devil youve been gossiping with some of these solicitors clerks fawsitt  i shouldnt call it gossiping sir i am always interested to hear anything that may concern ourmy future i have reason to believe sir that we are being passed over for briefs  the reason being  one cant pick and choose sir one shouldnt anyway  francis smiled  you evidently dont approve of any measure of personal choice as to the work which one takes up  certainly i do not sir in our profession the only brief i would refuse would be a losing or an illpaid one i dont conceive it to be our business to prejudge a case  i see francis murmured go on fawsitt  theres a rumour about the young man continued that you are only going to plead where the chances are that your client is innocent  theres some truth in that francis admitted  if i could leave a little before the three months sir i should be glad fawsitt said i look at the matter from an entirely different point of view  you shall leave when you like of course fawsitt but tell me what that point of view is  just this sir the simplestminded idiot who ever stammered through his address can get an innocent prisoner off if he knows enough of the facts and the law to my mind the real triumph in our profession is to be able to unwind the meshes of damning facts and force a verdict for an indubitably guilty client  how does the moral side of that appeal to you his senior enquired  i didnt become a barrister to study morals or even to consider them was the somewhat caustic reply when once a brief is in my mind it is a matter of brain cunning and resource the guiltier a man the greater the success if you can get him off  and turn him loose again upon society  it isnt our job to consider that sir the moral question is only confusing in the matter our job is to make use of the law for the benefit of our client thats what were paid for thats the measure of our success or failure  francis nodded  very reasonably put fawsitt he conceded ill give you a letter to barnes whenever you like  i should be glad if you would do so sir the young man said im only wasting my time here  francis wrote a letter of recommendation to barnes the great kc considered a stray brief which had found its way in and strolled up towards the milan as the hour approached luncheontime in the american bar of that palatial hotel he found the young man he was looking fora flaxenhaired youth who was seated upon one of the small tables with his feet upon a chair laying down the law to a little group of acquaintances he greeted francis cordially but without that due measure of respect which nineteen should accord to thirtyfive  cheerio my elderly relative he exclaimed have a cocktail  francis nodded assent  come into this corner with me for a moment charles he invited i have a word for your ear  the young man rose and sat by his uncles side on a settee  in my declining years the latter began i find myself reverting to the follies of youth i require a letter of introduction from you to a young lady of your acquaintance  the devil not one of my own special little pets i hope  her name is miss daisy hyslop francis announced  lord charles southover pursed his lips and whistled he glanced at francis sideways  is this the beginning of a campaign amongst the butterflies he enquired because if so i feel it my duty uncle to address to you a few words of solemn warning miss daisy hyslop is hot stuff  look here young fellow francis said equably i dont know what the state of your exchequer is  i owe you forty lord charles interrupted spring another tenner make it fifty that is and the letter of introduction i will write for you will bring tears of gratitude to your eyes  ill spring the tenner francis promised but youll write just what i tell youno more and no less  anything extra for keeping mum at home the young man ventured tentatively  youre a nice sort of nephew to have francis declared abandon these futile attempts at blackmail and just come this way to the writingtable  youve got the tenner with you the young man asked anxiously  francis produced a wellfilled pocketbook his nephew led the way to a writingtable lit a cigarette which he stuck into the corner of his mouth and in painstaking fashion wrote the few lines which francis dictated the ten pounds changed hands  have one with me for luck the young man invited brightly no perhaps youre right he added in valedictory fashion youd better keep your head clear for daisy     chapter xi   miss daisy hyslop received francis that afternoon in the sittingroom of her little suite at the milan her welcoming smile was plaintive and a little subdued her manner undeniably gracious she was dressed in black a wonderful background for her really gorgeous hair and her deportment indicated a recent loss  how nice of you to come and see me she murmured with a lingering touch of the fingers do take that easychair please and sit down and talk to me your roses were beautiful but whatever made you send them to me  impulse he answered  she laughed softly  then please yield to such impulses as often as you feel them she begged i adore flowers just now too she added with a little sigh anything is welcome which helps to keep my mind off my own affairs  it was very good of you to let me come he declared i can quite understand that you dont feel like seeing many people just now  francis manner although deferential and courteous had nevertheless some quality of aloofness in it to which she was unused and which she was quick to recognise the smile faded from her face she seemed suddenly not quite so young  havent i seen you before somewhere quite lately she asked a little sharply  you saw me at sotos the night that victor bidlake was murdered he reminded her i stood quite close to you both while you were waiting for your taxi  the animation evoked by this call from a presumably new admirer suddenly left her she became nervous and constrained she glanced again at his card  dont tell me she begged that you have come to ask me any questions about that night i simply could not bear it the police have been here twice and i had nothing to tell them absolutely nothing  quite right he assented soothingly police have such a clumsy way of expecting valuable information for nothing im always glad to hear of their being disappointed  she studied her visitor for a moment carefully then she turned to the table by her side picked up a note and read it through  lord southover tells me here she said that you are just a pal of his who wants to make my acquaintance he doesnt say why  is that necessary francis asked goodnaturedly  she moved in her chair a little nervously crossing and uncrossing her legs more than once her white silk stockings underneath her black skirt were exceedingly effective a fact of which she never lost consciousness although at that moment she was scarcely inspired to play the coquette  id like to think it wasnt she admitted frankly  ive seen you repeatedly upon the stage he told her and though musical comedy is rather out of my line i have always admired you immensely  she studied him once more almost wistfully  you look very nice she acknowledged but you dont look at all the kind of man who admires girls who do the sort of rubbish i do on the stage  what do i look like he asked smiling  a man with a purpose she answered  i begin to think he ventured that we shall get on you are really a very astute young lady  you are quite sure youre not one of these amateur detectives one reads about she demanded  certainly not he assured her i will confess that i am interested in victor bidlakes death and i should like to discover the truth about it but i have a reason for that which i may tell you some day it has nothing whatever to do with the young man himself to the best of my belief i never saw or heard of him before in my life my interest lies with another person you have lost a great friend i know if you felt disposed to tell me the whole story it might make such a difference  she sighed her confidence was returningalso her selfpity the latter at once betrayed itself  you see she confided victor and i were engaged to be married so naturally i let him help me a little i shant be able to stay on here now they are bothering me about their bill already she added with a sideglance at an envelope which stood on a table by her side  he drew a little nearer to her  miss hyslop he began  daisy she interrupted  miss daisy hyslop then he continued smiling i suggested just now that i did not want to come and bother you for information without any return if i can be of any assistance to you in that matter he added glancing towards the envelope i shall be very pleased  she sighed gratefully  just till victors people return to town she said i know that they mean to do something for me  how much he asked  two hundred pounds would keep me going she told him  he wrote out a cheque miss hyslop drew a sigh of relief as she laid it on one side with the envelope then she swung round in her chair to face him where he sat at the writingtable  i am afraid you will think that what i have to tell is very insignificant she confessed victor was one of those boys who always fancied themselves bored he was bored with polo bored with motoring bored with the country and bored with town then quite suddenly during the last few weeks he seemed changed all that he would tell me was that he had found a new interest in life i dont know what it was but i dont think it was a nice one he seemed to drop all his old friends too and go about with a new set altogethernot a nice set at all he used to stay out all night and he quite gave up going to dances and places where he could take me once or twice he came here in the afternoon dead beat without having been to bed at all and before he could say halfadozen words he was asleep in my easychair he used to mutter such horrible things that i had to wake him up  was he ever short of money francis asked  she shook her head  not seriously she answered he was quite welloff besides what his people allowed him i was going to have a wonderful settlement as soon as our engagement was announced however to go on with what i was telling you the very night beforeit happenedhe came in to see me looking like nothing on earth he cried like a baby behaved like a lunatic and called himself all manner of names he had had a great deal too much to drink and i gathered that he had seen something horrible it was then he asked me to dine with him the next night and told me that he was going to break altogether with his new friends something in connection with them seemed to have given him a terrible fright  francis nodded he had the tact to abandon his curiosity at this precise point  the old story he declared bad company and rotten habits i suppose some one got to know that the young man usually carried a great deal of money about with him  it was so foolish of him she assented eagerly i warned him about it so often the police wont listen to it but i am absolutely certain that he was robbed i noticed when he paid the bill that he had a great wad of banknotes which were never discovered afterwards  francis rose to his feet  what are you doing tonight he enquired  nothing she acknowledged eagerly  then lets dine somewhere and see the show at the frivolity he suggested  you dear man she assented with enthusiasm the one thing i wanted to do and the one person i wanted to do it with     chapter xii   it was after leaving miss daisy hyslops flat that the event to which francis ledsam had been looking forward more than anything else in the world happened it came about entirely by chance there were no taxis in the strand francis himself had finished work for the day and feeling disinclined for his usual rubber of bridge he strolled homewards along the mall at the corner of green park he came face to face with the woman who for the last few months had scarcely been out of his thoughts even in that first moment he realised to his pain that she would have avoided him if she could they met however where the path narrowed and he left her no chance to avoid him that curious impulse of conventionality which opens a conversation always with cut and dried banalities saved them perhaps from a certain amount of embarrassment without any conscious suggestion they found themselves walking side by side  i have been wanting to see you very much indeed he said i even went so far as to wonder whether i dared call  why should you she asked our acquaintance began and ended in tragedy there is scarcely any purpose in carrying it further  he looked at her for a moment before replying she was wearing black but scarcely the black of a woman who sorrows she was still frigidly beautiful redolent in all the details of her toilette of that almost negative perfection which he had learnt to expect from her she suggested to him still that same sense of aloofness from the actualities of life  i prefer not to believe that it is ended he protested have you so many friends that you have no room for one who has never consciously done you any harm  she looked at him with some faint curiosity in her immobile features  harm no on the contrary i suppose i ought to thank you for your evidence at the inquest  some part of it was the truth he replied  i suppose so she admitted drily you told it very cleverly  he looked her in the eyes  my profession helped me to be a good witness he said as for the gist of my evidence that was between my conscience and myself  your conscience she repeated are there really men who possess such things  i hope you will discover that for yourself some day he answered tell me your plans where are you living  for the present with my father in curzon street  with sir timothy brast  she assented  you know him she asked indifferently  very slightly francis replied we talked together some nights ago at sotos restaurant i am afraid that i did not make a very favourable impression upon him i gathered too that he has somewhat eccentric tastes  i do not see a great deal of my father she said we met a few months ago for the first time since my marriage and things have been a little difficult between usjust at first he really scarcely ever puts in an appearance at curzon street i dare say you have heard that he makes a hobby of an amazing country house which he has down the river  the walled house he ventured  she nodded  i see you have heard of it all london they tell me gossips about the entertainments there  are they really so wonderful he asked  i have never been to one she replied as a matter of fact i have spent scarcely any time in england since my marriage my husband as i remember he told you was fond of travelling  notwithstanding the warm spring air he was conscious of a certain chilliness her level indifferent tone seemed to him almost abnormally callous a horrible realisation flashed for a moment in his brain she was speaking of the man whom she had killed  your father overheard a remark of mine francis told her i was at sotos with a friendandrew wilmore the novelistand to tell you the truth we were speaking of the shock i experienced when i realised that i had been devoting every effort of which i was capable to saving the life ofshall we say a criminal your father heard me say in rather a flamboyant manner perhaps that in future i declared war against all crime and all criminals  she smiled very faintly a smile which had in it no single element of joy or humour  i can quite understand my father intervening she said he poses as being rather a patron of artisticallyperpetrated crime sue is his favourite author and i believe that he has exceedingly grim ideas as to duelling and fighting generally he was in prison once for six months at new orleans for killing a man who insulted my mother nothing in the world would ever have convinced him that he had not done a perfectly legitimate thing  i am expecting to find him quite an interesting study when i know him better francis pronounced my only fear is that he will count me an unfriendly person and refuse to have anything to do with me  i am not at all sure she said indifferently that it would not be very much better for you if he did  i cannot admit that he answered smiling i think that our paths in life are too far apart for either of us to influence the other you dont share his tastes do you  which ones she asked after a moments silence  well boxing for one he replied they tell me that he is the greatest living patron of the ring both here and in america  i have never been to a fight in my life she confessed i hope that i never may  i cant go so far as that he declared but boxing isnt altogether one of my hobbies cant we leave your father and his tastes alone for the present i would rather talk aboutourselves tell me what you care about most in life  nothing she answered listlessly  but that is only a phase he persisted you have had terrible trials i know and they must have affected your outlook on life but you are still young and while one is young life is always worth having  i thought so once she assented i dont now  but there must bethere will be compensations he assured her i know that just now you are suffering from the reactionafter all you have gone through the memory of that will pass  the memory of what i have gone through will never pass she answered  there was a moments intense silence a silence pregnant with reminiscent drama the little room rose up before his memorythe womans hopeless hating eyes the quivering thread of steel the dead mans mocking words he seemed at that moment to see into the recesses of her mind was it remorse that troubled her he wondered did she lack strength to realise that in that halfhour at the inquest he had placed on record for ever his judgment of her deed even to think of it now was morbid although he would never have confessed it even to himself there was growing daily in his mind some idea of reward she had never thanked himhe hoped that she never wouldbut he had surely a right to claim some measure of her thoughts some light place in her life  please look at me he begged a little abruptly  she turned her head in some surprise francis was almost handsome in the clear spring sunlight his face alight with animation his deepset grey eyes full of amused yet anxious solicitude even as she appreciated these things and became dimly conscious of his eager interest her perturbation seemed to grow  well she ventured  do i look like a person who knew what he was talking about he asked  on the whole i should say that you did she admitted  very well then he went on cheerfully believe me when i say that the shadow which depresses you all the time now will pass i say this confidently he added his voice softening because i hope to be allowed to help havent you guessed that i am very glad indeed to see you again  she came to a sudden standstill they had just passed through lansdowne passage and were in the quiet end of curzon street  but you must not talk to me like that she expostulated  why not he demanded we have met under strange and untoward circumstances but are you so very different from other women  for a single moment she seemed infinitely more human startled a little nervous exquisitely sympathetic to an amazing and unexpected impression she seemed to look with glad but terrified eyes towards the vision of possible thingsand then to realise that it was but a trick of the fancy and to come shivering back to the world of actualities  i am very different she said quietly i have lived my life what i lack in years has been made up to me in horror i have no desire now but to get rid of this aftermath of years as smoothly and quickly as possible i do not wish any man mr ledsam to talk to me as you are doing  you will not accept my friendship  it is impossible she replied  may i be allowed to call upon you he went on doggedly  i do not receive visitors she answered  they were walking slowly up curzon street now she had given him every opportunity to leave her opportunities to which he was persistently blind her obstinacy had been a shock to him  i am sorry he said but i cannot accept my dismissal like this i shall appeal to your father however much he may dislike me he has at least commonsense  she looked at him with a touch of the old horror in her coldlyquestioning eyes  in your way you have been kind to me she admitted let me in return give you a word of advice let me beg you to have nothing whatever to do with my father in friendship or in enmity either might be equally disastrous either in the long run is likely to cost you dear  if that is your opinion of your father why do you live with him he asked  she had become entirely callous again her smile with its mocking quality reminded him for a moment of the man whom they were discussing  because i am a luxury and comfortloving parasite she answered deliberately because my father gladly pays my accounts at lucille and worth and reville because i have never learnt to do without things and please remember this my father so far as i am concerned has no faults he is a generous and courteous companion nevertheless number 70 b curzon street is no place for people who desire to lead normal lives  and with that she was gone her gesture of dismissal was so complete and final that he had no courage for further argument he had lost her almost as soon as he had found her     chapter xiii   four men were discussing the verdict at the adjourned inquest upon victor bidlake at sotos american bar about a fortnight later they were robert fairfax a young actor in musical comedy peter jacks a cinema producer gerald morse a dress designer and sidney voss a musical composer and librettist all habitues of the place and members of the little circle towards which the dead man had seemed during the last few weeks of his life to have become attracted at a table a short distance away francis ledsam was seated with a cocktail and a dish of almonds before him he seemed to be studying an evening paper and to be taking but the scantiest notice of the conversation at the bar  it just shows peter jacks declared that crime is the easiest game in the world given a reasonable amount of intelligence and a murderers business is about as simple as a sandwichmans  the police gerald morse a palefaced anaemiclooking youth declared rely upon two things circumstantial evidence and motive in the present case there is no circumstantial evidence and as to motive poor old victor was too big a fool to have an enemy in the world  sidney voss who was up for the sheridan club and had once been there glanced respectfully across at francis  you ought to know something about crime and criminals mr ledsam he said have you any theory about the affair  francis set down the glass from which he had been drinking and folding up the evening paper laid it by the side of him  as a matter of fact he answered calmly i have  the few words simply spoken yet in their way charged with menace thrilled through the little room fairfax swung round upon his stool a tall aggressivelooking youth whose goodlooks were half eaten up with dissipation his eyes were unnaturally bright the cloudy remains in his glass indicated absinthe  listen you fellows he exclaimed mr francis ledsam the great criminal barrister is going to solve the mystery of poor old victors death for us  the three other young men all turned around from the bar their eyes and whole attention seemed rivetted upon francis no one seemed to notice the newcomer who passed quietly to a chair in the background although he was a person of some note and interest to all of them imperturbable and immaculate as ever sir timothy brast smiled amiably upon the little gathering summoned a waiter and ordered a dry martini  i can scarcely promise to do that francis said slowly his eyes resting for a second or two upon each of the four faces exact solutions are a little out of my line i think i can promise to give you a shock though if youre strong enough to stand it  there was another of those curiously charged silences the bartender paused with the cocktail shaker still in his hand voss began to beat nervously upon the counter with his knuckles  we can stand anything but suspense he declared get on with your shockgiving  i believe that the person responsible for the death of victor bidlake is in this room at the present moment francis declared  again the silence curious tense and dramatic little jimmy the bartender who had leaned forward to listen stood with his mouth slightly open and the cocktailshaker which was in his hand leaked drops upon the counter the first conscious impulse of everybody seemed to be to glance suspiciously around the room the four young men at the bar jimmy and one waiter francis and sir timothy brast were its only occupants  i say you know thats a bit thick isnt it sidney voss stammered at last i wasnt in the place at all i was in manchester but its a bit rough on these other chaps victors pals  i was dining at the cafe royal jacks declared loudly  morse drew a little breath  every one knows that i was at brighton he muttered  i went home directly the bar here closed jimmy said in a still dazed tone i heard nothing about it till the next morning  alibis by the bushel fairfax laughed harshly as for me i was doing my showevery one knows that i was never in the place at all  the murder was not committed in the place francis commented calmly  fairfax slid off his stool a spot of colour blazed in his pale cheeks the glass which he was holding snapped in his fingers he seemed suddenly possessed  i say what the hell are you getting at he cried are you accusing meor any of us victors pals  i accuse no one francis replied unperturbed you invited a statement from me and i made it  sir timothy brast rose from his place and made his way to the end of the counter next to fairfax and nearest francis he addressed the former there was an inscrutable smile upon his lips his manner was reassuring  young gentleman he begged pray do not disturb yourself i will answer for it that neither you nor any of your friends are the objects of mr leadsams suspicion without a doubt it is i to whom his somewhat bold statement refers  they all stared at him immersed in another crisis bereft of speech he tapped a cigarette upon the counter and lit it fairfax whose glass had just been refilled by the bartender was still ghastly pale shaking with nervousness and breathing hoarsely francis tense and alert in his chair watched the speaker but said nothing  you see sir timothy continued addressing himself to the four young men at the bar i happen to have two special aversions in life one is sweet champagne and the other amateur detectivestheir stories their methods and everything about them i chanced to sit upstairs in the restaurant within hearing of mr ledsam and his friend mr wilmore the novelist the other night and i heard mr ledsam very much to my chagrin announce his intention of abandoning a career in which he has if he will allow me to say sowith a courteous bow to francisattained considerable distinction to indulge in the motheaten flamboyant and melodramatic antics of the lesser sherlock holmes i fear that i could not resist the opportunity ofi think you young men call itpulling his leg  every one was listening intently including shopland who had just drifted into the room and subsided into a chair near francis  i moved my place therefore sir timothy continued and i whispered in mr ledsams ear some rodomontade to the effect that if he were planning to be the giant crimedetector of the world i was by ambition the archcriminalor words to that effect and to give emphasis to my words i wound up by prophesying a crime in the immediate vicinity of the place within a few hours  a somewhat significant prophecy under the circumstances francis remarked reaching out for a dish of salted almonds and drawing them towards him  sir timothy shrugged his shoulders deprecatingly  i will confess he admitted that i had not in my mind an affair of such dimensions my harmless remark however has produced cataclysmic effects the conversation to which i refer took place on the night of young bidlakes murder and mr ledsam with my somewhat i confess bombastic words in his memory has pitched upon me as the bloodthirsty murderer  hold on for a moment sir peter jacks begged wiping the perspiration from his forehead weve got to have another drink quick poor old bobby here looks knocked all of a heap and im kind of jumpy myself youll join us sir  i thank you was the courteous reply i do not as a rule indulge to the extent of more than one cocktail but i will recognise the present as an exceptional occasion to continue then he went on after the glasses had been filled i have during the last few weeks experienced the ceaseless and lynxeyed watch of mr ledsam and presumably his myrmidons i do not know whether you are all acquainted with my name but in case you are not let me introduce myself i am sir timothy brast chairman as i dare say you know of the united transvaal gold mines chairman also of two of the principal hospitals in london vice president of the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals a patron of sport in many forms a traveller in many countries and a recipient of the honour of knighthood from his majesty in recognition of my services for various philanthropic works these facts however have availed me nothing now that the bungling amateur investigator into crime has pointed the finger of suspicion towards me my servants and neighbours have alike been plagued to death with cunning questions as to my life and habits i have been watched in the streets and watched in my harmless amusements my simple life has been peered into from every perspective and direction in short i am suspect mr ledsams terrifying statement a few minutes ago was directed towards me and me only  there were murmurs of sympathy from the four young men who each in his own fashion appeared to derive consolation from sir timothys frank and somewhat caustic statement francis who had listened unmoved to this flow of words glanced towards the door behind which dark figures seemed to be looming  that is all you have to say sir timothy he asked politely  for the present yes was the guarded reply i trust that i have succeeded in setting these young gentlemens minds at ease  there is one of them francis said gravely whose mind not even your soothing words could lighten  shopland had risen unobtrusively to his feet he laid his hand suddenly on fairfaxs shoulder and whispered in his ear fairfax after his first start seemed cool enough he stretched out his hand towards the glass which as yet he had not touched covered it with his fingers for a moment and drained its contents the gently sarcastic smile left sir timothys lips his eyebrows met in a quick frown his eyes glittered  what is the meaning of this he demanded sharply  a policeman in plain clothes had advanced from the door the manager hovered in the background shopland saw that all was well  it means he announced that i have just arrested mr robert fairfax here on a charge of wilful murder there is a way out through the kitchens i believe take his other arm holmes now gentlemen if you please  there were a few bewildered exclamationsthen a dramatic hush fairfax had fallen forward on his stool he seemed to have relapsed into a comatose state every scrap of colour was drained from his sallow cheeks his eyes were covered with a film and he was breathing heavily the detective snatched up the glass from which the young man had been drinking and smelt it  i saw him drop a tablet in just now jimmy faltered i thought it was one of the digestion pills he uses sometimes  shopland and the policeman placed their hands underneath the armpits of the unconscious man  hes done sir the former whispered to francis well try and get him to the station if we can     chapter xiv   the greatest tragedies in the world provided they happen to other people have singularly little effect upon the externals of our own lives there was certainly not a soul in sotos that night who did not know that bobby fairfax had been arrested in the bar below for the murder of victor bidlake had taken poison and died on the way to the police station yet the same number of dinners were ordered and eaten the same quantity of wine drunk the management considered that they had shown marvellous delicacy of feeling by restraining the orchestra from their usual musical gymnastics until after the service of dinner conversation in consequence buzzed louder than ever one speculation in particular absorbed the attention of every single person in the roomwhy had bobby fairfax at the zenith of a very successful career risked the gallows and actually accepted death for the sake of killing victor bidlake a young man with whom so far as anybody knew he had no cause of quarrel whatever there were many theories many people who knew the real facts and whispered them into a neighbours ear only to have them contradicted a few moments later yet curiously enough the two men who knew most about it were the two most silent men in the room for each was dining alone francis who had remained only in the hope that something of the sort might happen was conscious of a queer sense of excitement when with the service of coffee sir timothy glass in hand moved up from a table lower down and with a word of apology took the vacant place by his side it was what he had desired and yet he felt a thrill almost of fear at sir timothys murmured words he felt that he was in the company of one who if not an enemy at any rate had no friendly feeling towards him  my congratulations mr ledsam sir timothy said quietly you appear to have started your career with a success  only a partial one francis acknowledged and as a matter of fact i deny that i have started in any new career it was easy enough to make use of a fluke and direct the intelligence of others towards the right person but when the real significance of the thing still eludes you one can scarcely claim a triumph  sir timothy gently knocked the ash from the very fine cigar which he was smoking  still your groundwork was good he observed  francis shrugged his shoulders  that he admitted was due to chance  shall we exchange notes sir timothy suggested gently it might be interesting  as you will francis assented there is no particular secret in the way i stumbled upon the truth i was dining here that night as you know with andrew wilmore and while he was ordering the dinner and talking to some friends i went down to the american bar to have a cocktail miss daisy hyslop and fairfax were seated there alone and talking confidentially fairfax was insisting that miss hyslop should do something which puzzled her she consented reluctantly and fairfax then hurried off to the theatre later on miss hyslop and the unfortunate young man occupied a table close to ours and i happened to notice that she made a point of leaving the restaurant at a particular time while they were waiting in the vestibule she grew very impatient i was standing behind them and i saw her glance at the clock just before she insisted upon her companions going out himself to look for a taxicab ergo one enquires at fairfaxs theatre for that exact threequarters of an hour he is off the stage at that point my interest in the matter ceases scotland yard was quite capable of the rest  disappointing sir timothy murmured i thought at first that you were overmodest i find that i was mistaken it was chance alone which set you on the right track  well there is my story at any rate francis declared with how much of your knowledge of the affair are you going to indulge me  sir timothy slowly revolved his brandy glass  well he said i will tell you this the two young men concerned bidlake and fairfax were both guests of mine recently at my country house they had discovered for one another a very fierce and reasonable antipathy with that recurrence to primitivism with which i have always been a hearty sympathiser they agreed instead of going round their little world making sneering remarks about each other to fight it out  at your suggestion i presume francis interposed  precisely sir timothy assented i recommended that course and i offered them facilities for bringing the matter to a crisis the fight indeed was to have come off the day after the unfortunate episode which anticipated it  do you mean to tell me that you knew francis began  sir timothy checked him quietly but effectively  i knew nothing he said except this they were neither of them young men of much stomach and i knew that the one who was the greater coward would probably try to anticipate the matter by attacking the other first if he could i knew that fairfax was the greater cowardnot that there was much to choose between themand i also knew that he was the injured person that is really all there is about it my somewhat theatrical statement to you was based upon probability and not upon any certain foreknowledge as you see it came off  and the cause of their quarrel francis asked  there might have been a hundred reasons sir timothy observed as a matter of fact it was the eternal one there is no need to mention a womans name so we will let it go at that  there was a moments silencea strange unforgettable moment for francis ledsam who seemed by some curious trick of the imagination to have been carried away into an impossible and grotesque world the hum of eager conversation the popping of corks the little trills of feminine laughter all blended into one sensual and not unmusical chorus seemed to fade from his ears he fancied himself in some subterranean place of vast dimensions through the grim galleries of which men and women with evil faces crept like animals and towering above them unreal in size his scornful face an epitome of sin the knout which he wielded symbolical and ghastly driving his motley flock with the leer of the evil shepherd was the man from whom he had already learnt to recoil with horror the picture came and went in a flash francis found himself accepting a courteously offered cigar from his companion  you see the story is very much like many others sir timothy murmured as he lit a fresh cigar himself and leaned back with the obvious enjoyment of the cultivated smoker in every country of the world the animal world as well as the human world the male resents his female being taken from him directly he ceases to resent it he becomes degenerate surely you must agree with me mr leddam  it comes to this then francis pronounced deliberately that you stagemanaged the whole affair  sir timothy smiled  it is my belief mr ledsam he said that you grow more and more intelligent every hour  sir timothy glanced presently at his thin gold watch and put it back in his pocket regretfully  alas he sighed i fear that i must tear myself away i particularly want to hear the last act of louise the new frenchwoman sings and my daughter is alone you will excuse me  francis nodded silently his companions careless words had brought a sudden dazzling vision into his mind sir timothy scrawled his name at the foot of his bill  it is one of my axioms in life mr ledsam he continued that there is more pleasure to be derived from the society of ones enemies than ones friends if i thought you sufficiently educated in the outside ways of the world to appreciate this i would ask if you cared to accompany me  francis did not hesitate for a moment  sir timothy he said i have the greatest detestation for you and i am firmly convinced that you represent all the things in life abhorrent to me on the other hand i should very much like to hear the last act of louise and it would give me the greatest pleasure to meet your daughter so long as there is no misunderstanding  sir timothy laughed  come he said we will get our hats i am becoming more and more grateful to you mr ledsam you are supplying something in my life which i have lacked you appeal alike to my sense of humour and my imagination we will visit the opera together     chapter xv   the two men left sotos together very much in the fashion of two ordinary acquaintances sallying out to spend the evening together sir timothys rollsroyce limousine was in attendance and in a few minutes they were threading the purlieus of covent garden it was here that an incident occurred which afforded francis considerable food for thought during the next few days  it was a friday night and one or two waggons laden with vegetable produce were already threading their way through the difficult thoroughfares suddenly sir timothy who was looking out of the window pressed the button of the car which was at once brought to a standstill before the footman could reach the door sir timothy was out in the street for the first time francis saw him angry his eyes were blazing his voicefrancis had followed him at once into the streetshook with passion his hand had fallen heavily upon the shoulder of a huge carter who with whip in hand was belabouring a thin scarecrow of a horse  what the devil are you doing sir timothy demanded  the man stared at his questioner and the instinctive antagonism of race vibrated in his truculent reply the carter was a beeryfaced untidylooking brute but powerfully built and with huge shoulders sir timothy straight as a dart without overcoat or any covering to his thin evening clothes looked like a stripling in front of him  im whippin er if yer want to know was the carters reply ive got to get up the ill avent i garn and mind yer own business  this is my business sir timothy declared laying his hand upon the neck of the horse i am an official of the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals you are laying yourself open to a fine for your treatment of this poor brute  ill lay myself open for a fine for the treatment of something else if you dont quid old of my oss the carter retorted throwing his whip back into the waggon and coming a step nearer dyer ear i dont want any swells interferin with my business you op it is that strite enough op it quick  sir timothys anger seemed to have abated there was even the beginning of a smile upon his lips all the time his hand caressed the neck of the horse francis noticed with amazement that the poor brute had raised his head and seemed to be making some faint effort at reciprocation  my good man sir timothy said you seem to be one of those brutal persons unfit to be trusted with an animal however  the carter had heard quite enough sir timothys tone seemed to madden him he clenched his fist and rushed in  you take that for interferin you big toff he shouted  the result of the mans effort at pugilism was almost ridiculous his arms appeared to go round like windmills beating the air it really seemed as though he had rushed upon the point of sir timothys knuckles which had suddenly shot out like the piston of an engine the carter lay on his back for a moment then he staggered viciously to his feet  dont sir timothy begged as he saw signs of another attack i dont want to hurt you i have been amateur champion of two countries not quite fair is it  wot dyer want to come interferin with a chaps business for the man growled dabbing his cheek with a filthy handkerchief but keeping at a respectful distance  it happens to be my business also sir timothy replied to interfere whenever i see animals illtreated now i dont want to be unreasonable that animal has done all the work it ought to do in this world how much is she worth to you  through the mans beerclogged brain a gleam of cunning began to find its way he looked at the rollsroyce with the two motionless servants on the box at francis standing by at sir timothy even to his thick understanding the very prototype of a toff  that oss he said aint what she was its true but theres a lot of work in er yet she may not be much to look at but shes worth forty quid to meay and one to spit on  sir timothy counted out some notes from the pocketbook which he had produced and handed them to the man  here are fifty pounds he said the mare is mine johnson  the second man sprang from his seat and came round  unharness that mare his master ordered help the man push his trolley back out of the way then lead the animal to the mews in curzon street see that she is well bedded down and has a good feed of corn tomorrow i shall send her down to the country but i will come and have a look at her first  the man touched his hat and hastened to commence his task the carter who had been busy counting the notes thrust them into his pocket with a grin  good luck to yer guvnor he shouted out in valedictory fashion ope i meets yer again when ive an old crock on the go  sir timothy turned his head  if ever i happen to meet you my good man he threatened using your whip upon a poor beast whos doing his best i promise you you wont get up in two minutes or twenty we might walk the last few yards mr ledsam  the latter acquiesced at once and in a moment or two they were underneath the portico of the opera house sir timothy had begun to talk about the opera but francis was a little distrait his companion glanced at him curiously  you are puzzled mr ledsam he remarked  very was the prompt response  sir timothy smiled  you are one of these primitive anglosaxons he said who can see the simple things with big eyes but who are terribly worried at an unfamiliar constituent you have summed me up in your mind as a hardened brute a criminal by predilection a patron of murderers ergo you ask yourself why should i trouble to save a poor beast of a horse from being chastised and go out of my way to provide her with a safe asylum for the rest of her life shall i help you mr ledsam  i wish you would francis confessed  they had passed now through the entrance to the opera house and were in the corridor leading to the grand tier boxes on every side sir timothy had been received with marks of deep respect two bowing attendants were preceding them sir timothy leaned towards his companion  because he whispered i like animals better than human beings  margaret hilditch her chair pushed back into the recesses of the box scarcely turned her head at her fathers entrance  i have brought an acquaintance of yours margaret the latter announced as he hung up his hat you remember mr ledsam  francis drew a little breath of relief as he bowed over her hand for the second time her inordinate composure had been assailed she was her usual calm and indifferent self almost immediately but the gleam of surprise and he fancied not unpleasant surprise had been unmistakable  are you a devotee mr ledsam she asked  i am fond of music francis answered especially this opera  she motioned to the chair in the front of the box facing the stage  you must sit there she insisted i prefer always to remain here and my father always likes to face the audience i really believe she went on that he likes to catch the eye of the journalist who writes little gossipy items and to see his name in print  but you yourself francis ventured  i fancy that my reasons for preferring seclusion should be obvious enough she replied a little bitterly  my daughter is inclined i fear to be a little morbid sir timothy said settling down in his place  francis made no reply a triangular conversation of this sort was almost impossible the members of the orchestra were already climbing up to their places in preparation for the overture to the last act sir timothy rose to his feet  you will excuse me for a moment he begged i see a lady to whom i must pay my respects  francis drew a sigh of relief at his departure he turned at once to his companion  did you mind my coming he asked  mind it she repeated with almost insolent nonchalance why should it affect me in any way my fathers friends come and go i have no interest in any of them  but he protested i want you to be interested in me  she moved a little uneasily in her place her tone nevertheless remained icy  could you possibly manage to avoid personalities in your conversation mr ledsam she begged  i have tried already to tell you how i feel about such things  she was certainly difficult francis realised that with a little sigh  were you surprised to see me with your father he asked a little inanely  i cannot conceive what you two have found in common she admitted  perhaps our interest in you he replied bythebye i have just seen him perform a quixotic but a very fine action francis said he stopped a carter from thrashing his horse knocked him down bought the horse from him and sent it home  she was mildly interested  an amiable side of my fathers character which no one would suspect she remarked the entire park of his country house at hatch end is given over to brokendown animals  i am one of those he confessed who find this trait amazing  and i am another she remarked coolly if any one settled down seriously to try and understand my father he would need the spectacles of a de quincey the outlook of a voltaire and the callousness of a borgia you see he doesnt lend himself to any of the recognised standards  neither do you he said boldly  she looked away from him across the house to where sir timothy was talking to a man and woman in one of the groundfloor boxes francis recognised them with some surprisean agricultural duke and his daughter lady cynthia milton one of the most beautiful and famous young women in london  your father goes far afield for his friends francis remarked  my father has no friends she replied he has many acquaintances i doubt whether he has a single confidant i expect cynthia is trying to persuade him to invite her to his next party at the walled house  i should think she would fail wont she he asked  why should you think that  francis shrugged his shoulders slightly  your fathers entertainments have the reputation of being somewhat unique he remarked you do not bythebye attend them yourself  you must remember that i have had very few opportunities so far she observed besides cynthia has tastes which i do not share  as for instance  she goes to the national sporting club she once travelled i know over a hundred miles to go to a bull fight  on the whole francis said i am glad that you do not share her tastes  you know her margaret enquired  indifferently well francis replied i knew her when she was a child and we seem to come together every now and then at long intervals as a debutante she was charming lately it seems to me that she has got into the wrong set  what do you call the wrong set  he hesitated for a moment  please dont think that i am laying down the law he said i have been out so little the last few years that i ought not perhaps to criticise lady cynthia however seems to me to belong to the extreme section of the younger generation the section who have a sort of craze for the unusual whose taste in art and living is distorted and bizarre you know what i mean dont youblack drawingrooms futurist wallpapers opium dens and a cocaine box its to some extent affectation of course but its a folly that claims its victims  she studied him for a moment attentively his leanness was the leanness of muscular strength and condition his face was full of vigour and determination  you at least have escaped the abnormal she remarked i am not quite sure how the entertainments at the walled house would appeal to you but if my father should invite you there i should advise you not to go  why not he asked  she hesitated for a moment  i really dont know why i should trouble to give you advice she said as a matter of fact i dont care whether you go or not in any case you are scarcely likely to be asked  i am not sure that i agree with you he protested your father seems to have taken quite a fancy to me  and you she murmured  well i like the way he bought that horse francis admitted and i am beginning to realise that there may be something in the theory which he advanced when he invited me to accompany him here this eveningthat there is a certain piquancy in ones intercourse with an enemy which friendship lacks there may be complexities in his character which as yet i have not appreciated  the curtain had gone up and the last act of the opera had commenced she leaned back in her chair without a word or even a gesture he understood that a curtain had been let down between them he obeyed her unspoken wish and relapsed into silence her very absorption after all was a hopeful sign she would have him believe that she felt nothing that she was living outside all the passion and sentiment of life yet she was absorbed in the music sir timothy came back and seated himself silently it was not until the tumult of applause which broke out after the great song of the french ouvrier that a word passed between them  cavalisti is better sir timothy commented this man has not the breadth of passion at times he is merely peevish  she shook her head  cavalisti would be too egotistical for the part she said quietly it is difficult  not another word was spoken until the curtain fell francis lingered for a moment over the arrangement of her cloak sir timothy was already outside talking to some acquaintances  it has been a great pleasure to see you like this unexpectedly he said a little wistfully  i cannot imagine why she answered with an undernote of trouble in her tone remember the advice i gave you before no good can come of any friendship between my father and you  there is this much of good in it at any rate he answered as he held open the door for her it might give me the chance of seeing you sometimes  that is not a matter worth considering she replied  i find it very much worth considering he whispered losing his head for a moment as they stood close together in the dim light of the box and a sudden sense of the sweetness of her thrilled his pulses there isnt anything in the world i want so much as to see you oftenerto have my chance  there was a momentary glow in her eyes her lips quivered the few words which he saw framed therehe fancied of reproofremained unspoken sir timothy was waiting for them at the entrance  i have been asking mrs hilditchs permission to call in curzon street francis said boldly  i am sure my daughter will be delighted was the cold but courteous reply  margaret herself made no comment the car drew up and she stepped into ita tall slim figure wonderfully graceful in her unrelieved black her hair gleaming as though with some sort of burnish as she passed underneath the electric light she looked back at him with a smile of farewell as he stood bareheaded upon the steps a smile which reminded him somehow of her father a little sardonic a little tender having in it some faintly challenging quality the car rolled away people around were gossipingrather freely  the wife of that man oliver hilditch he heard a woman say the man who was tried for murder and committed suicide the night after his acquittal why that cant be much more than three months ago  if you are the daughter of a millionaire her escort observed you can defy convention  yes that was sir timothy brast another man was saying hes supposed to be worth a cool five millions  if the truth about him were known his companion confided dropping his voice it would cost him all that to keep out of the old bailey they say that his orgies at hatch endour taxi come on sharpe  francis strolled thoughtfully homewards    chapter xvi   francis ledsam was himself again the lightesthearted and most popular member of his club still a brilliant figure in the courts although his appearances there were less frequent still devoting the greater portion of his time to his profession although his work in connection with it had become less spectacular one morning at the corner of clarges street and curzon street about three weeks after his visit to the opera he came face to face with sir timothy brast  well my altruistic peerer into other peoples affairs how goes it the latter enquired pleasantly  how does it seem my archcriminal to be still breathing gods fresh air francis retorted in the same vein make the most of it it may not last for ever  sir timothy smiled he was looking exceedingly well that morning the very prototype of a man contented with life and his part in it he was wearing a morning coat and silk hat his patent boots were faultlessly polished his trousers pressed to perfection his grey silk tie neat and fashionable notwithstanding his waxenlike pallor his slim figure and lithe athletic walk seemed to speak of good health  you may catch the minnow he murmured the big fish swim on bythebye he added i do not notice that your sledgehammer blows at crime are having much effect two undetected murders last week and one the week before what are you about my astute friend  those are matters for scotland yard francis replied with an indifferent little wave of the hand which held his cigarette details are for the professional i seek that corner in hell where the thunders are welded and the poison gases mixed in other words i seek for the brains of crime  believe me we do not see enough of one another my young friend sir timothy said earnestly you interest me more and more every time we meet i like your allegories i like your confidence which in any one except a genius would seem blatant when can we dine together and talk about crime  the sooner the better francis replied promptly invite me and i will cancel any other engagement i might happen to have  sir timothy considered for a moment the june sunshine was streaming down upon them and the atmosphere was a little oppressive  will you dine with me at hatch end tonight he asked my daughter and i will be alone  i should be delighted francis replied promptly i ought to tell you perhaps that i have called three times upon your daughter but have not been fortunate enough to find her at home  sir timothy was politely apologetic  i fear that my daughter is a little inclined to be morbid he confessed society is good for her i will undertake that you are a welcome guest  at what time do i come and how shall i find your house francis enquired  you motor down i suppose sir timothy observed good in hatch end any one will direct you we dine at eight you had better come down as soon as you have finished your days work bring a suitcase and spend the night  i shall be delighted francis replied  do not sir timothy continued court disappointment by overanticipation you have without doubt heard of my little gatherings at hatch end they are viewed i am told with grave suspicion alike by the moralists of the city and i fear the police i am not inviting you to one of those gatherings they are for people with other tastes my daughter and i have been spending a few days alone in the little bungalow by the side of my larger house that is where you will find usthe sanctuary we call it  some day francis ventured i shall hope to be asked to one of your more notorious gatherings for the present occasion i much prefer the entertainment you offer  then we are both content sir timothy said smiling au revoir   francis walked across green park along the mall down horse guards parade along the embankment to his rooms on the fringe of the temple here he found his clerk awaiting his arrival in some disturbance of spirit  there is a young gentleman here to see you sir he announced mr reginald wilmore his name is i think  wilmore francis repeated what have you done with him  he is in your room sir he seems very impatient he has been out two or three times to know how long i thought you would be  francis passed down the stone passage and entered his room a large shady apartment at the back of the building to his surprise it was empty he was on the point of calling to his clerk when he saw that the writingpaper on his desk had been disturbed he went over and read a few lines written in a boys hasty writing  dear mr ledsam  i am in a very strange predicament and i have come to ask your advice you know my brother andrew well and you may remember playing tennis with me last year i am compelled  at that point the letter terminated abruptly there was a blot and a smudge the pen lay where it seemed to have rolledon the floor the ink was not yet dry francis called to his clerk  angrave he said mr wilmore is not here  the clerk looked around in obvious surprise  it isnt five minutes since he came out to my office sir he exclaimed i heard him go back again afterwards  francis shrugged his shoulders  perhaps he decided not to wait and you didnt hear him go by  angrave shook his head  i do not see how he could have left the place without my hearing him sir he declared the door of my office has been open all the time and i sit opposite to it besides on these stone floors one can hear any one so distinctly  then what francis asked has become of him  the clerk shook his head  i havent any idea sir he confessed  francis plunged into his work and forgot all about the matter he was reminded of it however at luncheontime when on entering the diningroom of the club he saw andrew wilmore seated alone at one of the small tables near the wall he went over to him at once  hullo andrew he greeted him what are you doing here by yourself  bit hipped old fellow was the depressed reply sit down will you  francis sat down and ordered his lunch  bythebye he said i had rather a mysterious visit this morning from your brother reggie  wilmore stared at him for a moment half in relief half in amazement  good god francis you dont say so he exclaimed how was he what did he want tell me about it at once weve been worried to death about the boy  well as a matter of fact i didnt see him francis explained he arrived before i reached my roomsas you know i dont live therewaited some time began to write me this notedrawing the sheet of paper from his pocketand when i got there had disappeared without leaving a message or anything  wilmore adjusted his pince nez with trembling fingers then he read the few lines through  francis he said when he had finished them do you know that this is the first word weve heard of him for three days  great heavens francis exclaimed he was living with his mother wasnt he  down at kensington but he hasnt been there since monday andrew replied his mother is in a terrible state and now this i dont understand it at all  was the boy hard up  not more than most young fellows are was the puzzled reply his allowance was due in a few days too he had money in the bank i feel sure he was saving up for a motorcar  havent i seen him once or twice at restaurants lately francis enquired sotos for instance  very likely his brother assented why not hes fond of dancing and we none of us ever encouraged him to be a stayathome  any particular girl was he interested in  not that we know of like most young fellows of his age he was rather keen on young women with some connection with the stage but i dont believe there was any one in particular reggie was too fond of games to waste much time that way hes at the gymnasium three evenings a week  i wish id been at the office a few minutes earlier this morning francis observed i tell you what andrew i have some pals down at scotland yard and ill go down and see them this afternoon theyll want a photograph and to ask a few questions i dare say but i shouldnt talk about the matter too much  youre very kind francis his friend replied but it isnt so easy to sit tight i was going to the police myself this afternoon  take my advice and leave it to me francis begged i have a particular pal down at scotland yard who i know will be interested and i want him to take up the case  you havent any theory i suppose wilmore asked a little wistfully  francis shook his head  not the ghost of one he admitted the reason i am advising you to keep as quiet as possible though is just this if you create a lot of interest in a disappearance you have to satisfy the public curiosity when the mystery is solved  i see wilmore murmured all the same i cant imagine reggie getting mixed up in anything discreditable  neither can i from what i remember of the boy francis agreed let me see what was he doing in the city  he was with jameson  scott the stockbrokers wilmore replied he was only learning the business and he had no responsibilities curiously enough though when i went to see mr jameson he pointed out one or two little matters that reggie had attended to which looked as though he were clearing up somehow or other  he left no message there i suppose  not a line or a word he gave the porter five shillings though on the afternoon before he disappeareda man who has done some odd jobs for him  well a voluntary disappearance is better than an involuntary one francis remarked what was his usual programme when he left the office  he either went to queens and played racquets or he went straight to his gymnasium in the holborn i telephoned to queens he didnt call there on the wednesday night anyhow  wheres the gymnasium  at 147 a holborn a lot of city young men go there late in the evening but reggie got off earlier than most of them and used to have the place pretty well to himself i think thats why he stuck to it  francis made a note of the address  ill get shopland to step down there some time he said or better still finish your lunch and well take a taxi there ourselves im going to the country later on but ive halfanhour to spare we can go without our coffee and be there in ten minutes  a great idea wilmore acquiesced its probably the last place reggie visited anyway     chapter xvii   the gymnasium itself was a source of immense surprise to both francis and wilmore it stretched along the entire top storey of a long block of buildings and was elaborately fitted with bathrooms a restaurant and a readingroom the trapezes bars and all the usual appointments were of the best possible quality the manager a powerfullooking man dressed with the precision of the prosperous city magnate came out of his office to greet them  what can i do for you gentlemen he enquired  first of all francis replied accept our heartiest congratulations upon your wonderful gymnasium  the man bowed  it is the best appointed in the country sir he said proudly absolutely no expense has been spared in fitting it up every one of our appliances is of the latest possible description and our bathrooms are an exact copy of those in a famous philadelphia club  what is the subscription wilmore asked  five shillings a year  and how many members  two thousand  the manager smiled as he saw his two visitors exchange puzzled glances  needless to say sir he added we are not selfsupporting we have very generous patrons  i lave heard my brother speak of this place as being quite wonderful wilmore remarked but i had no idea that it was upon this scale  is your brother a member the man asked  he is to tell you the truth we came here to ask you a question about him  what is his name  reginald wilmore he was here i think last wednesday night  while wilmore talked francis watched he was conscious of a curious change in the mans deportment at the mention of reginald wilmores name from being full of bumptious almost condescending goodnature his expression had changed into one of stony incivility there was something almost sinister in the tightlyclosed lips and the suspicious gleam in his eyes  what questions did you wish to ask he demanded  mr reginald wilmore has disappeared francis explained simply he came here on leaving the office last monday he has not been seen or heard of since  well the manager asked  we came to ask whether you happen to remember his being here on that evening and whether he gave any one here any indication of his future movements we thought perhaps that the instructor who was with him might have some information  not a chance was the uncompromising reply i remember mr wilmore being here perfectly he was doing double turns on the high bar i saw more of him myself than any one i was with him when he went down to have his swim  did he seem in his usual spirits wilmore ventured  i dont notice what spirits my pupils are in the man answered a little insolently there was nothing the matter with him so far as i know  he didnt say anything about going away  not a word youll excuse me gentlemen  one moment francis interrupted we came here ourselves sooner than send a detective enquiries are bound to be made as to the young mans disappearance and we have reason to know that this is the last place at which he was heard of it is not unreasonable therefore is it that we should come to you for information  reasonable or unreasonable i havent got any the man declared gruffly if mr wilmores cleared out hes cleared out for some reason of his own its not my business and i dont know anything about it  you understand francis persisted that our interest in young mr wilmore is entirely a friendly one  i dont care whether its friendly or unfriendly i tell you i dont know anything about him and he added pressing his thumb upon the button for the lift ill wish you two gentlemen good afternoon ive business to attend to  francis looked at him curiously  havent i seen you somewhere before he asked a little abruptly  i cant say my name is john maclane  heavyweight champion about seven years ago  i was the man acknowledged you may have seen me in the ring now gentlemen if you please  the lift had stopped opposite to them the managers gesture of dismissal was final  i am sorry mr maclane if we have annoyed you with our questions francis said i wish you could remember a little more of mr wilmores last visit  well i cant and thats all there is to it was the blunt reply as to being annoyed i am only annoyed when my times wasted take these gents down jim good afternoon  the door was slammed to and they shot downwards francis turned to the lift man  do you know a mr wilmore who comes here sometimes he asked  not likely the man scoffed theyre comin and goin all the time from four oclock in the afternoon till eleven at night if i heard a name i shouldnt remember it this way out gentlemen  wilmores hand was in his pocket but the man turned deliberately away they walked out into the street  for downright incivility the former observed commend me to the attendants of a young mens gymnasium  francis smiled  all the same old fellow he said if you worry for another five minutes about reggie youre an ass  at six oclock that evening francis turned his twoseater into a winding drive bordered with rhododendrons and pulled up before the porch of a charming twostoried bungalow covered with creepers and with frenchwindows opening from every room onto the lawns a manservant who had heard the approach of the car was already standing in the porch sir timothy in white flannels and a panama hat strolled across the lawn to greet his approaching guest  excellently timed my young friend he said you will have time for your first cocktail before you change my daughter you know of course lady cynthia milton i think you also know  francis shook hands with the two girls who were lying under the cedar tree margaret hilditch seemed to him more wonderful than ever in her white serge boating clothes lady cynthia who had apparently just arrived from some function in town was still wearing muslin and a large hat  i am always afraid that mr ledsam will have forgotten me she observed as she gave him her hand the last time i met you was at the old bailey when you had been cheating the gallows of a very respectable wife murderer poynings i think his name was  i remember it perfectly francis assented we danced together that night i remember at your aunts mrs malcolms and you were intensely curious to know how poynings had spent his evening  lady cynthias reminder is perhaps a little unfortunate sir timothy observed mr ledsam is no longer the last hope of the enterprising criminal he has turned over a new leaf to secure the services of his silver tongue you have to lay at his feet no longer the bags of gold from your illgotten gains but the white flower of the blameless life  this is all in the worst possible taste margaret hilditch declared in her cold expressionless tone you might consider my feelings  lady cynthia only laughed  my dear margaret she said if i thought that you had any i should never believe that you were your fathers daughter heres to them anyway she added accepting the cocktail from the tray which the butler had just brought out mr ledsam are you going to attach yourself to me or has margaret annexed you  i have offered myself to mrs hilditch francis rejoined promptly but so far i have made no impression  try her with a punt and a concertina after dinner lady cynthia suggested after all i came down here to better my acquaintance with my host you flirted with me disgracefully when i was a debutante and have never taken any notice of me since i hate infidelity in a man sir timothy i shall devote myself to you can you play a concertina  where the higher forms of music are concerned he replied i have no technical ability i should prefer to sit at your feet  while i punt i suppose  there are backwaters he suggested  lady cynthia sipped her cocktail appreciatively  i wonder how it is she observed that in these days although we have become callous to everything else in life cocktails and flirtations still attract us you shall take me to a backwater after dinner sir timothy i shall wear my silvergrey and take an armful of those black cushions from the drawingroom in that half light there is no telling what success i may not achieve  sir timothy sighed  alas he said before dinner is over you will probably have changed your mind  perhaps so she admitted but you must remember that mr ledsam is my only alternative and i am not at all sure that he likes me i am not sufficiently victorian for his taste  the dressingbell rang sir timothy passed his arm through francis  the sentimental side of my domain he said the others may show you my rose garden across the stream has been very much admired i am now going to give you a glimpse of the walled house an edifice the possession of which has made me more or less famous  he led the way through a little shrubbery across a further strip of garden and through a door in a high wall which he opened with a key attached to his watchchain they were in an open park now studded with magnificent trees in the further corner of which stood an imposing mansion with a great domed roof in the centre and broad stone terraces one of which led down to the river the house itself was an amazingly blended mixture of old and new with great wings supported by pillars thrown out on either side it seemed to have been built without regard to any definite period of architecture and yet to have attained a certain coherencya farreaching structure with long lines of outbuildings in the park itself were a score or more of horses and in the distance beyond a long line of loose boxes with open doors even as they stood there a grey sorrel mare had trotted up to their side and laid her head against sir timothys shoulder he caressed her surreptitiously affecting not to notice the approach of other animals from all quarters  let me introduce you to the walled house its owner observed so called i imagine because this wall which is a great deal older than you or i completely encloses the estate of course you remember the old house the walled palace they called it it belonged for many years to the lynton family and afterwards to the crown  i remember reading of your purchase francis said and of course i remember the old mansion you seem to have wiped it out pretty effectually  i was obliged to play the vandal his host confessed in its previous state the house was picturesque but uninhabitable as you see it now it is an exact reproduction of the country home of one of the lesser known of the borgiassodina i believe the ladys name was you will find inside some beautiful arches and a sense of space which all modern houses lack it cost me a great deal of money and it is inhabited when i am in europe about once a fortnight you know the river name for it timothys folly  but what on earth made you build it so long as you dont care to live there francis enquired  sir timothy smiled reflectively  well he explained i like sometimes to entertain and i like to entertain when i do on a grand scale in london if i give a party the invitations are almost automatic i become there a very insignificant link in the chain of what is known as society and society practically helps itself to my entertainment and sees that everything is done according to rule down here things are entirely different an invitation to the walled house is a personal matter society has nothing whatever to do with my functions here the receptionrooms too are arranged according to my own ideas i have as you may have heard the finest private gymnasium in england the ballroom and musicroom and private theatre too are famous  and do you mean to say that you keep that huge place empty francis asked curiously  i have a suite of rooms there which i occasionally occupy sir timothy replied and there are always thirty or forty servants and attendants of different sorts who have their quarters there i suppose that my daughter and i would be there at the present moment but for the fact that we own this cottage both she and i for residential purposes prefer the atmosphere there  i scarcely wonder at it francis agreed  they were surrounded now by various quadrupeds as well as the horses halfadozen of which were standing patiently by sir timothys side several dogs had made their appearance and after a little preliminary enthusiasm had settled down at his feet he leaned over and whispered something in the ear of the mare who had come first she trotted off and the others followed suit in a curious little procession sir timothy watched them keeping his head turned away from francis  you recognise the mare the third from the end he pointed out that is the animal i bought in covent garden you see how she has filled out  i should never have recognised her the other confessed  even nero had his weaknesses sir timothy remarked waving the dogs away my animals quarters are well worth a visit if you have time there is a small hospital too which is quite up to date  do any of the horses work at all francis asked  sir timothy smiled  i will tell you a very human thing about my favourites he said in the gardens on the other side of the house we have very extensive lawns and my head groom thought he would make use of one of a my horses who had recovered from a serious accident and was really quite a strong beast for one of the machines he found the idea quite a success and now he no sooner appears in the park with a halter than instead of stampeding practically every one of those horses comes cantering up with the true volunteering spirit the one which he selects arches his neck and goes off to work with a whole string of the others following dodsleythat is my grooms nametells me that he does a great deal more mowing now than he need simply because they worry him for the work gratitude you see mr ledsam sheer gratitude if you were to provide a dozen almshouses for your poor dependants i wonder how many of them would be anxious to mow your lawn come let me show you your room now  they passed back through the posterngate into the gardens of the sanctuary sir timothy led the way towards the house  i am glad that you decided to spend the night mr ledsam he said the river sounds a terribly hackneyed place to the londoner but it has beauties which only those who live with it can discover mind your head my ceilings are low  francis followed his host along many passages up and down stairs until he reached a little suite of rooms at the extreme end of the building the manservant who had unpacked his bag stood waiting sir timothy glanced around critically  small but compact he remarked there is a little sittingroom down that stair and a bathroom beyond if the flowers annoy you throw them out of the window and if you prefer to bathe in the river tomorrow morning brooks here will show you the diving pool i am wearing a short coat myself tonight but do as you please we dine at halfpast eight  sir timothy disappeared with a courteous little inclination of the head francis dismissed the manservant at once as being out of keeping with his quaint and fascinating surroundings the tiny room with its flowers its perfume of lavender its oldfashioned chintzes and its fragrant linen might still have been a room in a cottage the sittingroom with its veranda looking down upon the river was provided with cigars whisky and soda and cigarettes a bookcase with a rare copy of rabelais an original surtees a large paper decameron and a few other classics down another couple of steps was a perfectly white bathroom with shower and plunge francis wandered from room to room and finally threw himself into a chair on the veranda to smoke a cigarette from the river below him came now and then the sound of voices through the trees on his right he could catch a glimpse here and there of the strange pillars and green domed roof of the borghese villa     chapter xviii   it was one of those faultless june evenings when the only mission of the faintly stirring breeze seems to be to carry perfumes from garden to garden and to make the lightest of music amongst the rustling leaves the dinnertable had been set out of doors underneath the odorous cedartree above the sky was an arc of the deepest blue through which the web of stars had scarcely yet found its way every now and then came the sound of the splash of oars from the river more rarely still the murmur of light voices as a punt passed up the stream the little party at the sanctuary sat over their coffee and liqueurs long after the fall of the first twilight till the points of their cigarettes glowed like little specks of fire through the enveloping darkness conversation had been from the first curiously desultory edited in a way francis felt for his benefit there was an atmosphere about his host and lady cynthia shared in a negative way by margaret hilditch which baffled francis it seemed to establish more than a lack of sympathyto suggest even a life lived upon a different plane yet every now and then their references to everyday happenings were trite enough sir timothy had assailed the recent craze for drugs a diatribe to which lady cynthia had listened in silence for reasons which francis could surmise  if one must soothe the senses sir timothy declared for the purpose of forgetting a distasteful or painful present i cannot see why the average mind does not turn to the contemplation of beauty in some shape or other a night like tonight is surely sedative enough watch these lights drink in these perfumes listen to the fall and flow of the water long enough and you would arrive at precisely the same mental inertia as though you had taken a dose of cocaine with far less harmful an aftermath  lady cynthia shrugged her shoulders  cocaine is in ones dressingroom she objected and beauty is hard to seek in grosvenor square  the common mistake of all men sir timothy continued and women too for the matter of that is that we will persist in formulating doctrines for other people every man or woman is an entity of humanity with a separate heaven and a separate hell no two people can breathe the same air in the same way or see the same picture with the same eyes  lady cynthia rose to her feet and shook out the folds of her diaphanous gown daring alike in its shapelessness and scantiness she lit a cigarette and laid her hand upon sir timothys arm  come she said must i remind you of your promise you are to show me the stables at the walled house before it is dark  you would see them better in the morning he reminded her rising with some reluctance to his feet  perhaps she answered but i have a fancy to see them now  sir timothy looked back at the table  margaret he said will you look after mr ledsam for a little time you will excuse us ledsam we shall not be gone long  they moved away together towards the shrubbery and the door in the wall behind francis resumed his seat  are you not also curious to penetrate the mysteries behind the wall mr ledsam margaret asked  not so curious but that i would much prefer to remain here he answered  with me  with you  she knocked the ash from her cigarette she was looking directly at him and he fancied that there was a gleam of curiosity in her beautiful eyes there was certainly a little more abandon about her attitude she was leaning back in a corner of her highbacked chair and her gown although it lacked the daring of lady cynthias seemed to rest about her like a cloud of bluegrey smoke  what a curious meal she murmured can you solve a puzzle for me mr ledsam  i would do anything for you that i could he answered  tell me then why my father asked you here tonight i can understand his bringing you to the opera that was just a whim of the moment but an invitation down here savours of deliberation studiously polite though you are to one another one is conscious all the time of the hostility beneath the surface  i think that so far as your father is concerned it is part of his peculiar disposition francis replied you remember he once said that he was tired of entertaining his friendsthat there was more pleasure in having an enemy at the board  are you an enemy mr ledsam she asked curiously  he rose a little abruptly to his feet ignoring her question there were servants hovering in the background  will you walk with me in the gardens he begged or may i take you upon the river  she rose to her feet for a moment she seemed to hesitate  the river i think she decided will you wait for three minutes while i get a wrap you will find some punts moored to the landingstage there in the stream i like the very largest and most comfortable  francis strolled to the edge of the stream and made his choice of punts soon a servant appeared with his arms full of cushions and a moment or two later margaret herself wrapped in an ermine cloak she smiled a little deprecatingly as she picked her way across the lawn  dont laugh at me for being such a chilly mortal please she enjoined and dont be afraid that i am going to propose a long expedition i want to go to a little backwater in the next stream  she settled herself in the stern and they glided down the narrow thoroughfare the rose bushes from the garden almost lapped the water as they passed behind the long low cottage the deserted dinnertable the smooth lawn with its beds of scarlet geraniums and drooping lilac shrubs in the background seemed like a scene from fairyland to attain a perfection of detail unreal almost theatrical  to the right when you reach the river please she directed you will find there is scarcely any current we turn up the next stream  there was something almost mysterious a little impressive about the broad expanse of river into which they presently turned opposite were woods and then a sloping lawn from a house hidden in the distance they heard the sound of a woman singing they even caught the murmurs of applause as she concluded then there was silence only the soft gurgling of the water cloven by the punt pole they glided past the front of the great unlit house past another strip of woodland and then up a narrow stream  to the left here she directed and then stop  they bumped against the bank the little backwater into which they had turned seemed to terminate in a bed of lilies whose faint fragrance almost enveloped them the trees on either side made a little arch of darkness  please ship your pole and listen margaret said dreamily make yourself as comfortable as you can there are plenty of cushions behind you this is where i come for silence  francis obeyed her orders without remark for a few moments speech seemed impossible the darkness was so intense that although he was acutely conscious of her presence there only a few feet away nothing but the barest outline of her form was visible the silence which she had brought him to seek was all around them there was just the faintest splash of water from the spot where the stream and the river met the distant barking of a dog the occasional croaking of a frog from somewhere in the midst of the bed of lilies otherwise the silence and the darkness were like a shroud francis leaned forward in his place his hands which gripped the sides of the punt were hot the serenity of the night mocked him  so this is your paradise he said a little hoarsely  she made no answer her silence seemed to him more thrilling than words he leaned forward his hands fell upon the soft fur which encompassed her they rested there still she did not speak he tightened his grasp moved further forward the passion surging through his veins his breath almost failing him he was so near now that he heard her breathing saw her face as pale as ever her lips were a little parted her eyes looked out as it seemed to him half in fear half in hope he bent lower still she neither shrank away nor invited him  dear he whispered  her arms stole from underneath the cloak her fingers rested upon his shoulders he scarcely knew whether it was a caress or whether she were holding him from her in any case it was too late with a little sob of passion his lips were pressed to hers even as she closed her eyes the scent of the lilies seemed to intoxicate him  he was back in his place without conscious movement his pulses were quivering the passion singing in his blood the joy of her faint caress living proudly in his memory it had been the moment of his life and yet even now he felt sick at heart with fears with the torment of her passiveness she had lain there in his arms he had felt the thrill of her body some quaint inspiration had told him that she had sought for joy in that moment and had not wholly failed yet his anxiety was tumultuous overwhelming then she spoke and his heart leaped again her voice was more natural it was not a voice which he had ever heard before  give me a cigarette pleaseand i want to go back  he leaned over her again struck a match with trembling fingers and gave her the cigarette she smiled at him very faintly  please go back now she begged smoke yourself take me home slowly and say nothing  he obeyed but his knees were shaking when he stood up slowly a foot at a time they passed from the mesh of the lilies out into the broad stream almost as they did so the yellow rim of the moon came up over the low hills as they turned into their own stream the light was strong enough for him to see her face she lay there like a ghost her eyes half closed the only touch of colour in the shining strands of her beautiful hair she roused herself a little as they swung around he paused leaning upon the pole  you are not angry he asked  no i am not angry she answered why should i be but i cannot talk to you about it tonight  they glided to the edge of the landingstage a servant appeared and secured the punt  is sir timothy back yet margaret enquired  not yet madam  she turned to francis  please go and have a whisky and soda in the smokingroom she said pointing to the open french windows i am going to my favourite seat you will find me just across the bridge there  he hesitated filled with a passionate disinclination to leave her side even for a moment she seemed to understand but she pointed once more to the room  i should like very much she added to be alone for five minutes if you will come and find me thenplease  francis stepped through the french windows into the smokingroom where all the paraphernalia for satisfying thirst were set out upon the sideboard he helped himself to whisky and soda and drank it absently with his eyes fixed upon the clock in five minutes he stepped once more back into the gardens soft and brilliant now in the moonlight as he did so he heard the click of the gate in the wall and footsteps his host with lady cynthia upon his arm came into sight and crossed the lawn towards him francis filled though his mind was with other thoughts paused for a moment and glanced towards them curiously lady cynthia seemed for a moment to have lost all her weariness her eyes were very bright she walked with a new spring in her movements even her voice as she addressed francis seemed altered  sir timothy has been showing me some of the wonders of his villado you call it a villa or a palace she asked  it is certainly not a palace sir timothy protested and i fear that it has scarcely the atmosphere of a villa it is an attempt to combine certain ideas of my own with the requirements of modern entertainment come and have a drink with us ledsam  i have just had one francis replied mrs hilditch is in the rose garden and i am on my way to join her  he passed on and the two moved towards the open french windows he crossed the rustic bridge that led into the flower garden turned down the pergola and came to a sudden standstill before the seat which margaret had indicated it was empty but in the corner lay the longstalked lily which she had picked in the backwater he stood there for a moment transfixed there were other seats and chairs in the garden but he knew before he started his search that it was in vain she had gone the flower drooping a little now though the stalk was still wet with the moisture of the river seemed to him like her farewell     chapter xix   francis was surprised when he descended for breakfast the next morning to find the table laid for one only the butler who was waiting handed him the daily papers and wheeled the electric heater to his side  is no one else breakfasting francis asked  sir timothy and mrs hilditch are always served in their rooms sir her ladyship is taking her coffee upstairs  francis ate his breakfast glanced through the times lit a cigarette and went round to the garage for his car the butler met him as he drove up before the porch  sir timothy begs you to excuse him this morning sir he announced his secretary has arrived from town with a very large correspondence which they are now engaged upon  and mrs hilditch francis ventured  i have not seen her maid this morning sir the man replied but mrs hilditch never rises before midday sir timothy hopes that you slept well sir and would like you to sign the visitors book  francis signed his name mechanically and was turning away when lady cynthia called to him from the stairs she was dressed for travelling and followed by a maid carrying her dressingcase  will you take me up to town mr ledsam she asked  delighted he answered  their dressingcases were strapped together behind and lady cynthia sank into the cushions by his side they drove away from the house francis with a backward glance of regret the striped sunblinds had been lowered over all the windows thrushes and blackbirds were twittering on the lawn the air was sweet with the perfume of flowers a boatman was busy with the boats out beyond through the trees the river wound its placid way  quite a little paradise lady cynthia murmured  delightful her companion assented i suppose great wealth has its obligations but why any human being should rear such a structure as what he calls his borghese villa when he has a charming place like that to live in i cant imagine  her silence was significant almost purposeful she unwound the veil from her motoring turban took it off altogether and attached it to the cushions of the car with a hatpin  there she said leaning back you can now gaze upon a horrible example to the young women of today you can see the ravages which late hours innumerable cocktails a thirst for excitement a contempt of the simple pleasures of life have worked upon my once comely features i was quite goodlooking you know in the days you first knew me  you were the most beautiful debutante of your season he agreed  what do you think of me now she asked  she met his gaze without flinching her face was unnaturally thin with disfiguring hollows underneath her cheekbones her lips lacked colour even her eyes were lustreless her hair seemed to lack brilliancy only her silken eyebrows remained unimpaired and a certain charm of expression which nothing seemed able to destroy  you look tired he said  be honest my dear man she rejoined drily i am a physical wreck dependent upon cosmetics for the looks which i am still clever enough to palm off on the uninitiated  why dont you lead a quieter life he asked a month or so in the country would put you all right  she laughed a little hardly then for a moment she looked at him appraisingly  i was going to speak to you of nerves she said but how would you ever understand you look as though you had not a nerve in your body i cant think how you manage it living in london i suppose you do exercises and take care of what you eat and drink  i do nothing of the sort he assured her indignantly i eat and drink whatever i fancy i have always had a direct object in lifemy workand i believe that has kept me fit and well nerve troubles come as a rule i think from the underused brain  i must have been born with a butterfly disposition she said i am quite sure that mine come because i find it so hard to be amused i am sure i am most enterprising i try whatever comes along but nothing satisfies me  why not try being in love with one of these men whove been in love with you all their lives  she laughed bitterly  the men who have cared for me and have been worth caring about she said gave me up years ago i mocked at them when they were in earnest scoffed at sentiment and told them frankly that when i married it would only be to find a refuge for broader life the right sort wouldnt have anything to say to me after that and i do not blame them and here is the torture of it i cant stand the wrong sort near mephysically i mean mind i believe im attracted towards people with criminal tastes and propensities i believe that is what first led me towards sir timothy every taste i ever had in life seems to have become besmirched im all the time full of the craving to do horrible things but all the same i cant bear to be touched thats the torment of it i wonder if you can understand  i think i can he answered your trouble lies in having the wrong friends and in lack of selfdiscipline if you were my sister id take you away for a fortnight and put you on the road to being cured  then i wish i were your sister she sighed  dont think im unsympathetic he went on because im not wait till weve got into the main road here and ill try and explain  they were passing along a country lane so narrow that twigs from the hedges wreathed here and there in wild roses brushed almost against their cheeks on their left was the sound of a reapingmachine and the perfume of newmown hay the sun was growing stronger at every moment a transitory gleam of pleasure softened her face  it is ages since i smelt honeysuckle she confessed except in a perfumers shop i was wondering what it reminded me of  that he said as they turned out into the broad main road with its long vista of telegraph poles is because you have been neglecting the real for the sham flowers themselves for their artificially distilled perfume what i was going to try and put into words without sounding too priggish lady cynthia he went on is this it is just you people who are cursed with a restless brain who are in the most dangerous position nowadays the things which keep us healthy and normal physicallygames farces dinnerparties of young people fresh air and exerciseare the very things which after a time fail to satisfy the person with imagination you want more out of life always the something you dont understand the something beyond and so you keep on trying new things and for every new thing you try you drop an old one isnt it something like that  i suppose it is she admitted wearily  drugs take the place of wholesome wine he went on warming to his subject the hideous fascination of flirting with the uncouth or the impossible some way or another stimulates a passion which simple means have ceased to gratify you seek for the unusual in every wayin food in the substitution of absinthe for your harmless martini of cocaine for your stimulating champagne there is a horrible wave of all this sort of thing going on today in many places and i am afraid he concluded that a great many of our very nicest young women are caught up in it  guilty she confessed now cure me  i could point out the promised land but how could i lead you to it he answered  you dont like me well enough she sighed  i like you better than you believe he assured her slackening his speed a little we have met i suppose a dozen times in our lives i have danced with you here and there talked nonsense once i remember at a musical reception  i tried to flirt with you then she interrupted  he nodded  i was in the midst of a great case he said and everything that happened to me outside it was swept out of my mind day by day what i was going to say is that i have always liked you from the moment when your mother presented me to you at your first dance  i wish youd told me so she murmured  it wouldnt have made any difference he declared i wasnt in a position to think of a dukes daughter in those days i dont suppose i am now  try she begged hopefully  he smiled back at her the reawakening of her sense of humour was something  too late he regretted during the last month or so the thing has come to me which we all look forward to only i dont think fate has treated me kindly i have always loved normal ways and normal people and the woman i care for is different  tell me about her she insisted  you will be very surprised when i tell you her name he said it is margaret hilditch  she looked at him for a moment in blank astonishment  heavens she exclaimed oliver hilditchs wife  i cant help that he declared a little doggedly shes had a miserable time i know she was married to a scamp im not quite sure that her father isnt as bad a one those things dont make any difference  they wouldnt with you she said softly tell me did you say anything to her last night  i did he replied i began when we were out alone together she gave me no encouragement to speak of but at any rate she knows  lady cynthia leaned a little forward in her place  do you know where she is now  he was a little startled  down at the cottage i suppose the butler told me that she never rose before midday  then for once the butler was mistaken his companion told him margaret hilditch left at six oclock this morning i saw her in travelling clothes get into the car and drive away  she left the cottage this morning before us francis repeated amazed  i can assure you that she did lady cynthia insisted i never sleep amongst my other peculiarities she went on bitterly and i was lying on a couch by the side of the open window when the car came for her she stopped it at the bend of the avenueso that it shouldnt wake us up i suppose i saw her get in and drive away  francis was silent for several moments lady cynthia watched him curiously  at any rate she observed in whatever mood she went away this morning you have evidently succeeded in doing what i have never seen any one else dobreaking through her indifference i shouldnt have thought that anything short of an earthquake would have stirred margaret these days  these days he repeated quickly how long have you known her  we were at school together for a short time she told him it was while her father was in south america margaret was a very different person in those days  however was she induced to marry a person like oliver hilditch francis speculated  his companion shrugged her shoulders  who knows she answered indifferently are you going to drop me  wherever you like  take me on to grosvenor square if you will then she begged and deposit me at the ancestral mansion i am really rather annoyed about margaret she went on rearranging her veil i had begun to have hopes that you might have revived my taste for normal things  if i had had the slightest intimation he murmured  it would have made no difference she interrupted dolefully now i come to think of it the margaret whom i used to knowand there must be plenty of her left yetis just the right type of woman for you  they drew up outside the house in grosvenor square lady cynthia held out her hand  come and see me one afternoon will you she invited  id like to very much he replied  she lingered on the steps and waved her hand to hima graceful somewhat insolent gesture  all the same i think i shall do my best to make you forget margaret she called out thanks for the lift up a bientot     chapter xx   francis drove direct from grosvenor square to his chambers in the temple and found shopland his friend from scotland yard awaiting his arrival  any news francis enquired  nothing definite i am sorry to say was the others reluctant admission  francis hung up his hat threw himself into his easychair and lit a cigarette  the lads brother is one of my oldest friends shopland he said he is naturally in a state of great distress  the detective scratched his chin thoughtfully  i said nothing definite just now sir he observed as a rule i never mention suspicions but with you it is a different matter i havent discovered the slightest trace of mr reginald wilmore or the slightest reason for his disappearance he seems to have been a wellconducted young gentleman a little extravagant perhaps but able to pay his way and with nothing whatever against him nothing whatever that is to say except one almost insignificant thing  and that  a slight tendency towards bad company sir i have heard of his being about with one or two whom we are keeping our eye upon  bobby fairfaxs lot by any chance  shopland nodded  he was with jacks and miss daisy hyslop a night or two before he disappeared i am not sure that a young man named morse wasnt of the party too  what do you make of that lot francis asked curiously are they gamesters dope fiends or simply vicious  the detective was silent he was gazing intently at his rather squaretoed shoes  there are rumours sir he said presently of things going on in the west end which want looking into very badlyvery badly indeed you will remember speaking to me of sir timothy brast  i remember quite well francis acknowledged  ive nothing to go on the other continued i am working almost on your own lines mr ledsam groping in the dark to find a clue as it were but im beginning to have ideas about sir timothy brast just ideas  as for instance  well he stands on rather queer terms with some of his acquaintances sir now you saw down at sotos bar the night we arrested mr fairfax that not one of those young men there spoke to sir timothy as though they were acquainted nor he to them yet i happened to find out that every one of them including mr fairfax himself was present at a party sir timothy brast gave at his house down the river a week or two before  im afraid there isnt much in that francis declared sir timothy has the name of being an eccentric person everywhere especially in this respecthe never notices acquaintances i heard only the other day that while he was wonderfully hospitable and charming to all his guests he never remembered them outside his house  shopland nodded  a convenient eccentricity he remarked a little drily i have heard the same thing myself you spent the night at his country cottage did you not mr ledsam did he offer to show you over the walled house  how the dickens did you know i was down there francis demanded with some surprise i was just thinking as i drove up that i hadnt left my address either here or at clarges street  next time you visit sir timothy the detective observed i should advise you to do so i knew you were there mr ledsam because i was in the neighbourhood myself i have been doing a little fishing and keeping my eye on that wonderful estate of sir timothys  francis was interested  shopland he said i believe that our intelligences such as they are are akin  what do you suspect sir timothy of the detective asked bluntly  i suspect him of nothing francis replied he is simply to my mind an incomprehensible somewhat sinister figure who might be capable of anything he may have very excellent qualities which he contrives to conceal or he may be an archcriminal his personality absolutely puzzles me  there was a knock at the door and angrave appeared apparently he had forgotten shoplands presence for he ushered in another visitor  sir timothy brast to see you sir he announced  the moment was one of trial to every one admirably borne shopland remained in his chair with only a casual glance at the newcomer francis rose to his feet with a halfstifled expression of anger at the clumsiness of his clerk sir timothy wellshaven and groomed attired in a perfectlyfitting suit of grey flannel nodded to francis in friendly fashion and laid his homburg hat upon the table with the air of a familiar  my dear ledsam he said i do hope that you will excuse this early call i could only have been an hour behind you on the road i dare say you can guess what i have come to see you about can we have a word together  certainly was the ready reply you remember my friend shopland sir timothy it was mr shopland who arrested young fairfax that night at sotos  i remember him perfectly sir timothy declared i fancied directly i entered that your face was familiar he added turning to shopland i am rather ashamed of myself about that night my little outburst must have sounded almost ridiculous to you two to tell you the truth i quite failed at that time to give mr ledsam credit for gifts which i have since discovered him to possess  mr shopland and i are now discussing another matter francis went on pushing a box of cigarettes towards sir timothy who was leaning against the table in an easy attitude dont go shopland for a minute we were consulting together about the disappearance of a young man reggie wilmore the brother of a friend of mineandrew wilmore the novelist  disappearance sir timothy repeated as he lit a cigarette that is rather a vague term  the young man has been missing from home for over a week francis said and left no trace whatever of his whereabouts he was not in financial trouble he does not seem to have been entangled with any young woman he had not quarrelled with his people and he seems to have been on the best of terms with the principal at the house of business where he was employed his disappearance therefore is to say the least of it mysterious  sir timothy assented gravely  the lack of motive to which you allude he pointed out makes the case interesting still one must remember that london is certainly the city of modern mysteries if a new arabian nights were written it might well be about london i dare say mr shopland will agree with me he continued turning courteously towards the detective that disappearances of this sort are not nearly so uncommon as the uninitiated would believe for one that is reported in the papers there are halfadozen which are not your late chief commissioner bythebye he added meditatively once a very intimate friend of mine was my informant  where do you suppose they disappear to francis enquired  who can tell was the speculative reply for an adventurous youth there are a thousand doors which lead to romance besides the lives of none of us are quite so simple as they seem even youth has its secret chapters this young man for instance might be on his way to australia happy in the knowledge that he has escaped from some murky chapter of life which will now never be known he may write to his friends giving them a hint the whole thing will blow over  there may be cases such as you suggest sir timothy the detective said quietly our investigations so far as regards the young man in question however do not point that way  sir timothy turned over his cigarette to look at the name of the maker  excellent tobacco he murmured bythebye what did you say the young mans name was  reginald wilmore francis told him  a good name sir timothy murmured i am sure i wish you both every good fortune in your quest would it be too much to ask you now mr ledsam for that single minute alone  by no means francis answered  ill wait in the office if i may shopland suggested rising to his feet i want to have another word with you before i go  my business with mr ledsam is of a family nature sir timothy said apologetically as shopland passed out i will not keep him for more than a moment  shopland closed the door behind him sir timothy waited until he heard his departing footsteps then he turned back to francis  mr ledsam he said i have come to ask you if you know anything of my daughters whereabouts  nothing whatever francis replied i was on the point of ringing you up to ask you the same question  did she tell you that she was leaving the sanctuary  she gave me not the slightest intimation of it francis assured his questioner in fact she invited me to meet her in the rose garden last night when i arrived there she was gone i have heard nothing from her since  you spent the evening with her  to my great content  what happened between you  nothing happened i took the opportunity however of letting your daughter understand the nature of my feelings for her  dear me may i ask what they are  i will translate them into facts francis replied i wish your daughter to become my wife  you amaze me sir timothy exclaimed with the old mocking smile at his lips how can you possibly contemplate association with the daughter of a man whom you suspect and distrust as you do me  if i suspect and distrust you it is your own fault francis reminded him you have declared yourself to be a criminal and a friend of criminals i am inclined to believe that you have spoken the truth i care for that fact just as little as i care for the fact that you are a millionaire or that margaret has been married to a murderer i intend her to become my wife  did you encourage her to leave me  i did not i had not the slightest idea that she had left the sanctuary until lady cynthia told me halfway to london this morning  sir timothy was silent for several moments  have you any idea in your own mind he persisted as to where she has gone and for what purpose  not the slightest in the world francis declared i am just as anxious to hear from her and to know where she is as you seem to be  sir timothy sighed  i am disappointed he admitted i had hoped to obtain some information from you i must try in another direction  since you are here sir timothy francis said as his visitor prepared to depart may i ask whether you have any objection to my marrying your daughter  sir timothy frowned  the question places me in a somewhat difficult position he replied coldly in a certain sense i have a liking for you you are not quite the ingenuous nincompoop i took you for on the night of our first meeting on the other hand you have prejudices against me my harmless confession of sympathy with criminals and their ways seems to have stirred up a cloud of suspicion in your mind you even employ a detective to show the world what a fool he can look sitting in a punt attempting to fish with one eye on the supposed abode of crime  i have nothing whatever to do with the details of shoplands investigations francis protested he is in search of reggie wilmore  does he think i have secret dungeons in my new abode sir timothy demanded or oubliettes in which i keep and starve brainless youths for some nameless purpose be reasonable mr ledsam what the devil benefit could accrue to me from abducting or imprisoning or in any way laying my criminal hand upon this young man  none whatever that we have been able to discover as yet francis admitted  a leaning towards melodrama admirable in its way needs the leaven of a wellbalanced discretion and a sense of humour sir timothy observed the latter quality is as a rule singularly absent amongst the myrmidons of scotland yard i do not think that mr shopland will catch even fish in the neighbourhood of the walled house as regards your matrimonial proposal let us waive that until my daughter returns  as you will francis agreed i will be frank to this extent at any rate if i can persuade your daughter to marry me your consent will not affect the matter  i can leave margaret a matter of two million pounds sir timothy said pensively  i have enough money to support my wife myself francis observed  utopian but foolish sir timothy declared all the same mr ledsam let me tell you this you have a curious attraction for me when i was asked why i had invited you to the sanctuary last night i frankly could not answer the question i didnt know i dont know your dislike of me doesnt seem to affect the question i was glad to have you there last night it pleases me to hear you talk to hear your views of things i feel that i shall have to be very careful mr ledsam or  or what francis demanded  or i shall even welcome the idea of having you for a soninlaw sir timothy concluded reluctantly make my excuses to mr shopland au revoir  shopland came in as the door closed behind the departing visitor he listened to all that francis had to say without comment  if the walled house he said at last is so carefully guarded that sir timothy has been informed of my watching the place and has been made aware of my mild questionings it must be because there is something to conceal i may or may not be on the track of mr reginald wilmore but the detective concluded of one thing i am becoming convincedthe walled house will pay for watching     chapter xxi   it was a day when chance was kind to francis after leaving his rooms at the temple he made a call at one of the great clubs in pall mall to enquire as to the whereabouts of a friend on his way back towards the sheridan he came face to face with margaret hilditch issuing from the doors of one of the great steamship companies for a moment he almost failed to recognise her she reminded him more of the woman of the teashop her costume neat and correct though it was was studiously unobtrusive her motoring veil too was obviously worn to assist her in escaping notice  she too came to a standstill at seeing him her first ejaculations betrayed a surprise which bordered on consternation then francis with a sudden inspiration pointed to the long envelope which she was carrying in her hand  you have been to book a passage somewhere he exclaimed  well  the monosyllable was in her usual level tone nevertheless he could see that she was shaken  you were going away without seeing me again he asked reproachfully  yes she admitted  why  she looked up and down a little helplessly  i owe you no explanation for my conduct she said please let me pass  could we talk for a few minutes please he begged tell me where you were going  oh back to lunch i suppose she answered  your father has been up looking for you he told her  i telephoned to the sanctuary she replied he had just left  i am very anxious he continued not to distress you but i cannot let you go away like this will you come to my rooms and let us talk for a little time  she made no answer somehow he realised that speech just then was difficult he called a taxi and handed her in they drove to clarges street in silence he led the way up the stairs gave some quick orders to his servant whom he met coming down ushered her into his sittingroom and saw her ensconced in an easychair  please take off that terrible veil he begged  it is pinned on to my hat she told him  then off with both he insisted you cant eat luncheon like that im not going to try and bully you if youve booked your passage to timbuctoo and you really want to gowhy you must i only want the chance of letting you know that i am coming after you  she took off her hat and veil and threw them on to the sofa glancing sideways at a mirror let into the door of a cabinet  my hair is awful she declared  he laughed gaily and turned around from the sideboard where he was busy mixing cocktails  thank heavens for that touch of humanity he exclaimed a woman who can bother about her hair when she takes her hat off is never past praying for please drink this  she obeyed he took the empty glass away from her then he came over to the hearthrug by her side  do you know that i kissed you last night he reminded her  i do she answered that is why i have just paid eightyfour pounds for a passage to buenos ayres  i should have enjoyed the trip he said still im glad i havent to go  do you really mean that you would have come after me she asked curiously  of course i should he assured her believe me there isnt such an obstinate person in the world as the man of early middleage who suddenly discovers the woman he means to marry  but you cant marry me she protested  why not he asked  because i was oliver hilditchs wife for one thing  look here he said if you had been beelzebubs wife it wouldnt make the least difference to me you havent given me much of a chance to tell you so yet margaret but i love you  she sat a little forward in her chair her eyes were fixed upon his wonderingly  but how can you she exclaimed you know nothing of me except my associations and they have been horrible what is there to love in me i am a frozenup woman everything is dead here she went on clasping her hand to her heart i have no sentiment no passion nothing but an animal desire to live my life luxuriously and quickly  he smiled confidently then with very little warning he sank on one knee drew her face to his kissed her lips and then her eyes  are you so sure of all these things margaret he whispered dont you think it is perhaps because there has been no one to care for you as i doas i shallto the end of my days the lily you left on your chair last night was like youfair and stately and beautiful but a little bruised you will come back as it has done come back to the world my love will bring you my care believe it please  then he saw the first signs of change in her face there was the faintest shade of almost shelllike pink underneath the creamywhite of her cheeks her lips were trembling a little her eyes were misty with a sudden passionate little impulse her arms were around his neck her lips sought his of their own accord  let me forget she sobbed kiss me let me forget  francis servant was both heavyfooted and discreet when he entered the room with a tray his master was standing at the sideboard  ive done the best i could sir he announced a little apologetically shall i lay the cloth  leave everything on the tray brooks francis directed we will help ourselves in an hours time bring coffee  the man glanced around the room  there are glasses on the sideboard sir and the corkscrew is here i think you will have everything you want  he departed closing the door behind him francis held out his hands to margaret she rose slowly to her feet looked in the glass helplessly and then back at him she was very beautiful but a little dazed  are we going to have luncheon she asked  of course he answered did you think i meant to starve you  he picked up the long envelope which she had dropped upon the carpet and threw it on to the sofa then he drew up two chairs to the table and opened a small bottle of champagne  i hope you wont mind a picnic he said really brooks hasnt done so badlypate de foie gras hot toast and devonshire butter let me spread some for you a cold chicken afterwards and some strawberries please be hungry margaret  she laughed at him it occurred to him suddenly with a little pang that he had never heard her laugh before it was like music  im too happy she murmured  believe me he assured her as he buttered a piece of toast happiness and hunger might well be twins they go so well together misery can take away ones appetite happiness when one gets over the gulpiness of it is the best tonic in the world and i never saw any one dear with whom happiness agreed so well he added pausing in his task to bend over and kiss her do you know you are the most beautiful thing on earth it is a lucky thing we are going to live in england and that these are sober matteroffact days or i should find myself committed to fighting duels all the time  she had a momentary relapse a look of terror suddenly altered her face she caught at his wrist  dont she cried dont talk about such things  he was a little bewildered the moment passed she laughed almost apologetically  forgive me she begged but i hate the thought of fighting of any sort some day ill explain  clumsy ass i was he declared completing his task and setting the result before her now hows that for a first course drink a little of your wine  he leaned his glass against hers  my love he whispered my love now dear and always and youll find it quite strong enough he went on to keep you from all the ugly things and now away with sentiment i had a very excellent but solitary breakfast this morning and it seems a long time ago  it seems amazing to think that you spent last night at the sanctuary she reflected  and that you and i were in a punt he reminded her in the pool of darkness where the trees met and the lilies leaned over to us  and you nearly upset the punt  nothing of the sort as a matter of fact i was very careful but he proceeded with a sudden wave of memory i dont think my heart will ever beat normally again it seemed as though it would tear its way out of my side when i leaned towards you and you knew and you lay still  she laughed  you surely didnt expect i was going to get up it was quite encouragement enough to remain passive as a matter of fact she went on i couldnt have moved i couldnt have uttered a sound i suppose i must have been like one of those poor birds you read about when some devouring animal crouches for its last spring  compliments already he remarked you wont forget that my name is francis will you try and practise it while i carve the chicken  you carve very badly francis she told him demurely  my dear he said thank heavens we shall be able to afford a butler bythebye i told your father this morning that i was going to marry you and he didnt seem to think it possible because he had two million pounds  braggart she murmured when did you see my father  he came to my rooms in the temple soon after i arrived this morning he seemed to think i might know where you were i dare say he wont like me for a soninlaw francis continued with a smile i cant help that he shouldnt have let me go out with you in a punt  there was a discreet knock at the door brooks made his apologetic and somewhat troubled entrance  sir timothy brast is here to see you sir he announced i ventured to say that you were not at home  but i happened to know otherwise a still voice remarked from outside may i come in mr ledsam  sir timothy stepped past the servant who at a sign from francis disappeared closing the door behind him     chapter xxii   after his first glance at sir timothy francis only thought was for margaret to his intense relief she showed no signs whatever of terror or of any relapse to her former state she was entirely mistress of herself and the occasion sir timothys face was cold and terrible  i must apologise for this second intrusion mr ledsam he said cuttingly i think you will admit that the circumstances warrant it am i to understand that you lied to me this morning  you are to understand nothing of the sort francis answered i told you everything i knew at that time of your daughters movements  indeed sir timothy murmured this little banquet then was unpremeditated  entirely francis replied here is the exact truth so far as i am concerned i met your daughter little more than an hour ago coming out of a steamship office where she had booked a passage to buenos ayres to get away from me i was fortunate enough to induce her to change her mind she has consented instead to remain in england as my wife we were as you see celebrating the occasion  sir timothy laid his hat upon the sideboard and slowly removed his gloves  i trust he said that this pint bottle does not represent your cellar i will drink a glass of wine with you and with your permission make myself a pate sandwich i was just sitting down to luncheon when i received the information which brought me here  francis produced another bottle of wine from the sideboard and filled his visitors glass  you will drink i hope to our happiness he said  i shall do nothing of the sort sir timothy declared helping himself with care to the pate i have no superstitions about breaking bread with an enemy or i should not have asked you to visit me at the sanctuary mr ledsam i object to your marriage with my daughter and i shall take what steps i can to prevent it  why  sir timothy did not at once reply he seemed to be enjoying his sandwich he also appreciated the flavour of his wine  your question he said strikes me as being a little ingenuous you are at the present moment suspecting me of crimes beyond number you encourage scotland yard detectives to make asses of themselves in my stream your myrmidons scramble on to the top of my walls and try to bribe my servants to disclose the mysteries of my household you have accepted to the fullest extent my volunteered statement that i am a patron of crime you are in shortforgive me if i help myself to a little more of this pateengaged in a strenuous attempt to bring me to justice  none of these things affects your daughter francis pointed out  pardon me sir timothy objected you are a great and shining light of the english law people speak of you as a future chancellor how can you contemplate an alliance with the widow of one criminal and the daughter of another  as to margaret being oliver hilditchs widow francis replied you were responsible for that and no one else he was your protege you gave your consent to the marriage as to your being her father that again is not margarets fault i should marry her if oliver hilditch had been three times the villain he was and if you were the devil himself  i am getting quite to like you mr ledsam sir timothy declared helping himself to another piece of toast and commencing to butter it margaret what have you to say about all this  i have nothing to say she answered francis is speaking for me i never dreamed that after what i have gone through i should be able to care for any one again in this world i do care and i am very happy about it all last night i lay awake making up my mind to run away and this morning i actually booked my passage to buenos ayres then we metjust outside the steamship officeand i knew at once that i was making a mistake i shall marry francis exactly when he wants me to  sir timothy passed his glass towards his proposed soninlaw  might one suggest he beganthank you very much this is of course very upsetting to me i seem to be set completely at defiance it is a very excellent wine this and a wonderful vintage  francis bent over margaret  please finish your lunch dear he begged it is perhaps just as well that your father came we shall know exactly where we are  just so sir timothy agreed  there was a queer constrained silence for several moments then sir timothy leaned back in his chair and with a word of apology lit a cigarette  let us he said consider the situation margaret is my daughter you wish to marry her margaret is of age and has been married before she is at liberty therefore to make her own choice you agree with me so far  entirely francis assented  it happens sir timothy went on that i disapprove of her choice she desires to marry a young man who belongs to a profession which i detest and whose efforts in life are directed towards the extermination of a class of people for whom i have every sympathy to me he represents the smug as against the human the artificially moral as against the freethinker he is also my personal enemy i am therefore naturally desirous that my daughter should not marry this young man  we will let it go at that francis commented but i should like to point out to you that the antagonism between us is in no way personal you have declared yourself for forces with which i am at enmity like any other decentliving citizen your declaration might at any time be amended  sir timothy bowed  the situation is stated he said i will ask you this question as a matter of form do you recognise my right to forbid your marriage with my daughter mr ledsam  i most certainly do not was the forcible reply  have i any rights at all sir timothy asked margaret has lived under my roof whenever it has suited her to do so since she has taken up her residence at curzon street she has been her own mistress her banking account has known no limit whatsoever i may be a person of evil disposition but i have shown no unkindness to her  it is quite true margaret admitted turning a little pale since i have been alone you have been kindness itself  then let me repeat my question sir timothy went on have i the right to any consideration at all  yes francis replied short of keeping us apart you have the ordinary rights of a parent  then i ask you to delay the announcement of your engagement or taking any further steps concerning it for fourteen days sir timothy said i place no restrictions on your movements during that time such hospitality as you mr ledsam care to accept at my hands is at your disposal i am bohemian enough indeed to find nothing to complain of in such little celebrations as you are at present indulging inmost excellent pate that but i request that no announcement of your engagement be made or any further arrangements made concerning it for that fourteen days  i am quite willing father margaret acquiesced  and i sir francis echoed  in which case sir timothy concluded rising to his feet lighting a cigarette and taking up his hat and gloves i shall go peaceably away you will admit i trust he added with that peculiar smile at the corner of his lips that i have not in any way tried to come the heavy father i can even command a certain amount of respect margaret for a young man who is able to inaugurate his engagement by an impromptu meal of such perfection i wish you both good morning any invitation which margaret extends ledsam please consider as confirmed by me  he closed the door softly they heard his footsteps descending the stairs francis leaned once more over margaret she seemed still dazed confused with new thoughts she responded however readily to his touch yielded to his caress with an almost pathetic eagerness  francis she murmured as his arms closed around her i want to forget     chapter xxiii   there followed a brief period of time the most wonderful of his life the happiest of hers they took advantage of sir timothys absolute license and spent long days at the sanctuary ideal lovers days with their punt moored at night amongst the lilies where her kisses seemed to come to him with an aroma and wonder born of the spot then there came a morning when he found a cloud on her face she was looking at the great wall and away at the minaret beyond they had heard from the butler that sir timothy had spent the night at the villa and that preparations were on hand for another of his wonderful parties francis who was swift to read her thoughts led her away into the rose garden where once she had failed him  you have been looking over the wall margaret he said reproachfully  she looked at him with a little twitch at the corners of her lips  francis dear she confessed i am afraid you are right i cannot even look towards the walled house without wondering why it was builtor catch a glimpse of that dome without stupid guesses as to what may go on underneath  i think very likely he said soothingly we have both exaggerated the seriousness of your fathers hobbies we know that he has a wonderful gymnasium there but the only definite rumour i have ever heard about the place is that men fight there who have a grudge against one another and that they are not too particular about the weight of the gloves that doesnt appeal to us you know margaret but it isnt criminal  if that were all she murmured  i dare say it is he declared london as you know is a hotbed of gossip everything that goes on is ridiculously exaggerated and i think that it rather appeals to your fathers curious sense of humour to pose as the lawbreaker  she pressed his arm a little the day was overcast a slight rain was beginning to fall  francis she whispered we had a perfect day here yesterday now the sun has gone and i am shivery  he understood in a moment  well lunch at ranelagh he suggested it is almost on the way up then we can see what the weather is like if it is bad we can dine in town tonight and do a theatre  you are a dear she told him fervently i am going in to get ready  francis went round to the garage for his car and brought it to the front while he was sitting there sir timothy came through the door in the wall he was smoking a cigar and he was holding an umbrella to protect his white flannel suit he was as usual wonderfully groomed and turned out but he walked as though he were tired and his smile as he greeted francis lacked a little of its usual lighthearted mockery  are you going up to town he enquired  francis pointed to the grey skies  just for the day he answered lady cynthia went by the early train we missed you last night  i came down late sir timothy explained and i found it more convenient to stay at the walled house i hope you find that grover looks after you while i am away he has carte blanche so far as regards my cellar  we have been wonderfully served francis assured him  in the distance they could hear the sound of hammering on the other side of the wall francis moved his head in that direction  i hear that they are preparing for another of your wonderful entertainments over there he remarked  on thursday sir timothy assented i shall have something to say to you about it later on  am i to take it that i am likely to receive an invitation francis asked  i should think it possible was the calm reply  what about margaret  my entertainment would not appeal to her sir timothy declared the women whom i have been in the habit of asking are not women of margarets type  and lady cynthia  sir timothy frowned slightly  i find myself in some difficulty as regards lady cynthia he admitted i am the guardian of nobodys morals nor am i the censor of their tastes but my entertainments are for men the women whom i have hitherto asked have been women in whom i have taken no personal interest they are necessary to form a picturesque background for my rooms in the same way that i look to the gardeners to supply the floral decorations lady cynthias instincts however are somewhat adventurous she would scarcely be content to remain a decoration  the issuing of your invitations francis remarked is of course a matter which concerns nobody else except yourself if you do decide to favour me with one i shall be delighted to come provided margaret has no objection  such a reservation promises well for the future sir timothy observed with gentle sarcasm here comes margaret looking very well i am glad to see  margaret came forward to greet her father before stepping into the car they exchanged only a few sentences but francis whose interest in their relations was almost abnormally keen fancied that he could detect signs of some change in their demeanour towards one another the cold propriety of deportment which had characterised her former attitude towards her father seemed to have given place to something more uncertain to something less formal something which left room even for a measure of cordiality she looked at him differently it was as though some evil thought which lived in her heart concerning him had perished  you are busy over there father she asked  in a way he replied we are preparing for some festivities on thursday  her face fell  another party  one more he replied perhaps the lastfor the present at any rate  she waited as though expecting him to explain he changed the subject however  i think you are wise to run up to town this morning he said glancing up at the grey skies bythebye if you dine at curzon street tonight do ask hedges to serve you some of the 99 cliquot a marvellous wine as you doubtless know ledsam but it should be drunk au revoir   francis after a pleasant lunch at ranelagh and having arranged with margaret to dine with her in curzon street spent an hour or two that afternoon at his chambers as he was leaving just before five he came face to face with shopland descending from a taxi  are you busy mr ledsam the latter enquired can you spare me halfanhour  an hour if you like francis assented  shopland gave the driver an address and the two men seated themselves in the taxicab  any news francis asked curiously  not yet was the cautious reply it will not be long however  before you discover reggie wilmore  the detective smiled in a superior way  i am no longer particularly interested in mr reginald wilmore he declared i have come to the conclusion that his disappearance is not a serious affair  its serious enough for his relatives francis objected  not if they understood the situation the detective rejoined assure them from me that nothing of consequence has happened to that young man i have made enquiries at the gymnasium in holborn and in other directions i am convinced that his absence from home is voluntary and that there is no cause for alarm as to his welfare  then the sooner you make your way down to kensington and tell his mother so the better francis said a little severely dont forget that i put you on to this  quite right sir the detective acquiesced and i am grateful to you the fact of it is that in making my preliminary investigations with regard to the disappearance of mr wilmore i have stumbled upon a bigger thing before many weeks are past i hope to be able to unearth one of the greatest scandals of modern times  the devil francis muttered  he looked thoughtfully almost anxiously at his companion shoplands face reflected to the full his usual confidence he had the air of a man buoyant with hope and with stifled selfsatisfaction  i am engaged he continued upon a study of the methods and habits of one whom i believe to be a great criminal i think that when i place my prisoner in the bar wainwright and these other great artists in crime will fade from the memory  is sir timothy brast your man francis asked quietly  his companion frowned portentously  no names he begged  considering that it was i who first put you on to him francis expostulated i dont think you need be so sparing of your confidence  mr ledsam the detective assured him i shall tell you everything that is possible at the same time i will be frank with you you are right when you say that it was you who first directed my attention towards sir timothy brast since that time however your own relations with him to an onlooker have become a little puzzling  i see francis murmured youve been spying on me  shopland shook his head in deprecating fashion  a study of sir timothy during the last month he said has brought you many a time into the focus  where are we going to now francis asked a little abruptly  just a side show sir its one of those outside things i have come across which give light and shade to the whole affair we get out here if you please  the two men stepped on to the pavement they were in a street a little north of wardour street where the shops for the most part were of a miscellaneous variety exactly in front of them the space behind a large plateglass window had been transformed into a sort of showplace for dogs there were twenty or thirty of them there of all breeds and varieties  what the mischief is this francis demanded  come in and make enquiries shopland replied i can promise that you will find it interesting its a sort of dogs home  francis followed his companion into the place a pleasantlooking middleaged woman came forward and greeted the latter  do you mind telling my friend what you told me the other day he asked  certainly sir she replied we collect stray animals here sir she continued turning to francis every one who has a dog or a cat he cant afford to keep or which he wants to get rid of may bring it to us we have agents all the time in the streets and if any official of the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals brings us news of a dog or a cat being illtreated we either purchase it or acquire it in some way or other and keep it here  but your dogs in the window francis observed all seem to be in wonderful condition  the woman smiled  we have a large dog and cat hospital behind she explained and a veterinary surgeon who is always in attendance the animals are treated there as they are brought in and fed up if they are out of condition when they are ready to sell we show them  but is this a commercial undertaking francis enquired carefully or is it a branch of the spca  its quite a private affair sir the woman told him we charge only five shillings for the dogs and halfacrown for the cats but every one who has one must sign our book promising to give it a good home and has to be either known to us or to produce references we do not attempt of course to snake a profit  who on earth is responsible for the upkeep  we are not allowed to mention any names here sir but as a matter of fact i think that your friend knows he met the gentleman in here one day would you care to have a look at the hospital sir  francis spent a quarter of an hour wandering around when they left the place shopland turned to him with a smile  now sir he said shall i tell you at whose expense that place is run  i think i can guess francis replied i should say that sir timothy brast was responsible for it  the detective nodded he was a little disappointed  you know about his collection of brokendown horses in the park at the walled house too then i suppose they come whinnying after him like a flock of sheep whenever he shows himself  i know about them too francis admitted i was present once when he got out of his car knocked a carter down who was illtreating a horse bought it on the spot and sent it home  shopland smiled inscrutably yet with the air of one vastly pleased  these little sideshows he said are what help to make this which i believe will be the greatest case of my life so supremely interesting any one of my fraternity he continued with an air of satisfaction can take hold of a thread and follow it step by step and wind up with the handcuffs as i did myself with the young man fairfax but a case like this which includes a study of temperament requires something more  they were seated once more in the taxicab on their way westward francis for the first time was conscious of an utterly new sensation with regard to his companion he watched him through halfclosed eyesan insignificantlooking little man whose clothes though neat were illchosen and whose tie was an offense there was nothing in the face to denote unusual intelligence but the eyes were small and cunning and the mouth dogged francis looked away out of the window a sudden flash of realisation had come to him a wave of unreasoning but positive dislike  when do you hope to bring your case to an end he asked  the man smiled once more and the very smile irritated his companion  within the course of the next few days sir he replied  and the charge  the detective turned around  mr ledsam he said we have been old friends if you will allow me to use the word ever since i was promoted to my present position in the force you have trusted me with a good many cases and i acknowledge myself your debtor but in the matter of sir timothy brast you will forgive my saying with all respect sir that our ways seem to lie a little apart  will you tell me why you have arrived at that conclusion francis asked it was i who first incited you to set a watch upon sir timothy it was to you i first mentioned certain suspicions i myself had with regard to him i treated you with every confidence why do you now withhold yours from me  it is quite true mr ledsam shopland admitted that it was you who first pointed out sir timothy as an interesting study for my profession but that was a matter of months ago if you will forgive my saying so your relations with sir timothy have altered since then you have been his guest at the sanctuary and there is a rumour siryou will pardon me if i seem to be taking a libertythat you are engaged to be married to his daughter oliver hilditchs widow  you seem to be tolerably well informed as to my affairs shopland francis remarked  only so far as regards your associations with sir timothy was the deprecating reply if you will excuse me sir this is where i should like to descend  you have no message for mr wilmore then francis asked  nothing definite sir but you can assure him of this his brother is not likely to come to any particular harm i have no absolute information to offer but it is my impression that mr reginald wilmore will be home before a week is past good afternoon sir  shopland stepped out of the taxicab and raising his hat walked quickly away francis directed the man to drive to clarges street as they drove off he was conscious of a folded piece of paper in the corner where his late companion had been seated he picked it up opened it realised that it was a letter from a firm of lawyers addressed to shopland and deliberately read it through it was dated from a small town not far from hatch end     dear sir    mr john phillips of this firm who is coroner for the district has desired me to answer the enquiry contained in your official letter of the 13th the number of inquests held upon bodies recovered from the thames in the neighbourhood to which you allude during the present year has been seven four of these have been identified concerning the remaining three nothing has ever been heard such particulars as are on our file will be available to any accredited representative of the police at any time                      faithfully yours                                     phillips  son   the taxicab came to a sudden stop francis glanced up very breathless shopland put his head in at the window  i dropped a letter he gasped  francis folded it up and handed it to him  what about these three unidentified people shopland he asked looking at him intently  the man frowned angrily there was a note of defiance in his tone as he stowed the letter away in his pocketbook  there were two men and one woman he replied all three of the upper classes the bodies were recovered from wilsons lock some three hundred yards from the walled house  do they form part of your case francis persisted  shopland stepped back  mr ledsam he said i told you some little time ago that so far as this particular case was concerned i had no confidences to share with you i am sorry that you saw that letter since you did however i hope you will not take it as a liberty from one in my position if i advise you most strenuously to do nothing which might impede the course of the law good day sir     chapter xxiv   francis in that pleasant halfhour before dinner which he spent in margarets sittingroom told her of the dogs home near wardour street she listened sympathetically to his description of the place  i had never heard of it she acknowledged but i am not in anyway surprised my father spends at least an hour of every day when he is down at hatch end amongst the horses and every time a fresh crock is brought down he is as interested as though it were a new toy  it is a remarkable trait in a very remarkable character francis commented  i could tell you many things that would surprise you margaret continued one night for instance when we were staying at the sanctuary he and i were going out to dine with some neighbours and he heard a cat mewing in the hedge somewhere he stopped the car got out himself found that the cat had been caught in a trap released it and sent me on to the dinner alone whilst he took the animal back to the veterinary surgeon at the walled house he was simply white with fury whilst he was tying up the poor things leg i couldnt help asking him what he would have done if he could have found the farmer who set the trap he looked up at me and i was almost frightened i should have killed him he saidand i believe he meant it and francis the very next day we were motoring to london and saw a terrible accident a motor bicyclist came down a side road at full speed and ran into a motorlorry my father got out of the car helped them lift the body from under the wheels of the lorry and came back absolutely unmoved serve the silly young fool right was his only remark he was so horribly callous that i could scarcely bear to sit by his side do you understand that  it isnt easy he admitted  there was a knock at the door margaret glanced at the clock  surely dinner cant be served already she exclaimed come in  very much to their surprise it was sir timothy himself who entered he was in evening dress and wearing several orders one of which francis noted with surprise  my apologies he said hedges told me that there were cocktails here and as i am on my way to a rather weary dinner i thought i might inflict myself upon you for a moment  margaret rose at once to her feet  i am a shocking hostess she declared hedges brought the things in twenty minutes ago  she took up the silver receptacle shook it vigorously and filled three glasses sir timothy accepted his and bowed to them both  my best wishes he said really when one comes to think of it however much it may be against my inclinations i scarcely see how i shall be able to withhold my consent i believe that you both have at heart the flair for domesticity this little picture and the thought of your teteatete dinner almost touches me  dont make fun of us father margaret begged tell us where you are going in all that splendour  sir timothy shrugged his shoulders  a month or so ago he explained i was chosen to induct a scion of royalty into the understanding of fighting as it is indulged in at the national sporting club this i suppose is my rewardan invitation to something in the nature of a state dinner which to tell you the truth i had forgotten until my secretary pointed it out to me this afternoon i have grave fears of being bored or of misbehaving myself i have as ledsam here knows a distressing habit of truthfulness especially to new acquaintances however we must hope for the best bythebye ledsam in case you should have forgotten i have spoken to hedges about the 99 cliquot  shall we see you here later margaret asked after francis had murmured his thanks  i shall probably return direct to hatch end sir timothy replied there are various little matters down there which are interesting me just now preparations for my party au revoir a delicious cocktail but i am inclined to resent the angostura  he sauntered out after a glance at the clock they heard his footsteps as he descended the stairs  tell me what manner of a man is your father francis asked impulsively  i am his daughter and i do not know margaret answered before he came i was going to speak to you of a strange misunderstanding which has existed between us and which has just been removed now i have a fancy to leave it until later you will not mind  when you choose francis assented nothing will make any difference we are past the days when fathers or even mothers count seriously in the things that exist between two people like you and me who have felt life whatever your father may be whatever he may turn out to be you are the woman i loveyou are the woman who is going to be my wife  she leaned towards him for a moment  you have an amazing gift she whispered of saying just the thing one loves to hear in the way that convinces  dinner was served to them in the smaller of the two diningrooms an exquisite meal made more wonderful still by the wine which hedges himself dispensed with jealous care the presence of servants with its restraining influence upon conversation was not altogether unwelcome to francis he and margaret had had so little opportunity for general conversation that to discuss other than personal subjects in this pleasant leisurely way had its charm they spoke of music of which she knew far more than he of foreign travel where they met on common ground for each had only the tourists knowledge of europe and each was anxious for a more individual acquaintance with it she had tastes in books which delighted him a knowledge of games which promised a common resource it was only whilst they were talking that he realised with a shock how young she was how few the years that lay between her serene schooldays and the tempestuous years of her married life her schooldays in naples were most redolent of delightful memories she broke off once or twice into the language and he listened with delight to her soft accent finally the time came when dessert was set upon the table  i have ordered coffee up in the little sittingroom again she said a little shyly do you mind or would you rather have it here  i much prefer it there he assured her  they sat before an open window looking out upon some elm trees in the boughs of which town sparrows twittered and with a background of roofs and chimneys margarets coffee was untasted even her cigarette lay unlit by her side there was a touch of the old horror upon her face the fingers which he drew into his were as cold as ice  you must have wondered sometimes she began why i ever married oliver hilditch  you were very young he reminded her with a little shiver and very inexperienced i suppose he appealed to you in some way or another  it wasnt that she replied he came to visit me at eastbourne and he certainly knew all the tricks of making himself attractive and agreeable but he never won my hearthe never even seriously took my fancy i married him because i believed that by doing so i was obeying my fathers wishes  where was your father at the time then francis asked  in south america oliver hilditch was nothing more than a discharged employé of his discharged for dishonesty he had to leave south america within a week to escape prosecution and on the way to europe he concocted the plot which very nearly ruined my life he forged a letter from my father begging me if i found it in any way possible to listen to oliver hilditchs proposals and hinting guardedly at a very serious financial crisis which it was in his power to avert it never occurred to me or to my chaperon to question his bona fides he had lived under the same roof as my father and knew all the intimate details of his life he was very clever and i suppose i was a fool i remember thinking i was doing quite a heroic action when i went to the registrar with him what it led to you know  there was a moments throbbing silence francis notwithstanding his deep pity was conscious of an overwhelming sensation of relief she had never cared for oliver hilditch she had never pretended to he put the thought into words  you never cared for him then  i tried to she replied simply but i found it impossible within a week of our marriage i hated him  francis leaned back his eyes half closed in his ears was the sonorous roar of piccadilly the hooting of motorcars close at hand the rustling of a faint wind in the elm trees it was a wonderful moment the nightmare with which he had grappled so fiercely which he had overthrown but whose ghost still sometimes walked by his side had lost its chief and most poignant terror she had been tricked into the marriage she had never cared or pretended to care the primal horror of that tragedy which he had figured so often to himself seemed to have departed with the thought its shadow must always remain but in time his conscience would acquiesce in the pronouncement of his reason it was the hand of justice not any human hand which had slain oliver hilditch  what did your father say when he discovered the truth he asked  he did not know it until he came to englandon the day that oliver hilditch was acquitted my husband always pretended that he had a special mail bag going out to south america so he took away all the letters i wrote to my father and he took care that i received none except one or two which i know now were forgeries he had friends in south america himself who helped himone a typist in my fathers office of whom i discovered afterwardsbut that really doesnt matter he was a wonderful master of deceit  francis suddenly took her hands he had an overwhelming desire to escape from the miasma of those ugly days with their train of attendant thoughts and speculations  let us talk about ourselves he whispered  after that the evening glided away incoherently with no sustained conversation but with an increasing sense of wellbeing of soothed nerves and happiness flaming seconds of passion signposts of the wonderful world which lay before them they sat in the cool silence until the lights of the returning taxicabs and motorcars became more frequent until the stars crept into the sky and the yellow arc of the moon stole up over the tops of the houses presently they saw sir timothys rollsroyce glide up to the front door below and sir timothy himself enter the house followed by another man whose appearance was somehow familiar  your father has changed his mind francis observed  perhaps he has called for something she suggested or he may want to change his clothes before he goes down to the country  presently however there was a knock at the door hedges made his diffident appearance  i beg your pardon sir he began addressing francis sir timothy has been asking if you are still here he would be very glad if you could spare him a moment in the library  francis rose at once to his feet  i was just leaving he said i will look in at the library and see sir timothy on my way out     chapter xxv   sir timothy was standing upon the hearthrug of the very wonderful apartment which he called his library by his side on a black marble pedestal stood a small statue by rodin behind him lit by a shielded electric light was a vandyck a portrait of a gentleman unknown and francis as he hesitated for a moment upon the threshold was struck by a sudden quaint likeness between the face of the man in the picture with his sunken cheeks his supercilious smile his narrowed but powerful eyes to the face of sir timothy himself there was something of the same spirit therethe lawless buccaneer perhaps the criminal  you asked for me sir timothy francis said  sir timothy smiled  i was fortunate to find that you had not left he answered i want you to be present at this forthcoming interview you are to a certain extent in the game i thought it might amuse you  francis for the first time was aware that his host was not alone the room with its odd splashes of light was full of shadows and he saw now that in an easychair a little distance away from sir timothy a girl was seated behind her still standing with his hat in his hand was a man francis recognised them both with surprise  miss hyslop he exclaimed  she nodded a little defiantly sir timothy smiled ah he said you know the young lady without a doubt mr shopland your coadjutor in various works of philanthropy you recognise of course i do not mind confessing to you ledsam that i am very much afraid of mr shopland i am not at all sure that he has not a warrant for my arrest in his pocket  the detective came a little further into the light he was attired in an illfitting dinner suit a softfronted shirt of unpleasing design a collar of the wrong shape and a badly arranged tie he seemed nevertheless very pleased with himself  i came on here mr ledsam at sir timothys desire he said i should like you to understand he added with a covert glance of warning that i have been devoting every effort during the last few days to the discovery of your friends brother mr reginald wilmore  i am very glad to hear it francis replied shortly the boys brother is one of my greatest friends  i have come to the conclusion the detective pronounced that the young man has been abducted and is being detained at the walled house against his will for some illegal purpose  in other respects sir timothy said stretching out his hand towards a cedarwood box of cigarettes and selecting one this man seems quite sane i have watched him very closely on the way here but i could see no signs of mental aberration i do not think at any rate that he is dangerous  sir timothy shopland explained with some anger in his tone declines to take me seriously i can of course apply for a search warrant as i shall do but it occurred to me to be one of those cases which could be better dealt with up to a certain point without recourse to the extremities of the law  sir timothy who had lit his cigarette presented a wholly undisturbed front  what i cannot quite understand he said is the exact meaning of that word abduction why should i be suspected of forcibly removing a harmless and worthy young man from his regular avocation and as you term it abducting him which i presume means keeping him bound and gagged and imprisoned i do not eat young men i do not even care for the society of young men i am not naturally a gregarious person but i think i would go so far he added with a bow towards miss hyslop as to say that i prefer the society of young women satisfy my curiosity therefore i beg of you for what reason do you suppose that i have been concerned in the disappearance of this mr reginald wilmore  francis opened his lips but shopland with a warning glance intervened  i work sometimes as a private person sir he said but it is not to be forgotten that i am an officer of the law it is not for us to state motives or even to afford explanations for our behaviour i have watched your house at hatch end sir timothy and i have come to the conclusion that unless you are willing to discuss this matter with me in a different spirit i am justified in asking the magistrates for a search warrant  sir timothy sighed  mr ledsam he said i think after all that yours is the most interesting end of this espionage business it is you who search for motives is it not and pass them on to our more automatic friend who does the rest may i ask have you supplied the motive in the present case  i have failed to discover any motive at all for reginald wilmores disappearance francis admitted nor have i at any time been able to connect you with it mr shoplands efforts however although he has not seen well to take me into his entire confidence have my warmest approval and sympathy although i have accepted your very generous hospitality sir timothy i think there has been no misunderstanding between us on this matter  most correct sir timothy murmured the trouble seems to be so far as i am concerned that no one will tell me exactly of what i am suspected i am to give mr shopland the run of my house or he will make his appearance in the magistrates court and the evening papers will have placards with marvellous headlines at my expense how will it run mr shopland    mysterious disappearance of a young gentleman     millionaires house to be searched  we do not necessarily acquaint the press with our procedure shopland rejoined  nevertheless sir timothy continued i have known awkward consequences arise from a search warrant too rashly applied for or granted however we are scarcely being polite so far miss hyslop has had very little to say  the young lady was not altogether at her ease  i have had very little to say she repeated because i did not expect an audience  sir timothy drew a letter from his pocket opened it and adjusted his eyeglass  here we are he said after leaving my dinnerparty tonight i called at the club and found this note quite an inviting little affair you see young ladys writing faint but very delicate perfume excellent stationery milan courtthe home of adventures    dear sir timothy brast    although i am not known to you personally there is a certain matter concerning which information has come into my possession which i should like to discuss with you will you call and see me as soon as possible                              sincerely yours                                  daisy hyslop  on receipt of this note sir timothy continued folding it up i telephoned to the young lady and as i was fortunate enough to find her at home i asked her to come here i then took the liberty of introducing myself to mr shopland whose interest in my evening has been unvarying and whose uninvited company i have been compelled to bear with and suggested that as i was on my way back to curzon street he had better come in and have a drink and tell me what it was all about i arranged that he should find miss hyslop here and for a person of observation which i flatter myself to be it was easy to discover the interesting fact that mr shopland and miss daisy hyslop were not strangers  now tell me young lady sir timothy went on you see i have placed myself entirely in your hands never mind the presence of these two gentlemen tell me exactly what you wanted to say to me  the matter is of no great importance miss hyslop declared in any case i should not discuss it before these two gentlemen  dont go for a moment please sir timothy begged as she showed signs of departure listen i want to make a suggestion to you there is an impression abroad that i was interested in the two young men victor bidlake and fairfax and that i knew something of their quarrel you were an intimate friend of young bidlakes and presumably in his confidence it occurs to me therefore that mr shopland might very well have visited you in search of information linking me up with that unfortunate affair hence your little note to me  miss hyslop rose to her feet she had the appearance of being very angry indeed  do you mean to insinuate she began  madam i insinuate nothing sir timothy interrupted sternly i only desire to suggest this you are a young lady whose manner of living i gather is to a certain extent precarious it must have seemed to you a likelier source of profit to withhold any information you might have to give at the solicitation of a rich man than to give it free gratis and for nothing to a detective now am i right  miss hyslop turned towards the door she had the air of a person who had been entirely misunderstood  i wrote you out of kindness sir timothy she said in an aggrieved manner i shall have nothing more to say on the matterto you at any rate  sir timothy sighed  you see he said turning to the others i have lost my chance of conciliating a witness my chequebook remains locked up and she has gone over to your side  she turned around suddenly  you know that you made bobby fairfax kill victor she almost shouted  sir timothy smiled in triumph  my dear young lady he begged let us now be friends again i desired to know your trump card for that reason i fear that i have been a little brutal now please dont hurry away you have shot your bolt already mr shopland is turning the thing over in his mind was i lurking outside that night mr shopland to guide that young mans flabby arm he scarcely seemed man enough for a murderer did he when he sat quaking on that stool in sotos bar while mr ledsam tortured him i beg you again not to hurry miss hyslop at any rate wait while my servants fetch you a taxi it was clouding over when i came in we may even have a thunderstorm  i want to get out of this house daisy hyslop declared i think you are all horrible mr ledsam did behave like a gentleman when he came to see me and mr shopland asked questions civilly but you she added turning round to sir timothy  hush my dear he interrupted holding out his hand dont abuse me i am not angry with younot in the leastand i am going to prove it i shall oppose any search warrant which you might apply for mr shopland and i think i can oppose it with success but i invite you two miss hyslop and mr ledsam to my party on thursday night once under my roof you shall have carte blanche you can wander where you please knock the walls for secret hidingplaces stamp upon the floor for oubliettes upstairs or down the cellars and the lofts the grounds and the park the whole of my domain is for you from midnight on thursday until four oclock what do you say mr shopland does my offer satisfy you  the detective hesitated  i should prefer an invitation for myself he declared bluntly  sir timothy shook his head  alas my dear mr shopland he regretted that is impossible if i had only myself to consider i would not hesitate personally i like you you amuse me more than any one i have met for a long time but unfortunately i have my guests to consider you must be satisfied with mr ledsams report  shopland stroked his stubbly moustache it was obvious that he was not in the least disconcerted  there are three days between now and then he reflected  during those three days of course sir timothy said drily i shall do my best to obliterate all traces of my various crimes still you are a clever detective and you can give mr ledsam a few hints take my advice you wont get that search warrant and if you apply for it none of you will be at my party  i accept shopland decided  sir timothy crossed the room unlocked the drawer of a magnificent writingtable and from a little packet drew out two cards of invitation they were of small size but thick and the colour was a brilliant scarlet on one he wrote the name of francis the other he filled in for miss hyslop  miss daisy hyslop he said shall we drink a glass of wine together on thursday evening and will you decide that although perhaps i am not a very satisfactory correspondent i can at least be an amiable host  the girls eyes glistened she knew very well that the possession of that card meant that for the next few days she would be the envy of every one of her acquaintances  thank you sir timothy she replied eagerly you have quite misunderstood me but i should like to come to your party  sir timothy handed over the cards he rang for a servant and bowed the others out francis he detained for a moment  our little duel my friend marches he said after thursday night we will speak again of this matter concerning margaret you will know then what you have to face  margaret herself opened the door and looked in  what have those people been doing here she asked what is happening  her father unlocked his drawer once more and drew out another of the red cards  margaret he said ledsam here has accepted my invitation for thursday night you have never up till now honoured me nor have i ever asked you i suggest that for the first part of the entertainment you give me the pleasure of your company  for the first part  for the first part only he repeated as he wrote her name upon the card  what about francis she asked is he to stay all the time  sir timothy smiled he locked up his drawer and slipped the key into his pocket  ledsam and i he said have promised one another a more complete mutual understanding on thursday night i may not be able to part with him quite so soon     chapter xxvi   bored and listless like a tired and drooping lily in the arms of her somewhat athletic partner lady cynthia brought her dance to a somewhat abrupt conclusion  there is some one in the lounge there to whom i wish to speak she said perhaps you wont mind if we finish later the floor seems sticky tonight or my feet are heavy  her partner made the best of it as lady cynthias partners nowadays generally had to she even dispensed with his escort and walked across the lounge of claridges alone sir timothy rose to his feet he had been sitting in a corner half sheltered by a pillar and had fancied himself unseen  what a relief she exclaimed another turn and i should have fainted through sheer boredom  yet you are quite wonderful dancing he said i have been watching you for some time  it is one of my expiring efforts she declared sinking into the chair by his side you know whose party it is of course old lady torringtons quite a boy and girl affair twentyfour of us had dinner in the worst corner of the room i can hear the old lady ordering the dinner now charles with a long menu she shakes her head and taps him on the wrist with her fan monsieur charles i am a poor woman give me what there isa small plain dinnerand charge me at your minimum the dinner was very small and very plain the champagne was horribly sweet my partner talked of a new drill his last innings for the household brigade and a wonderful round of golf he played last sunday week i was turned on to dance with a man who asked me to marry him a year ago and i could feel him vibrating with gratitude as he looked at me that i had refused i suppose i am very haggard  does that matter nowadays sir timothy asked  she shrugged her shoulders  i am afraid it does the bone and the hank of hair stuff is played out the dairymaid style is coming in plump little fanny torrington had a great success tonight in one of those simple white dresses you know which look like a sack with a hole cut in the top what are you doing here by yourself  i have an engagement in a few minutes he explained my car is waiting now i looked in at the club to dine found my favourite table taken and nearly every man i ever disliked sidling up to tell me that he hears i am giving a wonderful party on thursday i decided not to dine there after all and charles found me a corner here i am going in five minutes  where to she asked cant i come with you  i fear not he answered i am going down in the east end  adventuring  more or less he admitted  lady cynthia became beautiful she was always beautiful when she was not tired  take me with you please she begged  he shook his head  not to be done  dont shake your head like that she enjoined with a little grimace people will think i am trying to borrow money from you and that you are refusing me just take me with you some of the way i shall scream if i go back into that dancingroom again  sir timothy glanced at the clock  if there is any amusement to you in a rather dull drive eastwards  she was on her feet with the soft graceful speed which had made her so much admired before her present listlessness had set in  ill get my cloak she said  they drove along the embankment citywards the heat of the city seemed to rise from the pavements the wall of the embankment was lined with people leaning over to catch the languid breeze that crept up with the tide they crossed the river and threaded their way through a nightmare of squalid streets where halfdressed men and women hung from the top windows and were even to be seen upon the roof struggling for air the car at last pulled up at the corner of a long street  i am going down here sir timothy announced i shall be gone perhaps an hour the neighbourhood is not a fit one for you to be left alone in i shall have time to send you home the car will be back here for me by the time i require it  where are you going she asked curiously why cant i come with you  i am going where i cannot take you was the firm reply i told you that before i started  i shall sit here and wait for you she decided i rather like the neighbourhood there is a gentleman in shirtsleeves leaning over the rail of the roof there who has his eye on me i believe i shall be a success herewhich is more than i can say of a little further westwards  sir timothy smiled slightly he had exchanged his hat for a tweed cap and had put on a long dustcoat  there is no gauge by which you may know the measure of your success he said if there were  if there were she asked leaning a little forward and looking at him with a touch of the old brilliancy in her eyes  if there were he said with a little show of mock gallantry a very jealouslyguarded secret might escape me i think you will be quite all right here he continued it is an open thoroughfare and i see two policemen at the corner hassell my chauffeur too is a reliable fellow we will be back within the hour  we she repeated  he indicated a man who had silently made his appearance during the conversation and was standing waiting on the sidewalk  just a companion i do not advise you to wait if you insistau revoir  lady cynthia leaned back in a corner of the car  through halfclosed eyes she watched the two men on their way down the crowded thoroughfaresir timothy tall thin as a lath yet with a certain elegance of bearing the man at his side shorter his hands thrust into the pockets of his coat his manner one of subservience she wondered languidly as to their errand in this unsavoury neighbourhood then she closed her eyes altogether and wondered about many things  sir timothy and his companion walked along the crowded squalid street without speech presently they turned to the right and stopped in front of a publichouse of some pretensions  this is the place sir timothy asked  yes sir  both men entered sir timothy made his way to the counter his companion to a table near where he took a seat and ordered a drink sir timothy did the same he was wedged in between a heterogeneous crowd of shabby depressed but apparently not illnatured men and women a man in a flannel shirt and pair of shabby plaid trousers which owed their precarious position to a pair of wornout braces turned a beery eye upon the newcomer  ill ave one with you guvnor he said  you shall indeed sir timothy assented  strike me lucky but ive touched first time the man exclaimed ill ave a double tot of whisky he added addressing the barman will it run to it guvnor  certainly was the cordial reply and the same to your friends if you will answer a question  troop up lads the man shouted weve a toff ere he aint a teci know the cut of them out with the question  serve every one who desires it with drinks sir timothy directed the barman my question is easily answered is this the place which a man whom i understand they call billy the tanner frequents  the question appeared to produce an almost uncomfortable sensation the enthusiasm for the free drinks however was only slightly damped and a small forest of grimy hands was extended across the counter  dont you ask no questions about im guvnor sir timothys immediate companion advised earnestly hed kill you as soon as look at you when billy the tanners in a quarrelsome mood ive see im empty this place and the whole street quicker than if a mad dog was loose es a fair and oly terror e is e about killed is wife three nights ago but there aint a living soul as d dare to stand in the witnessbox about it  why dont the police take a hand in the matter if the man is such a nuisance sir timothy asked  his new acquaintance gripping a thick tumbler of spirits and water with a hand deeply encrusted with the stains of his trade scoffed  police why ed take on any three of the police round these parts he declared police you tell one on em that billy the tanners on the rampage and youll see em op it cheero guvnor and dont you get curious about billy it aint ealthy  the swingdoor was suddenly opened a touslehaired urchin shoved his face in  billy the tanners coming he shouted cave all hes been avin a rare todo in smiths court  then a curious thing happened the little crowd at the bar seemed somehow to melt away halfadozen left precipitately by the door halfadozen more slunk through an inner entrance into some room beyond sir timothys neighbour set down his tumbler empty he was the last to leave  if youre going to stop ere guvnor he begged fervently you keep a still tongue in your ead billy aint particular who it is ed kill is own mother if e felt like it ell swing some day sure as i stand ere but ell do a bit more mischief first op it with me guvnor or get inside there  jims right the man behind the bar agreed hes a very nasty customer bill the tanner sir if hes coming down id clear out for a moment you can go in the guvnors sittingroom if you like  sir timothy shook his head  billy the tanner will not hurt me he said as a matter of fact i came down to see him  his new friend hesitated no longer but made for the door through which most of his companions had already disappeared the barman leaned across the counter  guvnor he whispered hoarsely i dont know what the game is but ive given you the office billy wont stand no truck from any one hes a holy terror  sir timothy nodded  i quite understand he said  there was a moments ominous silence the barman withdrew to the further end of his domain and busied himself cleaning some glasses suddenly the door was swung open a man entered whose appearance alone was calculated to inspire a certain amount of fear he was tall but his height escaped notice by reason of the extraordinary breadth of his shoulders he had a coarse and vicious face a crop of red hair and an unshaven growth of the same upon his face he wore what appeared to be the popular dress in the neighbourhooda pair of trousers suspended by a belt and a dirty flannel shirt his hands and even his chest where the shirt fell away were discoloured by yellow stains he looked around the room at first with an air of disappointment then he caught sight of sir timothy standing at the counter and he brightened up  wheres all the crowd tom he asked the barman  scared of you i reckon was the brief reply there was plenty here a few minutes ago  scared of me eh the other repeated staring hard at sir timothy did you ear that guvnor  i heard it sir timothy acquiesced  billy the tanner began to cheer up he walked all round this stranger  a toff a big toff ill ave a drink with you guvnor he declared with a note of incipient truculence in his tone  the barman had already reached up for two glasses but sir timothy shook his head  i think not he said  there was a moments silence the barman made despairing signs at sir timothy billy the tanner was moistening his lips with his tongue  why not he demanded  because i dont know you and i dont like you was the bland reply  billy the tanner wasted small time upon preliminaries he spat upon his hands  i dunno you and i dont like you he retorted dyer know wot im going to do  i have no idea sir timothy confessed  im going to make you look so that your own mother wouldnt know youthen im going to pitch you into the street he added with an evil grin thats wot we does with big toffs who come anging around ere  do you sir timothy said calmly perhaps my friend may have something to say about that  the man of war was beginning to be worked up  wheres your big friend he shouted come on ill take on the two of you  the man who had met sir timothy in the street had risen to his feet he strolled up to the two billy the tanner eyed him hungrily  the two of you dyer ear he shouted and eres just a flick for the toff to be going on with  he delivered a sudden blow at sir timothya full vicious jabbing blow which had laid many a man of the neighbourhood in the gutter to his amazement the chin at which he had aimed seemed to have mysteriously disappeared sir timothy himself was standing about halfayard further away billy the tanner was too used to the game to be off his balance but he received at that moment the surprise of his life with the flat of his hand full open sir timothy struck him across the cheek such a blow that it resounded through the place a blow that brought both the inner doors ajar that brought peering eyes from every direction there was a moments silence the mans fists were clenched now there was murder in his face sir timothy stepped on one side  i am not a fighter he said coolly leaning back against the marble table my friend will deal with you  billy the tanner glared at the newcomer who had glided in between him and sir timothy  you can come and join in too he shouted to sir timothy ill knock your big head into pulp when ive done with this little job  the bully knew in precisely thirty seconds what had happened to him so did the crowds who pressed back into the place through the inner door so did the barman so did the landlord who had made a cautious appearance through a trapdoor billy the tanner for the first time in his life was fighting a better man for two years he had been the terror of the neighbourhood and he showed now that at least he had courage his smattering of science however appeared only ridiculous once through sheer strength and blundering force he broke down his opponents guard and struck him in the place that had dispatched many a man beforejust over the heart his present opponent scarcely winced and billy the tanner paid the penalty then for his years of bullying his antagonist paused for a single second as though unnerved by the blow red fire seemed to stream from his eyes then it was all over with a sickening crash billy the tanner went down upon the sanded floor it was no matter of a count for him he lay there like a dead man and from the two doors the hidden spectators streamed into the room sir timothy laid some money upon the table  this fellow insulted me and my friend he said you see he has paid the penalty if he misbehaves again the same thing will happen to him i am leaving some money here with your barman i shall be glad for every one to drink with me presently perhaps you had better send for an ambulance or a doctor  a little storm of enthusiastic excitement evidenced for the most part in expletives of a lurid note covered the retreat of sir timothy and his companion out in the street a small crowd was rushing towards the place a couple of policemen seemed to be trying to make up their minds whether it was a fine night an inspector hurried up to them  whats doing in the rising sun he demanded sharply  some ones giving billy the tanner a hiding one of the policemen replied  honest  a fair ripe knockout hiding was the emphatic confirmation i looked in at the window  the inspector grinned  im glad you had the sense not to interfere he remarked  sir timothy and his companion reached the car the latter took a seat by the chauffeur sir timothy stepped in it struck him that lady cynthia was a little breathless her eyes too were marvellously bright wrapped around her knees was the chauffeurs coat  wonderful she declared i havent had such a wonderful five minutes since i can remember you are a dear to have brought me sir timothy  what do you mean he demanded  mean she laughed as the car swung around and they glided away you didnt suppose i was going to sit here and watch you depart upon a mysterious errand i borrowed your chauffeurs coat and his cap and slunk down after you i can assure you i looked the most wonderful female apache you ever saw and i saw the fight it was better than any of the prize fights i have ever been to the real thing is better than the sham isnt it  sir timothy leaned back in his place and remained silent soon they passed out of the land of tired people of stalls decked out with unsavoury provender of foetid smells and unwholesomelooking houses they passed through a street of silent warehouses on to the embankment a stronger breeze came down between the curving arc of lights  you are not sorry that you brought me lady cynthia asked suddenly holding out her hand  sir timothy took it in his for some reason or other he made no answer at all     chapter xxvii   the car stopped in front of the great house in grosvenor square lady cynthia turned to her companion  you must come in please she said i insist if it is only for five minutes  sir timothy followed her across the hall to a curved recess where the footman who had admitted them touched a bell and a small automatic lift came down  i am taking you to my own quarters she explained they are rather cut off but i like themespecially on hot nights  they glided up to the extreme top of the house she opened the gates and led the way into what was practically an attic sittingroom decorated in black and white wideflung doors opened onto the leads where comfortable chairs a small table and an electric standard were arranged they were far above the tops of the other houses and looked into the green of the park  this is where i bring very few people she said this is where even after my twentyeight years of fraudulent life i am sometimes myself wait  there were feminine drinks and sandwiches arranged on the table she opened the cupboard of a small sideboard just inside the sittingroom however and produced whisky and a syphon of soda there was a pail of ice in a cool corner from somewhere in the distance came the music of violins floating through the window of a house where a dance was in progress they could catch a glimpse of the striped awning and the long line of waiting vehicles with their twin eyes of fire she curled herself up on a settee flung a cushion at sir timothy who was already ensconced in a luxurious easychair and with a tumbler of iced sherbet in one hand and a cigarette in the other looked across at him  i am not sure she said that you have not tonight dispelled an illusion  what manner of one he asked  above all things she went on i have always looked upon you as wicked most people do i think that is one reason why so many of the women find you attractive i suppose it is why i have found you attractive  the smile was back upon his lips he bowed a little and leaning forward dropped a chunk of ice into his whisky and soda  dear lady cynthia he murmured dont tell me that i am going to slip back in your estimation into some normal place  i am not quite sure she said deliberately i have always looked upon you as a kind of amateur criminal a man who loved black things and dark ways you know how weary one gets of the ordinary code of morals in these days you were such a delightful antidote and now i am not sure that you have not shaken my faith in you  in what way  you really seem to have been engaged tonight in a very sporting and philanthropic enterprise i imagined you visiting some den of vice and mixing as an equal with these terrible people who never seem to cross the bridges i was perfectly thrilled when i put on your chauffeurs coat and hat and followed you  the story of my little adventure is a simple one sir timothy said i do not think it greatly affects my character i believe as a matter of fact that i am just as wicked as you would have me be but i have friends in every walk of life and as you know i like to peer into the unexpected places i had heard of this man billy the tanner he beats women and has established a perfect reign of terror in the court and neighbourhood where he lives i fear i must agree with you that there were some elements of moralityof conforming at any rate to the recognised standards of justicein what i did you know of course that i am a great patron of every form of boxing fencing and the various arts of selfdefence and attack i just took along one of the men from my gymnasium who i knew was equal to the job to give this fellow a lesson  he did it all right lady cynthia murmured  but this is where i think i reestablish myself sir timothy continued the peculiar nature of his smile reasserting itself i did not do this for the sake of the neighbourhood i did not do it from any sense of justice at all i did it to provide for myself an enjoyable and delectable spectacle  she smiled lazily  that does rather let you out she admitted however on the whole i am disappointed i am afraid that you are not so bad as people think  people he repeated francis ledsam for instancemy soninlaw in posse  francis ledsam is one of those few rather brilliant persons who have contrived to keep sane without becoming a prig she remarked  you know why he reminded her francis ledsam has been a tremendous worker it is work which keeps a man sane brilliancy without the capacity for work drives people to the madhouse  where we are all going i suppose she sighed  not you he answered you have just enoughi dont know what we moderns call itsoul shall i sayto keep you from the muddy ways  she rose to her feet and leaned over the rails sir timothy watched her thoughtfully her figure notwithstanding its suggestions of delicate maturity was still as slim as a young girls she was looking across the treetops towards an angry bank of cloudslong pencillike streaks of black on a purple background below in the street a taxi passed with grinding of brakes and noisy horn the rail against which she leaned looked very flimsy sir timothy stretched out his hand and held her arm  my nerves are going with my old age he apologised that support seems too fragile  she did not move the touch of his fingers grew firmer  we have entered upon an allegory she murmured you are preserving me from the depths  he laughed harshly  i he exclaimed with a sudden touch of real and fierce bitterness which brought the light dancing into her eyes and a spot of colour to her cheeks i preserve you why you can never hear my name without thinking of sin of crime of some sort do you seriously expect me to ever preserve any one from anything  you havent made any very violent attempts to corrupt me she reminded him  women dont enter much into my scheme of life he declared they played a great part once it was a woman i think who first headed me off from the pastures of virtue  i know she said softly it was margarets mother  his voice rang out like a pistolshot  how did you know that  she turned away from the rail and threw herself back in her chair his hand however she still kept in hers  uncle joe was minister at rio you know the year it all happened she explained he told us the story years agohow you came back from europe and found things were not just as they should be between margarets mother and your partner and how you killed your partner  his nostrils quivered a little one felt that the fire of suffering had touched him again for a moment  yes i killed him he admitted that is part of my creed the men who defend their honour in the law courts are men i know nothing of this man would have wronged me and robbed me of my honour i bade him defend himself in any way he thought well it was his life or mine he was a poor fighter and i killed him  and margarets mother died from the shock  she died soon afterwards  the stars grew paler the passing vehicles with their brilliant lights grew fewer and fewer the breeze which had been so welcome at first turned into a cold night wind she led the way back into the room  i must go he announced  you must go she echoed looking up at him goodbye  she was so close to him that his embrace sudden and passionate though it was came about almost naturally she lay in his arms with perfect content and raised her lips to his  he broke away he was himself again selffurious  lady cynthia he said i owe you my most humble apologies the evil that is in me does not as a rule break out in this direction  you dear foolish person she laughed that was good not evil you like me dont you but i know you do there is one crime you have always forgotten to developyou havent the simplest idea in the world how to lie  yes i like you he admitted i have the most absurd feeling for you that any man ever found it impossible to put into words we have indeed strayed outside the world of natural things he added  why she murmured i never felt more natural or normal in my life i can assure you that i am loving it i feel like muslin gowns and primroses and the scent of those first march violets underneath a warm hedge where the sun comes sometimes i feel very natural indeed sir timothy  what about me he asked harshly in three weeks time i shall be fifty years old  she laughed softly  and in no time at all i shall be thirtyand entering upon a terrible period of spinsterhood  spinsterhood he scoffed why whenever the society papers are at a loss for a paragraph they report a few more offers of marriage to the everbeautiful lady cynthia  dont be sarcastic she begged i havent yet had the offer of marriage i want anyhow  youll get one you dont want in a moment he warned her  she made a little grimace  dont she laughed nervously how am i to preserve my romantic notions of you as the emperor of the criminal world if you kiss me as you did just nowyou kissed me rather welland then ask me to marry you it isnt your role you must light a cigarette now pat the back of my hand and swagger off to another of your haunts of vice  in other words i am not to propose sir timothy said slowly  you see how decadent i am she sighed i want to toy with my pleasures besides theres that scamp of a brother of mine coming up to have a drinki saw him get out of a taxiand you couldnt get it through in time not with dignity  the rattle of the lift as it stopped was plainly audible he stooped and kissed her fingers  i fear some day he murmured i shall be a great disappointment to you     chapter xxviii   there was a great deal of discussion the following morning at the sheridan club during the gossipy halfhour which preceded luncheon concerning sir timothy brasts forthcoming entertainment one of the men philip baker who had been for many years the editor of a famous sporting weekly had a ticket of invitation which he displayed to an envious little crowd  you fellows who get invitations to these parties a famous actor declared are the most elusive chaps on earth half london is dying to know what really goes on there and yet if by any chance one comes across a prospective or retrospective guest he is as dumb about it as though it were some masonic function weve got you this time baler though well put you under the inquisition on friday morning  there a wont be any need the other replied one hears a great deal of rot talked about these affairs but so far as i know nothing very much out of the way goes on there are always one or two pretty stiff fights in the gymnasium and you get the best variety show and supper in the world  why is there this aroma of mystery hanging about the affair then some one asked  well for one or two reasons baker answered one no doubt is because sir timothy has a great idea of arranging the fights himself and the opponents actually dont know until the fight begins whom they are meeting and sometimes not even then there has been some gossiping too about the rules and the weight of the gloves but that i know nothing about  and the rest of the show a younger member enquired is it simply dancing and music and that sort of thing  just a variety entertainment the proud possessor of the scarlethued ticket declared sir timothy always has something up his sleeve last year for instance he had those six african girls over from paris in that queer dance which they wouldnt allow in london at all this time no one knows what is going to happen the house as you know is absolutely surrounded by that hideous stone wall and from what i have heard reporters who try to get in arent treated too kindly heres ledsam very likely he knows more about it  ledsam some one demanded as francis joined the group are you going to sir timothy brasts show tomorrow night  i hope so francis replied producing his strip of pasteboard  ever been before  never  do you know what sort of a show its going to be the actor enquired  not the slightest idea i dont think any one does thats rather a feature of the affair isnt it  it is the envious outsider who has never received an invitation like myself some one remarked who probably spreads these rumours for one always hears it hinted that some disgraceful and illegal exhibition is on tap therea new sort of drugging party or some novel form of debauchery  i dont think francis said quietly that sir timothy is quite that sort of man  dash it all what sort of man is he the actor demanded they tell me that financially he is utterly unscrupulous although he is rolling in money he has the most mephistophelian expression of any man i ever metlooks as though hed set his heel on any ones neck for the sport of itand yet they say he has given at least fifty thousand pounds to the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals and that the whole of the park round that estate of his down the river is full of lamed and decrepit beasts which he has bought himself off the streets  the man must have an interesting personality a novelist who had joined the party observed of course you know that he was in prison for six months  what for some one asked  murder only they brought it in manslaughter was the terse reply he killed his partner it was many years ago and no one knows all the facts of the story  i am not holding a brief for sir timothy francis remarked as he sipped his cocktail as a matter of fact he and i are very much at crosspurposes but as regards that particular instance i am not sure that he was very much to be blamed any more than you can blame any injured person who takes the law into his own hands  he isnt a man i should care to have for an enemy baker declared  well well shake the truth out of you fellows somehow or other one of the group threatened on friday morning we are going to have the whole truthnone of this masonic secrecy which baker indulged in last year  the men drifted in to luncheon and francis leaving them took a taxi on to the ritz looking about in the vestibule for margaret he came face to face with lady cynthia she was dressed with her usual distinction in a gown of yellow muslin and a beflowered hat and was the cynosure of a good many eyes  one would almost imagine lady cynthia he said as they exchanged greetings that you had found that elixir we were talking about  perhaps i have she answered smiling are you looking for margaret she is somewhere about we were just having a chat when i was literally carried off by that terrible lanchester woman lets find her  they strolled up into the lounge margaret came to meet them her smile as she gave francis her left hand transformed and softened her whole appearance  you dont mind my having asked cynthia to lunch with us she said i really couldnt get rid of the girl she came in to see me this morning the most aggressively cheerful person i ever knew i believe that she had an adventure last night all that she will tell me is that she dined and danced at claridges with a party of the dullest people in town  a tall familiar figure passed down the vestibule lady cynthia gave a little start and francis who happened to be watching her was amazed at her expression  your father margaret she pointed out i wonder if he is lunching here  he told me that he was lunching somewhere with a south american friendone of his partners i believe margaret replied i expect he is looking for him  sir timothy caught sight of them hesitated for a moment and came slowly in their direction  have you found your friend margaret asked  the poor fellow is ill in bed her father answered i was just regretting that i had sent the car away or i should have gone back to hatch end  stay and lunch with us lady cynthia begged a little impetuously  i shall be very pleased if you will francis put in ill go and tell the waiter to enlarge my table  he hurried off on his way back a pageboy touched him on the arm  if you please sir he announced you are wanted on the telephone  i francis exclaimed some mistake i should think nobody knows that i am here  mr ledsam the boy said this way sir  francis walked down the vestibule to the row of telephone boxes at the further end the attendant who was standing outside indicated one of them and motioned the boy to go away francis stepped inside the man followed closing the door behind him  i am asking your pardon sir for taking a great liberty he confessed no one wants you on the telephone i wished to speak to you  francis looked at him in surprise the man was evidently agitated somehow or other his face was vaguely familiar  who are you and what do you want with me francis asked  i was butler to mr hilditch sir the man replied i waited upon you the night you dined there sirthe night of mr hilditchs death  well  i have a revelation to make with regard to that night sir the man went on which i should like to place in your hands it is a very serious matter and there are reasons why something must be done about it at once can i come and see you at your rooms sir  francis studied the man for a moment intently he was evidently agitatedevidently too in very bad health his furtive manner was against him on the other hand that might have arisen from nervousness  i shall be in at halfpast three number 13 b clarges street francis told him  i can get off for halfanhour then sir the man replied i shall be very glad to come i must apologise for having troubled you sir  francis went slowly back to his trio of guests all the way down the carpeted vestibule he was haunted by the grim shadow of a spectral fear the frozen horror of that ghastly evening was before him like a hateful tableau hilditchs mocking words rang in his cars my death is the one thing in the world which would make my wife happy the court scene with all its gloomy tragedy rose before his eyesonly in the dock instead of hilditch he saw another     chapter xxix   there were incidents connected with that luncheon which francis always remembered in the first place sir timothy was a great deal more silent than usual a certain vein of halfcynical halfamusing comment upon things and people of the moment which seemed whenever he cared to exert himself to flow from his lips without effort had deserted him he sat where the rather brilliant light from the high windows fell upon his face and francis wondered more than once whether there were not some change there perhaps some prescience of trouble to come which had subdued him and made him unusually thoughtful another slighter but more amusing feature of the luncheon was the number of people who stopped to shake hands with sir timothy and made more or less clumsy efforts to obtain an invitation to his coming entertainment sir timothys reply to these various hints was barely cordial the most he ever promised was that he would consult with his secretary and see if their numbers were already full lady cynthia as a somewhat blatant but discomfited peer of the realm took his awkward leave of them laughed softly  of course i think they all deserve what they get she declared i never heard such brazen impudence in my lifefrom people who ought to know better too  lord meadowson a sporting peer who was one of sir timothys few intimates came over to the table he paid his respects to the two ladies and francis and turned a little eagerly to sir timothy  well he asked  sir timothy nodded  we shall be quite prepared for you he said better bring your chequebook  capital the other exclaimed as i hadnt heard anything i was beginning to wonder whether you would be ready with your end of the show  there will be no hitch so far as we are concerned sir timothy assured him  more mysteries margaret enquired as meadowson departed with a smile of satisfaction  her father shrugged his shoulders  scarcely that he replied it is a little wager between lord meadowson and myself which is to be settled tomorrow  lady torrington a fussy little woman her hostess of the night before on her way down the room stopped and shook hands with lady cynthia  why my dear she exclaimed wherever did you vanish to last night claude told us all that in the middle of a dance with him you excused yourself for a moment and he never saw you again i quite expected to read in the papers this morning that you had eloped  precisely what i did lady cynthia declared the only trouble was that my partner had had enough of me before the evening was over and deposited me once more in grosvenor square it is really very humiliating she went on meditatively how every one always returns me  you talk such nonsense cynthia lady torrington exclaimed a little pettishly however you found your way home all right  quite safely thank you i was going to write you a note this afternoon i went away on an impulse all i can say is that i am sorry do forgive me  certainly was the somewhat chilly reply somehow or other you seem to have earned the right to do exactly as you choose some of my young men whom you had promised to dance with were disappointed but after all i suppose that doesnt matter  not much lady cynthia assented sweetly i think a few disappointments are good for most of the young men of today  what did you do last night cynthia margaret asked her presently when lady torrington had passed on  i eloped with your father lady cynthia confessed smiling across at sir timothy we went for a little drive together and i had a most amusing time the only trouble was as i have been complaining to that tiresome woman he brought me home again  but where did you go to margaret persisted  it was an errand of charity sir timothy declared  it sounds very mysterious francis observed is that all we are to be told  i am afraid sir timothy complained that very few people sympathise with my hobbies or my prosecution of them that is why such little incidents as last nights generally remain undisclosed if you really wish to know what happened he went on after a moments pause i will tell you as you know i have a great many friends amongst the boxing fraternity and i happened to hear of a man down in the east end who has made himself a terror to the whole community in which he lives i took peter fields my gymnasium instructor down to the east end last night and peter fieldsdealt with him  there was a fight margaret exclaimed with a little shudder  there was a fight sir timothy repeated if you can call it such fields gave him some part of the punishment he deserved  and you were there cynthia  i left lady cynthia in the car sir timothy explained she most improperly bribed my chauffeur to lend her his coat and hat and followed me  you actually saw the fight then francis asked  i did lady cynthia admitted i saw it from the beginning to the end  margaret looked across the table curiously it seemed to her that her friend had turned a little paler  did you like it she asked simply  lady cynthia was silent for a moment she glanced at sir timothy he too was waiting for her answer with evident interest  i was thrilled she acknowledged that was the pleasurable part of it i have been so used to looking on at shows that bored me listening to conversations that wearied me attempting sensations which were repellent that i just welcomed feeling when it camefeeling of any sort i was excited i forgot everything else i was so fascinated that i could not look away but if you ask me whether i liked it and i have to answer truthfully i hated it i felt nothing of the sort at the time but when i tried to sleep i found myself shivering it was justice i know but it was ugly  she watched sir timothy as she made her confession a little wistfully he said nothing but there was a very curious change in his expression he smiled at her in an altogether unfamiliar way  i suppose she said appealing to him that you are very disappointed in me  on the contrary he answered i am delighted  you mean that she asked incredulously  i do he declared companionship between our sexes is very delightful so far as it goes but the fundamental differences between a mans outlook and tastes and a womans should never be bridged over i myself do not wish to learn to knit i do not care for the womenkind in whom i am interested to appreciate and understand fighting  margaret looked across the table in amazement  you are most surprising this morning father she declared  i am perhaps misunderstood he sighed perhaps have acquired a reputation for greater callousness than i possess personally i love fighting i was born a fighter and i should find no happier way of ending my life than fighting but to put it bluntly fighting is a mans job  what about women going to see fights at the national sporting club lady cynthia asked curiously  it is their own affair but if you ask my opinion i do not approve of it sir timothy replied i am indifferent upon the subject because i am indifferent upon the subject of the generality of your sex he added with a little smile but i simply hold that it is not a taste which should be developed in women and if they do develop it it is at the expense of those very qualities which make them most attractive  lady cynthia took a cigarette from her case and leaned over to francis for a light  the world is changing she declared i cannot bear many more shocks i fancied that i had written myself for ever out of sir timothys good books because of my confession just now  he smiled across at her his words were words of courteous badinage but lady cynthia was conscious of a strange little sense of pleasure  on the contrary he assured her you found your way just a little further into my heart  it seems to me in a general sort of way margaret observed leaning back in her chair that you and my father are becoming extraordinarily friendly cynthia  i am hopefully in love with your father lady cynthia confessed it has been coming on for a long time i suspected it the first time i ever met him now i am absolutely certain  its quite a new idea margaret remarked shall we like her in the family francis  no airs lady cynthia warned her you two are not properly engaged yet it may devolve upon me to give my consent  in that case francis replied i hope that we may at least count upon your influence with sir timothy  if youll return the compliment and urge my suit with him lady cynthia laughed i am afraid he cant quite make up his mind about me and i am so nice i havent flirted nearly so much as people think and my instincts are really quite domestic  my position sir timothy remarked as he made an unsuccessful attempt to possess himself of the bill which francis had called for is becoming a little difficult  not really difficult lady cynthia objected because the real decision rests in your hands  just listen to the woman margaret exclaimed do you realise father that cynthia is making the most brazen advances to you and i was going to ask her if shed like to come back to the sanctuary with us this evening  lady cynthia was suddenly eager margaret glanced across at her father sir timothy seemed almost imperceptibly to stiffen a little  margaret has carte blanche at the sanctuary as regards her visitors he said i am afraid that i shall be busy over at the walled house  but youd come and dine with us  sir timothy hesitated an issue which had been looming in his mind for many hours seemed to be suddenly joined  please lady cynthia begged  sir timothy followed the example of the others and rose to his feet he avoided lady cynthias eyes he seemed suddenly a little tired  i will come and dine he assented quietly i am afraid that i cannot promise more than that lady cynthia as she knows is always welcome at the sanctuary     chapter xxx   punctual to his appointment that afternoon the man who had sought an interview with francis was shown into the latters study in clarges street  he wore an overcoat over his livery and directly he entered the room francis was struck by his intense pallor he had been trying feverishly to assure himself that all that the man required was the usual sort of help or assistance into a hospital yet there was something furtive in his visitors manner something which suggested the bearer of a guilty secret  please tell me what you want as quickly as you can francis begged i am due to start down into the country in a few minutes  i wont keep you long sir the man replied the matter is rather a serious one  are you ill  yes sir  you had better sit down  the man relapsed gratefully into a chair  ill leave out everything that doesnt count sir he said ill be as brief as i can i want you to go back to the night i waited upon you at dinner the night mr oliver hilditch was found dead you gave evidence the jury brought it in suicide it wasnt suicide at all sir mr hilditch was murdered  the sense of horror against which he had been struggling during the last few hours crept once more through the whole being of the man who listened he was face to face once more with that terrible issue had he perjured himself in vain was the whole structure of his dreams about to collapse to fall about his ears  by whom he faltered  by sir timothy brast sir  francis who had been standing with his hand upon the table felt suddenly inclined to laugh facile though his brain was the change of issues was too tremendous for him to readily assimilate it he picked up a cigarette from an open box with shaking fingers lit it and threw himself into an easychair he was all the time quite unconscious of what he was doing  sir timothy brast he repeated  yes sir the man reiterated i wish to tell you the whole story  i am listening francis assured him  that evening before dinner sir timothy brast called to see mr hilditch and a very stormy interview took place i do not know the rights of that sir i only know that there was a fierce quarrel mrs hilditch came in and sir timothy left the house his last words to mr hilditch were you will hear from me again as you know siri mean as you remember if you followed the evidenceall the servants slept at the back of the house i slept in the butlers room downstairs next to the plate pantry i was awake when you left sitting in my easychair reading ten minutes after you had left there was a sound at the front door as though some one had knocked with their knuckles i got up to open it but mr hilditch was before me he admitted sir timothy they went back into the library together it struck me that mr hilditch had had a great deal to drink and there was a queer look on sir timothys face that i didnt understand i stepped into the little room which communicates with the library by folding doors there was a chink already between the two i got a knife from the pantry and widened it until i could see through i heard very little of the conversation but there was no quarrel mr hilditch took up the weapon which you know about sat in a chair and held it to his heart i heard him say something like this this ought to appeal to you sir timothy youre a specialist in this sort of thing one little touch and there you are mrs hilditch said something about putting it away my master turned to sir timothy and said something in a low tone suddenly sir timothy leaned over he caught hold of mr hilditchs hand which held the hilt of the dagger and andwell he just drove it in sir then he stood away mrs hilditch sprang up and would have screamed but sir timothy placed his hand over her mouth in a moment i heard her say what have you done sir timothy looked at mr hilditch quite calmly i have ridded the world of a verminous creature he said my knees began to shake my nerves were always bad i crept back into my room took off my clothes and got into bed i had just put the light out when they called for me  francis was himself again there was an immense relief a joy in his heart he had never for a single moment blamed margaret but he had never for a single moment forgotten it was a closed chapter but the stain was on its pages it was wonderful to tear it out and scatter the fragments  i remember you at the inquest he said your name is john walter  yes sir  your evidence was very different  yes sir  you kept all this to yourself  i did sir i thought it best  tell me what has happened since  the man looked down at the table  i have always been a poor man sir he said i have had bad luck whenever ive made a try to start at anything i thought there seemed a chance for me here i went to sir timothy and i told him everything  well  sir timothy never turned a hair sir when i had finished he was very short with me almost curt you have behaved like a man of sense walter he said how much i hesitated for some time then i could see he was getting impatient i doubled what i had thought of first a thousand pounds sir i said sir timothy he went to a safe in the wall and he counted out a thousand pounds in notes there and then he brought them over to me walter he said there is your thousand pounds for that sum i understand you promise to keep what you saw to yourself yes sir i agreed take it then he said but i want you to understand this there have been many attempts but no one yet has ever succeeded in blackmailing me no one ever will i give you this thousand pounds willingly it is what you have asked for never let me see your face again if you come to me starving it will be useless i shall not part with another penny  the mans simple way of telling his story his speech slow and uneven on account of his faltering breath seemed all to add to the dramatic nature of his disclosure francis found himself sitting like a child who listens to a fairy story  and then he asked simply  i went off with the money walter continued and i had cruel bad luck i put it into a pub i was robbed a little i drank a little my wife wasnt any good i lost it all sir i found myself destitute i went back to sir timothy  well  the man shifted his feet nervously he seemed to have come to the difficult part of his story  sir timothy was as hard as nails he said slowly he saw me the moment i had finished he rang the bell hedges he said to the manservant who came in this man has come here to try and blackmail me throw him out if he gives any trouble send for the police if he shows himself here again send for the police  what happened then  well i nearly blurted out the whole story the man confessed and then i remembered that wouldnt do me any good so i went away i got a job at the ritz but i was took ill a few days afterwards i went to see a doctor from him i got my deathwarrant sir  is it heart  its heart sir the man acknowledged the doctor told me i might snuff out at any moment i cant live anyway for more than a year ive got a little girl  now just why have you come to see me francis asked  for just this sir the man replied heres my account of what happened he went on drawing some sheets of foolscap from his pocket its written in my own hand and there are two witnesses to my signatureone a clergyman sir and the other a doctor they thinking it was a will or something i had it in my mind to send that to scotland yard and then i remembered that i hadnt a penny to leave my little girl i began to wonderthink as meanly of me as you like sirhow i could still make some money out of this i happened to know that you were none too friendly disposed towards sir timothy this confession of mine if it wouldnt mean hanging would mean imprisonment for the rest of his life you could make a better bargain with him than me sir do you want to hold him in your power if so you can have this confession all signed and everything for two hundred pounds and as i live sir that two hundred pounds is to pay for my funeral and the balance for my little girl  francis took the papers and glanced them through  supposing i buy this document from you he said what is its actual value you could write out another confession get that signed and sell it to another of sir timothys enemies or you could still go to scotland yard yourself  i shouldnt do that sir i assure you the man declared nervously not on my solemn oath i want simply to be quit of the whole matter and have a little money for the child  francis considered for a moment  there is only one way i can see he said to make this document worth the money to me if you will sign a confession that any statement you have made as to the death of mr hilditch is entirely imaginary that you did not see sir timothy in the house that night that you went to bed at your usual time and slept until you were awakened and that you only made this charge for the purpose of extorting moneyif you will sign a confession to that effect and give it me with these papers i will pay you the two hundred pounds and i will never use the confession unless you repeat the charge  ill do it sir the man assented  francis drew up a document which his visitor read through and signed then he wrote out an open cheque  my servant shall take you to the bank in a taxi he said they would scarcely pay you this unless you were identified we understand one another  perfectly sir  francis rang the bell gave his servant the necessary orders and dismissed the two men halfanhour later already changed into flannels he was on his way into the country     chapter xxxi   sir timothy walked that evening amongst the shadows two hours ago the last of the workmen from the great furnishing and catering establishments who undertook the management of his famous entertainments had ceased work for the day and driven off in the motorbrakes hired to take them to the nearest town the long low wing whose use no one was able absolutely to divine was still full of animation but the great receptionrooms and stately hall were silent and empty in the gymnasium an enormous apartment as large as an ordinary concert hall two or three electricians were still at work directed by the man who had accompanied sir timothy to the east end on the night before the former crossed the room his footsteps awaking strange echoes  there will be seating for fifty sir and standing room for fifty he announced i have had the ring slightly enlarged as you suggested and the lighting is being altered so that the start is exactly north and south  sir timothy nodded thoughtfully the beautiful oak floor of the place was littered with sawdust and shavings of wood several tiers of seats had been arranged on the space usually occupied by swings punchingballs and other artifices on a slightly raised dais at the further end was an exact replica of a ring corded around and with sawdust upon the floor upon the walls hung a marvellous collection of weapons of every description from the modern rifle to the curved and terrible knife used by the most savage of known tribes  how are things in the quarters sir timothy asked  every one is well sir doctor ballantyne arrived this afternoon his report is excellent  sir timothy nodded and turned away he looked into the great gallery its waxen floors shining with polish ready for the feet of the dancers on the morrow looked into a beautiful concertroom with an organ that reached to the roof glanced into the banquetting hall which extended far into the wintergarden made his way up the broad stairs turned down a little corridor unlocked a door and passed into his own suite there was a small diningroom a library a bedroom and a bathroom fitted with every sort of device a manservant who had heard him enter hurried from his own apartment across the way  you are not dining here sir he enquired  sir timothy shook his head  no i am dining late at the sanctuary he replied i just strolled over to see how the preparations were going on i shall be sleeping over there too any prowlers  photographer brought some steps and photographed the horses in the park from the top of the wall this afternoon sir the man announced jenkins let him go two or three pressmen sent in their cards to you but they were not allowed to pass the lodge  sir timothy nodded soon he left the house and crossed the park towards the sanctuary he was followed all the way by horses of which there were more than thirty in the great enclosure one mare greeted him with a neigh of welcome and plodded slowly after him another pressed her nose against his shoulder and walked by his side with his hand upon her neck sir timothy looked a little nervously around but the park itself lay almost like a deep green pool unobserved and invisible from anywhere except the house itself he spoke a few words to each of the horses and producing his key passed through the door in the wall into the sanctuary garden closing it quickly as he recognised francis standing under the cedartree  has lady cynthia arrived yet he enquired  not yet francis replied margaret will be here in a minute she told me to say that cocktails are here and that she has ordered dinner served on the terrace  excellent sir timothy murmured let me try one of your cigarettes  everything ready for the great show tomorrow night francis asked as he served the cocktails  everything is in order i wonder really sir timothy went on looking at francis curiously what you expect to see  i dont think we any of us have any definite idea francis replied we have all of course made our guesses  you will probably be disappointed sir timothy warned him for some reason or otherperhaps i have encouraged the ideapeople look upon my parties as mysterious orgies where things take place which may not be spoken of they are right to some extent i break the law without a doubt but i break it i am afraid in rather a disappointing fashion  a limousine covered in dust raced in at the open gates and came to a standstill with a grinding of brakes lady cynthia stepped lightly out and came across the lawn to them  i am hot and dusty and i was disagreeable she confided but the peace of this wonderful place and the sight of that beautiful silver thing have cheered me may i have a cocktail before i go up to change i am a little late i know she went on but that wretched gardenparty i thought my turn would never come to receive my few words mother would have been brokenhearted if i had left without them what slaves we are to royalty now shall i hurry and change you men have the air of wanting your dinner and i am rather that way myself you look tired dear host she added a little hesitatingly  the heat he answered  why you ever leave this spot i cant imagine she declared as she turned away with a lingering glance around it seems like paradise to come here and breathe this air london is like a furnace  the two men were alone again in francis pocket were the two documents which he had not yet made up his mind how to use margaret came out to them presently and he strolled away with her towards the rose garden  margaret he said is it my fancy or has there been a change in your father during the last few days  there is a change of some sort she admitted i cannot describe it i only know it is there he seems much more thoughtful and less hard the change would be an improvement she went on except that somehow or other it makes me feel uneasy it is as though he were grappling with some crisis  they came to a standstill at the end of the pergola where the masses of drooping roses made the air almost faint with their perfume margaret stretched out her hand plucked a handful of the creamy petals and held them against her cheek a thrush was singing noisily a few yards away they heard the soft swish of the river  tell me she asked curiously my father still speaks of you as being in some respects an enemy what does he mean  i will tell you exactly he answered the first time i ever spoke to your father i was dining at sotos i was talking to andrew wilmore it was only a short time after you had told me the story of oliver hilditch a story which made me realise the horror of spending ones life keeping men like that out of the clutch of the law  go on please she begged  well i was talking to andrew i told him that in future i should accept no case unless i not only believed in but was convinced of the innocence of my client i added that i was at war with crime i think perhaps i was so deeply in earnest that i may have sounded a little flamboyant at any rate your father who had overheard me moved up to our table i think he deduced from what i was saying that i was going to turn into a sort of amateur crimeinvestigator a person who i gathered later was particularly obnoxious to him at any rate he held out a challenge if you are a man who hates crime he said or something like it i am one who loves it he then went on to prophesy that a crime would be committed close to where we were within an hour or so and he challenged me to discover the assassin that night victor bidlake was murdered just outside sotos  i remember do you mean to tell me then margaret went on with a little shiver that father told you this was going to happen  he certainly did francis replied how his knowledge came i am not sureyet but he certainly knew  have you anything else against him she asked  there was the disappearance of andrew wilmores younger brother reginald wilmore i have no right to connect your father with that but shopland the scotland yard detective who has charge of the case seems to believe that the young man was brought into this neighbourhood and some other indirect evidence which came into my hands does seem to point towards your father being concerned in the matter i appealed to him at once but he only laughed at me that matter too remains a mystery  margaret was thoughtful for a moment then she turned towards the house they heard the soft ringing of the gong  will you believe me when i tell you this she begged as they passed arm in arm down the pergola i am terrified of my father though in many ways he is almost princely in his generosity and in the broad view he takes of things then his kindness to all dumb animals and the way they love him is the most amazing thing i ever knew if we were alone here tonight every animal in the house would be around his chair he has even the cats locked up if we have visitors so that no one shall see it but i am quite honest when i tell you thisi do not believe that my father has the ordinary outlook upon crime i believe that there is a good deal more of the old testament about him than the new  and this change which we were speaking about he asked lowering his voice as they reached the lawn  i believe that somehow or other the end is coming she said francis forgive me if i tell you thisor rather let me be forgivenbut i know of one crime my father has committed and it makes me fear that there may be others and i have the feeling somehow that the end is close at hand and that he feels it just as we might feel a thunderstorm in the air  i am going to prove the immemorial selfishness of my sex he whispered as they drew near the little table promise me one thing and i dont care if your father is beelzebub himself promise me that whatever happens it shall not make any difference to us  she smiled at him very wonderfully a smile which had to take the place of words for there were servants now within hearing and sir timothy himself was standing in the doorway     chapter xxxii   lady cynthia and sir timothy strolled after dinner to the bottom of the lawn and watched the punt which francis was propelling turn from the stream into the river  perfectly idyllic lady cynthia sighed  we have another punt her companion suggested  she shook her head  i am one of those unselfish people she declared whose idea of repose is not only to rest oneself but to see others rest i think these two chairs plenty of cigarettes and you in your most gracious and discoursive mood will fill my soul with content  your decision relieves my mind her companion declared as he arranged the cushions behind her back i rather fancy myself with a pair of sculls but a puntpole never appealed to me we will sit here and enjoy the peace tomorrow night you will find it all disturbedmusic and raucous voices and the stampede of my poor frightened horses in the park this is really a very gracious silence  are those two really going to marry lady cynthia asked moving her head lazily in the direction of the disappearing punt  i imagine so  and you what are you going to do then  i am planning a long cruise i telegraphed to southampton today i am having my yacht provisioned and prepared i think i shall go over to south america  she was silent for a moment  alone she asked presently  i am always alone he answered  that is rather a matter of your own choice is it not  perhaps so i have always found it hard to make friends enemies seem to be more in my line  i have not found it difficult to become your friend she reminded him  you are one of my few successes he replied  she leaned back with halfclosed eyes there was nothing new about their environmentthe clusters of roses the perfume of the lilies in the rock garden the even sweeter fragrance of the trim border of mignonette away in the distance the night was made momentarily ugly by the sound of a gramophone on a passing launch yet this discordant note seemed only to bring the perfection of present things closer back across the velvety lawn through the feathery strips of foliage the lights of the sanctuary shaded and subdued were dimly visible the diningtable under the cedartree had already been cleared hedges newly arrived from town to play the major domo was putting the finishing touches to a little array of cool drinks and beyond dimly seen but always there the wall she turned to him suddenly  you build a wall around your life she said like the wall which encircles your mystery house last night i thought that i could see a little way over the top tonight you are different  if i am different he answered quietly it is because for the first time for many years i have found myself wondering whether the life i had planned for myself the things which i had planned should make life for me are the best i have had doubtsperhaps i might say regrets  i should like to go to south america lady cynthia declared softly  he finished the cigarette which he was smoking and deliberately threw away the stump then he turned and looked at her his face seemed harder than ever cleancut the face of a man able to defy fate but she saw something in his eyes which she had never seen before  dear child he said if i could roll back the years if from all my deeds of sin as the world knows sin i could cancel one there is nothing in the world would make me happier than to ask you to come with me as my cherished companion to just whatever part of the world you cared for but i have been playing pitch and toss with fortune all my life since the great trouble came which changed me so much even at this moment the coin is in the air which may decide my fate  you mean she ventured  i mean he continued that after the event of which we spoke last night nothing in life has been more than an incident and i have striven to find distraction by means which none of younot even you lady cynthia with all your breadth of outlook and all your craving after new thingswould justify  nothing that you may have done troubles me in the least she assured him i do wish that you could put it all out of your mind and let me help you to make a fresh start  i may put the thing itself out of my mind he answered sadly but the consequences remain  there is a consequence which threatens she asked  he was silent for a moment when he spoke again he had recovered all his courage  there is the coin in the air of which i spoke he replied let us forget it for a moment of the minor things i will make you my judge ledsam and margaret are coming to my party tomorrow night you too shall be my guest such secrets as lie on the other side of that wall shall be yours after that if i survive your judgment of them and if the coin which i have thrown into the air comes down to the tune i callafter thati will remind you of something which happened last nightof something which if i live for many years i shall never forget  she leaned towards him her eyes were heavy with longing her arms sweet and white in the dusky twilight stole hesitatingly out  last night was so long ago wont you take a later memory  once again she lay in his arms still and content  as they crossed the lawn an hour or so later they were confronted by hedgeswho hastened in fact to meet them  you are being asked for on the telephone sir he announced it is a trunk call i have switched it through to the study  any name sir timothy asked indifferently  the man hesitated his eyes sought his masters respectfully but charged with meaning  the person refuses to give his name sir but i fancied that i recognised his voice i think it would be as well for you to speak sir  lady cynthia sank into a chair  you shall go and answer your telephone call she said and leave hedges to serve me with one of these strange drinks i believe i see some of my favourite orangeade  sir timothy made his way into the house and into the low oakbeamed study with its dark furniture and latticed windows the telephone bell began to ring again as he entered he took up the receiver  sir timothy a rather hoarse strained voice asked  i am speaking sir timothy replied who is it  the man at the other end spoke as though he were out of breath nevertheless what he said was distinct enough  i am john walter  well  i am just ringing you up the voice went on to give you whats called a sporting chance theres a boat from southampton midday tomorrow if youre wise youll catch it or better still get off on your own yacht they carry a wireless now these big steamers dont give a criminal much of a chance does it  i am to understand then sir timothy said calmly that you have laid your information  ive parted with it and serve you right was the bitter reply im not saying that youre not a brave man sir timothy but theres such a thing as being foolhardy and thats what you are i wasnt asking you for half your fortune nor even a dab of it but if your life wasnt worth a few hundred poundsyou with all that moneywell it wasnt worth saving so now you know ive spent ninepence to give you a chance to hop it because i met a gent who has been good to me ive had a good dinner and i feel merciful so there you are  do i gather sir timothy asked in a perfectly level tone that the deed is already done  its already done and done thoroughly was the uncompromising answer im not ringing up to ask you to change your mind if you were to offer me five thousand now or ten i couldnt stop the bally thing youve a sporting chance of getting away if you start at once thats all there is to it  you have nothing more to say  nothing only i wish to god id never stepped into that mayfair agency i wish id never gone to mrs hilditchs as a temporary butler i wish id never seen any one of you thats all you can go to hell which way you like only if you take my advice youll go by the way of south america the scaffold isnt every mans fancy  there was a burr of the instrument and then silence sir timothy carefully replaced the receiver paused on his way out of the room to smell a great bowl of lavender and passed back into the garden  more applicants for invitations lady cynthia enquired lazily  her host smiled  not exactly although he added as a matter of fact my party would have been perhaps a little more complete with the presence of the person to whom i have been speaking  lady cynthia pointed to the stream down which the punt was slowly drifting the moon had gone behind a cloud and francis figure as he stood there was undefined and ghostly a thought seemed to flash into her mind she leaned forward  once she said he told me that he was your enemy  the term is a little melodramatic sir timothy protested we look at certain things from opposite points of view you see my prospective soninlaw if ever he becomes that represents the lawthe law with a capital lwhich recognises no human errors or weaknesses and judges crime out of the musty books of the lawgivers of old he makes of the law a mechanical thing which can neither bend nor give and he judges humanity from the same standpoint yet at heart he is a good fellow and i like him  and you  my weakness lies the other way he confessed and my sympathy is with those who do not fear to make their own laws  she held out her hand white and spectral in the momentary gloom at the other end of the lawn francis and margaret were disembarking from the punt  does it sound too shockingly obvious she murmured if i say that i want to make you my law     chapter xxxiii   it would have puzzled anybody except perhaps lady cynthia herself to have detected the slightest alteration in sir timothys demeanour during the following day when he made fitful appearances at the sanctuary or at the dinner which was served a little earlier than usual before his final departure for the scene of the festivities once he paused in the act of helping himself to some dish and listened for a moment to the sound of voices in the hall and when a taxicab drove up he set down his glass and again betrayed some interest  the maid with my frock thank heavens lady cynthia announced glancing out of the window my last anxiety is removed i am looking forward now to a wonderful night  you may very easily be disappointed her host warned her my entertainments appeal more as a rule to men  why dont you be thoroughly original and issue no invitations to women at all margaret enquired  for the same reason that you adorn your rooms and the dinnertable with flowers he answered one needs themas a relief apart from that i am really proud of my dancingroom and there again you see your sex is necessary  we are flattered margaret declared with a little bow it does seem queer to think that you should own what cynthias cousin davy hinton once told me was the best floor in london and that i have never danced on it  nor i lady cynthia put in there might have been some excuse for not asking you margaret but why an ultrabohemian like myself has had to beg and plead for an invitation i really cannot imagine  you might find sir timothy said you may even nowthat some of my men guests are not altogether to your liking  quite content to take my risk lady cynthia declared cheerfully the man with the best manners i ever metit was at one of maggies studio dances toowas a bookmaker and a retired prizefighter brought me home once from an albert hall dance  how did he behave francis asked  he was wistful but restrained lady cynthia replied quite the gentleman in fact  you encourage me to hope for the best sir timothy said rising to his feet you will excuse me now i have a few final preparations to make  are we to be allowed margaret enquired to come across the park  you would not find it convenient her father assured her you had better order a car say for ten oclock dont forget to bring your cards of invitation and find me immediately you arrive i wish to direct your proceedings to some extent  lady cynthia strolled across with him to the posterngate and stood by his side after he had opened it several of the animals grazing in different parts of the park pricked up their ears at the sound an old mare came hobbling towards him a fleabitten grey came trotting down the field his head in the air neighing loudly  you waste a great deal of tenderness upon your animal friends dear host she murmured  he deliberately looked away from her  the reciprocation at any rate has its disadvantages he remarked glancing a little disconsolately at the brown hairs upon his coatsleeve i shall have to find another coat before i can receive my guestswhich is a further reason he added why i must hurry  at the entrance to the great gates of the walled house two men in livery were standing one of them examined with care the red cards of invitation and as soon as he was satisfied the gates were opened by some unseen agency the moment the car had passed through they were closed again  father seems thoroughly mediaeval over this business margaret remarked looking about her with interest what a quaint courtyard too it really is quite italian  it seems almost incredible that you have never been here lady cynthia exclaimed curiosity would have brought me if i had had to climb over the wall  it does seem absurd in one way margaret agreed but as a matter of fact my fathers attitude about the place has always rather set me against it i didnt feel that there was any pleasure to be gained by coming here i wont tell you really what i did think we must keep to our bargain we are not to anticipate  at the front entrance under the covered portico the white tickets which they had received in exchange for their tickets of invitation were carefully collected by another man who stopped the car a few yards from the broad curving steps after that there was no more suggestion of inhospitality the front doors which were of enormous size and height seemed to have been removed and in the great domed hall beyond sir timothy was already receiving his guests being without wraps the little party made an immediate entrance sir timothy who was talking to one of the bestknown of the foreign ambassadors took a step forward to meet them  welcome he said you the most unique party at least amongst my guests prince may i present you to my daughter mrs hilditch lady cynthia milton and mr ledsam you know i believe  your father has just been preparing me for this pleasure the prince remarked with a smile i am delighted that his views as regards these wonderful parties are becoming a little morewould it be correct to say latitudinarian he has certainly been very strict up to now  it is the first time i have been vouchsafed an invitation margaret confessed  you will find much to interest you the prince observed for myself i love the sport of which your father is so noble a patron that without doubt though is a side of his entertainment of which you will know nothing  sir timothy choosing a moments respite from the inflowing stream of guests came once more across to them  i am going to leave you my honoured guests from the sanctuary he said with a faint smile to yourselves for a short time in the room to your left supper is being served in front is the dancinggallery to the right as you see is the lounge leading into the wintergarden the gymnasium is closed until midnight any other part of the place please explore at your leisure but i am going to ask you one thing i want you to meet me in a room which i will show you at a quarter to twelve  he led them down one of the corridors which opened from the hall before the first door on the right a manservant was standing as though on sentry duty sir timothy tapped the panel of the door with his forefinger  this is my sanctum he announced i allow no one in here without special permission i find it useful to have a place to which one can come and rest quite quietly sometimes williams here has no other duty except to guard the entrance williams you will allow this gentleman and these two ladies to pass in at a quarter to twelve  the man looked at them searchingly  certainly sir he said no one else  no one under any pretext  sir timothy hurried back to the hall and the others followed him in more leisurely fashion they were all three full of curiosity  i never dreamed margaret declared as she looked around her that i should ever find myself inside this house it has always seemed to me like one great bluebeards chamber if ever my father spoke of it at all it was as of a place which he intended to convert into a sort of miniature hell  sir timothy leaned back to speak to them as they passed  you will find a friend over there ledsam he said  wilmore turned around and faced them the two men exchanged somewhat surprised greetings  no idea that i was coming until this afternoon wilmore explained i got my card at five oclock with a note from sir timothys secretary i am racking my brains to imagine what it can mean  were all a little addled francis confessed come and join our tour of exploration you know lady cynthia let me present you to mrs hilditch  the introduction was effected and they all strolled on together margaret and lady cynthia led the way into the wintergarden a palace of glass tall palms banks of exotics flowering shrubs of every description and a fountain with wonderfully carved water nymphs brought with its basin from italy hidden in the foliage a small orchestra was playing very softly the atmosphere of the place was languorous and delicious  leave us here margaret insisted with a little exclamation of content neither cynthia nor i want to go any further come back and fetch us in time for our appointment  the two men wandered off the place was indeed a marvel of architecture a country house of which only the shell remained modernised and made wonderful by the genius of a great architect the first room which they entered when they left the wintergarden was as large as a small restaurant panelled in cream colour with a marvellous ceiling there were tables of various sizes laid for supper rows of champagne bottles in ice buckets and servants eagerly waiting for orders already a sprinkling of the guests had found their way here the two men crossed the floor to the cocktail bar in the far corner behind which a familiar face grinned at them it was jimmy the bartender from sotos who stood there with a wonderful array of bottles on a walnut table  if it were not a perfectly fatuous question i should ask what you were doing here jimmy francis remarked  i always come for sir timothys big parties sir jimmy explained your first visit isnt it sir  my first francis assented  and mine his companion echoed  what can i have the pleasure of making for you sir the man enquired  a difficult question francis admitted it is barely an hour and a half since we finished diner on the other hand we are certainly going to have some supper some time or other  jimmy nodded understandingly  leave it to me sir he begged  he served them with a foaming white concoction in tall glasses a genuine lime bobbed up and down in the liquid  sir timothy has the limes sent over from his own estate in south america jimmy announced you will find some things in that drink you dont often taste  the two men sipped their beverage and pronounced it delightful jimmy leaned a little across the table  a big thing on tonight isnt there sir he asked cautiously  is there francis replied you mean  jimmy motioned towards the open window close to which the river was flowing by  you going down sir  francis shook his head dubiously  where to  the bartender looked with narrowed eyes from one to the other of the two men then he suddenly froze up wilmore leaned a little further over the impromptu counter  jimmy he asked what goes on here besides dancing and boxing and gambling  i never heard of any gambling jimmy answered shaking his head sir timothy doesnt care about cards being played here at all  what is the principal entertainment then francis demanded the boxing  the bartender shook his head  no one understands very much about this house sir he said except that it offers the most wonderful entertainment in europe that is for the guests to find out though we servants have to attend to our duties will you let me mix you another drink sir  no thanks francis answered the last was too good to spoil but you havent answered my question jimmy what did you mean when you asked if we were going down  jimmys face had become wooden  i meant nothing sir he said sorry i spoke  the two men turned away they recognised many acquaintances in the supperroom and in the long gallery beyond where many couples were dancing now to the music of a wonderful orchestra by slow stages they made their way back to the wintergarden where lady cynthia and margaret were still lost in admiration of their surroundings they all walked the whole length of the place beyond down a flight of stone steps was a short paved way to the river a large electric launch was moored at the quay the grounds outside were dimly illuminated with cunninglyhidden electric lights shining through purplecoloured globes into the cloudy darkness in the background enveloping the whole of the house and reaching to the river on either side the great wall loomed up unlit menacing almost in its suggestions a couple of loiterers stood within a few yards of them looking at the launch  there she is ready for her errand whatever it may be one said to the other curiously we couldnt play the stowaway i suppose could we  dicky bell did that once the other answered sir timothy has only one way with intruders he was thrown into the river and jolly nearly drowned  the two men passed out of hearing  i wonder what part the launch plays in the nights entertainment wilmore observed  francis shrugged his shoulders  i have given up wondering he said margaret do you hear that music  she laughed  are we really to dance she murmured do you want to make a girl of me again  well i shouldnt be a magician should i he answered  they passed into the ballroom and danced for some time the music was seductive and perfect without any of the blatant notes of too many of the popular orchestras the floor seemed to sway under their feet  this is a new joy come back into life margaret exclaimed as they rested for a moment  the first of many he assured her  they stood in the archway between the wintergarden and the dancinggallery from which they could command a view of the passing crowds francis scanned the faces of the men and women with intense interest many of them were known to him by sight others were strangers there was a judge a cabinet minister various members of the aristocracy a sprinkling from the foreign legations and although the stage was not largely represented there were one or two wellknown actors the guests seemed to belong to no universal social order but to francis watching them almost eagerly they all seemed to have something of the same expression the same slight air of weariness of restless and unsatisfied desires  i cant believe that the place is real or that these people we see are not supers margaret whispered  i feel every moment that a clock will strike and that it will all fade away  im afraid im too material for such imaginings francis replied but there is a quaintly artificial air about it all we must go and look for wilmore and lady cynthia  they turned back into the enervating atmosphere of the wintergarden and came suddenly face to face with sir timothy who had escorted a little party of his guests to see the fountain and was now returning alone  you have been dancing i am glad to see the latter observed i trust that you are amusing yourselves  excellently thank you francis replied  and so far sir timothy went on with a faint smile you find my entertainment normal you have no question yet which you would like to ask  only onewhat do you do with your launch up the river on moonless nights sir timothy  sir timothys momentary silence was full of ominous significance  mr ledsam he said after a brief pause i have given you almost carte blanche to explore my domains here concerning the launch however i think that you had better ask no questions at present  you are using it tonight francis persisted  will you come and see my venturesome guest  with great pleasure was the prompt reply  sir timothy glanced at his watch  that he said is one of the matters of which we will speak at a quarter to twelve meanwhile let me show you something it may amuse you as it has done me  the three moved back towards one of the arched openings which led into the ballroom  observe if you please their host continued the third couple who pass us the girl is wearing greenthe very little that she does wear watch the man and see if he reminds you of any one  francis did as he was bidden the girl was a wellknown member of the chorus of one of the principal musical comedies and she seemed to be thoroughly enjoying both the dance and her partner the latter appeared to be of a somewhat ordinary type sallow with rather puffy cheeks and eyes almost unnaturally dark he danced vigorously and he talked all the time something about him was vaguely familiar to francis but he failed to place him  notwithstanding all my precautions sir timothy continued there fondly believing himself to be unnoticed is an emissary of scotland yard really of all the obvious the dryasdust huntyourcriminalbyruleofthree kind of people i ever met the class of detective to which this man belongs can produce the most blatant examples  what are you going to do about him francis asked  sir timothy shrugged his shoulders  i have not yet made up my mind he said i happen to know that he has been laying his plans for weeks to get here frequenting sotos and other restaurants and scraping acquaintances with some of my friends the duke of tadchester brought himwon a few hundreds from him at baccarat i suppose his grace will never again find these doors open to him  francis attention had wandered he was gazing fixedly at the man whom sir timothy had pointed out  you still do not fully recognise our friend the latter observed carelessly he calls himself manuel loito and he professes to be a cuban his real name i understood when you introduced us to be shopland  great heavens so it is francis exclaimed  let us leave him to his precarious pleasures sir timothy suggested i am free for a few moments we will wander round together  they found lady cynthia and wilmore and looked in at the supperroom where people were waiting now for tables a babel of sound and gaiety the grounds and wintergardens were crowded their guide led the way to a large apartment on the other side of the hall from which the sound of music was proceeding  my theatre he said i wonder what is going on  they passed inside there was a small stage with steps leading down to the floor easychairs and round tables everywhere and waiters serving refreshments a girl was dancing sir timothy watched her approvingly  nadia ellistoff he told them she was in the last russian ballet and she is waiting now for the rest of the company to start again at covent garden you see it is metzger who plays there they improvise rather a wonderful performance i think  they watched her breathlessly a spirit in grey tulle with great black eyes now and then half closed  it is wind before dawn lady cynthia whispered i heard him play it two days after he composed it only there are variations now she is the soul of the south wind  the curtain went down amidst rapturous applause the dancer had left the stage floating away into some sort of wonderfullycontrived nebulous background within a few moments the principal comedian of the day was telling stories sir timothy led them away  but how on earth do you get all these people lady cynthia asked  it is arranged for me sir timothy replied i have an agent who sees to it all every man or woman who is asked to perform has a credit at cartiers for a hundred guineas i pay no fees they select some little keepsake  margaret laughed softly  no wonder they call this place a sort of arabian nights she declared  well there isnt much else for you to see sir timothy said thoughtfully my gymnasium which is one of the principal features here is closed just now for a special performance of which i will speak in a moment the concert hall i see they are using for an overflow danceroom what you have seen with the grounds and the wintergarden comprises almost everything  they moved back through the hall with difficulty people were now crowding in lady cynthia laughed softly  why it is like a gala night at the opera sir timothy she exclaimed how dare you pretend that this is bohemia  it has never been i who have described my entertainments he reminded her they have been called everythingorgies debaucheseverything you can think of i have never ventured myself to describe them  their passage was difficult every now and then sir timothy was compelled to shake hands with some of his newlyarriving guests at last however they reached the little sittingroom sir timothy turned back to wilmore who hesitated  you had better come in too mr wilmore if you will he invited you were with ledsam the first day we met and something which i have to say now may interest you  if i am not intruding wilmore murmured  they entered the room still jealously guarded sir timothy closed the door behind them     chapter xxxiv   the apartment was one belonging to the older portion of the house and had been in fact an annex to the great library the walls were oakpanelled and hung with a collection of old prints there were some easychairs a writingtable and some wellladen bookcases there were one or two bronze statues of gladiators a wonderful study of two wrestlers no minor ornaments sir timothy plunged at once into what he had to say  i promised you lady cynthia and you ledsam he said to divulge exactly the truth as regards these muchtalkedof entertainments here you margaret under present circumstances are equally interested you wilmore are ledsams friend and you happen to have an interest in this particular party therefore i am glad to have you all here together the superficial part of my entertainment you have seen the part which renders it necessary for me to keep closed doors i shall now explain i give prizes here of considerable value for boxing contests which are conducted under rules of our own one is due to take place in a very few minutes the contests vary in character but i may say that the chief officials of the national sporting club are usually to be found here only of course in an unofficial capacity the difference between the contests arranged by me and others is that my men are here to fight they use sometimes an illegal weight of glove and they sometimes hurt one another if any two of the boxing fraternity have a grudge against one another and that often happens they are permitted here to fight it out under the strictest control as regards fairness but practically without gloves at all you heard of the accident for instance to norris that happened in my gymnasium he was knocked out by burgin it was a wonderful fight  however i pass on there is another class of contest which frequently takes place here two boxers place themselves unreservedly in my hands the details of the match are arranged without their knowledge they come into the ring without knowing whom they are going to fight sometimes they never know for my men wear masks then we have private matches there is one tonight lord meadowson and i have a wager of a thousand guineas he has brought tonight from the east end a boxer who according to the terms of our bet has never before engaged in a professional contest i have brought an amateur under the same conditions the weight is within a few pounds the same neither has ever seen the other only in this case the fight is with regulation gloves and under queensberry rules  who is your amateur sir timothy wilmore asked harshly  your brother mr wilmore was the prompt reply you shall see the fight if i have your promise not to attempt in any way to interfere  wilmore rose to his feet  do you mean to tell me he demanded that my brother has been decoyed here kept here against his will to provide amusement for your guests  mr wilmore i beg that you will be reasonable sir timothy expostulated i saw your brother box at his gymnasium in holborn my agent made him the offer of this fight one of my conditions had to be that he came here to train and that whilst he was here he held no communication whatever with the outside world my trainer has ideas of his own and this he insists upon your brother in the end acquiesced he was at first difficult to deal with as regards this condition and he did in fact i believe mr ledsam pay a visit to your office with the object of asking you to become an intermediary between him and his relatives  he began a letter to me francis interposed and then mysteriously disappeared  the mystery is easily explained sir timothy continued my trainer roger hagon a varsity blue and the best heavyweight of his year occupies the chambers above yours he saw from the window the arrival of reginald wilmorewhich was according to instructions as they were to come down to hatch end togetherwent down the stairs to meet him and to cut a long story short fetched him out of your office ledsam without allowing him to finish his letter this absolute isolation seems a curious condition perhaps but hagon insists upon it and i can assure you that he knows his business the mystery as you have termed it of his disappearance that morning is that he went upstairs with hagon for several hours to undergo a medical examination instead of leaving the building forthwith  queer thing i never thought of hagon francis remarked as a matter of fact i never see him in the temple and i thought that he had left  may i ask wilmore intervened when my brother will be free to return to his home  tonight directly the fight is over sir timothy replied should he be successful he will take with him a sum of money sufficient to start him in any business he chooses to enter  wilmore frowned slightly  but surely he protested that would make him a professional pugilist  not at all sir timothy replied for one thing the match is a private one in a private house and for another the money is a gift there is no purse if your brother loses he gets nothing will you see the fight mr wilmore  yes i will see it was the somewhat reluctant assent  you will give me your word not to interfere in any way  i shall not interfere wilmore promised if they are wearing regulation gloves and the weights are about equal and the conditions are what you say it is the last thing i should wish to do  capital sir timothy exclaimed now to pass on there is one other feature of my entertainments concerning which i have something to saya series of performances which takes place on my launch at odd times there is one fixed for tonight i can say little about it except that it is unusual i am going to ask you lady cynthia and you ledsam to witness it when you have seen that you know everything then you and i ledsam can call one anothers hands i shall have something else to say to you but that is outside the doings here  are we to see the fight in the gymnasium lady cynthia enquired  sir timothy shook his head  i do not allow women there under any conditions he said you and margaret had better stay here whilst that takes place it will probably be over in twenty minutes it will be time then for us to find our way to the launch after that if you have any appetite supper i will order some caviare sandwiches for you sir timothy went on ringing the bell and some wine  lady cynthia smiled  it is really a very wonderful party she murmured  their host ushered the two men across the hall now comparatively deserted for every one had settled down to his or her chosen amusementdown a long passage through a private door which he unlocked with a yale key and into the gymnasium there were less than fifty spectators seated around the ring and francis glancing at them hastily fancied that he recognised nearly every one of them there was baker a judge a couple of actors lord meadowson the most renowned of sporting peers and a dozen who followed in his footsteps a little man who had once been amateur champion in the bantam class and who was now considered the finest judge of boxing in the world a theatrical manager the present amateur boxing champion and a sprinkling of others sir timothy and his companions took their chairs amidst a buzz of welcome almost immediately the man who was in charge of the proceedings and whose name was harrison rose from his place  gentlemen he said this is a sporting contest but one under usual rules and usual conditions an amateur who tips the scales at twelve stone seven who has never engaged in a boxing contest in his life is matched against a young man from a different sphere of life who intends to adopt the ring as his profession but who has never as yet fought in public names gentlemen as you know are seldom mentioned here i will only say that the first in the ring is the nominee of our friend and host sir timothy brast second comes the nominee of lord meadowson  wilmore notwithstanding his preknowledge gave a little gasp the young man who stood now within a few yards of him carelessly swinging his gloves in his hand was without a doubt his missing brother he looked well and in the pink of condition not only well but entirely confident and at his ease his opponent on the other hand a sturdier man a few inches shorter was nervous and awkward though none the less determinedlooking sir timothy rose and whispered in harrisons ear the latter nodded in a very few moments the preliminaries were concluded the fight begun     chapter xxxv   francis glad of a moment or twos solitude in which to rearrange his somewhat distorted sensations found an empty space in the stern of the launch and stood leaning over the rail his pulses were still tingling with the indubitable excitement of the last halfhour it was all there even now before his eyes like a cinematograph picturethe duel between those two men a duel of knowledge of strength of science of courage from beginning to end there had been no moment when francis had felt that he was looking on at what was in any way a degrading or immoral spectacle each man had fought in his way to win young wilmore graceful as a panther with a keen joyous desire of youth for supremacy written in his face and in the dogged lines of his mouth the budding champion from the east end less graceful perhaps but with even more strength and at least as much determination had certainly done his best to justify his selection there were no points to be scored there had been no undue feinting no holding few of the tricks of the professional ring it was a fight to a finish or until harrison gave the word and the better man had won but even that knockout blow which reggie wilmore had delivered after a wonderful feint had had little that was cruel in it there was something beautiful almost in the strength and grace with which it had been deliveredthe breathless eagerness the waiting the end  francis felt a touch upon his arm and looked around a tall sadfaced looking woman whom he had noticed with a vague sense of familiarity in the dancingroom was standing by his side  you have forgotten me mr ledsam she said  for the moment he admitted  i am isabel culbridge she told him watching his face  lady isabel francis repeated incredulously but surely  better not contradict me she interrupted look again  francis looked again  i am very sorry he said it is some time is it not since we met  she stood by his side and for a few moments neither of them spoke the little orchestra in the bows had commenced to play softly but there was none of the merriment amongst the handful of men and women generally associated with a midnight river picnic the moon was temporarily obscured and it seemed as though some artists hand had so dealt with the few electric lights that the men with their pale faces and white shirtfronts and the three or four women most of them as it happened wearing black were like some ghostly figures in some sombre procession only the music kept up the pretence that this was in any way an ordinary excursion amongst the human element there was an air of tenseness which seemed rather to increase as they passed into the shadowy reaches of the river  you have been ill i am afraid francis said tentatively  if you will she answered but my illness is of the soul i have become one of a type she went on of which you will find many examples here we started life thinking that it was clever to despise the conventional and the known and to seek always for the daring and the unknown new experiences were what we craved for i married a wonderful husband i broke his heart and still looked for new things i had a daughter of whom i was fondshe ran away with my chauffeur and left me a son whom i adored and he was killed in the war a lover who told me that he worshipped me who spent every penny i had and made me the laughingstock of town i am still looking for new things  sir timothys parties are generally supposed to provide them francis observed  the woman shrugged her shoulders  so far they seem very much like anybodys else she said the fight might have been amusing but no women were allowed the rest was very wonderful in its way but that is all i am still hoping for what we are to see downstairs  they heard sir timothys voice a few yards away and turned to look at him he had just come from below and had paused opposite a man who had been standing a little apart from the others one of the few who was wearing an overcoat as though he felt the cold in the background were the two servants who had guarded the gangway  mr manuel loito sir timothy saidor shall i say mr shoplandmy invited guests are welcome i have only one method of dealing with uninvited ones  the two men suddenly stepped forward shopland made no protest attempted no struggle they lifted him off his feet as though he were a baby and a moment later there was a splash in the water they threw a lifebelt after him  always humane you see sir timothy remarked as he leaned over the side ah i see that even in his overcoat our friend is swimmer enough to reach the bank you find our methods harsh ledsam he asked turning a challenging gaze towards the latter  francis who had been watching shopland come to the surface shrugged his shoulders he delayed answering for a moment while he watched the detective disdaining the lifebelt swim to the opposite shore  i suppose that under the circumstances francis said he was prepared to take his risk  you should know best about that sir timothy rejoined i wonder whether you would mind looking after lady cynthia i shall be busy for a few moments  francis stepped across the deck towards where lady cynthia had been sitting by her hosts side they had passed into the mouth of a treehung strip of the river the engine was suddenly shut off a gong was sounded there was a murmur almost a sob of relief as the little sprinkling of men and women rose hastily to their feet and made their way towards the companionway downstairs in the saloon with its white satinwood panels and rows of swing chairs heavy curtains were drawn across the portholes all outside light was shut out from the place at the further end raised slightly from the floor was a sanded circle sir timothy made his way to one of the pillars by its side and turned around to face the little company of his guests his voice though it seemed scarcely raised above a whisper was extraordinarily clear and distinct even francis who with lady cynthia had found seats only just inside the door could hear every word he said  my friends he began you have often before been my guests at such small fights as we have been able to arrange in as unorthodox a manner as possible between professional boxers there has been some novelty about them but on the last occasion i think it was generally observed that they had become a little too professional a little ultrascientific there was something which they lacked with that something i am hoping to provide you tonight thank you sir edgar he murmured leaning down towards his neighbour  he held his cigarette in the flame of a match which the other had kindled francis who was watching intently was puzzled at the expression with which for a moment as he straightened himself sir timothy glanced down the room seeking for lady cynthias eyes in a sense it was as though he were seeking for something he neededapprobation sympathy understanding  our hobby as you know has been reality he continued that is what we have not always been able to achieve tonight i offer you reality there are two men here one an east end coster the other an italian until lately associated with an itinerant vehicle of musical production these two men have not outlived sensation as i fancy so many of us have they hate one another to the death i forget their surnames but guiseppe has stolen jims girl is living with her at the present moment and proposes to keep her jim has sworn to have the lives of both of them jims career in its way is interesting to us he has spent already six years in prison for manslaughter and a year for a brutal assault upon a constable guiseppe was tried in his native country for a particularly fiendish murder and escaped owing i believe to some legal technicality that however has nothing to do with the matter these men have sworn to fight to the death and the girl i understand is willing to return to jim if he should be successful or to remain with guiseppe if he should show himself able to retain her the fight between these men my friends has been transferred from seven dials for your entertainment it will take place before you here and now  there was a little shiver amongst the audience francis almost to his horror was unable to resist the feeling of queer excitement which stole through his veins a few yards away lady isabel seemed to have become transformed she was leaning forward in her chair her eyes glowing her lips parted rejuvenated dehumanised francis immediate companion however rather surprised him her eyes were fixed intently upon sir timothys she seemed to have been weighing every word he had spoken there was none of that hungry pleasure in her face which shone from the other womans and was reflected in the faces of many of the others she seemed to be bracing herself for a shock sir timothy looked over his shoulder towards the door which opened upon the sanded space  you can bring your men along he directed  one of the attendants promptly made his appearance he was holding tightly by the arm a man of apparently thirty years of age shabbily dressed barefooted without collar or necktie with a mass of black hair which looked as though it had escaped the care of any barber for many weeks his complexion was sallow he had high cheekbones and a receding chin which gave him rather the appearance of a fox he shrank a little from the lights as though they hurt his eyes and all the time he looked furtively back to the door through which in a moment or two his rival was presently escorted the latter was a young man of stockier build illconditioned and with the brutal face of the lowest of his class two of his front teeth were missing and there was a livid mark on the side of his cheek he looked neither to the right nor to the left his eyes were fixed upon the other man and they looked death  the gentleman who first appeared sir timothy observed stepping up into the sanded space but still half facing the audience is guiseppe the lothario of this little act the other is jim the wronged husband you know their story now jim he added turning towards the englishman i put in your trousers pocket these notes two hundred pounds you will perceive i place in the trousers pocket of guiseppe here notes to the same amount i understand you have a little quarrel to fight out the one who wins will naturally help himself to the others money together with that other little reward which i imagine was the first cause of your quarrel now let them go  sir timothy resumed his seat and leaned back in leisurely fashion the two attendants solemnly released their captives there was a moments intense silence the two men seemed fencing for position there was something stealthy and horrible about their movements as they crept around one another francis realised what it was almost as the little sobbing breath from those of the audience who still retained any emotion showed him that they too foresaw what was going to happen both men had drawn knives from their belts it was murder which had been let loose  francis found himself almost immediately upon his feet his whole being seemed crying out for interference lady cynthias deathwhite face and pleading eyes seemed like the echo of his own passionate aversion to what was taking place then he met sir timothys gaze across the room and he remembered his promise under no conditions was he to protest or interfere he set his teeth and resumed his seat the fight went on there were little sobs and tremors of excitement strange banks of silence both men seemed out of condition the sound of their hoarse breathing was easily heard against the curtain of spellbound silence for a time their knives stabbed the empty air but from the first the end seemed certain the englishman attacked wildly his adversary waited his time content with avoiding the murderous blows struck at him striving all the time to steal underneath the others guard and then almost without warning it was all over jim was on his back in a crumpled heap there was a horrid stain upon his coat the other man was kneeling by his side hate glaring out of his eyes guiding all the time the rising and falling of his knife there was one more shriekthen silence only the sound of the victors breathing as he rose slowly from his ghastly task sir timothy rose to his feet and waved his hand the curtain went down  on deck if you please ladies and gentlemen he said calmly  no one stirred a woman began to sob a fat unhealthylooking man in front of francis reeled over in a dead faint two other of the guests near had risen from their seats and were shouting aimlessly like lunatics even francis was conscious of that temporary imprisonment of the body due to his lacerated nerves only the clinging of lady cynthia to his arm kept him from rushing from the spot  you are faint he whispered hoarsely  upstairsair she faltered  they rose to their feet the sound of sir timothys voice reached them as they ascended the stairs  on deck every one if you please he insisted refreshments are being served there there are inquisitive people who watch my launch and it is inadvisable to remain here long  people hurried out then as though their one desire was to escape from the scene of the tragedy lady cynthia still clinging to francis arm led him to the furthermost corner of the launch there were real tears in her eyes her breath was coming in little sobs  oh it was horrible she cried horrible mr ledsami cant help iti never want to speak to sir timothy again  one final horror arrested for a moment the sound of voices there was a dull splash in the river something had been thrown overboard the orchestra began to play dance music conversation suddenly burst out every one was hysterical a peer of the realm redeyed and shaking like an aspen leaf was drinking champagne out of the bottle every one seemed to be trying to outvie the other in loud conversation in outrageous mirth lady isabel with a glass of champagne in her hand leaned back towards francis  well she asked how are you feeling mr ledsam  as though i had spent halfanhour in hell he answered  she screamed with laughter  hear this man she called out who will send any poor ragamuffin to the gallows if his fee is large enough of course she added turning back to him i ought to remember you are a normal person and tonights entertainment was not for normal persons for myself i am grateful to sir timothy for a few moments of this aching aftermath of life i forgot  suddenly all the lights around the launch flamed out the music stopped sir timothy came up on deck on either side of him was a man in ordinary dinner clothes the babel of voices ceased everyone was oppressed by some vague likeness a breathless silence ensued  ladies and gentlemen sir timothy said and once more the smile upon his lips assumed its most mocking curve let me introduce you to the two artists who have given us tonight such a realistic performance signor guiseppe elito and signor carlos marlini i had the good fortune he went on to witness this very marvellous performance in a small musichall at palermo and i was able to induce the two actors to pay us a visit over here steward these gentlemen will take a glass of champagne  the two sicilians raised their glasses and bowed expectantly to the little company they received however a much greater tribute to their performance than the applause which they had been expecting there reigned everywhere a deadly stupefied silence only a halfstifled sob broke from lady cynthias lips as she leaned over the rail her face buried in her hands her whole frame shaking     chapter xxxvi   francis and margaret sat in the rose garden on the following morning their conversation was a little disjointed as the conversation of lovers in a secluded and beautiful spot should be but they came back often to the subject of sir timothy  if i have misunderstood your father francis declared and i admit that i have it has been to some extent his own fault to me he was always the deliberate scoffer against any code of morals a rebel against the law even if not a criminal in actual deeds i honestly believed that the walled house was the scene of disreputable orgies that your father was behind fairfax in that coldblooded murder and that he was responsible in some sinister way for the disappearance of reggie wilmore most of these things seem to have been shams like the fight last night  she moved uneasily in her place  i am glad i did not see that she said with a shiver  i think he went on that the reason why your father insisted upon lady cynthias and my presence there was that he meant it as a sort of allegory half the vices in life he claims are unreal  margaret passed her arm through his and leaned a little towards him  if you knew just one thing i have never told you she confided i think that you would feel sorry for him i do more and more every day because in a way that one thing is my fault  notwithstanding the warm sunshine she suddenly shivered francis took her hands in his they were cold and lifeless  i know that one thing dear he told her quietly  she looked at him stonily there was a questioning fear in her eyes  you know  i know that your fattier killed oliver hilditch  she suddenly broke out into a stream of words there was passion in her tone and in her eyes she was almost the accuser  my father was right then she exclaimed he told me this morning that he believed that it was to you or to your friend at scotland yard that walter had told his story but you dont know you dont know how terrible the temptation was howyou see i say it quite coollyhow oliver hilditch deserved to die he was trusted by my father in south america and he deceived him he forged the letters which induced me to marry him it was part of his scheme of revenge this was the first time we had any of us met since i told my father the truth that afternoon he knew for the first time how my marriage came about my husband had prayed me to keep silent i refused then he became like a devil we were there we three that night after you left and francis as i live if my father had not killed him i should have  there was a time when i believed that you had he reminded her i didnt behave like a pedagogic upholder of the letter of the law then did i  she drew closer to him  you were wonderful she whispered  dearest your father has nothing to fear from me he assured her tenderly on the contrary i think that i can show him the way to safety  she rose impulsively to her feet  he will be here directly she said he promised to come across at halfpast twelve let us go and meet him but francis  for a single moment she crept into his arms their lips met her eyes shone into his he held her away from him a moment later the change was amazing she was no longer a tired woman she had become a girl again her eyes were soft with happiness the little lines had gone from about her mouth she walked with all the spring of youth and happiness  it is marvellous she whispered i never dreamed that i should ever be happy again  they crossed the rustic bridge which led on to the lawn lady cynthia came out of the house to meet them she showed no signs of fatigue but her eyes and her tone were full of anxiety  margaret she cried do you know that the hall is filled with your fathers luggage and that the car is ordered to take him to southampton directly after lunch  margaret and francis exchanged glances  sir timothy may change his mind the latter observed i have news for him directly he arrives  on the other side of the wall they heard the whinnying of the old mare the sound of galloping feet from all directions  here he comes lady cynthia exclaimed i shall go and meet him  francis laid his hand upon her arm  let me have a word with him first he begged  she hesitated  you are not going to say anythingthat will make him want to go away  i am going to tell him something which i think will keep him at home  sir timothy came through the posterngate a moment or two later he waved his hat and crossed the lawn in their direction francis went alone to meet him and as he drew near was conscious of a little shock his host although he held himself bravely seemed to have aged in the night  i want one word with you sir in your study please francis said  sir timothy shrugged his shoulders and led the way he turned to wave his hand once more to margaret and lady cynthia however and he looked with approval at the luncheontable which a couple of servants were laying under the cedar tree  wonderful thing these alfresco meals he declared i hope hedges wont forget the maraschino with the melons come into my den ledsam  he led the way in courtly fashion he was the ideal host leading a valued guest to his sanctum for a few moments pleasant conversation but when they arrived in the little beamed room and the door was closed his manner changed he looked searchingly almost challengingly at francis  you have news for me he asked  yes francis answered  sir timothy shrugged his shoulders he threw himself a little wearily into an easychair his hands strayed out towards a cigarette box he selected one and lit it  i expected your friend mr shopland he murmured i hope he is none the worse for his ducking  shopland is a fool francis replied he has nothing to do with this affair anyway i have something to give you sir timothy  he took the two papers from his pocket and handed them over  i bought these from john walter the day before yesterday he continued i gave him two hundred pounds for them the money was just in time he caught a steamer for australia late in the afternoon i had this wireless from him this morning  sir timothy studied the two documents read the wireless there was little change in his face only for a single moment his lips quivered  what does this mean he asked rising to his feet with the documents in his hand  it means that those papers are yours to do what you like with i drafted the second one so that you should be absolutely secure against any further attempt at blackmail as a matter of fact though walter is on his last legs i doubt whether he will live to land in australia  you know that i killed oliver hilditch sir timothy said his eyes fixed upon the others  i know that you killed oliver hilditch francis repeated if i had been margarets father i think that i should have done the same  sir timothy seemed suddenly very much younger the droop of his lips was no longer pathetic there was a little humourous twitch there  you the great upholder of the law he murmured  i have heard the story of oliver hilditchs life francis replied i was partially responsible for saving him from the gallows i repeat what i have said and if you will  he held out his hand sir timothy hesitated for one moment instead of taking it he laid his hand upon francis shoulder  ledsam he said we have thought wrong things of one another i thought you a prig moral to your fingertips with the morality of the law and the small places perhaps i was tempted for that reason to give you a wrong impression of myself but you must understand this though i have had my standard and lived up to it all my life i am something of a black sheep a man stole my wife i did not trouble the law courts i killed him  i have the blood of generations of lawyers in my veins francis declared but i have read many a divorce case in which i think it would have been better and finer if the two men had met as you and that man met  i was born with the love of fighting in my bones sir timothy went on in my younger days i fought in every small war in the southern hemisphere i fought as you know in our own war i have loved to see men fight honestly and fairly  it is a mans hobby francis pronounced  i encouraged you deliberately to think sir timothy went on what half the world thinks thatmy parties at the walled house were mysterious orgies of vice they have as a matter of fact never been anything of the sort the tragedies which are supposed to have taken place on my launch have been just as much mock tragedies as last nights only i have not previously chosen to take the audiences into my confidence the greatest pugilists in the world have fought in my gymnasium often if you will under illegal conditions but there has never been a fight that was not fair  i believe that francis said  and there is another matter for which i take some blame sir timothy went on the matter of fairfax and victor bidlake they were neither of them young men for whose loss the world is any the worse fairfax to some extent imposed upon me he was brought to the walled house by a friend who should have known better he sought my confidence the story he told was exactly that of the mock drama upon the launch bidlake had taken his wife he had no wish to appeal to the courts he wished to fight a point of view with which i entirely sympathised i arranged a fight between the two bidlake funked it and never turned up my advice to fairfax was whenever he met bidlake to give him the soundest thrashing he could that night at sotos i caught sight of fairfax some time before dinner he was talking to the woman who had been his wife and he had evidently been drinking he drew me on one side tonight he told me i am going to settle accounts with bidlake where i asked here he answered he went out to the theatre i upstairs to dine that was the extent of the knowledge i possessed which enabled me to predict some unwonted happening that night fairfax was a bedrugged and bedrunken decadent who had not the courage afterwards to face what he had done that is all  the hand slipped from francis shoulder francis with a smile held out his own they stood there for a moment with clasped handsa queer detached moment as it seemed to francis in a life which during the last few months had been full of vivid sensations from outside came the lazy sounds of the drowsy summer morningthe distant humming of a mowing machine the drone of a reaper in the field beyond the twittering of birds in the trees even the soft lapping of the stream against the stone steps the man whose hand he was holding seemed to francis to have become somehow transformed it was as though he had dropped a mask and were showing a more human a more kindly self francis wondered no longer at the halting gallop of the horses in the field  youll be good to margaret sir timothy begged shes had a wretched time  francis smiled confidently  im going to make up for it sir he promised and this south american trip he continued as they turned towards the french windows youll call that off  sir timothy hesitated  i am not quite sure  when they reached the garden lady cynthia was alone she scarcely glanced at francis her eyes were anxiously fixed upon his companion  margaret has gone in to make the cocktails herself she explained we have both sworn off absinthe for the rest of our lives and we know hedges cant be trusted to make one without  ill go and help her francis declared  lady cynthia passed her arm through sir timothys  i want to know about south america she begged the sight of those trunks worries me  sir timothys casual reply was obviously a subterfuge they crossed the lawn and the rustic bridge almost in silence passing underneath the pergola of roses to the sheltered garden at the further end then lady cynthia paused  you are not going to south america she pleaded alone  sir timothy took her hands  my dear he said listen please to my confession i am a fraud i am not a purveyor of new sensations for a decadent troop of weary fashionable people i am a fraud sometimes even to myself i have had good luck in material things i have had bad luck in the precious the sentimental side of life it has made something of an artificial character of me on the surface at any rate i am really a simple elderly man who loves fresh air clean honest things games and a healthy life i have no ambitions except those connected with sport i dont even want to climb to the topmost niches in the world of finance i think you have looked at me through the wrongcoloured spectacles you have had a whimsical fancy for a character which does not exist  what i have seen lady cynthia answered i have seen through no spectacles at allwith my own eyes but what i have seen even does not count there is something else  i am within a few weeks of my fiftieth birthday sir timothy reminded her and you i believe are twentynine  my dear man lady cynthia assured him fervently you are the only person in the world who can keep me from feeling fortynine  and your people  heavens my people for the first time in their lives will count me a brilliant success lady cynthia declared youll probably have to lend dad money and i shall be looked upon as the fairy child who has restored the family fortunes  sir timothy leaned a little towards her  last of all he said and this time his voice was not quite so steady are you really sure that you care for me dear because i have loved you so long and i have wanted love so badly and it is so hard to believe  it was the moment it seemed to her for which she had prayed she was in his arms tired no longer with all the splendid fire of life in her lovelit eyes and throbbing pulses around them the bees were humming and a soft summer breeze shook the roses and brought little wafts of perfume from the carnation bed  there is nothing in life lady cynthia murmured brokenly so wonderful as this  francis and margaret came out from the house the former carrying a silver tray they had spent a considerable time over their task but lady cynthia and sir timothy were still absent hedges followed them a little worried  shall i ring the gong madam he asked margaret cook has taken such pains with her omelette  i think you had better hedges margaret assented  the gong rang outand rang again presently lady cynthia and sir timothy appeared upon the bridge and crossed the lawn they were walking a little apart lady cynthia was looking down at some roses which she had gathered sir timothys unconcern seemed a trifle overdone margaret laughed very softly  a stepmother francis she whispered just fancy cynthia as a stepmother
