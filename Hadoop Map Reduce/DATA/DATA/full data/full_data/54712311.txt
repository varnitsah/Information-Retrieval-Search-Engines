                          244     my boys   feeling that i have been unusually fortunate in my knowledge of a choice and pleasing variety of this least appreciated portion of the human race i have a fancy to record some of my experiences hoping that it may awaken an interest in other minds and cause other people to cultivate the delightful but too often neglected boys who now run to waste so to speak  i have often wondered what they thought of the peculiar treatment they receive even at the hands of their nearest friends while they are rosy rolypoly little fellows they are petted and praised adorned and adored till it is a miracle that they are not utterly ruined but the moment they outgrow their babyhood their trials begin and they are regarded as nuisances till they are twentyone when they are again received into favor  yet that very time of neglect is the period when they most need all manner of helps and ought to have them i like boys and oysters raw so though good manners are always pleasing i dont mind the rough outside burr which repels most people and perhaps that is the reason why the burrs open and let me see the soft lining and taste the sweet nut hidden inside  my first wellbeloved boy was a certain frank to whom i clung at the age of seven with a devotion which i fear he did not appreciate there were six girls in the house but i would have nothing to say to them preferring to tag after frank and perfectly happy when he allowed me to play with him i regret to say that the small youth was something of a tyrant and one of his favorite amusements was trying to make me cry by slapping my hands with books hoopsticks shoes anything that came along capable of giving a good stinging blow i believe i endured these marks of friendship with the fortitude of a young indian and felt fully repaid for a blistered palm by hearing frank tell the other boys shes a brave little thing and you cant make her cry  my chief joy was in romping with him in the long galleries of a piano manufactory behind our house what bliss it was to mount one of the cars on which the workmen rolled heavy loads from room to room and to go thundering down the inclined plains regardless of the crash that usually awaited us at the bottom if i could have played football on the common with my frank and billy babcock life could have offered me no greater joy at that period as the prejudices of society forbid this sport i revenged myself by driving hoop all around the mall without stopping which the boys could not do  i can remember certain happy evenings when we snuggled in sofa corners and planned tricks and ate stolen goodies and sometimes frank would put his curly head in my lap and let me stroke it when he was tired what the girls did i dont recollect their domestic plays were not to my taste and the only figure that stands out from the dimness of the past is that jolly boy with a twinkling eye this memory would be quite radiant but for one sad thinga deed that cut me to the soul then and which i have never quite forgiven in all these years  on one occasion i did something very naughty and when called up for judgment fled to the diningroom locked the door and from my stronghold defied the whole world i could have made my own terms for it was near dinner time and the family must eat but alas for the treachery of the human heart frank betrayed me he climbed in at the window unlocked the door and delivered me up to the foe nay he even defended the base act and helped bear the struggling culprit to imprisonment that nearly broke my heart for i believed he would stand by me as staunchly as i always stood by him it was a sad blow and i couldnt love or trust him any more peanuts and candy gingersnaps and carrides were unavailing even football could not reunite the broken friendship and to this day i recollect the pang that entered my little heart when i lost my faith in the loyalty of my first boy  the second attachment was of quite a different sort and had a happier ending at the mature age of ten i left home for my first visit to a family of gay and kindly people inwell why not say right outprovidence there were no children and at first i did not mind this as every one petted me especially one of the young men named christopher so kind and patient yet so merry was this good christy that i took him for my private and particular boy and loved him dearly for he got me out of innumerable scrapes and never was tired of amusing the restless little girl who kept the family in a fever of anxiety by her pranks he never laughed at her mishaps and mistakes never played tricks upon her like a certain william who composed the most trying nicknames and wickedly goaded the wild visitor into all manner of naughtiness christy stood up for her through everything let her ride the cows feed the pigs bang on the piano and race all over the spice mill feasting on cinnamon and cloves brought her down from housetops and fished her out of brooks never scolded and never seemed tired of the troublesome friendship of little torment  in a week i had exhausted every amusement and was desperately homesick it has always been my opinion that i should have been speedily restored to the bosom of my family but for christy and but for him i should assuredly have run away before the second week was out he kept me and in the hour of my disgrace stood by me like a man and a brother  one afternoon inspired by a spirit of benevolence enthusiastic but shortsighted i collected several poor children in the barn and regaled them on cake and figs helping myself freely to the treasures of the pantry without asking leave meaning to explain afterward being discovered before the supplies were entirely exhausted the patience of the longsuffering matron gave out and i was ordered up to the garret to reflect upon my sins and the pleasing prospect of being sent home with the character of the worst child ever known  my sufferings were deep as i sat upon a fuzzy little trunk all alone in the dull garret thinking how hard it was to do right and wondering why i was scolded for feeding the poor when we were expressly bidden to do so i felt myself an outcast and bewailed the disgrace i had brought upon my family nobody could possibly love such a bad child and if the mice were to come and eat me then and there√† la bishop hattoit would only be a relief to my friends at this dark moment i heard christy say below she meant it kindly so i wouldnt mind fanny and then up came my boy full of sympathy and comfort seeing the tragic expression of my face he said not a word but sitting down in an old chair took me on his knee and held me close and quietly letting the action speak for itself it did most eloquently for the kind arm seemed to take me back from that dreadful exile and the friendly face to assure me without words that i had not sinned beyond forgiveness  i had not shed a tear before but now i cried tempestuously and clung to him like a shipwrecked little mariner in a storm neither spoke but he held me fast and let me cry myself to sleep for when the shower was over a pensive peace fell upon me and the dim old garret seemed not a prison but a haven of refuge since my boy came to share it with me how long i slept i dont know but it must have been an hour at least yet my good christy never stirred only waited patiently till i woke up in the twilight and was not afraid because he was there he took me down as meek as a mouse and kept me by him all that trying evening screening me from jokes rebukes and sober looks and when i went to bed he came up to kiss me and to assure me that this awful circumstance should not be reported at home this took a load off my heart and i remember fervently thanking him and telling him i never would forget it  i never have though he died long ago and others have probably forgotten all about the naughty prank i often longed to ask him how he knew the surest way to win a childs heart by the patience sympathy and tender little acts that have kept his memory green for nearly thirty years  cy was a comrade after my own heart and for a summer or two we kept the neighbourhood in a ferment by our adventures and hairbreadth escapes i think i never knew a boy so full of mischief and my opportunities of judging have been manifold he did not get into scrapes himself but possessed a splendid talent for deluding others into them and then morally remarking there i told you so his way of saying you darsnt do this or that was like fire to powder and why i still live in the possession of all my limbs and senses is a miracle to those who know my youthful friendship with cy it was he who incited me to jump off of the highest beam in the barn to be borne home on a board with a pair of sprained ankles it was he who dared me to rub my eyes with red peppers and then sympathisingly led me home blind and roaring with pain it was he who solemnly assured me that all the little pigs would die in agony if their tails were not cut off and won me to hold thirteen little squealers while the operation was performed those thirteen innocent pink tails haunt me yet and the memory of that deed has given me a truly jewish aversion to pork  i did not know him long but he was a kindred soul and must have a place in my list of boys he is a big brown man now and having done his part in the war is at work on his farm we meet sometimes and though we try to be dignified and proper it is quite impossible there is a sly twinkle in cys eye that upsets my gravity and we always burst out laughing at the memory of our early frolics  my augustus oh my augustus my first little lover and the most romantic of my boys at fifteen i met this charming youth and thought i had found my fate it was at a spelling school in a little country town where i as a stranger and visitor from the city was an object of interest painfully conscious of this fact i sat in a corner trying to look easy and elegant with a large red bow under my chin and a carnelian ring in full view among the boys and girls who frolicked about me i saw one lad of seventeen with large blue eyes a noble brow and a beautiful straight nose as i described him in a letter to my sister this attractive youth had a certain air of refinement and ease of manner that the others lacked and when i found he was the ministers son i felt that i might admire him without loss of dignity imagine my sensations as miss burneys evelina says when this boy came and talked to me a little bashfully at first but soon quite freely and invited me to a huckleberry party next day i had observed that he was one of the best spellers i also observed that his language was quite elegant he even quoted byron and rolled his eyes in a most engaging manner not to mention that he asked who gave me my ring and said he depended on escorting me to the berry pasture  dear me how interesting it was and when i found myself next day sitting under a tree in the sunny field full of boys and girls all more or less lovering with the amiable augustus at my feet gallantly supplying me with bushes to strip while we talked about books and poetry i really felt as if i had got into a novel and enjoyed it immensely i believe a dim idea that gus was sentimental hovered in my mind but i would not encourage it though i laughed in my sleeve when he was spouting latin for my benefit and was uncertain whether to box his ears or simper later in the day when he languished over the gate and said he thought chestnut hair the loveliest in the world  poor dear boy how innocent and softhearted and full of splendid dreams he was and what deliciously romantic times we had floating on the pond while the frogs sung to his accordion as he tried to say unutterable things with his honest blue eyes it makes me shiver now to think of the mosquitoes and the damp but it was pauline and claude melnotte then and when i went home we promised to be true to one another and write every week during the year he was away at school  we partednot in tears by any means that sort of nonsense comes later when the romance is less childishbut quite jolly and comfortable and i hastened to pour forth the thrilling tale to my faithful sister who approved of the match being a perfect mush of sentiment herself  i fear it was not a very ardent flame however for gus did not write every week and i did not care a bit nevertheless i kept his picture and gave it a sentimental sigh when i happened to think of it while he sent messages now and then and devoted himself to his studies like an ambitious boy as he was i hardly expected to see him again but soon after the year was out to my great surprise he called i was so fluttered by the appearance of his card that i rather lost my head and did such a silly thing that it makes me laugh even now he liked chestnut hair and pulling out my combs i rushed down theatrically dishevelled hoping to impress my lover with my ardour and my charms  i expected to find little gus but to my great confusion a tall being with a beaver in his hand rose to meet me looking so big and handsome and generally imposing that i could not recover myself for several minutes and mentally wailed for my combs feeling like an untidy simpleton  i dont know whether he thought me a little cracked or not but he was very friendly and pleasant and told me his plans and hoped i would make another visit and smoothed his beaver and let me see his tailcoat and behaved himself like a dear conceited clever boy he did not allude to our lovepassages being shy and i blessed him for it for really i dont know what rash thing i might have done under the exciting circumstances just as he was going however he forgot his cherished hat for a minute put out both hands and said heartily with his old boyish laugh  now you will come and well go boating and berrying and all the rest of it again wont we  the blue eyes were full of fun and feeling too i fancied as i blushingly retired behind my locks and gave the promise but i never went and never saw my little lover any more for in a few weeks he was dead of a fever brought on by too much studyand so ended the sad history of my fourth boy  after this for many years i was a boyless being but was so busy i did not feel my destitute condition till i went to the hospital during the war and found my little sergeant his story has been told elsewhere but the sequel to it is a pleasant one for baby b still writes to me now and then asks advice about his future and gladdens me with good news of his success as a business man in kansas  as if to atone for the former dearth a sudden shower of most superior boys fell upon me after i recovered from my campaign some of the very best sort it was my fortune to know and likereal gentlemen yet boys stilland jolly times they had stirring up the quiet old town with their energetic society  there was w a stout amiable youth who would stand in the middle of a strawberry patch with his hands in his pockets and let us feed him luxuriously b a delightful scapegrace who came once a week to confess his sins beat his breast in despair vow awful vows of repentance and then cheerfully depart to break every one of them in the next twentyfour hours s the gentlehearted giant j the dandy sober sensible b and e the young knight without reproach or fear  but my especial boy of the batch was aproud and cold and shy to other people sad and serious sometimes when his good heart and tender conscience showed him his shortcomings but so grateful for sympathy and a kind word  i could not get at him as easily as i could the other lads but thanks to dickens i found him out at last  we played dolphus and sophy tetterby in the haunted man at one of the school festivals and during the rehearsals i discovered that my dolphus waspermit the expression oh wellbred readersa trump what fun we had to be sure acting the droll and pathetic scenes together with a swarm of little tetterbys skirmishing about us from that time he has been my dolphus and i his sophy and my yellowhaired laddie dont forget me though he has a younger sophy now and some small tetterbys of his own he writes just the same affectionate letters as he used to do though i less faithful am too busy to answer them  but the best and dearest of all my flock was my polish boy ladislas wisniewskitwo hiccoughs and a sneeze will give you the name perfectly six years ago as i went down to my early breakfast at our pension in vevey i saw that a stranger had arrived he was a tall youth of eighteen or twenty with a thin intelligent face and the charmingly polite manners of a foreigner as the other boarders came in one by one they left the door open and a draught of cold autumn air blew in from the stone corridor making the newcomer cough shiver and cast wistful glances towards the warm corner by the stove my place was there and the heat often oppressed me so i was glad of an opportunity to move  a word to madame vodoz effected the change and at dinner i was rewarded by a grateful smile from the poor fellow as he nestled into his warm seat after a pause of surprise and a flush of pleasure at the small kindness from a stranger we were too far apart to talk much but as he filled his glass the pole bowed to me and said low in french  i drink the good health to mademoiselle  i returned the wish but he shook his head with a sudden shadow on his face as if the words meant more than mere compliment to him  that boy is sick and needs care i must see to him said i to myself as i met him in the afternoon and observed the military look of his blue and white suit as he touched his cap and smiled pleasantly i have a weakness for brave boys in blue and having discovered that he had been in the late polish revolution my heart warmed to him at once  that evening he came to me in the salon and expressed his thanks in the prettiest broken english i ever heard so simple frank and grateful was he that a few words of interest won his little story from him and in half an hour we were friends with his fellowstudents he had fought through the last outbreak and suffered imprisonment and hardship rather than submit had lost many friends his fortune and his health and at twenty lonely poor and ill was trying bravely to cure the malady which seemed fatal  if i recover myself of this affair in the chest i teach the music to acquire my bread in this so hospitable country at paris my friends all two find a refuge and i go to them in spring if i die not here yes it is solitary and my memories are not gay but i have my work and the good god remains always to me so i content myself with much hope and i wait  such genuine piety and courage increased my respect and regard immensely and a few minutes later he added to both by one of the little acts that show character better than words  he told me about the massacre when five hundred poles were shot down by cossacks in the marketplace merely because they sung their national hymn  play me that forbidden air i said wishing to judge of his skill for i had heard him practising softly in the afternoon  he rose willingly then glanced about the room and gave a little shrug which made me ask what he wanted  i look to see if the baron is here he is russian and to him my national air will not be pleasing  then play it he dare not forbid it here and i should rather enjoy that little insult to your bitter enemy said i feeling very indignant with everything russian just then  ah mademoiselle it is true we are enemies but we are also gentlemen returned the boy proving that he at least was one  i thanked him for his lesson in politeness and as the baron was not there he played the beautiful hymn singing it enthusiastically in spite of the danger to his weak lungs a true musician evidently for as he sung his pale face glowed his eyes shone and his lost vigor seemed restored to him  from that evening we were fast friends for the memory of certain dear lads at home made my heart open to this lonely boy who gave me in return the most grateful affection and service he begged me to call him varjo as his mother did he constituted himself my escort errandboy french teacher and private musician making those weeks indefinitely pleasant by his winning ways his charming little confidences and faithful friendship  we had much fun over our lessons for i helped him about his english with a great interest in free america and an intense longing to hear about our war the barrier of an unknown tongue did not long stand between us  beginning with my bad french and his broken english we got on capitally but he outdid me entirely making astonishing progress though he often slapped his forehead with the despairing exclamation  i am imbecile i never can will shall to have learn this beast of english  but he did and in a month had added a new language to the five he already possessed  his music was the delight of the house and he often gave us little concerts with the help of madame teiblin a german st cecilia with a cropped head and a gentlemanly sack cravat and collar both were enthusiasts and the longer they played the more inspired they got the piano vibrated the stools creaked the candles danced in their sockets and every one sat mute while the four white hands chased one another up and down the keys and the two fine faces beamed with such ecstasy that we almost expected to see instrument and performers disappear in a musical whirlwind  lake leman will never seem so lovely again as when laddie and i roamed about its shores floated on its bosom or laid splendid plans for the future in the sunny garden of the old chateau i tried it again last year but the charm was gone for i missed my boy with his fun his music and the frank fresh affection he gave his little mamma as he insisted on calling the lofty spinster who loved him like halfadozen grandmothers rolled into one  december roses blossomed in the gardens then and laddie never failed to have a posy ready for me at dinner few evenings passed without confidences in my corner of the salon and i still have a pile of merry little notes which i used to find tucked under my door he called them chapters of a great history we were to write together and being a polisson he illustrated it with droll pictures and a funny mixture of french and english romance  it was very pleasant but like all pleasant things in this world of change it soon came to an end when i left for italy we jokingly agreed to meet in paris the next may but neither really felt that we should ever meet again for laddie hardly expected to outlive the winter and i felt sure i should soon be forgotten as he kissed my hand there were tears in my boys eyes and a choke in the voice that tried to say cheerfully  bon voyage dear and good little mamma i do not say adieu but au revoir  then the carriage rolled away the wistful face vanished and nothing remained to me but the memory of laddie and a little stain on my glove where a drop had fallen  as i drew near paris six months later and found myself wishing that i might meet varjo in the great gay city and wondering if there was any chance of my doing it i never dreamed of seeing him so soon but as i made my way among the crowd of passengers that poured through the station feeling tired bewildered and homesick i suddenly saw a blue and white cap wave wildly in the air then laddies beaming face appeared and laddies eager hands grasped mine so cordially that i began to laugh at once and felt that paris was almost as good as home  ah ha behold the little mamma who did not think to see again her bad son yes i am greatly glad that i make the fine surprise for you as you come all weary to this place of noise give to me the billets for i am still mademoiselles servant and go to find the coffers  he got my trunks put me into a carriage and as we rolled merrily away i asked how he chanced to meet me so unexpectedly knowing where i intended to stay he had called occasionally till i notified madame d of the day and hour of my arrival and then he had come to make the fine surprise he enjoyed the joke like a true boy and i was glad to see how well he looked and how gay he seemed  you are better i said  i truly hope so the winter was good to me and i cough less it is a small hope but i do not enlarge my fear by a sad face i yet work and save a little purse so that i may not be a heaviness to those who have the charity to finish me if i fall back and yet die  i would not hear of that and told him he looked as well and happy as if he had found a fortune  he laughed and answered with his fine bow i have behold you come to make the f√™te for me i find also here my friends joseph and napoleon poor as mouses of the church as you say but brave boys and we work together with much gaiety  when i asked if he had leisure to be my guide about paris for my time was short and i wanted to see everything he pranced and told me he had promised himself a holiday and had planned many excursions the most wonderful charming and gay then having settled me at madames he went blithely away to what i afterwards discovered were very poor lodgings across the river  next day began the pleasantest fortnight in all my year of travel laddie appeared early elegant to behold in a new hat and buff gloves and was immensely amused because the servant informed me that my big son had arrived  i believe the first thing a woman does in paris is to buy a new bonnet i did or rather stood by and let my son do it in the best of french only whispering when he proposed gorgeous chapeaus full of flowers and feathers that i could not afford it  ah we must make our economies must we see then this modest pearlcolored one with the crape rose yes we will have that and be most elegant for the sunday promenade  i fear i should have bought a peagreen hat with a yellow plume if he had urged it so wheedlesome and droll were his ways and words his good taste saved me however and the modest one was sent home for the morrow when we were to meet joseph and napoleon and go to the concert in the tuileries garden  then we set off on our day of sightseeing and laddie proved himself an excellent guide we had a charming trip about the enchanted city a gay lunch at a caf√© and a first brief glimpse of the louvre at dinnertime i found a posy at my place and afterward laddie came and spent the evening in my little salon playing to me and having what he called babblings and pleasantries i found that he was translating vanity fair into polish and intended to sell it at home he convulsed me with his struggles to put cockney english and slang into good polish for he had saved up a list of words for me to explain to him haystack and beanpot were among them i remember and when he had mastered the meanings he fell upon the sofa exhausted  other days like this followed and we led a happy life together for my twelve years seniority made our adventures quite proper and i fearlessly went anywhere on the arm of my big son not to theatres or balls however for heated rooms were bad for laddie but pleasant trips out of the city in the bright spring weather quiet strolls in the gardens moonlight concerts in the champs elys√©es or best of all long talks with music in the little red salon with the gas turned low and the everchanging scenes of the rue de rivoli under the balcony  never were pleasures more cheaply purchased or more thoroughly enjoyed for our hearts were as light as our purses and our little economies gave zest to our amusements  joseph and napoleon sometimes joined us and i felt in my element with the three invalid soldier boys for napoleon still limped with a wound received in the war joseph had never recovered from his two years imprisonment in an austrian dungeon and laddies loyalty might yet cost him his life  thanks to them i discovered a joke played upon me by my polisson he told me to call him ma drogha saying it meant my friend in polish i innocently did so and he seemed to find great pleasure in it for his eyes always laughed when i said it using it one day before the other lads i saw a queer twinkle in their eyes and suspecting mischief demanded the real meaning of the words laddie tried to silence them but the joke was too good to keep and i found to my dismay that i had been calling him my darling in the tenderest manner  how the three rascals shouted and what a vain struggle it was to try and preserve my dignity when laddie clasped his hands and begged pardon explaining that jokes were necessary to his health and he never meant me to know the full baseness of this pleasantrie i revenged myself by giving him some bad english for his translation and telling him of it just as i left paris  it was not all fun with my boy however he had his troubles and in spite of his cheerfulness he knew what heartache was walking in the quaint garden of the luxembourg one day he confided to me the little romance of his life a very touching little romance as he told it with eloquent eyes and voice and frequent pauses for breath i cannot give his words but the simple facts were these  he had grown up with a pretty cousin and at eighteen was desperately in love with her she returned his affection but they could not be happy for her father wished her to marry a richer man in poland to marry without the consent of parents is to incur lasting disgrace so leonore obeyed and the young pair parted this had been a heavy sorrow to laddie and he rushed into the war hoping to end his trouble  do you ever hear from your cousin i asked as he walked beside me looking sadly down the green aisles where kings and queens had loved and parted years ago  i only know that she suffers still for she remembers her husband submits to the russians and i despise him as i have no english to tell and he clenched his hands with the flash of the eye and sudden kindling of the whole face that made him handsome  he showed me a faded little picture and when i tried to comfort him he laid his head down on the pedestal of one of the marble queens who guard the walk as if he never cared to lift it up again  but he was all right in a minute and bravely put away his sorrow with the little picture he never spoke of it again and i saw no more shadows on his face till we came to say goodbye  you have been so kind to me i wish i had something beautiful to give you laddie i said feeling that it would be hard to get on without my boy  this time it is for always so as a parting souvenir give to me the sweet english goodbye  as he said this with a despairing sort of look as if he could not spare even so humble a friend as myself my heart was quite rent within me and regardless of several prim english ladies i drew down his tall head and kissed him tenderly feeling that in this world there were no more meetings for us then i ran away and buried myself in an empty railway carriage hugging the little cologne bottle he had given me  he promised to write and for five years he has kept his word sending me from paris and poland cheery bright letters in english at my desire so that he might not forget here is one as a specimen       my dear and good friendwhat do you think of me that i do not      write so long time excuse me my good mamma for i was so busy in      these days i could not do this pleasant thing i write english      without the fear that you laugh at it because i know it is more      agreeable to read the own language and i think you are not      excepted of this rule it is good of me for the expressions of      love and regard made with faults take the funny appearance they      are ridicule and instead to go to the heart they make the      laugh never mind i do it       you cannot imagine yourself how stupide is paris when you are      gone i fly to my work and make no more f√™tesit is too sad      alone i tie myself to my table and my vanity not of mine for i      am not vain am i i wish some chapters to finish themselfs      vite that i send them to pologne and know the end i have a      little question to ask you of vanity as always i cannot      translate this no one of dictionnaires makes me the words and i      think it is jargon de prison this little period behold         mopy is that your snum        nubble your dad and gully the dog c       so funny things i cannot explain myself so i send to you and      you reply sooner than without it for you have so kind interest in      my work you do not stay to wait so this is a little hook for you      to make you write some words to your

a few lines i acknowledged the receipt of it but since then not a word has come and i begin to fear that my boy is dead others have appeared to take his place but they dont suit and i keep his corner always ready for him if he lives if he is dead i am glad to have known so sweet and brave a character for it does one good to see even as shortlived and obscure a hero as my polish boy whose dead december rose embalms for me the memory of varjo the last and dearest of my boys  it is hardly necessary to add for the satisfaction of inquisitive little women that laddie was the original of laurie as far as a pale penandink sketch could embody a living loving boy     tessas surprises   i  little tessa sat alone by the fire waiting for her father to come home from work the children were fast asleep all four in the big bed behind the curtain the wind blew hard outside and the snow beat on the windowpanes the room was large and the fire so small and feeble that it didnt half warm the little bare toes peeping out of the old shoes on the hearth  tessas father was an italian plasterworker very poor but kind and honest the mother had died not long ago and left twelveyear old tessa to take care of the little children she tried to be very wise and motherly and worked for them like any little woman but it was so hard to keep the small bodies warm and fed and the small souls good and happy that poor tessa was often at her wits end she always waited for her father no matter how tired she was so that he might find his supper warm a bit of fire and a loving little face to welcome him tessa thought over her troubles at these quiet times and made her plans for her father left things to her a good deal and she had no friends but tommo the harpboy upstairs and the lively cricket who lived in the chimney tonight her face was very sober and her pretty brown eyes very thoughtful as she stared at the fire and knit her brows as if perplexed she was not thinking of her old shoes nor the empty closet nor the boys ragged clothes just then no she had a fine plan in her good little head and was trying to discover how she could carry it out  you see christmas was coming in a week and she had set her heart on putting something in the childrens stockings as the mother used to do for while she lived things were comfortable now tessa had not a penny in the world and didnt know how to get one for all the fathers earnings had to go for food fire and rent  if there were only fairies ah how heavenly that would be for then i should tell them all i wish and pop behold the fine things in my lap said tessa to herself i must earn the money there is no one to give it to me and i cannot beg but what can i do so small and stupid and shy as i am i must find some way to give the little ones a nice christmas i must i must and tessa pulled her long hair as if that would help her think  but it didnt and her heart got heavier and heavier for it did seem hard that in a great city full of fine things there should be none for poor nono sep and little speranza just as tessas tears began to tumble off her eyelashes on to her brown cheeks the cricket began to chirp of course he didnt say a word but it really did seem as if he had answered her question almost as well as a fairy for before he had piped a dozen shrill notes an idea popped into tessas headsuch a truly splendid idea that she clapped her hands and burst out laughing ill do it ill do it if father will let me she said to herself smiling and nodding at the fire tommo will like to have me go with him and sing while he plays his harp in the streets i know many songs and may get money if i am not frightened for people throw pennies to other little girls who only play the tambourine yes i will try and then if i do well the little ones shall have a merry christmas  so full of her plan was tessa that she ran upstairs at once and asked tommo if he would take her with him on the morrow her friend was delighted for he thought tessas songs very sweet and was sure she would get money if she tried  but see then it is cold in the streets the wind bites and the snow freezes ones fingers the day is very long people are cross and at night one is ready to die with weariness thou art so small tessa i am afraid it will go badly with thee said tommo who was a merry blackeyed boy of fourteen with the kindest heart in the world under his old jacket  i do not mind cold and wet and cross people if i can get the pennies answered tessa feeling very brave with such a friend to help her she thanked tommo and ran away to get ready for she felt sure her father would not refuse her anything she sewed up the holes in her shoes as well as she could for she had much of that sort of cobbling to do she mended her only gown and laid ready the old hood and shawl which had been her mothers then she washed out little ranzas frock and put it to dry because she would not be able to do it the next day she set the table and got things ready for breakfast for tommo went out early and must not be kept waiting for her she longed to make the beds and dress the children over night she was in such a hurry to have all in order but as that could not be she sat down again and tried over all the songs she knew six pretty ones were chosen and she sang away with all her heart in a fresh little voice so sweetly that the children smiled in their sleep and her fathers tired face brightened as he entered for tessa was his cheery cricket on the hearth when she had told her plan peter benari shook his head and thought it would never do but tessa begged so hard he consented at last that she should try it for one week and sent her to bed the happiest little girl in new york  next morning the sun shone but the cold wind blew and the snow lay thick in the streets as soon as her father was gone tessa flew about and put everything in nice order telling the children she was going out for the day and they were to mind tommos mother who would see about the fire and the dinner for the good woman loved tessa and entered into her little plans with all her heart nono and giuseppe or sep as they called him wondered what she was going away for and little ranza cried at being left but tessa told them they would know all about it in a week and have a fine time if they were good so they kissed her all round and let her go  poor tessas heart beat fast as she trudged away with tommo who slung his harp over his shoulder and gave her his hand it was rather a dirty hand but so kind that tessa clung to it and kept looking up at the friendly brown face for encouragement  we go first to the caf√© where many french and italians eat the breakfast they like my music and often give me sips of hot coffee which i like much you too shall have the sips and perhaps the pennies for these people are greatly kind said tommo leading her into a large smoky place where many people sat at little tables eating and drinking see now have no fear give them bella monica that is merry and will make the laugh whispered tommo tuning his harp  for a moment tessa felt so frightened that she wanted to run away but she remembered the empty stockings at home and the fine plan and she resolved not to give it up one fat old frenchman nodded to her and it seemed to help her very much for she began to sing before she thought and that was the hardest part of it her voice trembled and her cheeks grew redder and redder as she went on but she kept her eyes fixed on her old shoes and so got through without breaking down which was very nice the people laughed for the song was merry and the fat man smiled and nodded again this gave her courage to try another and she sung better and better each time for tommo played his best and kept whispering to her yes we go well this is fine they will give the money and the blessed coffee  so they did for when the little concert was over several men put pennies in the cap tessa offered and the fat man took her on his knee and ordered a mug of coffee and some bread and butter for them both this quite won her heart and when they left the caf√© she kissed her hand to the old frenchman and said to her friend how kind they are i like this very much and now it is not hard  but tommo shook his curly head and answered soberly yes i took you there first for they love music and are of our country but up among the great houses we shall not always do well the people there are busy or hard or idle and care nothing for harps and songs do not skip and laugh too soon for the day is long and we have but twelve pennies yet  tessa walked more quietly and rubbed her cold hands feeling that the world was a very big place and wondering how the children got on at home without the little mother till noon they did not earn much for every one seemed in a hurry and the noise of many sleighbells drowned the music slowly they made their way up to the great squares where the big houses were with fine ladies and pretty children at the windows here tessa sung all her best songs and tommo played as fast as his fingers could fly but it was too cold to have the windows open so the pretty children could not listen long and the ladies tossed out a little money and soon went back to their own affairs  all the afternoon the two friends wandered about singing and playing and gathering up their small harvest at dusk they went home tessa so hoarse she could hardly speak and so tired she fell asleep over her supper but she had made half a dollar for tommo divided the money fairly and she felt rich with her share the other days were very much like this sometimes they made more sometimes less but tommo always went halves and tessa kept on in spite of cold and weariness for her plans grew as her earnings increased and now she hoped to get useful things instead of candy and toys alone  on the day before christmas she made herself as tidy as she could for she hoped to earn a good deal she tied a bright scarlet handkerchief over the old hood and the brilliant color set off her brown cheeks and bright eyes as well as the pretty black braids of her hair tommos mother lent her a pair of boots so big that they turned up at the toes but there were no holes in them and tessa felt quite elegant in whole boots her hands were covered with chilblains for she had no mittens but she put them under her shawl and scuffled merrily away in her big boots feeling so glad that the week was over and nearly three dollars safe in her pocket how gay the streets were that day how brisk every one was and how bright the faces looked as people trotted about with big baskets hollywreaths and young evergreens going to blossom into splendid christmas trees  if i could have a tree for the children id never want anything again but i cant so ill fill the socks all full and be happy said tessa as she looked wistfully into the gay stores and saw the heavy baskets go by  who knows what may happen if we do well returned tommo nodding wisely for he had a plan as well as tessa and kept chuckling over it as he trudged through the mud they did not do well somehow for every one seemed so full of their own affairs they could not stop to listen even to bella monica but bustled away to spend their money in turkeys toys and trees in the afternoon it began to rain and poor tessas heart to fail her for the big boots tired her feet the cold wind made her hands ache and the rain spoilt the fine red handkerchief even tommo looked sober and didnt whistle as he walked for he also was disappointed and his plan looked rather doubtful the pennies came in so slowly  well try one more street and then go home thou art so tired little one come let me wipe thy face and give me thy hand here in my jacket pocket there it will be as warm as any kitten and kind tommo brushed away the drops which were not all rain from tessas cheeks tucked the poor hand into his ragged pocket and led her carefully along the slippery streets for the boots nearly tripped her up   ii  at the first house a cross old gentleman flapped his newspaper at them at the second a young gentleman and lady were so busy talking that they never turned their heads and at the third a servant came out and told them to go away because some one was sick at the fourth some people let them sing all their songs and gave nothing the next three houses were empty and the last of all showed not a single face as they looked up anxiously it was so cold so dark and discouraging that tessa couldnt help one sob and as he glanced down at the little red nose and wet figure beside him tommo gave his harp an angry thump and said something very fierce in italian they were just going to turn away but they didnt for that angry thump happened to be the best thing they could have done all of a sudden a little head appeared at the window as if the sound had brought it then another and another till there were five of all heights and colors and five eager faces peeped out smiling and nodding to the two below  sing tessa sing quick quick cried tommo twanging away with all his might and showing his white teeth as he smiled back at the little gentlefolk  bless us how tessa did tune up at that she chirped away like a real bird forgetting all about the tears on her cheeks the ache in her hands and the heaviness at her heart the children laughed and clapped their hands and cried more more sing another little girl please do and away they went again piping and playing till tessas breath was gone and tommos stout fingers tingled well  mamma says come to the door its too muddy to throw the money into the street cried out a kindly childs voice as tessa held up the old cap with beseeching eyes  up the wide stone steps went the street musicians and the whole flock came running down to give a handful of silver and ask all sorts of questions tessa felt so grateful that without waiting for tommo she sang her sweetest little song all alone it was about a lost lamb and her heart was in the song therefore she sang it well so well that a pretty young lady came down to listen and stood watching the brighteyed girl who looked about her as she sang evidently enjoying the light and warmth of the fine hall and the sight of the lovely children with their gay dresses shining hair and dainty little shoes  you have a charming voice child who taught you to sing asked the young lady kindly  my mother she is dead now but i do not forget answered tessa in her pretty broken english  i wish she could sing at our tree since bella is ill cried one of the children peeping through the banisters  she is not fair enough for the angel and too large to go up in the tree but she sings sweetly and looks as if she would like to see a tree said the young lady  oh so much exclaimed tessa adding eagerly my sister ranza is small and pretty as a babyangel she could sit up in the fine tree and i could sing for her from under the table  sit down and warm yourself and tell me about ranza said the kind elder sister who liked the confiding little girl in spite of her shabby clothes  so tessa sat down and dried the big boots over the furnace and told her story while tommo stood modestly in the background and the children listened with faces full of interest  o rose let us see the little girl and if she will do let us have her and tessa can learn our song and it will be splendid cried the biggest boy who sat astride of a chair and stared at the harp with round eyes  ill ask mamma said rose and away she went into the diningroom close by as the door opened tessa saw what looked to her like a fairy feastall silver mugs and flowery plates and oranges and nuts and rosy wine in tall glass pitchers and smoking dishes that smelt so deliciously she could not restrain a little sniff of satisfaction  are you hungry asked the boy in a grand tone  yes sir meekly answered tessa  i say mamma she wants something to eat can i give her an orange called the boy prancing away into the splendid room quite like a fairy prince tessa thought  a plump motherly lady came out and looked at tessa asked a few questions and then told her to come tomorrow with ranza and they would see what could be done tessa clapped her hands for joyshe didnt mind the chilblains nowand tommo played a lively march he was so pleased  will you come too and bring your harp you shall be paid and shall have something from the tree likewise said the motherly lady who liked what tessa gratefully told about his kindness to her  ah yes i shall come with much gladness and play as never in my life before cried tommo with a flourish of the old cap that made the children laugh  give these to your brothers said the fairy prince stuffing nuts and oranges into tessas hands  and these to the little girl added one of the young princesses flying out of the diningroom with cakes and rosy apples for ranza  tessa didnt know what to say but her eyes were full and she just took the mothers white hand in both her little grimy ones and kissed it many times in her pretty italian fashion the lady understood her and stroked her cheek softly saying to her elder daughter we must take care of this good little creature freddy bring me your mittens these poor hands must be covered alice get your playhood this handkerchief is all wet and maud bring the old chinchilla tippet  the children ran and in a minute there were lovely blue mittens on the red hands a warm hood over the black braids and a soft pussy round the sore throat  ah so kind so very kind i have no way to say thank you but ranza shall be for you a heavenly angel and i will sing my heart out for your tree cried tessa folding the mittens as if she would say a prayer of thankfulness if she knew how  then they went away and the pretty children called after them come again tessa come again tommo now the rain didnt seem dismal the wind cold nor the way long as they bought their gifts and hurried home for kind words and the sweet magic of charity had changed all the world to them  i think the good spirits who fly about on christmas eve to help the loving fillers of little stockings smiled very kindly on tessa as she brooded joyfully over the small store of presents that seemed so magnificent to her all the goodies were divided evenly into three parts and stowed away in fathers three big socks which hung against the curtain with her three dollars she had got a pair of shoes for nono a knit cap for sep and a pair of white stockings for ranza to her she also gave the new hood to nono the mittens and to sep the tippet  now the dear boys can go out and my ranza will be ready for the lady to see in her nice new things said tessa quite sighing with pleasure to see how well the gifts looked pinned up beside the bulging socks which wouldnt hold them all the little mother kept nothing for herself but the pleasure of giving everything away yet i think she was both richer and happier than if she had kept them all her father laughed as he had not done since the mother died when he saw how comically the old curtain had broken out into boots and hoods stockings and tippets  i wish i had a gold gown and a silver hat for thee my tessa thou art so good may the saints bless and keep thee always said peter benari tenderly as he held his little daughter close and gave her the goodnight kiss  tessa felt very rich as she crept under the faded counterpane feeling as if she had received a lovely gift and fell happily asleep with chubby ranza in her arms and the two rough black heads peeping out at the foot of the bed she dreamed wonderful dreams that night and woke in the morning to find real wonders before her eyes she got up early to see if the socks were all right and there she found the most astonishing sight four socks instead of three and by the fourth pinned out quite elegantly was a little dress evidently meant for hera warm woollen dress all made and actually with bright buttons on it it nearly took her breath away so did the new boots on the floor and the funny long stocking like a grey sausage with a wooden doll staring out at the top as if she said politely a merry christmas maam tessa screamed and danced in her delight and up tumbled all the children to scream and dance with her making a regular carnival on a small scale everybody hugged and kissed everybody else offered sucks of orange bites of cake and exchanges of candy every one tried on the new things and pranced about in them like a flock of peacocks ranza skipped to and fro airily dressed in her white socks and the red hood the boys promenaded in their little shirts one with his creaking new shoes and mittens the other in his gay cap and fine tippet and tessa put her dress straight on feeling that her fathers gold gown was not all a joke in her long stocking she found all sorts of treasures for tommo had stuffed it full of queer things and his mother had made gingerbread into every imaginable shape from fat pigs to full omnibuses  dear me what happy little souls they were that morning and when they were quiet again how like a fairy tale did tessas story sound to them ranza was quite ready to be an angel and the boys promised to be marvellously good if they were only allowed to see the tree at the palace as they called the great house  little ranza was accepted with delight by the kind lady and her children and tessa learned the song quite easily the boys were asked and after a happy day the young italians all returned to play their parts at the fine christmas party mamma and miss rose drilled them all and when the foldingdoors flew open one rapturous oh arose from the crowd of children gathered to the festival i assure you it was splendid the great tree glittering with lights and gifts and on her invisible perch up among the green boughs sat the little goldenhaired angel all in white with downy wings a shining crown on her head and the most serene satisfaction in her blue eyes as she stretched her chubby arms to those below and smiled her baby smile at them before any one could speak a voice as fresh and sweet as a larks sang the christmas carol so blithely that every one stood still to hear and then clapped till the little angel shook on her perch and cried out be till or mell fall how they laughed at that and what fun they had talking to ranza while miss rose stripped the tree for the angel could not resist temptation and amused herself by eating all the bonbons she could reach till she was taken down to dance about like a fairy in a white frock and red shoes tessa and her friends had many presents the boys were perfect lambs tommo played for the little folks to dance and every one said something friendly to the strangers so that they did not feel shy in spite of shabby clothes it was a happy night and all their lives they remembered it as something too beautiful and bright to be quite true before they went home the kind mamma told tessa she should be her friend and gave her a motherly kiss which warmed the childs heart and seemed to set a seal upon that promise it was faithfully kept for the rich lady had been touched by tessas patient struggles and sacrifices and for many years thanks to her benevolence there was no end to tessas surprises     buzz   i live high up in a city house all alone my room is a cosy little place though there is nothing very splendid in itonly my pictures and books my flowers and my little friend when i began to live there i was very busy and therefore very happy but byandby when my hurry was over and i had more time to myself i often felt lonely when i ate my meals i used to wish for a pleasant companion to eat with me and when i sat by the fire of evenings i thought how much more social it would be if some one sat opposite i had many friends and callers through the day but the evenings were often rather dull for i couldnt read much and didnt care to go out in the stormy weather  i was wishing for a cheerful friend one night when all of a sudden i found one for sitting on my hand i saw a plump jollylooking fly he sat quietly staring at me with a mild little hum as if to say  how are you you wanted a friend and here i am will you have me  of course i would for i liked him directly he was so cheery and confiding and seemed as glad to see me as i was to see him all his mates were dead and gone and he was alone like myself so i waggled one finger by way of welcome fearing to shake my hand lest he should tumble off and feel hurt at my reception he seemed to understand me and buzzed again evidently saying  thank you maam i should like to stay in your warm room and amuse you for my board i wont disturb you but do my best to be a good little friend  so the bargain was struck and he stopped to tea i found that his manners had been neglected for he was inclined to walk over the butter drink out of the creampot and put his fingers in the jelly a few taps with my spoon taught him to behave with more propriety and he sipped a drop of milk from the waiter with a crumb of sugar as a wellbred fly should do  on account of his fine voice i named him buzz and we soon got on excellently together he seemed to like his new quarters and after exploring every corner of the room he chose his favourite haunts and began to enjoy himself i always knew where he was for he kept up a constant song humming and buzzing like a little kettle getting ready to boil  on sunny days he amused himself by bumping his head against the window and watching what went on outside it would have given me a headache but he seemed to enjoy it immensely up in my hanging basket of ivy he made his bower and sat there on the moss basking in the sunshine as luxuriously as any gentleman in his conservatory he was interested in the plants and examined them daily with great care walking over the ivy leaves grubbing under the moss and poking his head into the unfolding hyacinth buds to see how they got on  the pictures also seemed to attract his attention for he spent much time skating over the glasses and studying the designs sometimes i would find him staring at my madonna as if he said what in the world are all those topsyturvy children about then hed sit in the middle of a brook in a watercolor sketch by vautin as if bathing his feet or seem to be eating the cherry which one little duck politely offers another little duck in oscar pletchs summer party he frequently kissed my mothers portrait and sat on my fathers bald head as if trying to get out some of the wisdom stored up there like honey in an illthatched beehive my bronze mercury rather puzzled him for he could not understand why the young gentleman didnt fly off when he had four wings and seemed in such a hurry  im afraid he was a trifle vain for he sat before the glass a great deal and i often saw him cleaning his proboscis and twiddling his feelers and i know he was prinking as we say the books pleased him too and he used to run them over as if trying to choose which he would read and never seemed able to decide he would have nothing to say to the fat french dictionary or my english plays but liked goethe and schiller emerson and browning as well as i did carlyle didnt suit him and richter evidently made his head ache but jean ingelows poems delighted him and so did her stories told to a child fairy bells he often listened to and was very fond of the pictures in a photograph book of foreign places and great people  he frequently promenaded on the piazza of a little swiss chalet standing on the mantelpiece and thought it a charming residence for a single gentleman like himself the closet delighted him extremely and he buzzed in the most joyful manner when he got among the provisionsfor we kept house together such revels as he had in the sugarbowl such feasts of gingerbread and grapes such long sips of milk and sly peeps into every uncovered box and dish once im afraid he took too much cider for i found him lying on his back kicking and humming like a crazy top and he was very queer all the rest of that day so i kept the bottle corked after that but his favorite nook was among the ferns in the vase which a parian dancinggirl carried she stood just over the stove on one little toe rattling some castanets which made no sound and never getting a step farther for all her prancing this was a warm and pretty retreat for buzz and there he spent much of his time swinging on the ferns sleeping snugly in the vase or warming his feet in the hot air that blew up like a south wind from the stove  i dont believe there was a happier fly in boston than my friend buzz and i grew fonder and fonder of him every day for he never got into mischief but sung his cheery song no matter what the weather was and made himself agreeable then he was so interested in all i did it was delightful to have him round when i wrote he came and walked about over my paper to see that it was right peeped into my inkstand and ran after my pen he never made silly or sharp criticisms on my stories but appeared to admire them very much so i am sure he was a good judge when i sewed he sat in my basket or played hideandseek in the folds of my work talking away all the while in the most sociable manner he often flew up all of a sudden and danced about in the air as if he was in such a jolly mood he couldnt keep still and wanted me to come and play with him but alas i had no wings and could only sit stupidly still and laugh at his pranks that was his exercise for he never went out and only took a sniff of air now and then when i opened the windows  well little buzz and i lived together many weeks and never got tired of one another which is saying a good deal at christmas i went home for a week and left my room to take care of itself i put the hyacinths into the closet to be warm and dropped the curtain so the frost should not nip my ivy but i forgot buzz i really would have taken him with me or carried him down to a neighbours room to be taken care of while i was away but i never thought of him in the hurry of getting my presents and myself ready off i went without even saying goodbye and never thought of my little friend till freddy my small nephew said to me one evening at dusk  aunt jo tell me a story  so i began to tell him about buzz and all of a sudden i cried out  mercy on me im afraid hell die of cold while im gone  it troubled me a good deal and i wanted to know how the poor little fellow was so much that i would have gone to see if i had not been so far away but it would be rather silly to hurry away twenty miles to look after one fly so i finished my visit and then went back to my room hoping to find buzz alive and well in spite of the cold  alas no my little friend was gone there he lay on his back on the mantelpiece his legs meekly folded and his wings stiff and still he had evidently gone to the warm place and been surprised when the heat died out and left him to freeze my poor little buzz had sung his last song danced his last dance and gone where the good flies go i was very sorry and buried him among the ivy roots where the moss lay green above him the sun shone warmly on him and the bitter cold could never come i miss him very much when i sit writing i miss his cheerful voice and busy wings at meals there is no tiny little body to drink up spilt drops and eat the crumbs in the evenings when i sit alone i want him more than ever and every day as i water my plants i say softly  grow green ivy lie lightly moss shine warmly sun and make his last bed pleasant to my little friend     the childrens joke   you cant do this and you mustnt do that from morning to night try it yourself and see how youd like it muttered harry as he flung down his hat in sulky obedience to his fathers command to give up a swim in the river and keep himself cool with a book that warm summer evening  of course i should like to mind my parents good children always do began mr fairbairn entirely forgetting the pranks of his boyhood as people are apt to  glad i didnt know you then must have been a regular prig growled harry under his breath  silence sir go to your room and dont let me see you till teatime you must be taught respect as well as obedience and mr fairbairn gave the table a rap that caused his son to retire precipitately  on the stairs he met his sister kitty looking as cross as himself  whats the matter with you he asked pausing a minute for misery loves company  mamma will make me dress up in a stiff clean frock and have my hair curled over again just because some one may come i want to play in the garden and i cant all fussed up this way i do hate company and clothes and manners dont you answered kitty with a spiteful pull at her sash  i hate being ordered round everlastingly and badgered from morning till night id just like to be let alone and harry went on his way to captivity with a grim shake of the head and a very strong desire to run away from home altogether  so would i mamma is so fussy i never have any peace of my life sighed kitty feeling that her lot was a hard one  the martyr in brown linen went up and the other martyr in white cambric went down both looking as they felt rebellious and unhappy yet a stranger seeing them and their home would have thought they had everything heart could desire all the comforts that money could buy and all the beauty that taste could give seemed gathered round them papa and mamma loved the two little people dearly and no real care or sorrow came to trouble the lives that would have been all sunshine but for one thing with the best intentions in the world mr and mrs fairbairn were spoiling their children by constant faultfinding too many rules and too little sympathy with the active young souls and bodies under their care as harry said they were ordered about corrected and fussed over from morning till night and were getting so tired of it that the most desperate ideas began to enter their heads  now in the house was a quiet old maiden aunt who saw the mischief brewing and tried to cure it by suggesting more liberty and less nagging as the boys call it but mr and mrs f always silenced her by saying  my dear betsey you never had a family so how can you know anything about the proper management of children  they quite forgot that sister betsey had brought up a flock of motherless brothers and sisters and done it wisely and well though she never got any thanks or praise for it and never expected any for doing her duty faithfully if it had not been for aunty harry and kitty would have long ago carried out their favorite plan and have run away together like roland and maybird she kept them from this foolish prank by all sorts of unsuspected means and was their refuge in troublous times for all her quiet ways aunty was full of fun as well as sympathy and patience and she smoothed the thorny road to virtue with the innocent and kindly little arts that make some people as useful and beloved as good fairy godmothers were once upon a time  as they sat at tea that evening papa and mamma were most affable and lively but the childrens spirits were depressed by a long day of restraint and they sat like wellbred mutes languidly eating their supper  its the warm weather they need something bracing ill give them a dose of iron mixture tomorrow said mamma  ive taken enough now to make a cookingstove groaned kitty who hated being dosed  if youd let me go swimming every night id be all right added harry  not another word on that point i will not let you do it for you will get drowned as sure as you try said mamma who was so timid she had panics the minute her boy was out of sight  aunt betsey let her boys go and they never came to grief began harry  aunt betseys ideas and mine differ children are not brought up now as they were in her day answered mamma with a superior air  i just wish they were jolly good times her boys had  yes and girls too playing anything they liked and not rigged up and plagued with company cried kitty with sudden interest  what do you mean by that asked papa goodnaturedly for somehow his youth returned to him for a minute and seemed very pleasant  the children could not explain very well but harry said slowly  if you were to be in our places for a day youd see what we mean  wouldnt it be worth your while to try the experiment said aunt betsey with a smile  papa and mamma laughed at the idea but looked sober when aunty added  why not put yourselves in their places for a day and see how you like it i think you would understand the case better than any one could describe it and perhaps do both yourselves and the children a lasting service  upon my word thats a droll idea what do you say to it mamma and papa looked much amused  i am willing to try it if you are just for the fun of the thing but i dont think it will do any good and mamma shook her head as if aunt betseys plan was a wild one  the children sat quiet speechless with surprise at this singular proposal but as its full richness dawned upon them they skipped in their chairs and clapped their hands delightedly  how do you propose to carry out this new educational frolic asked papa beginning to feel some curiosity as to the part he was to play  merely let the children do as they like for one day and have full power over you let them plan your duties and pleasures order your food fix your hours and punish or reward you as they think proper you must promise entire obedience and keep the agreement till night  good good oh wont it be fun cried harry and kitty applauding enthusiastically while papa and mamma looked rather sober as the plan was developed before them  tomorrow is a holiday for us all and we might celebrate it by this funny experiment it will amuse us and do no harm at any rate added aunty quite in love with her new scheme  very well we will come mamma let us promise and see what these rogues will do for us playing father and mother is no joke mind you but you will have an easier time of it than we do for we shall behave ourselves said papa with a virtuous expression  mamma agreed and the supper ended merrily for every one was full of curiosity as to the success of the new play harry and kitty went to bed early that they might be ready for the exciting labors of the next day aunt betsey paid each a short visit before they slept and it is supposed that she laid out the order of performances and told each what to do for the little people would never have thought of so many sly things if left to themselves  at seven the next morning as mamma was in her dressingroom just putting on her cool easy wrapper in came kitty with a solemn face though her eyes danced with fun as she said  careless untidy girl put on a clean dress do up your hair properly and go and practise half an hour before breakfast  at first mamma looked as if inclined to refuse but kitty was firm and with a sigh mamma rustled into a stiff scratchy french print took her hair out of the comfortable net and braided it carefully up then instead of reading in her armchair she was led to the parlor and set to learning a hard piece of music  cant i have my early cup of tea and my roll she asked  eating between meals is a very bad habit and i cant allow it said kitty in the tone her mother often used to her i shall have a mug of new milk and a roll because grown people need more nourishment than children and sitting down she ate her early lunch with a relish while poor mamma played away feeling quite out of tune herself  harry found papa enjoying the last delightful doze that makes bed so fascinating of a morning as if half afraid to try the experiment the boy slowly approached and gave the sleeper a sudden hard shake saying briskly  come come come lazybones get up get up  papa started as if an earthquake had roused him and stared at harry astonished for a minute then he remembered and upset harrys gravity by whining out  come you let me alone it isnt time yet and i am so tired  harry took the joke and assuming the stern air of his father on such occasions said impressively  you have been called and now if you are not down in fifteen minutes you wont have any breakfast not a morsel sir not a morsel and coolly pocketing his fathers watch he retired to giggle all the way downstairs  when the breakfast bell rang mamma hurried into the diningroom longing for her tea but kitty sat behind the urn and said gravely  go back and enter the room properly will you never learn to behave like a lady  mamma looked impatient at the delay and having reentered in her most elegant manner sat down and passed her plate for fresh trout and muffins  no fish or hot bread for you my dear eat your good oatmeal porridge and milk that is the proper food for children  cant i have some tea cried mamma in despair for without it she felt quite lost  certainly not i never was allowed tea when a little girl and couldnt think of giving it to you said kitty filling a large cup for herself and sipping the forbidden draught with a relish  poor mamma quite groaned at this hard fate but meekly obeyed and ate the detested porridge understanding kittys dislike to it at last  harry sitting in his fathers chair read the paper and ate everything he could lay his hands on with a funny assumption of his fathers morning manner aunt betsey looked on much amused and now and then nodded to the children as if she thought things were going nicely  breakfast was half over when papa came in and was about to take harrys place when his son said trying vainly to look grave as he showed the watch  what did i tell you sir you are late again sir no breakfast sir im sorry but this habit must be broken up not a word its your own fault and you must bear the penalty  come now thats hard on a fellow im awful hungry cant i have just a bite of something asked papa quite taken aback at this stern decree  i said not a morsel and i shall keep my word go to your morning duties and let this be a lesson to you  papa cast a look at aunt betsey that was both comic and pathetic and departed without a word but he felt a sudden sympathy with his son who had often been sent fasting from the table for some small offence  now it was that he appreciated auntys kind heart and felt quite fond of her for in a few minutes she came to him as he raked the gravel walk harrys duty every day and slipping a nice warm wellbuttered muffin into his hand said in her motherly way  my dear do try and please your father he is right about late rising but i cant bear to see you starve  betsey you are an angel and turning his back to the house papa bolted the muffin with grateful rapidity inquiring with a laugh do you think those rogues will keep it up in this vigorous style all day  i trust so it isnt a bit overdone hope you like it and aunt betsey walked away looking as if she enjoyed it extremely  now put on your hat and draw baby up and down the avenue for half an hour dont go on the grass or you will wet your feet and dont play with baby i want her to go to sleep and dont talk to papa or he will neglect his work said kitty as they rose from table  now it was a warm morning and baby was heavy and the avenue was dull and mamma much preferred to stay in the house and sew the trimming on to a new and pretty dress  must i really kitty you are a hardhearted mamma to make me do it and mrs fairbairn hoped her playparent would relent  but she did not and only answered with a meaning look  i have to do it every day and you dont let me off  mamma said no more but put on her hat and trundled away with fretful baby thinking to find her fellowsufferer and have a laugh over the joke she was disappointed however for harry called papa away to weed the lettucebed and then shut him up in the study to get his lessons while he mounted the pony and trotted away to town to buy a new fishingrod and otherwise enjoy himself  when mamma came in hot and tired she was met by kitty with a bottle in one hand and a spoon in the other  here is your iron mixture dear now take it like a good girl  i wont and mamma looked quite stubborn  then aunty will hold your hands and i shall make you  but i dont like it i dont need it cried mamma  neither do i but you give it to me all the same im sure you need strengthening more than i do you have so many trials and kitty looked very sly as she quoted one of the words often on her mothers lips  youd better mind carrie it cant hurt you and you know you promised entire obedience set a good example said aunty  but i never thought these little chits would do so well ugh how disagreeable it is and mamma took her dose with a wry face feeling that aunt betsey was siding with the wrong party  now sit down and hem these towels till dinnertime i have so much to do i dont know which way to turn continued kitty much elated with her success  rest of any sort was welcome so mamma sewed busily till callers came they happened to be some little friends of kittys and she went to them in the parlor telling mamma to go up to nurse and have her hair brushed and her dress changed and then come and see the guests while she was away kitty told the girls the joke they were having and begged them to help her carry it out they agreed being ready for fun and not at all afraid of mrs fairbairn so when she came in they all began to kiss and cuddle and praise and pass her round as if she was a doll to her great discomfort and the great amusement of the little girls  while this was going on in the drawingroom harry was tutoring his father in the study and putting that poor gentleman through a course of questions that nearly drove him distracted for harry got out the hardest books he could find and selected the most puzzling subjects a dusty old history was rummaged out also and classical researches followed in which papas memory played him false more than once calling forth rebukes from his severe young tutor but he came to open disgrace over his mathematics for he had no head for figures and not being a business man had not troubled himself about the matter so harry who was in fine practice utterly routed him in mental arithmetic by giving him regular puzzlers and when he got stuck offered no help but shook his head and called him a stupid fellow  the dinnerbell released the exhausted student and he gladly took his sons place looking as if he had been hard at work he was faint with hunger but was helped last being only a boy and then checked every five minutes for eating too fast mamma was very meek and only looked wistfully at the pie when told in her own words that pastry was bad for children  any attempts at conversation were promptly quenched by the wornout old saying children should be seen not heard while harry and kitty chattered all dinnertime and enjoyed it to their hearts content especially the frequent pecks at their great children who to be even with them imitated all their tricks as well as they could  dont whistle at table papa keep your hands still mamma wait till you are helped sir tuck your napkin well in and dont spill your soup caroline  aunt betsey laughed till her eyes were full and they had a jolly time though the little people had the best of it for the others obeyed them in spite of their dislike to the new rules  now you may play for two hours was the gracious order issued as they rose from table  mamma fell upon a sofa exhausted and papa hurried to read his paper in the shady garden  usually these hours of apparent freedom were spoilt by constant callsnot to run not to play this or that or frequent calls to do errands the children had mercy however and left them in peace which was a wise move on the whole for the poor souls found rest so agreeable they privately resolved to let the children alone in their playhours  can i go over and see mr hammond asked papa wishing to use up the last halfhour of his time by a neighbourly call  no i dont like tommy hammond so i dont wish you to play with his father said harry with a sly twinkle of the eye as he turned the tables on his papa  mr fairbairn gave a low whistle and retired to the barn where harry followed him and ordered the man to harness up old bill  going to drive sir asked papa respectfully  dont ask questions was all the answer he got  old bill was put into the best buggy and driven to the hall door papa followed and mamma sprang up from her nap ready for her afternoon drive  cant i go she asked as kitty came down in her new hat and gloves  no there isnt room  why not have the carryall and let us go too we like it so much said papa in the pleading tone harry often used  kitty was about to consent for she loved mamma and found it hard to cross her so but harry was made of sterner stuff his wrongs still burned within him and he said impatiently  we cant be troubled with you the buggy is nicest and lightest and we want to talk over our affairs you my son can help john turn the hay on the lawn and caroline can amuse baby or help jane with the preserves little girls should be domestic  oh thunder growled papa  aunt betsey taught you that speech you saucy boy cried mamma as the children drove off in high glee leaving their parents to the distasteful tasks set them  mrs fairbairn wanted to read but baby was fretful and there was no kitty to turn him over to so she spent her afternoon amusing the small tyrant while papa made hay in the sun and didnt like it  just at teatime the children came home full of the charms of their drive but did not take the trouble to tell much about it to the stayathome people bread and milk was all they allowed their victims while they revelled in marmalade and cake fruit and tea  i expect company this evening but i dont wish you to sit up caroline you are too young and late hours are bad for your eyes go to bed and dont forget to brush your hair and teeth well five minutes for each cold cream your hands fold your ribbons hang up your clothes put out your boots to be cleaned and put in the mosquito bars i will come and take away the light when i am dressed  kitty delivered this dread command with effect for she had heard and cried over it too often not to have it quite by heart  but i cant go to bed at halfpast seven oclock of a summer night im not sleepy and this is just the pleasantest time of the whole day said mamma thinking her bargain a hard one  go up directly my daughter and dont discuss the matter i know what is best for you and kitty sent social wideawake mamma to bed there to lie thinking soberly till mrs kit came for the lamp  have you had a happy day love she asked bending over the pillow as her mother used to do  no maam  then it was your own fault my child obey your parents in all things and you will be both good and happy  that dependsbegan mamma but stopped short remembering that tomorrow she would be on the other side and anything she might say now would be quoted against her  but kitty understood and her heart melted as she hugged her mother and said in her own caressing way  poor little mamma did she have a hard time and didnt she like being a good girl and minding her parents  mamma laughed also and held kitty close but all she said was  goodnight dear dont be troubled it will be all right tomorrow  i hope so and with a hearty kiss kitty went thoughtfully downstairs to meet several little friends whom she had asked to spend the evening with her  as the ladies left the room papa leaned back and prepared to smoke a cigar feeling that he needed the comfort of it after this trying day but harry was down upon him at once  a very bad habitcant allow it throw that dirty thing away and go and get your latin lesson for tomorrow the study is quiet and we want this room  but i am tired i cant study at night let me off till tomorrow please sir begged papa who had not looked at latin since he left school  not a word sir i shall listen to no excuses and shall not let you neglect your education on any account and harry slapped the table √† la papa in the most impressive manner  mr fairbairn went away into the dull study and made believe do his lesson but he really smoked and meditated  the young folks had a grand revel and kept it up till ten oclock while mamma lay awake longing to go down and see what they were about and papa shortly fell asleep quite exhausted by the society of a latin grammar  idle boy is this the way you study said harry audaciously tweaking him by the ear  no its the way you do and feeling that his day of bondage was over papa cast off his allegiance tucked a child under each arm and marched upstairs with them kicking and screaming setting them down at the nursery door he said shaking his finger at them in an awful manner  wait a bit you rascals and see what you will get tomorrow  with this dark threat he vanished into his own room and a minute after a great burst of laughter set their fears at rest  it was a fair bargain so im not afraid said harry stoutly  he kissed us goodnight though he did glower at us so i guess it was only fun added kitty  hasnt it been a funny day asked harry  dont think i quite like it everything is so turned round said kitty  guess they didnt like it very well hear em talking in there and harry held up his finger for a steady murmur of conversation had followed the laughter in papa and mammas room  i wonder if our joke will do any good said kitty thoughtfully  wait and see answered aunt betsey popping her nightcapped head out of her room with a nod and a smile that sent them to bed full of hope for the future     dandelion   down by the sea lived ben the fisherman with his wife and little son who was called dandelion because he wore yellow pinafores and had curly yellow hair that covered his head with a golden fuzz a very happy family for ben was kind and industrious hetty his wife a cheerful busy creature and dandelion the jolliest threeyearold baby who ever made sandpies and paddled on the beach  but one day a great trouble came to them ben and his fellowfishermen sailed blithely away as usual and hetty watched the fleet of whitewinged boats out of the bay thinking how pretty they looked with the sunshine on them while dandelion stood clapping his chubby hands and saying as he always did daddy tummin soon but daddy did not come soon that time for a great storm arose and when some of the boats came scudding home at nightfall bens was not among them all night the gale raged and in the morning bens boat lay empty and broken on the shore his mates shook their heads when they saw the wreck and drew their rough hands over their eyes for ben was a good seaman and they knew he never would desert his boat alive they looked for him far and wide but could hear nothing of him and felt sure that he had perished in the storm they tried to comfort poor hetty but she would not be comforted her heart seemed broken and if it had not been for her baby her neighbours feared that she would have gone to join ben in his grave under the sea dandelion didnt understand why every one was so sad and why his father stayed away so long but he never lost his cheerfulness never gave up hoping or stopped saying with a contented smile daddy tummin soon the sunshiny little face was hettys only comfort the sight of the fuzzy yellow head bobbing round the house alone made it endurable and the touch of the loving baby hands kept her from the despair which made her long to end her sorrow in the sea  people dont believe in fairies nowadays nevertheless good spirits still exist and help us in our times of trouble better even than the little people we used to read about one of these household spirits is called love and it took the shape of dandelion to comfort poor hetty another is called labor a beautiful happy spirit this is and it did its part so well that there was little time for bitter thoughts or vain regrets for hettys spinningwheel must go in order to earn bread for dandelion whose mouth was always ready for food like a hungry birds busily hummed the wheel and as it flew it seemed to catch an echo of the babys cheerful song saying over and over daddy tummin soon till hetty stopped crying as she worked and listened to the cheerful whirr yes i shall see my good ben again if i wait patiently baby takes comfort in saying that and i will too though the poor dear will get tired of it soon she said  but dandelion didnt get tired he firmly believed what he said and nothing could change his mind he had been much troubled at seeing the boat laid up on the beach all broken and dismantled but his little mind couldnt take in the idea of shipwreck and death so after thinking it over he decided that daddy was waiting somewhere for a new boat to be sent to bring him home this idea was so strong that the child gathered together his store of toyboatsfor he had many as they were his favourite playthingand launched them one after another telling them to find his father and bring him home  as dandelion was not allowed to play on the beach except at low tide the little boats sailed safely away on the receding waves and the child was sure that some of them would get safely into the distant port where daddy was waiting all the boats were launched at last all sailed bravely away but none came back and little dandy was much disappointed he babbled about it to himself told the peeps and the horseshoes the snails and the lobsters of his trouble begged the gulls to fly away and find daddy and every windy night when the sea dashed on the shore and the shutters rattled he would want the lamp put in the window as it used to be when they expected ben and tried to make home look cheerful even before he got there  hetty used to humour the child though it made her heart ache to know that the light shone in vain at such times dandy would prance about the room in his little shirt and talk about daddy as happily as if long months had not passed without bringing him back when fairly in his big oldfashioned cradle the boy would lie looking more like a dandelion than ever in his yellow flannel nightgown playing with his toes or rocking himself to and fro calling the cradle his boat and blithely telling his mother that he was sailing far way to find daddy when tired of play he lay still and asked her to sing to him she had no heart for the gay old seasongs she used to sing for lullabies so she sung hymns in her soft motherly voice till the blue eyes closed and the golden head lay still looking so pretty with the circle of bright hair above the rosy face my little saint hetty called him and though she often wept sadly as she watched him the bitterness of her grief passed away and a patient hope came to her for the childs firm faith impressed her deeply the pious music of the sweet old hymns comforted her sore heart and daily labor kept her cheerful in spite of herself the neighbours wondered at the change that came over her but she could not explain it and no one knew that the three good spirits called love labor and hope were working their pleasant miracles  six long months went by and no one ever thought of seeing ben againno one but his little son who still watched for him here and his wife who waited to meet him hereafter  one bright spring day something happened the house was as tidy as ever the wheel hummed briskly as hetty sung softly to herself with a cheerful face though there were white hairs among the brown and her eyes had a thoughtful absent look at times dandelion more chubby and cheery than ever sat at her feet with the sunshine making a golden glory of his yellow hair as he tried his new boat in the tub of water his mother kept for her little sailor or tugged away with his fat fingers at a big needle which he was trying to pull through a bit of cloth intended for a sail the faithful little soul had not forgotten his father but had come to the conclusion that the reason his boats never prospered was because they hadnt large enough sails so he was intent on rigging a new boat lately given him with a sail that could not fail to waft ben safely home with his mouth puckered up his downy eyebrows knit and both hands pulling at the big needle he was so wrapped in his work that he did not mind the stopping of the wheel when hetty fell into a reverie thinking of the happy time when she and ben should meet again sitting so neither heard a step come softly over the sand neither saw an eager brown face peer in at the door and neither knew for a minute that ben was watching them with a love and longing in his heart that made him tremble like a woman  dandelion saw him first for as he pulled the thread through with a triumphant jerk the small sailmaker lost his balance tumbled over and lay staring up at the tall man with his blue eyes so wide open they looked as if they would never shut again all of a sudden he shouted with a joyful shout daddys tummin and the next instant vanished ship and all in the arms of the man who wore the rough jacket over went the spinningwheel as hetty vanished likewise and for a time there was nothing but sobbing and kissing clinging and thanking heaven for its kindness to them when they grew quieter and ben got into his old chair with his wife on one knee and his boy on the other he told them how he was wrecked in the gale picked up by an outwardbound ship and only able to get back after months of sickness and delay  my boaty fetched him said dandelion feeling that every thing had turned out just as he expected  so it did my precious leastways your faith helped i havent a doubt cried hetty hugging the curly headed prophet close as she told ben all that had happened  ben didnt say much but a few great tears rolled down the rough blue jacket as he looked from the queer sail with its two big stitches to the little son whose love he firmly believed had kept him safe through many dangers and brought him home at last  when the fine new boat was built no one thought it strange that ben named it dandelion no one laughed at the little sail which always hung over the fireplace in the small house and long years after when ben was an old man and sat by the door with his grandchildren on his knee the story which always pleased them best was that which ended with the funny words daddy tummin soon     madam cluck and her family   there never was a prouder mamma than madam cluck when she led forth her family of eight downy little chicks chanticleer strut snowball speckle peep peck downy and blot were their names and no sooner were they out of the shell than they began to chirp and scratch as gaily as if the big world in which they suddenly found themselves was made for their especial benefit it was a fine brood but poor madam cluck had bad luck with her chicks for they were her first and she didnt know how to manage them old aunt cockletop told her that she didnt and predicted that those poor dears would come to bad ends  aunt cockletop was right as you will see when i have told the sad history of this unfortunate family the tragedy began with chanty who was the boldest little cockadoodle who ever tried to crow before he had a feather to his bit of a tail chanty began to fight and soon was known as the most quarrelsome chick in the farmyard having pecked his brothers and sisters he tried to do the same to his playmates the ducklings goslings and young turkeys and was so disagreeable that all the fowls hated him one day a pair of bantams arrivedpretty little white birds with red crests and nice yellow feet chanty thought he could beat mr bantam easily he was so small and invited him to fight mr b declined then chanty called him a coward and gave mrs b a peck which so enraged her spouse that he flew at chanty like a gamecock and a dreadful fight followed which ended in chantys utter defeat for he died from his wounds  downy and snowball soon followed for the two sweet little things would swing on the burdockleaves that grew over the brook sitting side by side the plump sisters were placidly swaying up and down over the clear brown water rippling below whenah sad to relatethe stem broke and down went leaf chickens and all to a watery death  im the most unlucky hen ever hatched groaned poor madam cluck and it did seem so for the very next week speckle the best and prettiest of the brood went to walk with aunt cockletop grasshoppering they called it in the great field across the road what a nice time speckle did have to be sure for the grasshoppers were lively and fat and aunt was in an unusually amiable mood  never run away from anything but face danger and conquer it like a brave chick said the old biddy as she went clucking through the grass with her gray turban wagging in the wind speckle had hopped away from a toad with a startled chirp which caused aunt to utter that remark the words had hardly left her beak when a shadow above made her look up give one loud croak of alarm and then scuttle away as fast as legs and wings could carry her  little speckle remembering the advice and unconscious of the danger stood her ground as a great hawk came circling nearer and nearer till with a sudden dart he pounced on the poor chicken and bore it away chirping dismally  aunty told me not to run oh dear oh dear what shall i do  it was a dreadful blow to mrs cluck and aunt cockletop didnt show herself for a whole day after that story was known for every fowl in the yard twitted her with the difference between her preaching and her practice  strut the other son was the vainest chick ever seen and the great aim of his life was to crow louder than any other cock in the neighbourhood he was at it from morning till night and everyone was tired to death of hearing his shrill small voice making funny attempts to produce hoarse little crows as he sat on the wall and stretched his yellow neck till his throat quite ached with the effort  ah if i could only fly to the highest beam in the barn and give a splendid crow that everyone could hear i should be perfectly happy said this silly little fowl as he stared up at the loft where the old cock often sat  so he tried every day to fly and crow and at last managed to get up then how he did strut and rustle his feathers while his playmates sat below and watched him  youll fall and get hurt said his sister blot  hold your tongue you ugly little thing and dont talk to me im going to crow and cant be interrupted by any silly bit of a hen be quiet down there and hear if i cant do it as well as daddy  the chicks stopped scratching and peeping and sat in a row to hear strut crow perching himself on the beam he tried his best but only a droll cockadoodledoo came of it and all the chicks laughed that made strut mad and he resolved to crow even if he killed himself doing it he gave an angry cluck flapped his wings and tried again alas alas for poor strut he leaned so far forward in his frantic effort to get a big crow out that he toppled over and fell bump on the hard barnfloor killing himself instantly  for some time after this mrs cluck kept her three remaining little ones close to her side watching over them with maternal care till they were heartily tired of her anxious cluckings peep and peck were always together being very fond of one another peep was a most inquisitive chicken poking her head into every nook and corner and never satisfied till she had seen all there was to see peck was a glutton eating everything she could find and often making herself ill by gobbling too fast and forgetting to eat a little gravel to help digest her food  dont go out of the barn children im going to lay an egg and cant look after you just now said their mother one day  yes maam chirped the chickens and then as she went rustling into the haymow they began to run about and enjoy themselves with all their might peep found a little hole into the mealroom and slipped in full of joy at the sight of the bags boxes and bins ill eat all i want and then ill call peck she said and having taken a taste of every thing she was about to leave when she heard the stableman coming and in her fright couldnt find the hole so flew into the mealbin and hid herself sam never saw her but shut down the cover of the bin as he passed and left poor peep to die no one knew what had become of her till some days later when she was found dead in the meal with her poor little claws sticking straight up as if imploring help peck meanwhile got into mischief also for in her hunt for something good to eat she strayed into the sheepshed and finding some salt ate as much as she liked not knowing that salt is bad for hens having taken all she wanted she ran back to the barn and was innocently catching gnats when her mamma came out of the haymow with a loud cutcutcutcadarcut  where is peep asked mrs cluck  dont know ma shethere peck stopped suddenly rolled up her eyes and began to stagger about as if she was tipsy  mercy on us whats the matter with the chick cried mrs cluck in great alarm  fits maam answered doctor drake who just then waddled by  oh what can i do screamed the distracted hen  nothing maam its fatal and the doctor waddled on to visit dame partlets son who was ill of the pip  my child my child dont flap and stagger so let me hold you taste this mintleaf have a drop of water what shall i do  as poor mrs cluck sighed and sobbed her unhappy child went scuffling about on her back gasping and rolling up her eyes in great anguish for she had eaten too much of the fatal salt and there was no help for her when all was over they buried the dead chicken under a currant bush covered the little grave with chickweed and the bereaved parent wore a black string round her leg for a month  blot the last of that bright band needed no mourning for she was as black as a crow this was the reason why her mother never had loved her as much as she did the others who were all white gray or yellow poor little blot had been much neglected by every one but now her lonely mamma discovered how good and affectionate a chicken she was for blot was a great comfort to her never running away or disobeying in any way but always close to her side ready to creep under her wing or bring her a plump bug when the poor biddys appetite failed her they were very happy together till thanksgiving drew near when a dreadful pestilence seemed to sweep through the farmyard for turkeys hens ducks and geese fell a prey to it and were seen by their surviving relatives featherless pale and stiff borne away to some unknown place whence no fowl returned blot was waked one night by a great cackling and fluttering in the henhouse and peeping down from her perch saw a great hand glide along the roost clutch her beloved mother by the leg and pull her off screaming dolefully goodby goodby my darling child  aunt cockletop pecked and croaked fiercely but tough as she was the old biddy did not escape and many another amiable hen and gallant cockadoodle fell a victim to that mysterious hand in the morning few remained and blot felt that she was a forlorn orphan a thought which caused her to sit with her head under her wing for several hours brooding over her sad lot and longing to join her family in some safe and happy land where fowls live in peace she had her wish very soon for one day when the first snowflakes began to flutter out of the cold gray sky blot saw a little kitten mewing pitifully as it sat under the fence  what is the matter dear asked kind blot  im lost and i cant find my way home answered the kitten shivering with cold i live at the red farmhouse over the hill only i dont know which road to take  ill show you come at once for night is coming on and the snow will soon be too deep for us said blot  so away they went as fast as their small legs could carry them but it was a long way and dusk came on before the red farmhouse appeared  now im safe thank you very much wont you come in and stay all night my mother will be glad to see you said the kit rubbing her soft white face against blots little black breast  its against the rule to stay out all night and i promised to be in early so goodby dear and off trotted blot along the snowy road hoping to get home before the henhouse door was shut faster and faster fell the snow darker and darker grew the night and colder and colder became poor blots little feet as she waded through the drifts the firelight was shining out into the gloom as the halffrozen chicken came into the yard to find all doors shut and no shelter left for her but the bough of a leafless tree too stiff and weak to fly up she crept as close as possible to the bright glow which shone across the doorstep and with a shiver put her little head under her wing trying to forget hunger weariness and the bitter cold and wait patiently for morning but when morning came little blot lay frozen stiff under a coverlet of snow and the tenderhearted children sighed as they dug a grave for the last of the unfortunate family of the clucks     a curious call   i have often wondered what the various statues standing about the city think of all day and what criticisms they would make upon us and our doings if they could speak i frequently stop and stare at them wondering if they dont feel lonely if they wouldnt be glad of a nod as we go by and i always long to offer my umbrella to shield their uncovered heads on a rainy day especially to good ben franklin when the snow lies white on his benevolent forehead i was always fond of this old gentleman and one of my favourite stories when a little girl was that of his early life and the time when he was so poor he walked about philadelphia with a roll of bread under each arm eating a third as he went i never pass without giving him a respectful look and wishing he could know how grateful i am for all he had done in the printing line for without types and presses where would the books be  well i never imagined that he understood why the tall woman in the big bonnet stared at him but he did and he liked it and managed to let me know it in a very curious manner as you shall hear  as i look out the first thing i see is the great gilt eagle on the cityhall dome there he sits with open wings all day long looking down on the people who must appear like ants scampering busily to and fro about an anthill the sun shines on him splendidly in the morning the gay flag waves and rustles in the wind above him sometimes and the moonlight turns him to silver when she comes glittering up the sky when it rains he never shakes his feathers snow beats on him without disturbing his stately repose and he never puts his head under his wing at night but keeps guard in darkness as in day like a faithful sentinel i like the big lonely bird call him my particular fowl and often wish hed turn his head and speak to me one night he did actually do it or seemed to for ive never been able to decide whether i dreamed what im going to tell you or whether it really happened  it was a stormy night and as i drew down my curtain i said to myself after peering through the driving snow to catch a glimpse of my neighbour poor goldy hell have a rough time of it i hope this northeaster wont blow him off his perch then i sat down by my fire took my knitting and began to meditate im sure i didnt fall asleep but i cant prove it so well say no more about it all at once there came a tap at my door as i thought and i said come in just as mr poe did when that unpleasant raven paid him a call no one came so i went to see who it was not a sign of a human soul in the long hall only little jessie the poodle asleep on her mat down i sat but in a minute the tap came again this time so loud that i knew it was at the window and went to open it thinking that one of my doves wanted to come in perhaps up went the sash and in bounced something so big and so bright that it dazzled and scared me  dont be frightened maam its only me said a hoarse voice so i collected my wits rubbed my eyes and looked at my visitor it was the gold eagle off the city hall i dont expect to be believed but i wish youd been here to see for i give you my word it was a sight to behold how he ever got in at such a small window i cant tell but there he was strutting majestically up and down the room his golden plumage rustling and his keen eyes flashing as he walked i really didnt know what to do i couldnt imagine what he came for i had my doubts about the propriety of offering him a chair and he was so much bigger than i expected that i was afraid he might fly away with me as the roc did with sindbad so i did nothing but sidle to the door ready to whisk out if my strange guest appeared to be peckishly inclined my respectful silence seemed to suit him for after a turn or two he paused nodded gravely and said affably goodevening maam i stepped over to bring you old bens respects and to see how you were getting on  im very much obliged sir may i inquire who mr oldben is im afraid i havent the honour of his acquaintance  yes you have its ben franklin of cityhall yard you know him and he wished me to thank you for your interest in him  dear me how very odd will you sit down sir  never sit ill perch here and the great fowl took his accustomed attitude just in front of the fire looking so very splendid that i couldnt keep my eyes off of him  ah you often do that never mind i rather like it said the eagle graciously as he turned his brilliant eye upon me i was rather abashed but being very curious i ventured to ask a few questions as he seemed in a friendly mood  being a woman sir im naturally of an inquiring turn and i must confess that i have a strong desire to know how it happens that you take your walks abroad when you are supposed to be permanently engaged at home  he shrugged his shoulders and actually winked at me as he replied thats all people know of what goes on under or rather over their noses bless you maam i leave my roost every night and enjoy myself in all sorts of larks excuse the expression but being ornithological it is more proper for me than for some people who use it  what a gay old bird thought i feeling quite at home after that please tell me what you do when the shades of evening prevail and you go out for a frolic  i am a gentleman therefore i behave myself returned the eagle with a stately air i must confess i smoke a great deal but thats not my fault its the fault of the chimneys they keep it up all day and i have to take it just as you poor ladies have to take cigar smoke whether you like it or not my amusements are of a wholesome kind i usually begin by taking a long flight down the harbour for a look at the lighthouses the islands the shipping and the sea my friends the gulls bring their reports to me for they are the harbourpolice and i take notes of their doings the schoolship is an object of interest to me and i often perch on the masthead to see how the lads are getting on then i take a turn over the city gossip with the weathercocks pay my compliments to the bells inspect the firealarm and pick up information by listening at the telegraph wires people often talk about a little bird who spreads news but they dont know how that figure of speech originated it is the sparrows sitting on the wires who receive the electric shock and being hollowboned the news go straight to their heads they then fly about chirping it on the housetops and the air carries it everywhere thats the way rumours rise and news spread  if youll allow ill make a note of that interesting fact said i wondering if i might believe him he appeared to fall into a reverie while i jotted down the sparrow story and it occurred to me that perhaps i ought to offer my distinguished guest some refreshment but when i modestly alluded to it he said with an aldermanic air no thank you ive just dined at the parker house  now i really could not swallow that and so plainly betrayed my incredulity that the eagle explained the savoury smells which rise to my nostrils from that excellent hotel with an occasional sniff from the tremont are quite sufficient to satisfy my appetite for having no stomach i dont need much food and i drink nothing but water  i wish others would follow your example in that latter habit said i respectfully for i was beginning to see that there was something in my bird though he was hollow will you allow me to ask if the other statues in the city fly by night  they promenade in the parks and occasionally have social gatherings when they discuss politics education medicine or any of the subjects in which they are interested ah we have grand times when you are all asleep it quite repays me for being obliged to make an owl of myself  do the statues come from the shops to these parties i asked resolving to take a late walk the next moonlight night  sometimes but they get lazy and delicate living in close warm places we laugh at cold and bad weather and are so strong and hearty that i shouldnt be surprised if i saw webster and everett flying round the common on the newfashioned velocipedes for they believed in exercise goethe and schiller often step over from de vriess window to flirt with the goddesses who come down from their niches on horticultural hall nice robust young women are pomona and flora if your niminypiminy girls could see them run they would stop tilting through the streets and learn that the true grecian bend is the line of beauty always found in straight shoulders wellopened chest and an upright figure firmly planted on active feet  in your rambles dont you find a great deal of misery said i to change the subject for he was evidently oldfashioned in his notions  many sad sights and he shook his head with a sigh then added briskly but there is a deal of charity in our city and it does its work beautifully by the by i heard of a very sweet charity the other daya church whose sunday school is open to all the poor children who will come and there in pleasant rooms with books pictures kindly teachers and a fatherly minister to welcome them the poor little creatures find refreshment for their hungry souls i like that its a lovely illustration of the text suffer little children to come unto me and i call it practical christianity  he did like it my benevolent old bird for he rustled his great wings as if he wanted to clap them if there had only been room and every feather shone as if a clearer light than that of my little fire had fallen on it as he spoke  you are a literary woman hey he said suddenly as if hed got a new idea and was going to pounce upon me with it  ahem i do a little in that line i answered with a modest cough  then tell people about that place write some stories for the children go and help teach them do something and make others do what they can to increase the sabbath sunshine that brightens one day in the week for the poor babies who live in shady places  i should be glad to do my best and if id known beforei began  you might have known if youd looked about you people are so wrapt up in their own affairs they dont do half they might now then hand me a bit of paper and ill give you the address so you wont have any excuse for forgetting what i tell you  mercy on us what will he do next thought i as he tweaked a feather out of his breast gave the nib a peck and then coolly wrote these words on the card i handed him church of the disciples knock and it shall be opened there it was in letters of gold and while i looked at it feeling reproached that i hadnt known it sooner my friendhe didnt seem a stranger any moresaid in a businesslike tone as he put back his pen now i must be off old ben reads an article on the abuses of the press at the present day and i must be there to report  it must be very interesting i suppose you dont allow mortals at your meetings said i burning to go in spite of the storm  no maam we meet on the common and in the present state of the weather i dont think flesh and blood would stand it bronze marble and wood are sterner stuff and can defy the elements  good evening pray call again i said hospitably  i will your eyrie suits me but dont expect me to call in the daytime im on duty then and cant take my eye off my charge the city needs a deal of watching my dear bless me its striking eight your watch is seven minutes slow by the old south goodnight goodnight  and as i opened the window the great bird soared away like a flash of light through the storm leaving me so astonished at the whole performance that i havent got over it yet     tillys christmas   im so glad tomorrow is christmas because im going to have lots of presents  so am i glad though i dont expect any presents but a pair of mittens  and so am i but i shant have any presents at all  as the three little girls trudged home from school they said these things and as tilly spoke both the others looked at her with pity and some surprise for she spoke cheerfully and they wondered how she could be happy when she was so poor she could have no presents on christmas  dont you wish you could find a purse full of money right here in the path said kate the child who was going to have lots of presents  oh dont i if i could keep it honestly and tillys eyes shone at the very thought  what would you buy asked bessy rubbing her cold hands and longing for her mittens  id buy a pair of large warm blankets a load of wood a shawl for mother and a pair of shoes for me and if there was enough left id give bessy a new hat and then she neednt wear bens old felt one answered tilly  the girls laughed at that but bessy pulled the funny hat over her ears and said she was much obliged but shed rather have candy  lets look and maybe we can find a purse people are always going about with money at christmas time and some one may lose it here said kate  so as they went along the snowy road they looked about them half in earnest half in fun suddenly tilly sprang forward exclaiming  i see it ive found it  the others followed but all stopped disappointed for it wasnt a purse it was only a little bird it lay upon the snow with its wings spread and feebly fluttering as if too weak to fly its little feet were benumbed with cold its once bright eyes were dull with pain and instead of a blithe song it could only utter a faint chirp now and then as if crying for help  nothing but a stupid old robin how provoking cried kate sitting down to rest  i shant touch it i found one once and took care of it and the ungrateful thing flew away the minute it was well said bessy creeping under kates shawl and putting her hands under her chin to warm them  poor little birdie how pitiful he looks and how glad he must be to see some one coming to help him ill take him up gently and carry him home to mother dont be frightened dear im your friend and tilly knelt down in the snow stretching her hand to the bird with the tenderest pity in her face  kate and bessy laughed  dont stop for that thing its getting late and cold lets go on and look for the purse they said moving away  you wouldnt leave it to die cried tilly id rather have the bird than the money so i shant look any more the purse wouldnt be mine and i should only be tempted to keep it but this poor thing will thank and love me and im so glad i came in time  gently lifting the bird tilly felt its tiny cold claws cling to her hand and saw its dim eyes brighten as it nestled down with a grateful chirp  now ive got a christmas present after all she said smiling as they walked on i always wanted a bird and this one will be such a pretty pet for me  hell fly away the first chance he gets and die anyhow so youd better not waste your time over him said bessy  he cant pay you for taking care of him and my mother says it isnt worth while to help folks that cant help us added kate  my mother says do as youd be done by and im sure id like any one to help me if i was dying of cold and hunger love your neighbour as yourself is another of her sayings this bird is my little neighbour and ill love him and care for him as i often wish our rich neighbour would love and care for us answered tilly breathing her warm breath over the benumbed bird who looked up at her with confiding eyes quick to feel and know a friend  what a funny girl you are said kate caring for that silly bird and talking about loving your neighbour in that sober way mr king dont care a bit for you and never will though he knows how poor you are so i dont think your plan amounts to much  i believe it though and shall do my part any way goodnight i hope youll have a merry christmas and lots of pretty things answered tilly as they parted  her eyes were full and she felt so poor as she went on alone toward the little old house where she lived it would have been so pleasant to know that she was going to have some of the pretty things all children love to find in their full stockings on christmas morning and pleasanter still to have been able to give her mother something nice so many comforts were needed and there was no hope of getting them for they could barely get food and fire  never mind birdie well make the best of what we have and be merry in spite of every thing you shall have a happy christmas any way and i know god wont forget us if every one else does  she stopped a minute to wipe her eyes and lean her cheek against the birds soft breast finding great comfort in the little creature though it could only love her nothing more  see mother what a nice present ive found she cried going in with a cheery face that was like sunshine in the dark room  im glad of that dearie for i havent been able to get my little girl anything but a rosy apple poor bird give it some of your warm bread and milk  why mother what a big bowlful im afraid you gave me all the milk said tilly smiling over the nice steaming supper that stood ready for her  ive had plenty dear sit down and dry your wet feet and put the bird in my basket on this warm flannel  tilly peeped into the closet and saw nothing there but dry bread  mothers given me all the milk and is going without her tea cause she knows im hungry now ill surprise her and she shall have a good supper too she is going to split wood and ill fix it while shes gone  so tilly put down the old teapot carefully poured out a part of the milk and from her pocket produced a great plummy bun that one of the schoolchildren had given her and she had saved for her mother a slice of the dry bread was nicely toasted and the bit of butter set by for her put on it when her mother came in there was the table drawn up in a warm place a hot cup of tea ready and tilly and birdie waiting for her  such a poor little supper and yet such a happy one for love charity and contentment were guests there and that christmas eve was a blither one than that up at the great house where lights shone fires blazed a great tree glittered and music sounded as the children danced and played  we must go to bed early for weve only wood enough to last over tomorrow i shall be paid for my work the day after and then we can get some said tillys mother as they sat by the fire  if my bird was only a fairy bird and would give us three wishes how nice it would be poor dear he cant give me any thing but its no matter answered tilly looking at the robin who lay in the basket with his head under his wing a mere little feathery bunch  he can give you one thing tillythe pleasure of doing good that is one of the sweetest things in life and the poor can enjoy it as well as the rich  as her mother spoke with her tired hand softly stroking her little daughters hair tilly suddenly started and pointed to the window saying in a frightened whisper  i saw a facea mans face looking in its gone now but i truly saw it  some traveller attracted by the light perhaps ill go and see and tillys mother went to the door  no one was there the wind blew cold the stars shone the snow lay white on field and wood and the christmas moon was glittering in the sky  what sort of a face was it asked tillys mother coming back  a pleasant sort of face i think but i was so startled i dont quite know what it was like i wish we had a curtain there said tilly  i like to have our light shine out in the evening for the road is dark and lonely just here and the twinkle of our lamp is pleasant to peoples eyes as they go by we can do so little for our neighbours i am glad to cheer the way for them now put these poor old shoes to dry and go to bed dearie ill come soon  tilly went taking her bird with her to sleep in his basket near by lest he should be lonely in the night  soon the little house was dark and still and no one saw the christmas spirits at their work that night  when tilly opened the door next morning she gave a loud cry clapped her hands and then stood still quite speechless with wonder and delight there before the door lay a great pile of wood all ready to burn a big bundle and a basket with a lovely nosegay of winter roses holly and evergreen tied to the handle  oh mother did the fairies do it cried tilly pale with her happiness as she seized the basket while her mother took in the bundle  yes dear the best and dearest fairy in the world called charity she walks abroad at christmas time does beautiful deeds like this and does not stay to be thanked answered her mother with full eyes as she undid the parcel  there they werethe warm thick blankets the comfortable shawls the new shoes and best of all a pretty winter hat for bessy the basket was full of good things to eat and on the flowers lay a paper saying  for the little girl who loves her neighbour as herself  mother i really think my bird is a fairy bird and all these splendid things come from him said tilly laughing and crying with joy  it really did seem so for as she spoke the robin flew to the table hopped to the nosegay and perching among the roses began to chirp with all his little might the sun streamed in on flowers bird and happy child and no one saw a shadow glide away from the window no one ever knew that mr king had seen and heard the little girls the night before or dreamed that the rich neighbour had learned a lesson from the poor neighbour  and tillys bird was a fairy bird for by her love and tenderness to the helpless thing she brought good gifts to herself happiness to the unknown giver of them and a faithful little friend who did not fly away but stayed with her till the snow was gone making summer for her in the wintertime     my little gentleman   no one would have thought of calling him so this ragged barefooted frecklefaced jack who spent his days carrying marketbaskets for the butcher or clean clothes for mrs quinn selling chips or grubbing in the ashheaps for cinders but he was honestly earning his living doing his duty as well as he knew how and serving those poorer and more helpless than himself and that is being a gentleman in the best sense of that fine old word he had no home but mrs quinns garret and for this he paid by carrying the bundles and getting the cinders for her fire food and clothes he picked up as he could and his only friend was little nanny her mother had been kind to him when the death of his father left him all alone in the world and when she too passed away the boy tried to show his gratitude by comforting the little girl who thought there was no one in the world like her jack  old mrs quinn took care of her waiting till she was strong enough to work for herself but nanny had been sick and still sat about a pale little shadow of her former self with a white film slowly coming over her pretty blue eyes this was jacks great trouble and he couldnt whistle it away as he did his own worries for he was a cheery lad and when the baskets were heavy the way long the weather bitter cold his poor clothes in rags or his stomach empty he just whistled and somehow things seemed to get right but the day he carried nanny the first dandelions and she felt of them instead of looking at them as she said with such pathetic patience in her little face i dont see em but i know theyre pretty and i like em lots jack felt as if the blithe spring sunshine was all spoiled and when he tried to cheer himself up with a good whistle his lips trembled so they wouldnt pucker  the poor dears eyes could be cured i aint a doubt but it would take a sight of money and whos agoing to pay it said mrs quinn scrubbing away at her tub  how much money asked jack  a hundred dollars i dare say dr wilkinsons cook told me once that he done something to a ladys eyes and asked a thousand dollars for it  jack sighed a long hopeless sigh and went away to fill the waterpails but he remembered the doctors name and began to wonder how many years it would take to earn a hundred dollars  nanny was very patient but by and by mrs quinn began to talk about sending her to some almshouse for she was too poor to be burdened with a helpless child the fear of this nearly broke jacks heart and he went about with such an anxious face that it was a mercy nanny did not see it jack was only twelve but he had a hard load to carry just then for the thought of his little friend doomed to lifelong darkness for want of a little money tempted him to steal more than once and gave him the first fierce bitter feeling against those better off than he when he carried nice dinners to the great houses and saw the plenty that prevailed there he couldnt help feeling that it wasnt fair for some to have so much and others so little when he saw pretty children playing in the park or driving with their mothers so gay so well cared for so tenderly loved the poor boys eyes would fill to think of poor little nanny with no friend in the world but himself and he so powerless to help her  when he one day mustered courage to ring at the great doctors bell begging to see him a minute and the servant answered gruffly as he shut the door go along he cant be bothered with the like of you jack clenched his hands hard as he went down the steps and said to himself with a most unboyish tone ill get the money somehow and make him let me in  he did get it and in a most unexpected way but he never forgot the desperate feeling that came to him that day and all his life long he was very tender to people who were tempted in their times of trouble and yielded as he was saved from doing by what seemed an accident  some days after his attempt at the doctors as he was grubbing in a newlydeposited ashheap with the bitter feeling very bad and the trouble very heavy he found a dirty old pocketbook and put it in his bosom without stopping to examine it for many boys and girls were scratching like a brood of chickens all round him and the pickings were unusually good so no time must be lost findings is havings was one of the laws of the ashheap haunters and no one thought of disputing anothers right to the spoons and knives that occasionally found their way into the ashbarrels while bottles old shoes rags and paper were regular articles of traffic among them jack got a good basketful that day and when the hurry was over sat down to rest and clear the dirt off his face with an old silk duster which he had picked out of the rubbish thinking mrs quinn might wash it up for a handkerchief but he didnt wipe his dirty face that day for with the rag out tumbled a pocketbook and on opening it he sawmoney yes a roll of bills with two figures on all of themthree tens and one twenty it took his breath away for a minute then he hugged the old book tight in both his grimy hands and rocked to and fro all in a heap among the oystershells and rusty tin kettles saying to himself with tears running down his cheeks o nanny o nanny now i can do it  i dont think a basket of cinders ever travelled at such a rate before as mrs quinns did that day for jack tore home at a great pace and burst into the room waving the old duster and shouting hooray ive got it ive got it  it is no wonder mrs quinn thought he had lost his wits for he looked like a wild boy with his face all streaked with tears and red ashes as he danced a doubleshuffle till he was breathless then showered the money into nannys lap and hugged her with another hooray which ended in a choke when they got him quiet and heard the story mrs quinn rather damped his joy by telling him the money wasnt his and he ought to advertise it  but i want it for nanny cried jack and how can i ever find who owns it when there was ever so many barrels emptied in that heap and no one knows where they came from  its very like you wont find the owner and you can do as you please but its honest to try im thinking for some poor girl may have lost her earnins this way and we wouldnt like that ourselves said mrs quinn turning over the shabby pocketbook and carefully searching for some clue to its owner  nanny looked very sober and jack grabbed up the money as if it were too precious to lose but he wasnt comfortable about it and after a hard fight with himself he consented to let mrs quinn ask their policeman what they should do he was a kindly man and when he heard the story said hed do what was right and if he couldnt find an owner jack should have the fifty dollars back  how hard it was to wait how jack thought and dreamed of his money day and night how nanny ran to the door to listen when a heavy step came up the stairs and how wistfully the poor darkened eyes turned to the light which they longed to see again  honest john floyd did his duty but he didnt find the owner so the old purse came back at last and now jack could keep it with a clear conscience nanny was asleep when it happened and as they sat counting the dingy bills mrs quinn said to the boy jack youd better keep this for yourself i doubt if its enough to do the child any good and you need clothes and shoes and a heap of things let alone the books you hanker after so much it aint likely youll ever find another wallet its all luck about nannys eyes and maybe you are only throwing away a chance youll never have again  jack leaned his head on his arms and stared at the money all spread out there and looking so magnificent to him that it seemed as if it could buy half the world he did need clothes his hearty boys appetite did long for better food and oh how splendid it would be to go and buy the books he had wanted so longthe books that would give him a taste of the knowledge which was more enticing to his wideawake young mind than clothes and food to his poor little body it wasnt an easy thing to do but he was so used to making small sacrifices that the great one was less hard and when he had brooded over the money a few minutes in thoughtful silence his eye went from the precious bits of paper to the dear little face in the trundlebed and he said with a decided nod ill give nanny the chance and work for my things or go without em  mrs quinn was a matteroffact body but her hard old face softened when he said that and she kissed him goodnight almost as gently as if shed been his mother  next day jack presented himself at dr wilkinsons door with the money in one hand and nanny in the other saying boldly to the gruff servant i want to see the doctor i can pay so youd better let me in  im afraid cross thomas would have shut the door in the boys face again if it had not been for the little blind girl who looked up at him so imploringly that he couldnt resist the mute appeal  the doctors going out but maybe hell see you a minute and with that he led them into a room where stood a tall man putting on his gloves  jack was a modest boy but he was so afraid that nanny would lose her chance that he forgot himself and told the little story as fast as he couldtold it well too i fancy for the doctor listened attentively his eye going from the boys eager flushed face to the pale patient one beside him as if the two little figures shabby though they were illustrated the story better than the finest artist could have done when jack ended the doctor sat nanny on his knee gently lifted up the halfshut eyelids and after examining the film a minute stroked her pretty hair and said so kindly that she nestled her little hand confidingly into his i think i can help you my dear tell me where you live and ill attend to it at once for its high time something was done  jack told him adding with a manly air as he showed the money i can pay you sir if fifty dollars is enough  quite enough said the doctor with a droll smile  if it isnt ill work for the rest if youll trust me please save nannys eyes and ill do any thing to pay you cried jack getting red and choky in his earnestness  the doctor stopped smiling and held out his hand in a grave respectful way as he said ill trust you my boy well cure nanny first and you and i will settle the bill afterward  jack liked that it was a gentlemanly way of doing things and he showed his satisfaction by smiling all over his face and giving the big white hand a hearty shake with both his rough ones  the doctor was a busy man but he kept them some time for there were no children in the fine house and it seemed pleasant to have a little girl sit on his knee and a bright boy stand beside his chair and when at last they went away they looked as if he had given them some magic medicine which made them forget every trouble they had ever known  next day the kind man came to give nanny her chance she had no doubt and very little fear but looked up at him so confidingly when all was ready that he stooped down and kissed her softly before he touched her eyes  let jack hold my hands then ill be still and not mind if it hurts me she said so jack pale with anxiety knelt down before her and kept the little hands steadily in his all through the minutes that seemed so long to him  what do you see my child asked the doctor when he had done something to both eyes with a quick skilful hand  nanny leaned forward with the film all gone and answered with a little cry of joy that went to the hearts of those who heard it jacks face i see it oh i see it  only a freckled round face with wet eyes and tightlyset lips but to nanny it was as beautiful as the face of an angel and when she was laid away with bandaged eyes to rest it haunted all her dreams for it was the face of the little friend who loved her best  nannys chance was not a failure and when she saw the next dandelions he brought her all the sunshine came back into the world brighter than ever for jack well might it seem so for his fifty dollars bought him many things that money seldom buys the doctor wouldnt take it at first but when jack said in the manful tone the doctor liked although it made him smile it was a bargain sir i wish to pay my debts and i shant feel happy if nanny dont have it all for her eyes please do id ratherthen he took it and nanny did have it not only for her eyes but in clothes and food and care many times over for it was invested in a bank that pays good interest on every mite so given  jack discovered that fifty dollars was far less than most people would have had to pay and begged earnestly to be allowed to work for the rest the doctor agreed to this and jack became his errandboy serving with a willingness that made a pleasure of duty soon finding that many comforts quietly got into his life that much help was given without words and that the days of hunger and rags heavy burdens and dusty ashheaps were gone by for ever  the happiest hours of jacks day were spent in the doctors chaise when he made his round of visits for while he waited the boy studied or read and while they drove hither and thither the doctor talked with him finding an eager mind as well as a tender heart and a brave spirit under the rough jacket of his little servingman but he never called him that for remembering the cheerfulness selfdenial honesty and loyalty to those he loved shown by the boy the good doctor proved his respect for the virtues all men should covet wherever they are found and always spoke of jack with a smile as my little gentleman     back windows   as i sit working at my back window i look out on a long row of other peoples back windows and it is quite impossible for me to help seeing and being interested in my neighbours there are a good many children in those houses and though i dont know one of their names i know them a great deal better than they think i do i never spoke a word to any of them and never expect to do so yet i have my likes and dislikes among them and could tell them things that they have said and done which would astonish them very much i assure you  first the babiesfor there are three the aristocratic baby the happygolucky baby and the forlorn baby the aristocratic baby lives in a fine wellfurnished room has a pretty little mamma who wears white gowns and pink ribbons in her cap likewise a fond young papa who evidently thinks this the most wonderful baby in boston there is a stout motherly lady who is the grandma i fancy for she is always hovering about the dear with cups blankets or a gorgeous red worsted bird to amuse it baby is a plump rosy sweetfaced little creature always smiling and kissing its hand to the world in general in its pretty white frocks with its own little pink or blue ribbons and its young mamma proudly holding it up to see and be seen my aristocratic neighbour has an easy life of it and is evidently one of the little lilies who do nothing but blossom in the sunshine  the happygolucky baby is just able to toddle and i seldom pull up my curtain in the morning without seeing him at his window in his yellow flannel nightgown taking a look at the weather no matter whether it rains or shines there he is smiling and nodding and looking so merry that it is evident he has plenty of sunshine bottled up in his own little heart for private use i depend on seeing him and feel as if the world was not right until this golden little sun rises to shine upon me he dont seem to have any one to take care of him but trots about all day and takes care of himself sometimes he is up in the chambers with the girl while she makes beds and he helps then he takes a stroll into the parlour and spins the gay curtaintassels to his hearts content next he dives into the kitchen i hope he does not tumble downstairs but i dare say he wouldnt mind if he did and he gets pushed about by all the busy women as they fly round i rather think it gets too hot for him there about dinnertime for he often comes out into the yard for a walk at noon and seems to find endless wonders and delights in the ash barrel the waterbut two old flowerpots and a little grass plat in which he plants a choice variety of articles in the firm faith they will come up in full bloom i hope the big spoon and his own red shoe will sprout and appear before any trouble is made about their mysterious disappearance at night i see a little shadow bobbing about on the curtain and watch it till with a parting glimpse at a sleepy face at the window my small sun sets and i leave him to his dreams  the forlorn baby roars all day and i dont blame him for he is trotted shaken spanked and scolded by a very cross nurse who treats him like a meal bag i pity that little neighbour and dont believe he will stand it long for i see him double up his tiny fists and spar away at nothing as if getting ready for a good tussle with the world by and by if he lives to try it  then the boysbless their buttonshow amusing they are one young man aged about ten keeps hens and the trials of that boy are really pathetic the biddies get out every day or two and fly away all over the neighbourhood like feathers when you shake a pillow they cackle and crow and get up on sheds and fences and trot down the streets all at once and that poor fellow spins round after them like a distracted top one by one he gets them and comes lugging them back upside down in the most undignified attitude and shuts them up and hammers away and thinks they are all safe and sits down to rest when a triumphant crow from some neighbouring shed tells him that that rascally black rooster is out again for another promenade im not bloodthirsty but i really do long for thanksgiving that my neighbour henry may find rest for the sole of his foot for not till his poultry are safely eaten will he ever know where they are  another boy has a circus about once a week and tries to break his neck jumping through hoops hanging to a rope by his heels turning somersaults in the air and frightening his mother out of her wits by his pranks i suspect that he has been to see leotard and i admire his energy for he is never discouraged and after tumbling flat halfadozen times he merely rubs his elbows and knees and then up and takes another  there is a good domestic boy who brushes and curls his three little sisters hair every morning and must do it very gently for they seem to like it and i often see them watch at the back gate for him and clap their hands and run to meet him sure of being welcomed as little sisters like to be met by the big brothers whom they love i respect that virtuous boy  the naughty boy is very funny and the running fight he keeps up with the cross cook is as good as a farce he is a torment but i think she could tame him if she took the right way the other day she wouldnt let him in because she had washed up her kitchen and his boots were muddy he wiped them on the grass but that wouldnt do and after going at her with his head down like a battering ram he gave it up or seemed to for the minute she locked the door behind her and came out to take in her clothes that sly dog whipped up one of the low windows scrambled in and danced a hornpipe all over the kitchen while the fat cook scolded and fumbled for her key for she couldnt follow through the window of course he was off upstairs by the time she got in but im afraid he had a shaking for i saw him glowering fiercely as he came out later with a basket going some confounded errand occasionally his father brings him out and whips him for some extra bad offence during which performance he howls dismally but when he is left sitting despondently and miraculously on an old chair without any seat he soon cheers up boos at a strange cat whistles to his dogwho is just like himor falls back on that standing cure for all the ills that boys are heir to and whittles vigorously i know i ought to frown upon this reprehensible young person and morally close my eyes to his pranks but i really cant do it and am afraid i find this little black sheep the most interesting of the flock  the girls have teaparties make calls and play mother of course and the sisters of the good boy have capital times up in a big nursery with such large dollies that i can hardly tell which are the babies and which the mammas one little girl plays about at home with a dirty face tumbled hair and an old pinafore on she wont be made tidy and i see her kick and cry when they try to make her neat now and then there is a great dressing and curling and then i see her prancing away in her light boots smart hat and pretty dress looking as fresh as a daisy but i dont admire her for ive been behind the scenes you see and i know that she likes to be fine rather than neat  so is the girl who torments her kitty slaps her sister and runs away when her mother tells her not to go out of the yard but the housewifely little girl who tends the baby washes the cups and goes to school early with a sunshiny face and kiss all round she now is a neighbour worth having and id put a good mark against her name if i knew it  i dont know as it would be proper for me to mention the grownup people over the way they go on very much as the children do for there is the lazy dandified man who gets up late and drinks the cross man who swears at the sheddoor when it wont shut the fatherly man who sits among his children every evening and the cheery old man up in the attic who has a flower in his window and looks out at the world with very much the same serene smile as my orangecoloured baby  the women too keep house make calls and play mother and some dont do it well either the forlorn babys mamma never seems to cuddle and comfort him and some day when the little fist lies cold and quiet im afraid shell wish she had then the naughty boys mother im very sure if she put her arms round him sometimes and smoothed that rough head of his and spoke to him as only mothers can speak that it would tame him far better than the scoldings and thrashings for i know there is a true boys heart warm and tender somewhere under the jacket that gets dusted so often as for the fine lady who lets her children do as they can while she trims her bonnet or makes panniers i wouldnt be introduced to her on any account but as some might think it was unjustifiable curiosity on my part to see these things and an actionable offence to speak of them i wont mention them  i sometimes wonder if the kind spirits who feel an interest in mortals ever take a look at us on the shady side which we dont show the world seeing the trouble vanities and sins which we think no one knows if they love pity or condemn us what records they keep and what rewards they prepare for those who are so busy with their work and play that they forget who may be watching their back windows with clearer eyes and truer charity than any inquisitive old lady with a pen in her hand     little marie of lehon   here comes our pretty little girl i said to kate as we sat resting on the seat beside the footpath that leads from dinan on the hill to lehon in the valley  yes there she was trotting toward us in her round cap blue woollen gown white apron and wooden shoes on her head was a loaf of buckwheat bread as big as a small wheel in one hand a basket full of green stuff while the other led an old goat who seemed in no hurry to get home we had often seen this rosy brighteyed child had nodded to her but never spoken for she looked rather shy and always seemed in haste now the sight of the goat reminded us of an excuse for addressing her and as she was about to pass with the respectful little curtsey of the country my friend said in french  stay please i want to speak to you she stopped at once and stood looking at us under her long eyelashes in a timid yet confiding way very pretty to see  we want to drink goats milk every morning can you let us have it little one  oh yes mademoiselle nannette gives fine milk and no one has yet engaged her answered the child her whole face brightening at the prospect  what name have you  marie rosier mademoiselle  and you live at lehon  yes mademoiselle  have you parents  truly yes of the best my father has a loom my mother works in the field and mill with brother yvon and i go to school and care for nannette and nurse little bebe  what school  at the convent mademoiselle the good sisters teach us the catechism also to write and read and sew i like it much and marie glanced at the little prayer in her apron pocket as if proud to show she could read it  what age have you  ten years mademoiselle  you are young to do so much for we often see you in the market buying and selling and sometimes digging in your garden there below and bringing water from the river do you love work as well as school  ah no but mademoiselle knows it is necessary to work every one does and im glad to do my part yvon works much harder than i and the father sits all day at his loom yet he is sick and suffers much yes i am truly glad to help and little marie settled the big loaf as if quite ready to bear her share of the burdens  shall we go and see your father about the goat and if he agrees will you bring the milk fresh and warm every morning i asked thinking that a sight of that blooming face would brighten our days for us  oh yes i always do it for the ladies and you will find the milk quite fresh and warm hey nannette and marie laughed as she pulled the goat from the hedge where she was nibbling the young leaves  we followed the child as she went clattering down the stony path and soon came into the narrow street bounded on one side by the row of low stone houses and on the other by the green wet meadow full of willows and the rapid millstream all along this side of the road sat women and children stripping the bark from willow twigs to be used in basketmaking a busy sight and a cheerful one for the women gossiped in their high clear voices the children sang and laughed and the babies crept about as freely as young lambs  we found maries home a very poor one only two rooms in the little hut the lower one with its earthen floor beds in the wall smoky fire and single window where the loom stood at it sat a pale dark man who stopped work as we entered and seemed glad to rest while we talked to him or rather while kate did for i could not understand his odd french and preferred to watch marie during the making of the bargain  yvon a stout lad of twelve was cutting up brush with an old sickle and little bebe looking like a dutch doll in her tiny round cap tight blue gown and bits of sabots clung to marie as she got the supper  i wondered what the children at home would have said to such a supper a few cabbage leaves made the soup and this with the dry black bread and a sip of sour wine was all they had there were no plates or bowls but little hollow places in the heavy wooden table near the edge and into these fixed cups marie ladled the soup giving each a wooden spoon from a queer rack in the middle the kettle stood at one end the big loaf lay at the other and all stood round eating out of their little troughs with nannette and a rough dog close by to receive any crusts that might be left  presently the mother came in a true breton woman rosy and robust neat and cheery though her poor clothes were patched all over her hands more rough and worn with hard work than any i ever saw and the fine hair under her picturesque cap gray at thirty with much care  i saw then where marie got the brightness that seemed to shine in every feature of her little face for the mothers coming was like a ray of sunshine in that dark place and she had a friendly word and look for every one  our little arrangement was soon made and we left them all smiling and nodding as if the few francs we were to pay would be a fortune to them  early next morning we were wakened by fran√ßoise the maid who came up to announce that the goats milk had arrived then we heard a queer quick tapping sound on the stairs and to our great amusement nannette walked into the room straight up to my bedside and stood there looking at me with her mild yellow eyes as if she was quite used to seeing nightcaps marie followed with a pretty little bowl in her hand and said laughing at our surprise see dear mademoiselle in this way i make sure that the milk is quite fresh and warm and kneeling down she milked the bowl full in a twinkling while nannette quietly chewed her cud and sniffed at a plate of rolls on the table  the warm draught was delicious and we drank each our portion with much merriment  it is our custom said fran√ßoise who stood by with her arms folded and looked on in a lofty manner  what had you for your own breakfast i asked as i caught maries eye hungrily fixed on the rolls and some tempting little cakes of chocolate left from our lunch the day before  my good bread as usual mademoiselle also sorrel salad andand water answered marie as if trying to make the most of her scanty meal  will you eat the rolls and put the chocolate in your pocket to nibble at school you must be tired with this long walk so early  she hesitated but could not resist and said in a low tone as she held the bread in her hand without eating it  would mademoiselle be angry if i took it to bebe she has never tasted the beautiful white bread and it would please her much  i emptied the plate into her basket tucked in the chocolate and added a gay picture for baby which unexpected treasures caused marie to clasp her hands and turn quite red with delight  after that she came daily and we had merry times with old nannette and her little mistress whom we soon learned to love so busy blithe and grateful was she  we soon found a new way to employ her for the boy who drove our donkey did not suit us and we got the donkeywoman to let us have marie in the afternoon when her lessons were done she liked that and so did we for she seemed to understand the nature of donkeys and could manage them without so much beating and shouting as the boy thought necessary such pleasant drives as we had we two big women in the droll wagon drawn by the little gray donkey that looked as if made of an old trunk so rusty and rough was he as he went trotting along his long ears wagging and his small hoofs clattering over the fine hard road while marie sat on the shaft with a long whip talking and laughing and giving andr√® a poke now and then crying e e houp la to make him go  we found her a capital little guide and storyteller for her grandmother had told her all the tales and legends of the neighbourhood and it was very pleasant to hear her repeat them in pretty peasant french as we sat among the ruins while kate sketched i took notes and marie held the big parasol over us  some of these stones were charming at least as she told them with her little face changing from gay to sad as she gesticulated most dramatically  the romance of gilles de bretagne was one of her favourites how he carried off his childwife when she was only twelve how he was imprisoned and poisoned and at last left to starve in a dungeon and would stand at his window crying bread bread for the love of god yet no one dared to give him any till a poor peasant woman went in the night and gave him half her black loaf not once but every night for six months though she robbed her children to do it and when he was dying it was she who took a priest to him that he might confess through the bars of his cell  so good ah so good this poor woman it is beautiful to hear of that mademoiselle little marie would say with her black eyes full and her lips trembling  but the story she liked best of all was about the peasant girl and her grandmother  see then dear ladies it was in this way in the time of the great war many poor people were shot because it was feared they would burn the chateaus in one of these so sad parties being driven to st malo to be shot was this young girl only fifteen dear ladies behold how young is this and see the brave thing she did with her went the old grandmother whom she loved next the good god they went slowly she was so old and one of the officers who guarded them had pity on the pretty girl and said to her as they were a little apart from the rest come you are young and can run i will save you it is a pity so fine a little girl should be shot  then she was glad and thanked him much saying and the grandmother also you will save her with me it is impossible says the officer she is too old to run i can save but one and her life is nearly over let her go and do you fly into the next wood i will not betray you and when we come up with the gang it will be too late to find you  then the great temptation of satan came to this girl she had no wish to suffer but she could not leave the good old grandmere to die alone she wept she prayed and the saints gave her courage  no i will not go she said and in the morning at st malo she was shot with the old mother in her arms  could you do that for your grandmere i once asked as she stopped for breath because this tale always excited her she crossed herself devoutly and answered with fire in her eyes and a resolute gesture of her little brown hands  i should try mademoiselle  i think she would and succeed too for she was a brave and tenderhearted child as she soon after proved  a long drought parched the whole country that summer and the gardens suffered much especially the little plats in lehon for most of them were on the steep hillside behind the huts and unless it rained water had to be carried up from the stream below the cabbages and onions on which these poor people depend when fresh salads are gone were dying in the baked earth and a hard winter was before them if this little store failed  the priests prayed for rain in the churches and long processions streamed out of the gates to visit the old stone cross called the croix de saint esprit and kneeling there in crowds the people implored the blessing of rain to save their harvest we felt great pity for them but liked little maries way of praying best  she did not come one morning but sent her brother who only laughed and said marie had hurt her foot when we inquired for her anxious to know if she was really ill we went to see her in the afternoon and heard a pretty little story of practical christianity  marie lay asleep on her mothers bed in the wall and her father sitting by her told the tale in a low voice pausing now and then to look at her as if his little daughter had done something to be proud of  it seems that in the village there was an old woman frightfully disfigured by fire and not quite sane as the people thought she was harmless but never showed herself by day and only came out at night to work in her garden or take the air many of the ignorant peasants feared her however for the country abounds in fairy legends and strange tales of ghosts and goblins but the more charitable left bread at her door and took in return the hose she knit or the thread she spun  during the drought it was observed that her garden though the steepest and stoniest was never dry her cabbages flourished when her neighbours withered and her onions stood up green and tall as if some special rainspirit watched over them people wondered and shook their heads but could not explain it for mother lobineau was too infirm to carry much water up the steep path and who would help her unless some of her own goblin friends did it  this idea was suggested by the story of a peasant returning late at night who had seen something white flitting to and fro in the gardenpatch and when he called to it saw it vanish most mysteriously this made quite a stir in the town others watched also saw the white phantom in the starlight and could not tell where it went when it vanished behind the chestnut trees on the hill till one man braver than the rest hid himself behind these trees and discovered the mystery the sprite was marie in her little shift who stepped out of the window of the loft where she slept on to a bough of the tree and thence to the hill for the house was built so close against the bank that it was but a step from garret to garden as they say in morlaix  in trying to escape from this inquisitive neighbour marie hurt her foot but was caught and confessed that it was she who went at night to water poor mother lobineaus cabbages because if they failed the old woman might starve and no one else remembered her destitute and helpless state  the goodhearted people were much touched by this silent sermon on loving ones neighbour as ones self and marie was called the little saint and tended carefully by all the good women just as the story ended she woke up and at first seemed inclined to hide under the bedclothes but we had her out in a minute and presently she was laughing over her good deed with a true childs enjoyment of a bit of roguery saying in her simple way  yes it was so droll to go running about en chemise like the girl in the tale of the midsummer eve where she pulls the saint johnswort flower and has her wish to hear all the creatures talk i liked it much and yvon slept so like the dormouse that he never heard me creep in and out it was hard to bring much water but the poor cabbages were so glad and mother lobineau felt that all had not forgotten her  we took care that little saint marie was not forgotten but quite well and all ready for her confirmation when the day came this is a pretty sight and for her sake we went to the old church of st sauveur to see it it was a bright spring day and the gardens were full of early flowers the quaint streets gay with proud fathers and mothers in holiday dress and flocks of strangers pausing to see the long procession of little girls with white caps and veils gloves and gowns prayerbooks and rosaries winding through the sunny square into the shadowy church with chanting and candles garlands and crosses  the old priest was too ill to perform the service but the young one who took his place announced after it was over that if they would pass the house the good old man would bless them from his balcony that was the best of all and a sweet sight as the feeble fatherly old priest leaned from his easychair to stretch his trembling hands over the little flock so like a bed of snowdrops while the bright eyes and rosy faces looked reverently up at him and the fresh voices chanted the responses as the curly heads under the long veils bowed and passed by  we learned afterwards that our marie had been called in and praised for her secret charitya great honour because the good priest was much beloved by all his flock and took a most paternal interest in the little ones  that was almost the last we saw of our little friend for we left dinan soon after bidding the lehon family goodbye and leaving certain warm souvenirs for wintertime marie cried and clung to us at parting then smiled like an april day and waved her hand as we went away never expecting to see her any more  but the next morning just as we were stepping on board the steamer to go down the rance to st malo we saw a little white cap come bobbing through the marketplace down the steep street and presently marie appeared with two great bunches of pale yellow primroses and wild blue hyacinths in one hand while the other held her sabots that she might run the faster rosy and smiling and breathless with haste she came racing up to us crying  behold my souvenir for the dear ladies i do not cry now no i am glad the day is so fine bon voyage bon voyage  we thanked and kissed and left her on the shore bravely trying not to cry as she waved her wooden shoes and kissed her hand till we were out of sight and had nothing but the soft colours and sweet breath of our nosegays to remind us of little marie of lehon     my mayday among curious birds and beasts   being alone in london yet wishing to celebrate the day i decided to pay my respects to the lions at the zoological gardens a lovely place it was and i enjoyed myself immensely for mayday in england is just what it should be mild sunny flowery and springlike as i walked along the wellkept paths between white and rosy hawthorn hedges i kept coming upon new and curious sights for the birds and beasts are so skilfully arranged that it is more like travelling through a strange and pleasant country than visiting a menagerie  the first thing i saw was a great american bison and i was so glad to meet with any one from home that id have patted him with pleasure if he had shown any cordiality toward me he didnt however but stared savagely with his fiery eyes and put down his immense head with a sullen snort as if hed have tossed me with great satisfaction i did not blame him for the poor fellow was homesick doubtless for his own wide prairies and the free life he had lost so i threw him some fresh clover and went on to the pelicans  i never knew before what handsome birds they were not graceful but with such snowy plumage tinged with pale pink and faint yellow they had just had their bath and stood arranging their feathers with their great bills uttering a queer cry now and then and nodding to one another sociably when fed they gobbled up the fish never stopping to swallow it till the pouches under their bills were full then they leisurely emptied them and seemed to enjoy their lunch with the grave deliberation of regular englishmen  being in a hurry to see the lions i went on to the long row of cages and there found a splendid sight six lions and lionesses in three or four different cages sitting or standing in dignified attitudes and eyeing the spectators with a mild expression in their fine eyes one lioness was ill and lay on her bed looking very pensive while her mate moved restlessly about her evidently anxious to do something for her and much afflicted by her suffering i liked this lion very much for though the biggest he was very gentle and had a noble face  the tigers were rushing about as tigers usually are some creeping noiselessly to and fro some leaping up and down and some washing their faces with their velvet paws all looked and acted so like cats that i wasnt at all surprised to hear one of them purr when the keeper scratched her head it was a very loud and large purr but no fireside pussy could have done it better and every one laughed at the sound  there were pretty spotted leopards panthers and smaller varieties of the same species i sat watching them a long time longing to let some of the wild things out for a good run they seemed so unhappy barred in those small dens  suddenly the lions began to roar the tigers to snarl and all to get very much excited about something sniffing at the openings thrusting their paws through the bars and lashing their tails impatiently i couldnt imagine what the trouble was till far down the line i saw a man with a barrowful of lumps of raw meat this was their dinner and as they were fed but once a day they were ravenous such roars and howls and cries as arose while the man went slowly down the line gave one a good idea of the sounds to be heard in indian forests and jungles the lions behaved best for they only paced up and down with an occasional cry but the tigers were quite frantic for they tumbled one over the other shook the cages and tried to reach the bystanders just out of reach behind the bar that kept us at a safe distance one lady had a fright for the wind blew the end of her shawl within reach of a tigers great claw and he clutched it trying to drag her nearer the shawl came off and the poor lady ran away screaming as if a whole family of wild beasts were after her  when the lumps of meat were thrown in it was curious to see how differently the animals behaved the tigers snarled and fought and tore and got so savage i was very grateful that they were safely shut up in a few minutes nothing but white bones remained and then they howled for more one little leopard was better bred than the others for he went up on a shelf in the cage and ate his dinner in a quiet proper manner which was an example to the rest the lions ate in dignified silence all but my favourite who carried his share to his sick mate and by every gentle means in his power tried to make her eat she was too ill however and turned away with a plaintive moan which seemed to grieve him sadly he wouldnt touch his dinner but lay down near her with the lump between his paws as if guarding it for her and there i left him patiently waiting in spite of his hunger till his mate could share it with him as i took a last look at his fine old face i named him douglas and walked away humming to myself the lines of the ballad    douglas douglas   tender and true  as a contrast to the wild beasts i went to see the monkeys who lived in a fine large house all to themselves here was every variety from the great ugly chimpanzee to the funny little fellows who played like boys and cut up all sorts of capers a mamma sat tending her baby and looking so like a little old woman that i laughed till the gray monkey with the blue nose scolded at me he was a cross old party and sat huddled up in the straw scowling at every one like an illtempered old bachelor halfadozen little ones teased him capitally by dropping bits of bread nutshells and straws down on him from above as they climbed about the perches or swung by their tails one poor little chap had lost the curly end of his tailim afraid the gray one bit it offand kept trying to swing like the others forgetting that the strong curly end was what he held on with he would run up the bare boughs and give a jump expecting to catch and swing but the lame tail wouldnt hold him and down hed go bounce on to the straw at first hed sit and stare about him as if much amazed to find himself there then hed scratch his little round head and begin to scold violently which seemed to delight the other monkeys and finally hed examine his poor little tail and appear to understand the misfortune which had befallen him the funny expression of his face was irresistible and i enjoyed seeing him very much and gave him a bun to comfort him when i went away  the snakehouse came next and i went in on my way to visit the rhinoceros family i rather like snakes since i had a tame green one who lived under the doorstep and would come out and play with me on sunny days these snakes i found very interesting only they got under their blankets and wouldnt come out and i wasnt allowed to poke them so i missed seeing several of the most curious an ugly cobra laid and blinked at me through the glass looking quite as dangerous as he was there were big and little snakesblack brown and speckled lively and lazy pretty and plain onesbut i liked the great boa best  when i came to his cage i didnt see anything but the branch of a tree such as i had seen in other cages for the snakes to wind up and down where is he i wonder i hope he hasnt got out i said to myself thinking of a story i read once of a person in a menagerie who turned suddenly and saw a great boa gliding towards him as i stood wondering if the big worm could be under the little flat blanket before me the branch began to move all at once and with a start i saw a limb swing down to stare at me with the boas glittering eyes he was so exactly the colour of the bare bough and lay so still i had not seen him till he came to take a look at me a very villainouslooking reptile he was and i felt grateful that i didnt live in a country where such unpleasant neighbours might pop in upon you unexpectedly he was kind enough to take a promenade and show me his size which seemed immense as he stretched himself and then knotted his rough grayish body into a great loop with the fieryeyed head in the middle he was not one of the largest kind but i was quite satisfied and left him to his dinner of rabbits which i hadnt the heart to stay and see him devour alive  i was walking toward the camels pagoda when all of a sudden a long dark curling thing came over my shoulder and i felt warm breath in my face its the boa i thought and gave a skip which carried me into the hedge where i stuck much to the amusement of some children riding on the elephant whose trunk had frightened me he had politely tried to tell me to clear the way which i certainly had done with all speed picking myself out of the hedge i walked beside him examining his clumsy feet and peering up at his small intelligent eye im very sure he winked at me as if enjoying the joke and kept poking his trunk into my pocket hoping to find something eatable  i felt as if i had got into a foreign country as i looked about me and saw elephants and camels walking among the trees flocks of snowwhite cranes stalking over the grass on their long scarlet legs striped zebras racing in their paddock queer kangaroos hopping about with little ones in their pouches pretty antelopes chasing one another and in an immense wirecovered aviary all sorts of brilliant birds were flying about as gaily as if at home  one of the curiosities was a seacow who lived in a tank of salt water and came at the keepers call to kiss him and flounder on its flippers along the margin of the tank after a fish it was very like a seal only much larger and had four fins instead of two its eyes were lovely so dark and soft and liquid but its mouth was not pretty and i declined one of the damp kisses which it was ready to dispense at word of command  the great polar bear lived next door and spent his time splashing in and out of a pool of water or sitting on a block of ice panting as if the mild spring day was blazing midsummer he looked very unhappy and i thought it a pity that they didnt invent a big refrigerator for him  these are not half of the wonderful creatures i saw but i have not room to tell more only i advise all who can to pay a visit to the zoological gardens when they go to london for it is one of the most interesting sights in that fine old city     our little newsboy   hurrying to catch a certain car at a certain corner late one stormy night i was suddenly arrested by the sight of a queerlooking bundle lying in a doorway  bless my heart its a child o john im afraid hes frozen i exclaimed to my brother as we both bent over the bundle  such a little fellow as he was in the big ragged coat such a tired baby face under the fuzzy cap such a purple little hand still holding fast a few papers such a pathetic sight altogether was the boy lying on the stone step with the snow drifting over him that it was impossible to go by  he is asleep but hell freeze if left so long here wake up my boy and go home as fast as you can cried john with a gentle shake and a very gentle voice for the memory of a dear little lad safely tucked up at home made him fatherly kind to the small vagabond  the moment he was touched the boy tumbled up and before he was half awake began his usual cry with an eye to business  paper sir herald transkip lasta great gape swallowed up the last edition and he stood blinking at us like a very chilly young owl  ill buy em all if youll go home my little chap its high time you were abed said john whisking the damp papers into one pocket and his purse out of another as he spoke  all of emwhy theres six croaked the boy for he was as hoarse as a raven  never mind i can kindle the fire with em put that in your pocket and trot home my man as fast as possible  where do you live i asked picking up the fifty cents that fell from the little fingers too benumbed to hold it  mills court out of hanover cold aint it said the boy blowing on his purple hands and hopping feebly from one leg to the other to take the stiffness out  he cant go all that way in this stormsuch a mite and so used up with cold and sleep john  of course he cant well put him in a car began john when the boy wheezed out  no ive got ter wait for sam hell

cried the boy as a gust of sleet slapped him in the face when he peeped to see if sam was coming hullo the lights is out why the plays done and the folks gone and sams forgot me  it was very evident that sam had forgotten his little prot√©g√© and a strong desire to shake sam possessed me  no use waitin any longer and now my papers is sold i aint afraid to go home said the boy stepping down like a little old man with the rheumatism and preparing to trudge away through the storm  stop a bit my little casabianca a car will be along in fifteen minutes and while waiting you can warm yourself over there said john with the purple hand in his  my names jack hill not cassy banks please sir said the little party with dignity  have you had your supper mr hill asked john laughing  i had some peanuts and two sucks of joes orange but it warnt very fillin he said gravely  i should think not here one stew and be quick please cried john as we sat down in a warm corner of the confectioners opposite  while little jack shovelled in the hot oysters with his eyes shutting up now and then in spite of himself we looked at him and thought again of little rosyface at home safe in his warm nest with motherlove watching over him nodding towards the ragged grimy forlorn little creature dropping asleep over his supper like a tired baby i said  can you imagine our freddy out alone at this hour trying to work off his papers because afraid to go home till he has  id rather not try answered brother john winking hard as he stroked the little head beside him which by the bye looked very like a ragged yellow doormat i think brother john winked hard but i cant be sure for i know i did and for a minute there seemed to be a dozen little newsboys dancing before my eyes  there goes our car and its the last said john looking at me  let it go but dont leave the boy and i frowned at john for hinting at such a thing  here is his car now my lad bolt your last oyster and come on  goodnight maam thankee sir croaked the grateful little voice as the child was caught up in johns strong hands and set down on the carstep  with a word to the conductor and a small business transaction we left jack coiled up in a corner to finish his nap as tranquilly as if it wasnt midnight and a knockinground might not await him at his journeys end  we didnt mind the storm much as we plodded home and when i told the story to rosyface next day his interest quite reconciled me to the sniffs and sneezes of a bad cold  if i saw that poor little boy aunt jo id love him lots said freddy with a world of pity in his beautiful childs eyes  and believing that others also would be kind to little jack and such as he i tell the story  when busy fathers hurry home at night i hope theyll buy their papers of the small boys who get shoved back the feeble ones who grow hoarse and cant sing out the shabby ones who evidently have only forgetful sams to care for them and the hungrylooking ones who dont get what is fillin for love of the little sons and daughters safe at home say a kind word buy a paper even if you dont want it and never pass by leaving them to sleep forgotten in the streets at midnight with no pillow but a stone no coverlet but the pitiless snow and not even a tenderhearted robin to drop leaves over them     pattys patchwork   i perfectly hate it and something dreadful ought to be done to the woman who invented it said patty in a pet sending a shower of gay pieces flying over the carpet as if a small whirlwind and a rainbow had got into a quarrel  puss did not agree with patty for after a surprised hop when the flurry came she calmly laid herself down on a red square purring comfortably and winking her yellow eyes as if she thanked the little girl for the bright bed that set off her white fur so prettily this cool performance made patty laugh and say more pleasantly  well it is tiresome isnt it aunt pen  sometimes but we all have to make patchwork my dear and do the best we can with the pieces given us  do we and patty opened her eyes in great astonishment at this new idea  our lives are patchwork and it depends on us a good deal how the bright and dark bits get put together so that the whole is neat pretty and useful when it is done said aunt pen soberly  deary me now she is going to preach thought patty but she rather liked aunt pens preachments for a good deal of fun got mixed up with the moralising and she was so good herself that children could never say in their naughty little minds you are just as bad as we so you neednt talk to us maam  i gave you that patchwork to see what you would make of it and it is as good as a diary to me for i can tell by the different squares how you felt when you made them continued aunt pen with a twinkle in her eye as she glanced at the manycoloured bits on the carpet  can you truly just try and see and patty looked interested at once  pointing with the yardmeasure aunt pen said tapping a certain dingy puckered brown and purple square  that is a bad day dont it look so  well it was i do declare for that was the monday piece when everything went wrong and i didnt care how my work looked cried patty surprised at aunt pens skill in reading the calico diary  this pretty pink and white one so neatly sewed is a good day this funny mixture of red blue and yellow with the big stitches is a merry day that one with spots on it is one that got cried over this with the gay flowers is a day full of good little plans and resolutions and that one made of dainty bits all stars and dots and tiny leaves is the one you made when you were thinking about the dear new baby there at home  why aunt pen you are a fairy how did you know they truly are just as you say as near as i can remember i rather like that sort of patchwork and patty sat down upon the floor to collect examine and arrange her discarded work with a new interest in it  i see what is going on and i have queer plays in my mind just as you little folks do suppose you make this a moral bedquilt as some people make album quilts see how much patience perseverance good nature and industry you can put into it every bit will have a lesson or a story and when you lie under it you will find it a real comforter said aunt pen who wanted to amuse the child and teach her something better even than the good oldfashioned accomplishment of needlework  i dont see how i can put that sort of thing into it answered patty as she gently lifted puss into her lap instead of twitching the red bit roughly from under her  there goes a nice little piece of kindness this very minute laughed aunt pen pointing to the cat and the red square  patty laughed also and looked pleased as she stroked mother bunch while she said thoughtfully  i see what you mean now i am making two kinds of patchwork at the same time and this that i see is to remind me of the other kind that i dont see  every task no matter how small or homely that gets well and cheerfully done is a fine thing and the sooner we learn to use up the dark and bright bits the pleasures and pains the cares and duties into a cheerful useful life the sooner we become real comforters and every one likes to cuddle about us dont you see deary  thats what you are aunt pen and patty put up her hand to hold fast by that other strong kind helpful hand that did so much yet never was tired cold or empty  aunt pen took the chubby little one in both her own and said smiling yet with meaning in her eyes as she tapped the small forefinger rough with impatient and unskilful sewing  shall we try and see what a nice little comforter we can make this month while you wait to be called home to see mamma and the dear new baby  yes id like to try and patty gave aunt pens hand a hearty shake for she wanted to be good and rather thought the new fancy would lend a charm to the task which we all find rather tiresome and hard  so the bargain was made and the patch patty sewed that day was beautiful to behold for she was in a delightfully moral state of mind and felt quite sure that she was going to become a model for all children to follow if they could the next day her ardour had cooled a little and being in a hurry to go out to play she slighted her work thinking no one would know but the third day she got so angry with her patch that she tore it in two and declared it was all nonsense to fuss about being good and thorough and all the rest of it  aunt pen did not say much but made her mend and finish her patch and add it to the pile after she went to bed that night patty thought of it and wished she could do it over it looked so badly but as it could not be she had a penitent fit and resolved to keep her temper while she sewed at any rate for mamma was to see the little quilt when it was done and would want to know all about it  of course she did not devote herself to being good all the time but spent her days in lessons play mischief and fun like any other lively tenyearolder but somehow whenever the sewinghour came she remembered that talk and as she worked she fell into the way of wondering whether aunt pen could guess from the patches what sort of days she had passed she wanted to try and see but aunt pen refused to read any more calico till the quilt was done then she said in a queer solemn way she should make the good and bad days appear in a remarkable manner  this puzzled patty very much and she quite ached to know what the joke would be meantime the pile grew steadily and every day good or bad added to that other work called pattys life she did not think much about that part of it but unconsciously the quiet sewingtime had its influence on her and that little conscience hour as she sometimes called it helped her very much  one day she said to herself as she took up her work now ill puzzle aunt pen she thinks my naughty tricks get into the patches but ill make this very nicely and have it gay and then i dont see how she will ever guess what i did this morning  now you must know that tweedledee the canary was let out every day to fly about the room and enjoy himself mother bunch never tried to catch him though he often hopped temptingly near her he was a droll little bird and patty liked to watch his promenades for he did funny things that day he made her laugh by trying to fly away with a shawl picking up the fringe with which to line the nest he was always trying to build it was so heavy he tumbled on his back and lay kicking and pulling but had to give it up and content himself with a bit of thread  patty was forbidden to chase or touch him at these times but always felt a strong desire to have just one grab at him and see how he felt that day being alone in the diningroom she found it impossible to resist and when tweedledee came tripping pertly over the tablecloth cocking his head on one side with shrill chirps and little prancings she caught him and for a minute held him fast in spite of his wrathful pecking  she put her thimble on his head laughing to see how funny he looked and just then he slipped out of her hand she clutched at him missed him but alas alas he left his little tail behind him every feather in his blessed little tail i do assure you and there sat patty with the yellow plumes in her hand and dismay in her face poor tweedledee retired to his cage much afflicted and sung no more that day but patty hid the lost tail and never said a word about it  aunt pen is so nearsighted she wont mind and maybe he will have another tail pretty soon or she will think he is moulting if she asks of course i shall tell her  patty settled it in that way forgetting that the slide was open and aunt pen in the kitchen so she made a neat blue and buff patch and put it away meaning to puzzle aunty when the readingtime came but patty got the worst of it as you will see byandbye  another day she strolled into the storeroom and saw a large tray of fresh buns standing there now it was against the rule to eat between meals and new hot bread or cake was especially forbidden patty remembered both these things but could not resist temptation one plump brown bun with a lovely plum right in the middle was so fascinating it was impossible to let it alone so patty whipped it into her pocket ran to the garden and hiding behind the big lilacbush ate it in a great hurry it was just out of the oven and so hot it burned her throat and lay like a live coal in her little stomach after it was down making her very uncomfortable for several hours  why do you keep sighing asked aunt pen as patty sat down to her work  i dont feel very well  you have eaten something that disagrees with you did you eat hot biscuits for breakfast  no maam i never do and patty gave another little gasp for the bun lay very heavily on both stomach and conscience just then  a drop or two of ammonia will set you right and aunt pen gave her some it did set the stomach right but the conscience still worried her for she could not make up her mind to fess the sly greedy thing she had done  put a white patch in the middle of those green ones said aunt pen as patty sat soberly sewing her daily square  why asked the little girl for aunty seldom interfered in her arrangement of the quilt  it will look pretty and match the other three squares that are going at the corners of that middle piece  well i will and patty sewed away wondering at this sudden interest in her work and why aunt pen laughed to herself as she put away the ammonia bottle  these are two of the naughty little things that got worked into the quilt but there were good ones also and aunt pens sharp eyes saw them all  at the window of a house opposite patty often saw a little girl who sat there playing with an old doll or a torn book she never seemed to run about or go out and patty often wondered if she was sick she looked so thin and sober and was so quiet patty began by making faces at her for fun but the little girl only smiled back and nodded so goodnaturedly that patty was ashamed of herself  is that girl over there poor she asked suddenly as she watched her one day  very poor her mother takes in sewing and the child is lame answered aunt pen without looking up from the letter she was writing  her doll is nothing but an old shawl tied round with a string and she dont seem to have but one book wonder if shed like to have me come and play with her said patty to herself as she stood her own big doll in the window and nodded back at the girl who bobbed up and down in her chair with delight at this agreeable prospect  you can go and see her some day if you like said aunt pen scribbling away  patty said no more then but later in the afternoon she remembered this permission and resolved to try if aunty would find out her good doings as well as her bad ones so tucking blanch augusta arabella maud under one arm her best picturebook under the other and gathering a little nosegay of her own flowers she slipped across the road knocked and marched boldly upstairs  mrs brown the sewingwoman was out and no one there but lizzie in her chair at the window looking lonely and forlorn  how do you do my name is patty and i live over there and ive come to play with you said one child in a friendly tone  how do you do my name is lizzie and im very glad to see you what a lovely doll returned the other child gratefully and then the ceremony of introduction was over and they began to play as if they had known each other for ever so long  to poor lizzie it seemed as if a little fairy had suddenly appeared to brighten the dismal room with flowers and smiles and pretty things while patty felt her pity and goodwill increase as she saw lizzies crippled feet and watched her thin face brighten and glow with interest and delight over book and doll and posy it felt good as patty said afterwards sort of warm and comfortable in my heart and i liked it ever so much she stayed an hour making sunshine in a shady place and then ran home wondering if aunt pen would find that out  she found her sitting with her hands before her and such a sad look in her face that patty ran to her saying anxiously  whats the matter aunty are you sick  no dear but i have sorrowful news for you come sit in my lap and let me tell you as gently as i can  mamma is dead cried patty with a look of terror in her rosy face  no thank god but the dear new baby only stayed a week and we shall never see her in this world  with a cry of sorrow patty threw herself into the arms outstretched to her and on aunt pens loving bosom sobbed away the first bitterness of her grief and disappointment  oh i wanted a little sister so much and i was going to be so fond of her and was so glad she came and now i cant see or have her even for a day im so disappointed i dont think i can bear it sobbed patty  think of poor mamma and bear it bravely for her sake whispered aunt pen wiping away her own and pattys tears  oh dear me theres the pretty quilt i was going to make for baby and now it isnt any use and i cant bear to finish it and patty broke out afresh at the thought of so much loves labour lost  mamma will love to see it so i wouldnt give it up work is the best cure for sorrow and i think you never will be sorry you tried it let us put a bright bit of submission with this dark trouble and work both into your little life as patiently as we can deary  patty put up her trembling lips and kissed aunt pen grateful for the tender sympathy and the helpful words ill try was all she said and then they sat talking quietly together about the dear dead baby who only stayed long enough to make a place in every ones heart and leave them aching when she went  patty did try to bear her first trouble bravely and got on very well after the first day or two except when the sewinghour came then the sight of the pretty patchwork recalled the memory of the cradle it was meant to cover and reminded her that it was empty now many quiet tears dropped on pattys work and sometimes she had to put it down and sob for she had longed so for a little sister it was very hard to give her up and put away all the loving plans she had made for the happy time when baby came a great many tender little thoughts and feelings got sewed into the gay squares and if a small stain showed here and there i think they only added to its beauty in the eyes of those who knew what made them aunt pen never suggested picking out certain puckered bits and grimy stitches for she knew that just there the little fingers trembled and the blue eyes got dim as they touched and saw the delicate flowery bits left from babys gowns  lizzie was full of sympathy and came hopping over on her crutches with her only treasure a black rabbit to console her friend but of all the comfort given mother bunchs share was the greatest and best for that very first sad day as patty wandered about the house disconsolately puss came hurrying to meet her and in her dumb way begged her mistress to follow and see the fine surprise prepared for herfour plump kits as white as snow with four gray tails all wagging in a row as they laid on their proud mammas downy breast while she purred over them with her yellow eyes full of supreme content  it was in the barn and patty lay for an hour with her head close to mother bunch and her hands softly touching the charming little bunches who squeaked and tumbled and sprawled about with their dim eyes blinking their tiny pink paws fumbling and their dear gray tails waggling in the sweetest way such a comfort as they were to patty no words could tell and nothing will ever convince me that mrs bunch did not know all about baby and so lay herself out to cheer up her little mistress like a motherly loving old puss as she was  as patty lay on the rug that evening while aunt pen sung softly in the twilight a small white figure came pattering over the straw carpet and dropped a soft warm ball down by pattys cheek saying as plainly as a loud confiding purr could say it  there my dear this is a lonely time for you i know so ive brought my best and prettiest darling to comfort you and with that mother bunch sat down and washed her face while patty cuddled little snowdrop and forgot to cry about baby  soon after this came a great happiness to patty in the shape of a letter from mamma saying she must have her little girl back a week earlier than they had planned  im sorry to leave you aunty but it is so nice to be wanted and im all mamma has now you know so i must hurry and finish my work to surprise her with how shall we finish it off there ought to be something regularly splendid to go all round said patty in a great bustle as she laid out her pieces and found that only a few more were needed to complete the moral bedquilt  i must try and find something we will put this white star with the blue round it in the middle for it is the neatest and prettiest piece in spite of the stains i will sew in this part and you may finish putting the long strips together said aunt pen rummaging her bags and bundles for something fine to end off with  i know ive got something and away hurried lizzie who was there and much interested in the work  she came hopping back again presently with a roll in her hand which she proudly spread out saying  there mother gave me that ever so long ago but i never had any quilt to use it for and now its just what you want you cant buy such chintz nowadays and im so glad i had it for you  its regularly splendid cried patty in a rapture and so it was for the pink and white was all covered with animals and the blue was full of birds and butterflies and bees flying about as naturally as possible really lovely were the little figures and the clear soft colours and aunt pen clapped her hands while patty hugged her friend and declared that the quilt was perfect now  mrs brown begged to be allowed to quilt it when the patches were all nicely put together and patty was glad to have her for that part of the work was beyond her skill it did not come home till the morning patty left and aunt pen packed it up without ever unrolling it  we will look at it together when we show it to mamma she said and patty was in such a hurry to be off that she made no objection  a pleasant journey a great deal of hugging and kissing some tears and tender laments for baby and then it was time to show the quilt which mamma said was just what she wanted to throw over her feet as she lay on the sofa  if there were any fairies patty would have been sure they had done something to her bedcover for when she proudly unrolled it what do you think she saw  right in the middle of the white star which was the centrepiece delicately drawn with indelible ink was a smiling little cherub all head and wings and under it these lines    while sister dear lies asleep   baby careful watch will keep  then in each of the four gay squares that were at the corners of the strip that framed the star was a white bit bearing other pictures and couplets that both pleased and abashed patty as she saw and read them  in one was seen a remarkably fine bun with the lines    who stole the hot bun     and got burnt well   go ask the lilac bush     guess it can tell  in the next was a plump tailless bird who seemed to be saying mournfully    my little tail my little tail   this bitter loss i still bewail   but rather neer have tail again   than patty should deceive aunt pen  the third was less embarrassing for it was a pretty bunch of flowers so daintily drawn one could almost think they smelt them and these lines were underneath    every flower to others given   blossoms fair and sweet in heaven  the fourth was a picture of a curlyhaired child sewing with some very large tears rolling down her cheeks and tumbling off her lap like marbles while some tiny sprites were catching and flying away with them as if they were very precious    every tender drop that fell     loving spirits caught and kept   and pattys sorrows lighter grew     for the gentle tears she wept  oh aunty what does it all mean cried patty who had looked both pleased and ashamed as she glanced from one picture to the other  it means dear that the goods and bads got into the bedquilt in spite of you and there they are to tell their own story the bun and the lost tail the posy you took to poor lizzie and the trouble you bore so sweetly it is just so with our lives though we dont see it quite as clearly as this invisible hands paint our faults and virtues and byandbye we have to see them so we must be careful that they are good and lovely and we are not ashamed to let the eyes that love us best read there the history of our lives  as aunt pen spoke and patty listened with a thoughtful face mamma softly drew the pictured coverlet over her and whispered as she held her little daughter close  my patty will remember this and if all her years tell as good a story as this month i shall not fear to read the record and she will be in truth my little comforter   for second series see shawlstraps     printed by   spottiswoode and co newstreet square   london
