38429807	erling the bold by rm ballantyne    chapter one  in which the tale begins somewhat furiously  by the early light of a bright summer morning long long ago two small boats were seen to issue from one of the fiords or firths on the west coast of norway and row towards the skerries or low rocky islets that lay about a mile distant from the mainland  although the morning was young the sun was already high in the heavens and brought out in glowing colours the varied characteristics of a mountain scene of unrivalled grandeur  the two shallops moved swiftly towards the islands their oars shivering the liquid mirror of the sea and producing almost the only sound that disturbed the universal stillness for at that early hour nature herself seemed buried in deep repose  a silvery mist hung over the water through which the innumerable rocks and islands assumed fantastic shapes and the more distant among them appeared as though they floated in air  a few seagulls rose startled from their nests and sailed upwards with plaintive cries as the keels of the boats grated on the rocks and the men stepped out and hauled them up on the beach of one of the islets  a wild uncouth crew were those norsemen of old  all were armed for in their days the power and the means of selfdefence were absolutely necessary to selfpreservation  most of them wore portions of scale armour or shirts of ring mail and headpieces of steel though a few among them appeared to have confidence in the protection afforded by the thick hide of the wolf which converted into rude yet not ungraceful garments covered their broad shoulders  all without exception carried sword or battleaxe and shield  they were goodly stalwart men every one but silent and stern  it might have been observed that the two boats although bound for the same islet did not row in company  they were beached as far from each other as the little bay into which they ran would admit of and the crews stood aloof in two distinct groups  in the centre of each group stood a man who from his aspect and bearing appeared to be superior to his fellows  one was in the prime of life dark and grave the other in the first flush of manhood full grown though beardless fair and ruddy  both were taller and stouter than their comrades  the two men had met there to fight and the cause of their feud was love  both loved a fair norse maiden in horlingdal  the father of the maid favoured the elder warrior the maid herself preferred the younger  in those days barbarous though they undoubtedly were law and justice were more respected and more frequently appealed to in norway than in almost any other country  liberty crushed elsewhere under the deadweight of feudalism found a home in the bleak north and a rough but loving welcome from the piratical searoving  she did not indeed dwell altogether scathless among her demisavage guardians who if their perceptions of right and wrong were somewhat confused might have urged in excuse that their light was small  she received many shocks and frequent insults from individuals but liberty was sincerely loved and fondly cherished by the body of the norwegian people through all the period of those dark ages during which other nations scarce dared to mention her name  nevertheless it was sometimes deemed more convenient to settle disputes by the summary method of an appeal to arms than to await the issue of a tedious and uncertain lawsuit such an appeal being perfectly competent to those who preferred it and the belief being strong among the fiery spirits of the age that odin the god of war would assuredly give victory to the right  in the present instance it was not considered any infringement of the law of liberty that the issue of the combat would be the disposal of a fair womans hand with or without her heart  then as now women were often forced to marry against their will  having gone to that island to fightan island being a naturally circumscribed battlefield whose limits could not conveniently be transgressedthe two champions set to work at once with the cool businesslike promptitude of men sprung from a warlike race and nurtured from their birth in the midst of wars alarms  together and without speaking they ascended the rock which was low and almost barren with a small extent of turf in the centre level and admirably suited to their purpose  here they faced each other the one drew his sword the other raised his battleaxe  there was no sentiment in that combat  the times and the men were extremely matteroffact  the act of slaying gracefully had not yet been acquired yet there was much of manly grace displayed as each threw himself into the position that nature and experience had taught him was best suited to the wielding of his peculiar weapon  for one instant each gazed intently into the face of the other as if to read there his premeditated plan of attack  at that moment the clear blue eye of the younger man dilated and as his courage rose the colour mounted to his cheek  the swart brow of the other darkened as he marked the change then with sudden spring and shout the two fell upon each other and dealt their blows with incredible vigour and rapidity  they were a wellmatched pair  for nearly two hours did they toil and moil over the narrow limits of that seagirt rockyet victory leaned to neither side  now the furious blows rained incessant on the sounding shields anon the din of strife ceased while the combatants moved round each other shifting their position with elastic step as with wary motion and eagle glances each sought to catch the other off his guard and the clash of steel as the weapons met in sudden onset was mingled with the shout of anger or defiance  the sun glanced on whirling blade and axe and sparkled on their coats of mail as if the lightning flash were playing round them while screaming seamews flew and circled overhead as though they regarded with intelligent interest and terror the mortal strife that was going on below  blood ere long began to flow freely on both sides the vigour of the blows began to abate the steps to falter  the youthful cheek grew pale the dark warriors brow grew darker while heaving chests labouring breath and an occasional gasp betokened the approaching termination of the struggle  suddenly the youth as if under the influence of a new impulse dropped his shield sprang forward raised himself to his full height grasped his axe with both hands and throwing it aloft thus recklessly exposing his person brought it down with terrific violence on the shield of his adversary  the action was so sudden that the other already much exhausted was for the moment paralysed and failed to take advantage of his opportunity he met but failed to arrest the blow with his shield  it was crushed down upon his head and in another moment the swarthy warrior lay stretched upon the turf  sternly the men conveyed their fallen chief to his boat and rowed him to the mainland and many a week passed by ere he recovered from the effects of the blow that felled him  his conqueror returned to have his wounds dressed by the bride for whom he had fought so long and so valiantly on that bright summer morning  thus it was that king haldor of horlingdal surnamed the fierce conquered king ulf of romsdal acquired his distinctive appellation and won herfrida the softeyed for his bride  it must not be supposed that these warriors were kings in the ordinary acceptation of that term  they belonged to the class of small or petty kings of whom there were great numbers in norway in those days and were merely rich and powerful freelandholders or udallers  haldor the fierce had a large family of sons and daughters  they were all fair strong and extremely handsome like himself  ulf of romsdal did not die of his wounds neither did he die of love disappointed love was then as now a terrible disease but not necessarily fatal  northmen were very sturdy in the olden time  they almost always recovered from that disease sooner or later  when his wounds were healed ulf married a fair girl of the horlingdal district and went to reside there but his change of abode did not alter his title  he was always spoken of as ulf of romsdal  he and his old enemy haldor the fierce speedily became fast friends and so was it with their wives astrid and herfrida who also took mightily to each other  they span and carded wool and sewed together oftentimes and discussed the affairs of horlingdal no doubt with mutual advantage and satisfaction  twenty years passed away and haldors eldest son erling grew to be a man  he was very like his fatheralmost a giant in size fair very strong and remarkably handsome  his silken yellow hair fell in heavy curls on a pair of the broadest shoulders in the dale  although so young he already had a thick short beard which was very soft and curly  his limbs were massive but they were so well proportioned and his movements so lithe that his great size and strength were not fully appreciated until one stood close by his side or fell into his powerful grasp  erling was lionlike yet he was by nature gentle and retiring  he had a kindly smile a hearty laugh and bright blue eyes  had he lived in modern days he would undoubtedly have been a man of peace  but he lived long long agotherefore he was a man of war  being unusually fearless his companions of the valley called him erling the bold  he was moreover extremely fond of the sea and often went on viking cruises in his own ships whence he was also styled erling the seaking although he did not at that time possess a foot of land over which to exercise kingly authority  now it must be explained here that the words seaking and viking do not denote the same thing  one is apt to be misled by the termination of the latter word which has no reference whatever to the royal title king  a viking was merely a piratical rover on the sea the seawarrior of the period but a seaking was a leader and commander of vikings every seaking was a viking but every viking was not a seaking just as every admiral is a sailor but every sailor is not an admiral  when it is said that erling was a seaking it is much as if we had said he was an admiral in a small way    chapter two  introduces among others the hero and heroine and opens up a view of norse life in the olden time  ulf of romsdal had a daughter named hilda  she was fair and extremely pretty  the young men said that her brow was the habitation of the lily her eye the mirror of the heavens her cheek the dwellingplace of the rose true in the ardour of their feelings and strength of their imaginations they used strong language nevertheless it was impossible to overpraise the norse maiden  her nutbrown hair fell in luxuriant masses over her shapely shoulders reaching far below the waist her skin was fair and her manners engaging  hilda was undoubtedly blueeyed and beautiful she was just seventeen at this time  those who loved her and there were few who did not styled her the sunbeam  erling and hilda had dwelt near each other from infancy  they had been playmates and for many years were as brother and sister to each other erlings affection had gradually grown into a stronger passion but he never mentioned the fact to anyone being exceedingly shamefaced and shy in regard to love  he would have given his ears to have known that his love was returned but he dared not to ask  he was very stupid on this point  in regard to other things he was sharpwitted above his fellows none knew better than he how to guide the warship through the intricate mazes of the islandstudded coast of norway none equalled him in deeds of arms no one excelled him in speed of foot in scaling the fells or in tracking the wolf and bear to their dens but all beat him in lovemaking  he was wondrously slow and obtuse at that and could by no means discover whether or not hilda regarded him as a lover or a brother  as uncertainty on this point continued erling became jealous of all the young men who approached her and in proportion as this feeling increased his natural disposition changed and his chafing spirit struggled fiercely within him  but his native good sense and modesty enabled him pretty well to conceal his feelings  as for hilda no one knew the state of her mind  it is probable that at this time she herself had not a very distinct idea on the point  hilda had a fostersister named ada who was also very beautiful  she was unusually dark for a norse maiden  her akin indeed was fair but her hair and eyes were black like the ravens wing  her father was king hakon of drontheim  it was the custom in those warlike days for parents to send out some of their children to be fostered by othersin order no doubt to render next to impossible the total extirpation of their families at a time when sudden descents upon households were common  by thus scattering their children the chances of family annihilation were lessened and the probability that some members might be left alive to take revenge was greatly increased  hilda and ada were warmly attached  having been brought up together they loved each other as sistersall the more perhaps that in character they were somewhat opposed  hilda was grave thoughtful almost pensive  ada was full of vivacity and mirth fond of fun and by no means averse to a little of what she styled harmless mischief  now there was a man in horlingdal called glumm surnamed the gruff who loved ada fervently  he was a stout handsome man of ruddy complexion and second only to erling in personal strength and prowess  but by nature he was morose and gloomy  nothing worse however could be said of him  in other respects he was esteemed a brave excellent man glumm was too proud to show his love to ada very plainly but she had wit enough to discover it though no one else did and she resolved to punish him for his pride by keeping him in suspense  horlingdal where ulf and haldor and their families dwelt was like nearly all the vales on the west of norway hemmed in by steep mountains of great height which were covered with dark pines and birch trees  to the level pastures high up on mountain tops the inhabitants were wont to send their cattle to feed in summerthe small crops of hay in the valleys being carefully gathered and housed for winter use  every morning before the birds began to twitter hilda set out with her pail and her wooden box to climb the mountain to the upland dairy or saeter and fetch the milk and butter required by the family during the day  although the maid was of noble birthulf claiming descent from one of those who are said to have come over with odin and his twelve godars or priests from asiathis was not deemed an inappropriate occupation  among the norsemen labour was the lot of high and low  he was esteemed the best man who could fight most valiantly in battle and labour most actively in the field or with the tools of the smith and carpenter  ulf of romsdal although styled king in virtue of his descent was not too proud in the busy summertime to throw off his coat and toss the hay in his own fields in the midst of his thralls slaves taken in war and housecarles  neither he nor haldor nor any of the small kings although they were the chief men of the districts in which they resided thought it beneath their dignity to forge their own spearheads and anchors or to mend their own doors  as it was with the men so was it with the women  hilda the sunbeam was not despised because she climbed the mountainside to fetch milk and butter for the family  one morning in returning from the fell hilda heard the loud clatter of the anvil at haldorstede  having learned that morning that danish vikings had been seen prowling among the islands near the fiord she turned aside to enquire the news  haldorstede lay about a mile up the valley and hilda passed it every morning on her way to and from the saeter  ulfstede lay near the shore of the fiord  turning into the smithy she found erling busily engaged in hammering a huge mass of stubborn redhot metal  so intent was the young man on his occupation that he failed to observe the entrance of his fair visitor who set down her milk pail and stood for a few minutes with her hands folded and her eyes fixed demurely on her lover  erling had thrown off his jerkin and rolled up the sleeves of his shirt of coarse homespun fabric in order to give his thick muscular arms unimpeded play in wielding the hammer and turning the mass of glowing metal on the anvil  he wore woollen breeches and hose both of which had been fashioned by the fingers of his buxom mother herfrida  a pair of neatly formed shoes of untanned hidehis own workmanshipprotected his feet and his waist was encircled by a broad leathern girdle from one side of which depended a short huntingknife and from the other a flap with a slit in it to support his sword  the latter weapona heavy doubleedged bladestood leaning against the forge chimney along with a huge battleaxe within reach of his hand  the collar of his shirt was thrown well back exposing to view a neck and chest whose muscles denoted extraordinary power and the whiteness of which contrasted strikingly with the ruddy hue of his deeply bronzed countenance  the young giant appeared to take pleasure in the exercise of his superabundant strength for instead of using the ordinary singlehand hammer with which other men were wont to bend the glowing metal to their will he wielded the great forehammer and did it as easily too with his right arm as if it had been but a wooden mallet  the mass of metal at which he wrought was thick and unyielding but under his heavy blows it began to assume the form of an axea fact which hilda noticed with a somewhat saddened brow  erlings long hair rolling as it did down his shoulders frequently straggled over his face and interfered slightly with his vision whereupon he shook it back with an impatient toss as a lion might shake his mane while he toiled with violent energy at his work  to look at him one might suppose that vulcan himself had condescended to visit the abodes of men and work in a terrestrial smithy  during one of the tosses with which he threw back his hair erling chanced to raise his eyes which instantly fell upon hilda  a glad smile beamed on his flushed face and he let the hammer fall with a ringing clatter on the anvil exclaiming  ha good morrow to thee hilda  thou comest with stealthy tread like the midnight marauder  what news  does all go well at ulfstede  but why so sad hilda  thy countenance is not wont to quarrel with the mountain air  truly no replied the girl smiling mountain air likes me well  if my looks are sadder than usual it is because of the form of the weapon thou art fashioning  the weapon exclaimed erling as he raised the handle of the hammer and resting his arms on it gazed at his visitor in some surprise  it is but an axea simple axe perchance a trifle heavier than other axes because it suits my arm better and i have a weakness that way  what ails thee at a battleaxe hilda  i quarrel not with the axe erling but it reminds me of thy love of fighting and i grieve for that  why art thou so fond of war  fond of war echoed the youth  now out upon thee hilda what were a man fit for if he could not fight  nay i question not thine ability to fight but i grieve to see thy love for fighting  truly there seems to me a close relationship between the love of war and the ability to fight returned the youth  but to be plain with thee i do not love war so much as ye think  yet i utter this in thine ear for i would not that the blades of the valley knew it lest they might presume upon it and i should have to prove my ability despite my want of loveupon some of their carcasses  i wish there were no such thing as war said hilda with a sigh  erling knitted his brows and gazed into the smithy fire as if he were engaged in pondering some knotty point  well im not sure said he slowly and descending to a graver tone of addressim not sure that i can go quite so far as that  if we had no war at all perchance our swords might rust and our skill for want of practice might fail us in the hour of need  besides how could men in that case hope to dwell with odin in valhallas bright and merry halls  but i agree with thee in wishing that we had less of war and more of peace at home  i fear said hilda we seem likely to have more of war and less of peace than usual if rumours be true  have you heard that danish vikings have been seen among the islands  aye truly i have heard of them and it is that which has sent me to the smithy this morning to hasten forward my battleaxe for i love not too light a weapon  you see hilda when it has not weight one must sometimes repeat the blow especially if the mail be strong  but with a heavy axe and a stout arm there is no need for that  i had begun this weapon continued the youth as if he were musing aloud rather than speaking to his companion with intent to try its metal on the head of the king but i fear me it will be necessary to use it in cracking a vikings headpiece before it cleaves a royal crown  the king exclaimed hilda with a look of surprise not unmingled with terror erling has ambition led thee to this  not so but selfpreservation urges me to it  the maiden paused a few seconds ere she replied in a meditative voicethe old man who came among us a year ago and who calls himself christian tells me that his god is not a god of war like odin he says that his god permits no war to men save that of selfdefence but erling would slaying the king be indeed an act of selfpreservation  aye in good sooth would it replied the youth quickly while a dark frown crossed his brow  how can that be asked the maiden  hast such small love for gossip hilda that the foul deeds and ambitious projects of harald haarfager have not reached thine ear  i have heard replied hilda that he is fond of war which truly is no news and that he is just now more busy with his bloody game than usual but what does that matter to thee  matter cried the youth impatiently as he seized the lump of metal on which he had been at work and thrusting it into the smouldering charcoal commenced to blow the fire energetically as if to relieve his feelings  know ye not that the kingthis harald fairhairis not satisfied with the goodly domains that of right belong to him and the kingly rule which he holds according to law over all norway but that he means to subdue the whole land to himself and trample on our necks as he has already trampled on our laws  i know somewhat of this said hilda  no one pursued erling vehemently and blowing the fire into a fervent heatno one denies to harald the right to wear the crown of norway that was settled at the ore thing see note 1 in drontheim long ago but everyone denies his right to interfere with our established laws and privileges  has he not by mere might and force of arms slain many and enslaved others of our best and bravest men  and now he proposes to reduce the whole land to slavery or something like it and all because of the foolish speech of a proud girl who says she will not wed him until he shall first subdue to himself the whole of norway and rule over it as fully and freely as king eric rules over sweden or king gorm over denmark  he has sworn that he will neither clip nor comb his hair until he has subdued all the land with scatt taxes and duties and domains or die in the attempt  trust me he is like to die in the attempt and since his kingship is to be so little occupied with his hair it would please me well if he would use his time and his shears in clipping the tongue of the wench that set him on so foul an errand  all this thou knowest hilda as well as i but thou dost not know that men have been at the stede today who tell us that the king is advancing north and is victorious everywhere  already king gandalf and hako are slain the two sons of king eystein have also fallen and many of the upland kings have been burned with most of their men in a house at ringsager  it is not many days since harald went up gudbrandsdal and north over the doverfielde where he ordered all the men to be slain and everything wide around to be given to the flames  king gryting of orkadal and all his people have sworn fidelity to him and nowworst news of allit is said he is coming over to pay us a visit in horlingdal  is not here cause for fighting in selfdefence or rather for country and laws and freedom and wives and children and  the excited youth stopped abruptly and seizing the tongs whirled the white mass of semimolten steel upon the anvil and fell to belabouring it with such goodwill that a bright shower of sparks drove hilda precipitately out of the workshop  the wrongs which roused the young norsemans indignation to such a pitch are matters of history  the government of the country at that time involved the democratic element very largely  no act or expedition of any importance could be done or undertaken without the previous deliberation and consent of a thing or assembly of landed proprietors  there were many different thingssuch as general things district things house things of the kings counsellors and herd things of the court etcetera and to such of these there was a distinct and wellknown trumpet call  there were also four great things which were legislative while the small district things were only administrative  in addition to which there was the ore thing of drontheim referred to by erling  at these things the king himself possessed no greater power than any of the bonders  he was only a thingman at a thing  no wonder then that the selfgoverning and warlike norsemen could not bring themselves tamely to submit to the tyranny of harald haarfager or fairhair king of norway by hereditary right when he cast aside all the restraints of ancient custom and in his effort to obtain more power commenced those bloody wars with his subjects which had the effect of causing many of his chief men to expatriate themselves and seek new homes in the islands of the great western sea and which ultimately resulted in the subjugation at least during that reign of all the petty kings of norway  these small kings be it observed were not at that time exercising any illegal power or in the occupation of any unwarrantable position which could be pleaded by king harald in justification of his violent proceedings against them  the title of king did not imply independent sovereignty  they were merely the hereditary lords of the soil who exercised independent and rightful authority over their own estates and households and modified authority over their respective districts subject however to the laws of the landlaws which were recognised and perfectly understood by the people and the king and which were admitted by people and king alike to have more authority than the royal will itself  by law the small kings were bound to attend the meetings of the stor things or parliaments at the summons of the sovereign and to abide by the decisions of those assemblies where all men met on an equal footing but where of course intellectual power and eloquence led the multitude for good or for evil then just as they do now and will continue to do as long as and wherever free discussion shall obtain  to say that the possession of power wealth or influence was frequently abused to the overawing and coercing of those assemblies is simply to state that they were composed of human beings possessed of fallen natures  so thoroughly did the northmen appreciate the importance of having a right to raise their voices and to vote in the national parliaments and so jealously did they assert and maintain their privileges that the king himselfbefore he could on his accession assume the crownwas obliged to appear at the thing where a freeborn landholder proposed him and where his title to the crown was investigated and proved in due form  no war expedition on a large scale could be undertaken until a thing had been converged and requisition legally made by the king for a supply of men and arms and generally whenever any act affecting national or even district interests was contemplated it was necessary to assemble a thing and consult with the people before anything could be done  it may be easily understood then with what an outburst of indignation a free and warlike race beheld the violent course pursued by harald fairhair who roamed through the country with fire and sword trampling on their cherished laws and privileges subduing the petty kings and placing them when submissive as jarls ie earls or governors over the districts to collect the scatt or taxes and manage affairs in his name and for his behoof  it is no wonder that erling the bold gathered his brow into an ominous frown pressed his lips together tossed his locks impatiently while he thought on these things and battered the iron mass on his anvil with the amount of energy that he would have expended in belabouring the head of king harald himself had opportunity offered  erlings wrath cooled however almost instantly on his observing hildas retreat before the fiery shower  he flung down his hammer seized his battleaxe and throwing it on his shoulder as he hurried out speedily overtook her  forgive my rude manners he said  my soul was chafed by the thoughts that filled my brain and i scare knew what i did  truly thou man of fire replied the girl with an offended look i am of half a mind not to pardon thee  see my kirtle is destroyed by the shower thou didst bestow upon me so freely  i will repay thee that with such a kirtle as might grace a queen the next time i go on viking cruise  meantime said hilda i am to go about like a witch plucked somewhat hastily from the fire by a sympathising crone  nay herfrida will make thee a new kirtle of the best wool at haldorstede  so thy mother it seems is to work and slave in order to undo thy mischief  then if nothing else will content thee said erling gaily i will make thee one myself but it must be of leather for i profess not to know how to stitch more delicate substance  but let me carry thy pitcher hilda  i will go to ulfstede to hold converse with thy father on these matters for it seemed to me that the clouds are gathering somewhat too thickly over the dale for comfort or peace to remain long with us  as the young man and maiden wended their way down the rocky path that skirted the foaming horlingdal river hilda assumed a more serious tone and sought to convince her companion of the impropriety of being too fond of fighting in which attempt as might be supposed she was not very successful  why hilda said the youth at the close of a speech in which his fair companion endeavoured to point out the extreme sinfulness of viking cruises in particular it is as thou sayest unjust to take from another that which belongs to him if he be our friend but if he is our enemy and the enemy of our country that alters the case  did not the great odin himself go on viking cruise and seize what prey he chose  erling said this with the air of a man who deemed his remark unanswerable  i know not rejoined hilda  there seems to me much mystery in our thoughts about the gods  i have heard it said that there is no such god as odin  the maiden uttered this in a subdued voice and her cheek paled a little as she glanced up at erlings countenance  the youth gazed at her with an expression of extreme surprise and for a few minutes they walked slowly forward without speaking  there was reason for this silence on both sides  hilda was naturally of a simple and trustful nature  she had been brought up in the religion of her fathers and had listened with awe and with deep interest on many a long winter night to the wild legends with which the scalds or poets of the period were wont to beguile the evening hours in her fathers mansion but about a year before the time of which we write an aged stranger had come from the south and taken up his abode in the valley in a secluded and dilapidated hut in which he was suffered to dwell unmolested by its owner haldor the fierce whose fierceness by the way was never exhibited except in time of war and in the heat of battle  with this hermit hilda had held frequent converse and had listened with horror but with a species of fascination which she could not resist to his calm and unanswerable reasoning on the fallacy of the religion of odin and on the truth of that of jesus christ  at first she resolved to fly from the old man as a dangerous enemy who sought to seduce her from the paths of rectitude but when she looked at his grave sad face and listened to the gentle andshe knew not whypersuasive tones of his voice she changed her mind and resolved to hear what he had to say  without being convinced of the truth of the new religionof which she had heard rumours from the roving vikings who frequented horlingdalshe was much shaken in regard to the truth of her own and now for the first time she had ventured to hint to a human being what was passing in her mind  at this period christianity had not penetrated into norway but an occasional wanderer or hermit had found his way thither from time to time to surprise the inhabitants with his new doctrines and then perchance to perish as a warlock because of them  erling had heard of this old man and regarded him with no favour for in his sea rovings he had met with socalled christians whose conduct had not prepossessed him in their favour  as for their creed he knew nothing whatever about it  his mind however was of that bold straightforward selfreliant and meditative cast which happily has existed in all ages and in all climes and which in civilised lands usually brings a man to honour and power while in barbarous countries and ages if not associated with extreme caution and reticence it is apt to bring its possessor into trouble  it was with astonishment that erling heard sentiments which had long been harboured in his own mind drop from the lips of one whose natural character he knew to be the reverse of sceptical in matters of faith or speculative in matters of opinion  instead of making a direct reply to hildas remark he said after a pause  hilda i have my doubts of the old man christian men say he is a warlock and i partly believe them for it is only such who shun the company of their fellows  i would caution thee against him  he believes not in odin or thor which is matter of consideration mainly to himself but methinks he holdeth fellowship with nikke satan or the evil one which is matter of consideration for all honest men aye and women too who would live in peace for if the evil spirit exists at all as i firmly believe he does in some shape or other it were well to keep as far from him as we may and specially to avoid those erring mortals who seem to court his company  the old man is misjudged believe me replied the girl earnestly i have spoken much with him and oft  it may be he is wrong in some thingshow can a woman judge of such mattersbut he is gentle and has a kind heart  i like him not was erlings curt reply  the youth and maiden had now reached a part of the valley where a small footpath diverged from the main track which led to ulfs dwelling  the path ran in the direction of the hayfields that bordered the fiord just as they reached it hilda observed that her father was labouring there with his thralls  see she exclaimed stopping abruptly and taking her pitcher from erling my father is in the hayfield  the youth was about to remonstrate and insist on being allowed to carry the pitcher to the house before going to the field but on second thoughts he resigned his slight burden and saying farewell turned on his heel and descended the path with rapid step and a somewhat burdened heart  she loves me not he muttered to himself almost sternly  i am a brother nothing more  indulging in these and kindred gloomy reflections he advanced towards a rocky defile where the path diverged to the right  before taking the turn he looked back  hilda was standing on the spot where they had parted but her face was not directed towards her late companion  she was looking steadily up the valley  presently the object which attracted her attention appeared in view and erling felt a slight sensation of anger he scarce knew why on observing the old man who had been the subject of their recent conversation issue from among the rocks  his first impulse was to turn back but checking himself he wheeled sharply round and hurried away  scarcely had he taken three steps however when he was arrested by a sound that resembled a crash of thunder  glancing quickly upwards he beheld an enormous mass of rock which had become detached from the mountain side descending in shattered fragments into the valley  the formation of horlingdal at that particular point was peculiar  the mountain ranges on either side which rose to a height of at least four thousand feet approached each other abruptly thus forming a dark gloomy defile of a few hundred yards in width with precipitous cliffs on either side and the river roaring in the centre of the pass  the water rushed in whitecrested billows through its rockimpeded bed and terminated in a splendid foss or fall forty or fifty feet high which plunged into a seething caldron whence it issued in a troubled stream to the plain that opened out below  it here found rest in the level fields of ulfstede that lay at the head of the fiord  the open amphitheatre above this pass with its circlet of grand glaciercapped mountains was the abode of a considerable number of small farmers in the midst of whose dwellings stood the residence of haldor where the meeting in the smithy just described took place  it was in this narrow defile that the landslip happened a catastrophe which always has been and still is of frequent occurrence in the mountain regions of norway  hilda and the old man whom we shall henceforth call christian cast their eyes hastily upwards on hearing the sound that had arrested erlings steps so suddenly  the enormous mass of rock was detached from the hill on the other side of the river but the defile was so narrow that falling rocks often rebounded quite across it  the slip occurred just opposite the spot on which hilda and the old man stood and as the terrible shower came on tearing down trees and rocks the heavier masses being dashed and spurned from the hillside in innumerable fragments it became evident that to escape beyond the range of the chaotic deluge was impossible  hilda understood the danger so well that she was panic stricken and rooted to the spot  erling understood it also and with a sudden cry dashed at full speed to the rescue  his cry was one almost of despair for the distance between them was so great that he had no chance he knew of reaching her in time  in this extremity the hermit looked round for a crevice or a rock which might afford protection but no such place of safety was at hand  the side of the pass rose behind them like a wall to a height of several hundred feet  seeing this at a glance the old man planted himself firmly in front of hilda  his lips moved and the single word jesus dropped from them as he looked with a calm steady gaze at the avalanche  scarcely had he taken his stand when the first stones leaped across the gorge and striking on the wall of rock behind burst into fragments and fell in a shower around them  some of the smaller debris struck the old mans breast and the hands which he had raised to protect his face but he neither blanched nor flinched  in another instant the greater part of the hurling rubbish fell with a terrible crash and tore up the earth in all directions round them  still they stood unhurt the height from which the ruin had descended was so great that the masses were scattered and although they flew around over and close to them the great shock passed by and left them unscathed  but the danger was not yet past  several of the smaller masses which had been partially arrested in their progress by bushes still came thundering down the steep  the quick eye of the hermit observed one of these flying straight towards his head  its force had been broken by a tree on the opposite hill but it still retained tremendous impetus  he knew that there was no escape for him  to have moved aside would have exposed hilda to almost certain destruction  once again he murmured the saviours name as he stretched out both hands straight before his face the rock struck full against them beat them down on his forehead and next instant old man and maid were hurled to the ground  well was it for erling that all this occurred so quickly that the danger was past before he reached the spot  part of the road he had to traverse was strewn so thickly with the rocky ruin that his destruction had he been a few seconds sooner on the ground would have been inevitable  he reached hilda just in time to assist her to rise  she was slightly stunned by the shock but otherwise unhurt  not so the hermit  he lay extended where he had fallen his grey beard and thin scattered locks dabbled with blood that flowed from a gash in his forehead  hilda kneeled at his side and raising his head she laid it in her lap  now the gods be praised said erling as he knelt beside her and endeavoured to stanch the flow of blood from the wound i had thought thy last hour was come hilda but the poor old man i fear much he will die  not so he recovers said the girl fetch me some water from the spring  erling ran to a rill that trickled down the face of the rock at his side dipped his leathern bonnet into it and quickly returning sprinkled a little on the old mans face and washed the wound  it is not deep he remarked after having examined the cut  his hands are indeed badly bruised but he will live  get thee to the stede erling and fetch aid said hilda quickly the old man is heavy  the youth smiled  heavy he is no doubt but he wears no armour methinks i can lift him  so saying erling raised him in his strong arms and bore him away to ulfstede where under the tender care of hilda and her fostersister ada he speedily revived  erling went out meanwhile to assist in the hayfield    note 1  the great assembly or parliament which was considered the only thing which could confer the sovereignty of the whole of norway the other things having no right or powers beyond their circles  it was convened only for the special purpose of examining and proclaiming the right of the aspirant to the crown but the king had still to repair to each law thing or small thing to obtain its acknowledgement of his right and the power of a sovereign within its jurisdiction    chapter three  shows how chief friends may become foes and crosspurposes may produce cross consequences involving worry and confusion  when christian had been properly cared for hilda sent ada to the hayfield saying that she would follow her in a short time  now it so happened by one of those curious coincidences which are generally considered unaccountable that as ada ascended the track which led to the high field above the foss glumm the gruff descended towards the same point from an opposite direction so that a meeting between the two in the secluded dell where the tracks joined became inevitable  whether or not this meeting was anticipated we cannot tell  if it was the young man and maiden were inimitable actors by nature for they appeared to be wholly unconscious of aught save the peculiar formation of the respective footpaths along which they slowly moved  there was indeed a twinkle in adas eyes but then adas eyes were noted twinklers besides a refractory eyelash might account for such an expression  as for glumm he frowned on the path most unamiably while he sauntered along with both hands thrust into the breast of his tunic and the point of his sword rasping harshly against rocks and bushes  glumm was peculiar in his weapons  he wore a doublehanded and doubleedged sword which was so long that he was obliged to sling it across his back in order to keep it off the ground  the handle projected above his left shoulder and the blade lying diagonally across his person extended beyond his right calf  the young man was remarkably expert in the use of this immense weapon and was not only a terror to his foes but owing to the enormous sweep of its long blade an object of some anxiety to his friends when they chanced to be fighting alongside of him  he wore a knife or dagger at his girdle on the right side which was also of unusual size in all probability it would have been deemed a pretty good sword by the romans  there were only two men in the dale who could wield glumms weapons  these were erling and his father haldor  the latter was as strong a man as glumm erling was even stronger though being an amiable man he could not be easily persuaded to prove his strength upon his friends  glumm wore his hair very short  it was curly and lay close to his head  as he sauntered along he kicked the stones out of his way savagely and appeared to find relief to his feelings in so doing as well as by allowing his sword to rasp across the rocks and shrubs at his side  it might have been observed however that glumm only kicked the little stones out of his way he never kicked the big ones  it is interesting to observe how trifling a matter will bring out a trait of human nature men will sometimes relieve their angry feelings by storming violently at those of their fellows who cannot hurt them but strangely enough they manage to obtain relief to these same feelings without storming when they chance to be in the company of stronger men than themselves thereby proving that they have powers of selfrestraint which prudence not to say fearcan call into exercise commend this moral reflection particularly to the study of boys  after glumm had kicked all the little stones out of his way carefully letting the big ones alone he came suddenly face to face with ada who saluted him with a look of startled surprise a slight blush and a burst of hearty laughter  why glumm exclaimed the maiden with an arch smile thou must have risen off thy wrong side this morning  methinks now were i a man i should have to look to my weapons for that long blade of thine seems inclined to fight with the rocks and shrubs of its own accord  poor glumm blushed as red as if he had been a young girl at being thus unexpectedly caught giving vent to his illhumour he stammered something about bad dreams and evil spirits and then breaking into a goodhumoured smile said  well ada i know not what it is that ails me but i do feel somewhat crossgrained  perchance a walk with thee may cure me i see thou art bound for the hayfield  but hast thou not heard the news  the danish vikings are off the coast burning and murdering wherever they go  it is rumoured too that their fleet is under that king of scoundrels skarpedin the red  surely there is reason for my being angry  nay then if thou wert a bold man thou wouldst find reason in this for being glad replied ada  is not the chance of a fight the joy of a true norsemans heart  surely a spell must have been laid on thee if thy brow darkens and thy heart grows heavy on hearing of a stout enemy it is not thus with erling the bold  his brow clears and his eye sparkles when a foe worthy ofbut what seest thou glumm  has the dane appeared in the forest that thy brow becomes so suddenly clouded  i pray thee do not run away and leave me unprotected  doubtless if i did erling the bold would come to thine aid replied the young man with some asperity  nay do not be angry with me glumm said the girl laughing as they reached the field where haldor and his stout son were busily at work assisting ulf who with all his thralls and freemen was engaged in cutting and gathering in his hay  hey here come cloud and sunshine hand in hand cried erling pausing in his work as glumm and his pretty companion approached the scene of labour  get on with thy work then and make the hay while i am shining retorted ada bestowing on the youth a bright smile which he returned cheerfully and with interest  this was the wicked adas finishing touch  glumm saw the exchange of smiles and a pang of fierce jealousy shot through his breast  the cloud sometimes darts out lightning he muttered angrily and turning on his heel began to toss the hay with all his might in order to relieve his feelings  just then hilda entered the field and glumm putting strong constraint on himself accosted her with extreme cheerfulness and respectresolved in his heart to show ada that there were other girls in horlingdal worth courting besides herself  in this game he was by no means successful as regarded ada who at once discerned his intention but the shaft which flew harmlessly past her fixed itself deep in the breast of another victim  glumms unusual urbanity took the kindhearted hilda so much by surprise that she was interested and encouraged him in what she conceived to be a tendency towards improvement of disposition by bestowing on him her sweetest smiles during the course of the day insomuch that erling the bold became much surprised and at last unaccountably cross  thus did these two men who had for many years been fast and loving friends become desperately jealous though each sought to conceal the fact from the other  but the greeneyed monster having obtained a lodgment in their bosoms could not be easily cast out  yet the good sense of each enabled him to struggle with some success against the passion for glumm although gruff was by no means a bad man  the presence of those conflicting feelings did not however interrupt or retard the work of the field  it was a truly busy scene  masters unfreemen and thralls mistresses and maidens were there cutting and turning and piling up the precious crop with might and main for they knew that the weather could not be trusted to and the very lives of their cattle depended on the successful ingathering of the hay  as we have here mentioned the three different classes that existed in norway it may be well to explain that the masters were peasants or bonders but not by any means similar to peasants in other lands on the contrary they were the udalborn proprietors of the soilthe peasantnobility so to speak the udallers or freeholders without any superior lord and were entitled to attend and have a voice in the things or assemblies where the laws were enacted and public affairs regulated  the next class was that of the unfreemen  these were freed slaves who had wrought out or purchased their freedom but who although personally free and at liberty to go where and serve whom they pleased were not free to attend the legislative assemblies  they were unfree of the things and hence their apparently contradictory designation  they however enjoyed the protection and civil rights imparted by the laws and to their class belonged all the cottars on the land paying a rent in work on the farm of the bonder or udaller also the housecarles or freeborn indoormen and the tradesmen labourers fishermen etcetera about villages and farms  thralls were slaves taken in war over whom the owners had absolute control  they might sell them kill them or do with them as they pleased  thralls were permitted to purchase their freedomand all the descendants of those freed thralls or unfreemen were free  the clothing of the unfreemen was finer than that of the thralls  the legs and arms of nearly all were bare from the knees and elbows downward though a few had swathed their limbs in bands of rough woollen cloth while others used straw for this purpose  nearly all the men wore shoes of untanned leather and caps of the same material or of rough homespun cloth resembling in form the cap of modern fishermen the udallers such as haldor ulf and their children were clad in finer garments which were looped and buttoned with brooches and pendants of gold and silver the booty gathered on those viking cruises against which hilda inveighed so earnestly  the work went on vigorously until the sun began to sink behind the mountain range that lay to the northwestward of the dale  by this time the hay was all cut and that portion which was sufficiently dry piled up so ulf and haldor left the work to be finished by the younger hands and stood together in the centre of the field chatting and looking on  little change had taken place in the personal appearance of ulf of romsdal since the occasion of that memorable duel related in the first chapter of our story  some of his elasticity but none of his strength was gone  there was perhaps a little more thought in his face and a few more wrinkles on his swarthy brow but his hair was still black and his figure straight as the blade of his good sword  his old enemy but now fast friend haldor the fierce had changed still less  true his formerly smooth chin and cheeks were now thickly covered with luxuriant fair hair but his broad forehead was still unwrinkled and his clear blue eye was as bright as when twenty years before it gleamed in youthful fire at ulf  many a battle had haldor fought since then at home and abroad and several scars on his countenance and shoulders gave evidence that he had not come out of these altogether scathless but war had not soured him  his smile was as free open and honest and his laugh as loud and hearty as in days of yore  erling was the counterpart of his father only a trifle taller and stouter  at a short distance they might have been taken for twin brothers and those who did not know them could scarcely have believed that they were father and son  close to the spot where the two friends stood a sturdy thrall was engaged in piling up hay with an uncommon degree of energy  this man had been taken prisoner on the coast of ireland by ulf during one of his searoving expeditions  he had a huge massive frame with a profusion of red hair on his head and face and a peculiarly humorous twinkle in his eye  his name was kettle flatnose  we have reason to believe that the first part of this name had no connection with that domestic utensil which is intimately associated with tea  it was a mere accidental resemblance of sound no doubt  as to the latter part that is easily explained  in those days there were no surnames  in order to distinguish men of the same name from each other it was usual to designate them by their complexions or by some peculiarity of person or trait of character  a blow from a club in early life had destroyed the shape of kettles nose and had disfigured an otherwise handsome and manly countenance  hence his name  he was about thirtyfive years of age largeboned broadshouldered and tall but lean in flesh and rather ungainly in his motions  few men cared to grapple with the huge irish slave for he possessed a superabundant share of that fire and love of fight which are said to characterise his countrymen even at the present time  he was also gifted with a large share of their characteristic good humour and joviality which qualities endeared him to many of his companions especially to the boys of the neighbourhood in short there was not a better fellow in the dale than kettle flatnose  thy labour is not light kettle observed ulf to the thrall as he paused for a few moments in the midst of his work to wipe his heated brow  ill would it become me master replied the man to take my work easy when my freedom is so nearly gained  right quite right replied ulf with an approving nod as the thrall set to work again with redoubled energy  that man he added turning to haldor will work himself free in a few weeks hence  he is one of my best thralls  i give my slaves as thou knowest leave to work after hours to purchase their freedom and kettle labours so hard that he is almost a free man already though he has been with me little more than two years and a half  i fear the fellow will not remain with me after he is free for he is an unsettled spirit  he was a chief in his own land it seems and left a bride behind him i am told  if he goes i lose a man equal to two he is so strong and willingho  kettle continued ulf turning to the man who had just finished the job on which he had been engaged toss me yonder stone and let my friend haldor see what thou art made of  kettle obeyed with alacrity  he seized a round stone as large as his own head and with an unwieldy action of his great frame cast it violently through the air about a dozen yards in advance of him  well cast well cast cried haldor while a murmur of applause rose from the throng of labourers who had been instantly attracted to the spot  come i will try my own hand against thee  haldor advanced and lifting the stone balanced it for a few moments in his right hand then with a graceful motion and an apparently slight effort hurled it forward  it fell a foot beyond kettles mark  seeing this the thrall leaped forward seized the stone ran back to the line bent his body almost to the ground and exerting himself to the utmost threw it into the same hollow from which he had lifted it  equal cried ulf  come haldor try again  nay i will not try until he beats me replied haldor with a goodnatured laugh  but do thou take a cast ulf  thine arm is powerful as i can tell from experience  not so replied ulf  it becomes men who are past their prime to reserve their strength for the sword and battleaxe  try it once more kettle  mayhap thou wilt pass the mark next time  kettle tried again and again but without gaining a hairsbreadth on haldors throw  the stalwart thrall had indeed put forth greater force in his efforts than haldor but he did not possess his skill  will no young man make trial of his strength and skill said haldor looking round upon the eager faces of the crowd  glumm is no doubt anxious to try his hand said erling who stood close to the line with his arms resting on the head of his longhafted battleaxe  the shining of the sunbeam will doubtless warm thy heart and nerve thine arm  erling muttered the latter part of his speech in a somewhat bitter tone alluding to hildas smiles but the jealous and sulky glumm could appreciate no sunbeams save those that flashed from adas dark eyes  he understood the remark as a triumphant and ironical taunt and leaping fiercely into the ring formed by the spectators exclaimed  i will cast the stone but i must have a better man than thou kettle to strive with  if erling the bold will throw  i will not balk thee interrupted the other quickly as he laid down his axe and stepped up to the line  glumm now made a cast  everyone knew well enough that he was one of the best throwers of the stone in all the dale and confidently anticipated an easy victory over the thrall  but the unusual tumult of conflicting feelings in the young mans breast rendered him at the time incapable of exerting his powers to the utmost in a feat to excel in which requires the union of skill with strength  at his first throw the stone fell short about an inch  at this adas face became grave and her heart began to flutter with anxiety for although willing enough to torment her lover a little herself she could not brook the idea of his failing in a feat of strength before his comrades  furious with disappointment and jealousy and attributing adas expression to anxiety lest he should succeed glumm cast again with passionate energy and sent the stone just an inch beyond the thralls mark  there was a dispute on the point however which did not tend to soothe the youths feelings but it was ultimately decided in his favour  erling now stood forth and as he raised his tall form to its full height and elevated the stone above his head he seemed especially to hilda the beauideal of manly strength and beauty  he was grieved however at glumms failure for he knew him to be capable of doing better than he had done  he remembered their old friendship too and pity for his friends loss of credit caused the recently implanted jealousy for a moment to abate  he resolved therefore to exert himself just sufficiently to maintain his credit  but unhappily for the successful issue of this effort of selfdenial erling happened to cast his eye towards the spot where hilda stood  the tenderhearted maiden chanced at that moment to be regarding glumm with a look of genuine pity  of course erling misconstrued the look  next moment the huge stone went singing through the air and fell with a crash full two yards beyond glumms mark  happening to alight on a piece of rock it sprang onward passed over the edge of the hill or brae on the summit of which the field lay and gathering additional impetus in its descent went bounding down the slope tearing through everything in its way until it found rest at last on the sea beach below  a perfect storm of laughter and applause greeted this unexpected feat but high above the din rose the voice of glumm who now in a towering passion seized his doublehanded sword and shouting  guard thee erling made a furious blow at his conquerors head  erling had fortunately picked up his axe after throwing the stone  he immediately whirled the heavy head so violently against the descending sword that the blade broke off close to the hilt and glumm stood before him disarmed and helpless gazing in speechless astonishment at the hilt which remained in his hands  my good sword he exclaimed in a tone of deep despondency  at this erling burst into a hearty fit of laughter  my bad sword thou must mean said he  how often have i told thee glumm that there was a flaw in the metal  i have advised thee more than once to prove the blade and now that thou hast consented to do so behold the result but be not so cast down man i have forged another blade specially for thyself friend glumm but did not think to give it thee so soon  glumm stood abashed and had not a word to reply  fortunately his feelings were relieved by the attention of the whole party being attracted at that moment to the figure of a man on the opposite side of the valley who ran towards them at full speed leaping over almost every obstacle that presented itself in his course  in a few minutes he rushed panting into the midst of the throng and presented a baton or short piece of wood to ulf at the same time exclaiming haste  king harald holds a thing at the springs  speed on the token  the import of this message and signal were well understood by the men of horlingdal  when an assembly or thing was to be convened for discussing civil matters a wooden truncheon was sent round from place to place by fleet messengers each of whom ran a certain distance and then delivered over his messagetoken to another runner who carried it forward to a third and so on  in this manner the whole country could be roused and its chief men assembled in a comparatively short time when however the thing was to be assembled for the discussion of affairs pertaining to war an arrow split in four parts was the messagetoken  when the split arrow passed through the land men were expected to assemble armed to the teeth but when the baton went round it was intended that they should meet without the full panoply of war  as soon as the token was presented ulf looked about for a fleet man to carry forward the message  several of the youths at once stepped forward offering their services  foremost among them was a stout deepchested active boy of about twelve years of age with long flaxen curls a round sunburnt face a bold yet not forward look a merry smile and a pair of laughing blue eyes  this was erlings little brother alrica lad whose bosom was kept in a perpetual state of stormy agitation by the conflict carried on therein between a powerful tendency to fun and mischief and a strong sense of the obedience due to parents  i will go said the boy eagerly holding out his hand for the token  thou my son said haldor regarding him with a look of illsuppressed pride  go to thy mothers bower boy  what if a fox or mayhap even a wolf met thee on the fell  have i not my good bow of elm replied alric touching the weapon which with a quiver full of arrows was slung across his back  tush boy go pop at the squirrels till thou be grown big enough to warrant thy boasting  father said alric with a look of glee im sure i did not boast  i did but point to my poor weapons  besides i have good legs  if i cannot fight methinks i can run  out upon thee  nay haldor said ulf interrupting the discussion thou art too hard on the lad  can he run well  ill answer for that said erling laying his large hand on his brothers flaxen head  i doubt if there is a fleeter foot in all the dale  away then cried ulf handing the token to alric and see that ye deserve all this praise  and now sirs let us fare to the hall to sup and prepare for our journey to the springs  the crowd at once broke up and hurried away to ulfstede in separate groups discussing eagerly as they went and stepping out like men who had some pressing business on hand  alric had already darted away like a hunted deer  erling turned hastily aside and went away alone  as soon as he reached a spot where the rugged nature of the ground concealed him from his late companions he started up the valley at his utmost speed directing his course so as to enable him to overshoot and intercept his brother  he passed a gorge ahead of the boy and then turning suddenly to the left bore down upon him  so well did he calculate the distance that on turning round the edge of a jutting cliff he met him face to face and the two ran somewhat violently into each others arms  on being relieved from this involuntary embrace alric stepped back and opened his eyes wide with surprise while erling roared with laughter  ye are merry my brother said alric relaxing into a grin but i have seen thee often thus and may not stop to observe thee now seeing that it is nothing new  give me an arrow thou rogue  there said erling splitting the shaft into four parts handing it back to the boy and taking the baton from him  get thee gone and use thy legs well  we must not do the king the dishonour to appear before him without our weapons in these unsettled times  let the token be sent out north south east and west and harkee lad say nothing to anyone about the object of the assembly  alrics countenance became grave then it again relaxed into a broad grin  giving his brother an emphatic wink with one of his large blue eyes he darted past him and was soon far up the glen running with the speed of a deer and waving the wartoken over his head    chapter four  describes warlike preparations and a norse hall in the olden time tells also of a surprise  instead of returning to ulfstede erling directed his steps homeward at a brisk pace and in a short space of time reached the door of his forge  here he met one of his fathers thralls  ho fellow said he is thy mistress at home  yes master she is in the hall getting supper ready against your fathers return  go tell her there will be no men to eat supper in the hall tonight said erling unfastening the door of the forge  say that i am in the forge and will presently be in to speak with her  go also to thorer and tell him to get the housecarles busked for war  when they are ready let him come hither to me and harkee use thine utmost speed there may be bloody work for us all to do this night before the birds are on the wing  away  the man turned and ran to the house while erling blew up the smouldering fire of the forge  throwing off his jerkin he rolled up his sleeves and seizing the axe on which he had been engaged when hilda interrupted him he wrought so vigorously at the stubborn metal with the great forehammer that in the course of half an hour it was ready to fit on the haft  there was a bundle of hafts in a corner of the workshop one of these a tough thick one without knot or flaw and about five feet long he fitted to the iron head with great neatness and skill the polishing of this formidable weapon he deferred to a period of greater leisure  having completed this piece of work erling next turned to another corner of the forge and took up the huge twohanded sword which he had made for his friend glumm  the weapon was beautifully executed and being highly polished the blade glittered with a flashing light in the ruddy glare of the forge fire  the young giant sat down on his anvil and put a few finishing touches to the sword regarding it the while with a grim smile as if he speculated on the probability of his having formed a weapon wherewith his own skull was destined to be cloven asunder  while he was thus engaged his mother herfrida entered  the softeyed dame could scarcely be called a matronly personage having married when about sixteen she was now just thirtyeight years of age and though the bloom of maidenhood was gone the beauty of a wellfavoured and healthy woman still remained  she wore a cloak of rich blue wool and under it a scarlet kirtle with a silver girdle  how now my son she said why these warlike preparations  because there is rumour of war im sure that is neither strange nor new to you mother  truly no and well do i know that where war is there my husband and my son will be found  herfrida said this with a feeling of pride for like most of the women of that time and country she esteemed most highly the men who were boldest and could use their weapons best  twere well if we were less noted in that way and more given to peace said erling halfjestingly  for my own part i have no liking for war but you women will be for ever egging us on  herfrida laughed  she was well aware of what she was pleased to term her sons weakness namely an idea that he loved peace while he was constantly proving to the world that he was just cut out for war  had he ever shown a spark of cowardice she would have regarded those speeches of his with much anxiety but as it was she only laughed at them  erling my boy she said suddenly as her eye fell on the axe at his sidewhat terrible weapon is this  surely thou must have purchased thors hammer  can ye wield such a thing  i hope so mother said erling curtly if not i shall soon be in valhallas halls  what are these rumours of war that are abroad just now asked herfrida  erling replied by giving his mother an account of king haralds recent deeds and told her of the calling of the thing and of the appearance of the danish vikings off the coast  may good spirits attend thee my son she said kissing the youths forehead fervently as a natural gush of tenderness and womanly anxiety filled her breast for a moment  but the feeling passed away as quickly as it came for women who are born and nurtured in warlike times become accustomed and comparatively indifferent to danger whether it threatens themselves or those most dear to them  while mother and son were conversing thorer entered the smithy bearing erlings armour  are the lads all aboun  armed and ready enquired erling as he rose  aye master and i have brought your wargear  the man who thus spoke was haldors chief housecarle  he was a very short and extremely powerful man of about fortyfive years of age and so sturdy and muscular as to have acquired the title of thorer the thick  he wore a shirt of scale armour rather rusty and somewhat the worse of having figured in many a tough battle by land and sea  a triangular shield hung at his back and his headpiece was a simple peaked helmet of iron with a prolongation in front that guarded his nose  thorers offensive armour consisted of a short straight sword a javelin and a bow with a quiver of arrows  how many men hast thou assembled thorer asked erling as he donned his armour  seventyfive master the rest are up on the fells on what errand i know not  seventyfive will do  haste thee carle and lead them to my longship the swan  methinks we will skate upon the ocean tonight  longships or warvessels were sometimes called oceanskates i will follow thee let every man be at his post and quit not the shore till i come on board  now fare away as swiftly as may be and see that everything be done stealthily above all keep well out of sight of ulfstede  thus admonished thorer quickly left the forge and a few seconds later the clanking tread of armed men was heard as erlings followers took their way to the fiord  now i will to the hall my son and pray that thou mayst fare well said herfrida once more kissing the forehead which the youth lowered to receive the parting salute  the mother retired and left her son standing in the forge gazing pensively at the fire the dying flames of which shot up fitfully now and then and gleamed on his shining mail  if erling the bold was a splendid specimen of a man in his ordinary costume when clad in the full panoply of war he was truly magnificent the rude but not ungraceful armour of the period was admirably fitted to display to advantage the elegant proportions of his gigantic figure  a shirt or tunic of leather covered with steel rings hung looselyyet owing to its weight closelyon his shoulders  this was gathered in at the waist by a broad leathern belt studded with silver ornaments from which hung a short dagger  a cross belt of somewhat similar make hung from his right shoulder and supported a twoedged sword of immense weight which was quite as strong though not nearly so long as that which he had forged for glumm  it was intended for a singlehanded weapon though men of smaller size might have been constrained in attempting to wield it to make use of both hands  the youths lower limbs were clothed in closelyfitting leather leggings and a pair of untanned leather shoes laced with a single thong protected his feet on his head he wore a small skullcap or helmet of burnished steel from the top of which rose a pair of hawks wings expanded as if in the act of flight  no gloves or gauntlets covered his hands but on his left arm hung a large shield shaped somewhat like an elongated heart with a sharp point at its lower end  its top touched his shoulder and the lower part reached to his knee  this shield was made of several plies of thick bullhide with an outer coat of ironthe whole being riveted firmly together with iron studs it was painted pure white without device of any kind but there was a band of azure blue round it near the marginthe rim itself being of polished steel  in addition to his enormous axe sword and dagger erling carried at his back a short bow and a quiver full of arrows  the whole of this war gear bore evidence of being cherished with the utmost care and solicitude  every ring on the tunic was polished as highly as the metal would admit of so that the light appeared to trickle over it as its wearer moved  the helmet shone like a globe of quicksilver and lines of light gleamed on the burnished edge of the shield or sparkled on the ornamental points of the more precious metals with which the various parts of his armour were decorated  above all hung a loose mantle or cloak of darkblue cloth which was fastened on the right shoulder with a large circular brooch of silver  the weight of this panoply was enormous but long habit had so inured the young norseman to the burthen of his armour that he moved under it as lightly as if it had been no heavier than his ordinary habiliments indeed so little did it impede his movements that he could spring over chasms and mountain streams almost as well with as without it and it was one of the boasts of his admiring friends that he could leap his own height with all his war gear on  we have already referred to erlings partiality for the axe as an offensive weapon  this preference was in truthstrange though the assertion may appearowing to the peculiar adaptation of that instrument to the preservation of life as well as the taking of it  there are exceptions to all rules  the rule among the northmen in former years was to slay and spare not  erlings tendency and occasionally his practice was to spare and not to slay if he could do so with propriety  from experience he found that by a slight motion of his wrist the edge of his axe could be turned aside and the blow which was delivered by its flat side was invariably sufficient without killing to render the recipient utterly incapable of continuing or renewing the combatat least for a few days  with the sword this delicate manoeuvre could not be so easily accomplished for a blow from the flat of a sword was not sufficiently crushing and if delivered with great force the weapon was apt to break  besides erling was a blunt downright straightforward man and it harmonised more with his feelings and the energy of his character to beat down sword and shield and headpiece with one tremendous blow than to waste time in fencing with a lighter weapon  having completed his toilet and concluded his meditationswhich latter filled him with much perplexity if one might judge from the frequency with which he shook his headerling the bold hung glumms long sword at his back laid his huge axe on his shoulder and emerging from the smithy strode rapidly along the bridle path that led to the residence of ulf of romsdal  suddenly it occurred to him that he had not yet tried the temper of his new weapon so he stopped abruptly before a small pine tree about as thick as a mans arm  it stood on the edge of a precipice along the margin of which the track skirted  swaying the axe once round his head he brought it forcibly down on the stem through which it passed as if it had been a willow wand and the tree went crashing into the ravine below  the youth looked earnestly at his weapon and nodded his head once or twice as if the result were satisfactory  a benignant smile played on his countenance as he replaced it on his shoulder and continued on his way  a brisk walk of half an hour brought him to ulfstede where he found the men of the family making active preparations for the impending journey to the thing  in the great hall of the house his father held earnest discussion with ulf  the housecarles busied themselves in burnishing their mail and sharpening their weapons while ada and hilda assisted dame astrid ulfs wife to spread the board for the evening meal  everything in the hall was suggestive of rude wealth and barbarous warlike times  the hall itself was unusually largecapable of feasting at least two hundred men  at one end a raised hearth sustained a fire of wood that was large enough to have roasted an ox  the smoke from this in default of a chimney found an exit through a hole in the roof the rafters were of course smoked to a deep rich coffee colour and from the same cause the walls also partook not a little of that hue all round these walls hung in great profusion shields spears swords bows skins horns and such like implements and trophies of war and the chase  the centre of the hall was open but down each side ran two long tables which were at this time groaning with great haunches of venison legs of mutton and trenchers of salmon interspersed with platters of wild fowl and flanked by tankards and horns of mead and ale  most of the drinking cups were of horn but many of these were edged with a rim of silver and opposite the raised seats of honour in the centre of each table the tankards were of solid silver richly though rudely chasedsquare sturdy and massive like the stout warriors who were wont to quaff their foaming contents  i tell thee ulf said haldor thou wilt do wrong to fare to the thing with men fully armed when the token was one of peace  the king is in no mood just now to brook opposition  if we would save our independence we must speak him smoothly  i care not replied ulf gruffly this is no time to go about unarmed  nay i did not advise thee to go unarmed but surely a short sword might suffice and  at this moment erling entered and ulf burst into a loud laugh as he interrupted his friend aye a short swordsomething like that he said pointing to the huge hilt which rose over the youths shoulder  hey lad exclaimed his father art going to fight with an axe in one hand and a sword in the other  the sword is for glumm father  i owe him one after this mornings work  here friend glumm buckle it on thy shoulder  the best wish that thou and i can exchange is that thy sword and my axe may never kiss each other  truly if they ever do i know which will fare worst said haldor taking the axe and examining it thou art fond of a weary arm my lad else ye would not have forged so weighty a weapon  take my advice and leave it behind thee  come come interrupted ulf see the tables are spread let us use our jaws on food and drink and not on words for we shall need both to fit us for the work before us and perchance we may have no longer need of either before many days go by  we can talk our fill at the thing an it so please us  that will depend on the kings pleasure replied haldor laughing  so much the more reason for taking our arms with us in order that we may have the means of talking the kings pleasure retorted ulf with a frown but sit ye down at my right hand haldor and hilda will wait upon thee  come my men alllet us fall to  it is scarcely necessary to say that this invitation was accepted with alacrity  in a few minutes about fifty pairs of jaws were actively employed in the manner which ulf recommended  meanwhile erling the bold seated himself at the lower end of one of the tables in such a position that he could keep his eye on the outer door and if need be steal away unobserved  he calculated that his little brother must soon return from his flying journey and he expected to hear from him some news of the vikings  in this expectation he was right but when alric did come erling saw and heard more than he looked for  the meal was about half concluded and ulf was in the act of pledging not absent but defunct friends when the door opened slowly and alric thrust his head cautiously in  his hair dripping and tangled bore evidence that his head at least had been recently immersed in water  he caught sight of erling and the head was at once withdrawn  next moment erling stood outside of the house  how now alric what has befallen thee  hey thou art soaking all over  come here ill show you a fellow who will tell you all about it  in great excitement the boy seized his brothers hand and dragged rather than led him round the end of the house where the first object that met his view was a man whose face was covered with blood which oozed from a wound in his forehead while the heaving of his chest and an occasional gasp seemed to indicate that he had run far and swiftly    chapter five  the viking raidalrics adventure with the daneerlings cutter and the battle in the pass  whom have we here exclaimed erling looking close into the face of the wounded man  what  swart of the springs  erling said this sternly for he had no liking for swart who was a notorious character belonging to one of the neighbouring fiordsa wild reckless fellow and if report said truly a thief  that recent mischief has cost thee a cracked crown asked erling a little more gently as he observed the exhausted condition of the man  mischief enough said swart rising from the stone on which he had seated himself and wiping the blood dust and sweat from his haggard face while his eyes gleamed like coals of fire skarpedin the dane has landed in the fiord my house is a smoking pile my children and most of the people in the stede are burned and the springs run blood  there was something terrible in the hoarse whisper in which this was hissed out between the mans teeth  erlings tone changed instantly as he laid his hand on swarts shoulder  can this be true he answered anxiously are we too late are all gone  all answered swart save the few fighting men that gained the fells  the man then proceeded to give a confused and disjointed account of the raid of which the following is the substance  skarpedin a danish viking noted for his daring cruelty and success had taken it into his head to visit the neighbourhood of horlingdal and repay in kind a visit which he had received in denmark the previous summer from a party of norsemen on which occasion his crops had been burned his cattle slaughtered and his lands herried while he chanced to be absent from home  it must be observed that this deed of the northmen was not deemed unusually wicked  it was their custom and the custom also of their enemies to go out every summer on viking cruise to plunder and ravage the coasts of denmark sweden britain and france carrying off all the booty they could lay hold of and as many prisoners as they wanted or could obtain  then returning home they made slaves or thralls of their prisoners often married the women and spent the winter in the enjoyment of their plunder  among many other simple little habits peculiar to the times was that called strandhug  it consisted in a viking when in want of provisions landing with his men on any coastwhether that of an enemy or a countrymanand driving as many cattle as he required to the shore where they were immediately slaughtered and put on board without leave asked or received  skarpedin was influenced both by cupidity and revenge  swart had been one of the chief leaders of the expedition which had done him so much damage  to the springs therefore he directed his course with six longships or ships of war and about five hundred men  in the afternoon of a calm day he reached the fiord at the head of which were the springs and swarts dwelling  there was a small hamlet at the place and upon this the vikings descended  so prompt and silent were they that the men of the place had barely time to seize their arms and defend their homes  they fought like lions for well they knew that there was no hope of mercy if they should be beaten  but the odds against them were overwhelming  they fell in heaps with many of their foes underneath them  the few who remained to the last retreated fighting step by step each man towards his own dwelling where he fell dead on its threshold  swart himself with a few of the bravest had driven back that part of the enemys line which they attacked  thus they were separated for a time from their less successful comrades and it was not till the smoke of their burning homesteads rose up in dense clouds that they became aware of the true state of the fight  at once they turned and ran to the rescue of their families but their retreat was cut off by a party of the enemy and the roar of the conflagration told them that they were too late  they drew together therefore and making a last desperate onset hewed their way right through the ranks of their enemies and made for the mountains  all were more or less wounded in the melee and only one or two succeeded in effecting their escape  swart dashed past his own dwelling in his flight and found it already down on the ground in a blazing ruin  he killed several of the men who were about it and then bounding up the mountain side sought refuge in a ravine  here he lay down to rest a few moments  during the brief period of his stay he saw several of his captured friends have their hands and feet chopped off by the marauders while a terrible shriek that arose once or twice told him all too plainly that on a few of them had been perpetrated the not uncommon cruelty of putting out the eyes  swart did not remain many moments inactive  he descended by a circuitous path to the shore and keeping carefully out of sight set off in the direction of horlingdal  the distance between the two places was little more than nine or ten miles but being separated from each other by a ridge of almost inaccessible mountains that rose to a height of above five thousand feet neither sight nor sound of the terrible tragedy enacted at the springs could reach the eyes or ears of the inhabitants of ulfstede  swart ran round by the coast and made such good use of his legs that he reached the valley in little more than an hour  before arriving at ulfstede his attention was attracted and his step arrested by the sight of a warship creeping along the fiord close under the shadow of the precipitous cliffs  he at once conjectured that this was one of the danish vessels which had been dispatched to reconnoitre horlingdal  he knew by its small size having only about twenty oars that it could not be there for the purpose of attack  he crouched therefore among the rocks to escape observation  now it happened at this very time that erlings brother alric having executed his commission by handing the wartoken to the next messenger whose duty it was to pass it on came whistling gaily down a neighbouring gorge slashing the bushes as he went with a stout stick which in the lads eyes represented the broadsword or battleaxe he hoped one day to wield in similar fashion on the heads of his foes those who knew erling well could have traced his likeness in every act and gesture of the boy  the vikings happened to observe alric before he saw them as was not to be wondered at considering the noise he made they therefore rowed close in to the rocks and their leader a stout redhaired fellow leaped on shore ascended the cliffs by a narrow ledge or natural footpath and came to a spot which overhung the sea and round which the boy must needs pass  here the man paused and leaning on the haft of his battleaxe awaited his coming up  it is no disparagement to alric to say that when he found himself suddenly face to face with this man his mouth opened as wide as did his eyes that the colour fled from his cheeks that his heart fluttered like a bird in a cage and that his lips and tongue became uncommonly dry  well did the little fellow know that one of the danish vikings was before him for many a time had he heard the men in haldorstede describe their dress and arms minutely and well did he know also that mercy was only to be purchased at the price of becoming an informer as to the state of affairs in horlingdalperhaps a guide to his fathers house besides this alric had never up to that time beheld a real foe even at a distance  he would have been more than mortal therefore had he shown no sign of trepidation  thou art light of heart lad said the dane with a grim smile  alric would perhaps have replied that his heart was the reverse of light at that moment but his tongue refused to fulfil its office so he sighed deeply and tried to lick his parched lips instead  thou art on thy way to ulfstede or haldorstede i suppose said the man  alric nodded by way of reply  to which demanded the dane sternly  ttoto ulf  ha interrupted the man  i see  i am in want of a guide thither wilt guide me lad  at this the truant blood rushed back to alrics cheeks  he attempted to say no and to shake his head but the tongue was still rebellious and the head would not moveat least not in that wayso the poor boy glanced slightly aside as if meditating flight  the dane without altering his position just moved his foot on the stones which act had the effect of causing the boys eyes to turn full on him again with that species of activity which cats are wont to display when expecting an immediate assault  escape is impossible said the dane with another grim smile  alric glanced at the precipice on his left full thirty feet deep with the sea below at the precipice on his right which rose an unknown height above at the steep rugged path behind and at the wild rugged man in front who could have clutched him with one bound and admitted in his heart that escape was impossible  now lad continued the viking thou wilt go with me and point out the way to ulfstede and haldorstede if not with a good will torture shall cause thee to do it against thy will and after we have plundered and burnt both we will give thee a cruise to denmark and teach thee the use of the pitchfork and reapinghook  this remark touched a chord in alrics breast which at once turned his thoughts from himself and allowed his native courage to rise  during the foregoing dialogue his left hand had been nervously twitching the little elm bow which it carried  it now grasped the bow firmly as he replied  ulfstede and haldorstede may burn but thou shalt not live to see it  with that he plucked an arrow from his quiver fitted it to the string and discharged it full at the danes throat  quick as thought the man of war sprang aside but the shaft had been well and quickly aimed  it passed through his neck between the skin and the flesh  a cry of anger burst from him as he leaped on the boy and caught him by the throat  he hastily felt for the hilt of his dagger and in the heat of his rage would assuredly have ended the career of poor alric then and there but missing the hilt at the first grasp he suddenly changed his mind lifted the boy as if he had been a little dog and flung him over the precipice into the sea  a fall of thirty feet even though water should be the recipient of the shock is not a trifle by any means but alric was one of those vigorous little fellowsof whom there are fortunately many in this worldwho train themselves to feats of strength and daring  many a time had he when bathing leaped off that identical cliff into the sea for his own amusement and to the admiration and envy of many of his companions and now that he felt himself tumbling in the air against his will the sensation although modified was nothing new  he straightened himself out after the manner of a bad child that does not wish to sit on nurses knee and went into the blue fiord head foremost like a javelin  he struck the water close to the vessel of his enemies and on rising to the surface one of them made a plunge at him with an oar which had it taken effect would have killed him on the spot but he missed his aim and before he could repeat it the boy had dived  the dane was sensible of his error the instant he had tossed alric away from him so he hastened to his boat leaped into it and ordered the men to pull to the rocks near to which alric had dived but before they could obey the order a loud ringing cheer burst from the cliffs and in another moment the form of swart was seen on a ledge high above in the act of hurling a huge mass of rock down on the boat  the mass struck the cliff in its descent burst into fragments and fell in a shower upon the danes  at the same time swart waved his hand as if to someone behind him and shouted with stentorian voice  this way men  come on  down into the boats and give chase huzza  the enemy did not await the result of the order but pulled out into the fiord as fast as possible while swart ran down to the edge of the water and assisted alric to land  it was not until they heard both man and boy utter a cheer of defiance and burst into a fit of laughter and saw them hastening at full speed towards horlingdal that the vikings knew they had been duped  it was too late however to remedy the evil they knew also that they might now expect an immediate attack so bending to the oars with all their might they hastened off to warn their comrades at the springs  now swart said erling after hearing this tale to its conclusion if ye are not too much exhausted to  exhausted cried swart springing up as though he had but risen from a refreshing slumber  well i see thou art still fit for the fight  revenge like love is a powerful stirrer of the blood  come along then i will lead the way and do thou tread softly and keep silence  follow us alric i have yet more work for thee lad  taking one of the numerous narrow paths that ran from ulfstede to the shores of the fiord erling led his companions to a grassy mound which crowned the top of a beetling cliff whose base was laved by deep water although the night was youngprobably two hours short of midnightthe sun was still high in the heavens for in most parts of norway that luminary during the height of summer sinks but a short way below the horizonthey have daylight all night for some time  in the higher latitudes the sun for a brief period shines all the twentyfour hours round  erling could therefore see far and wide over the fiord as well as if it were the hour of noon  nothing in sight he exclaimed in a tone of chagrin  i was a fool to let thee talk so long swart but there is still a chance of catching the boat before it rounds the ness  come along  saying this hurriedly the youth descended into what appeared to be a hole in the ground  a rude zigzag stair cut in the rock conducted them into a subterranean cavern which at first seemed to be perfectly dark but in a few seconds their eyes became accustomed to the dim light and as they advanced rapidly over a bed of pebbles swart who had never been there before discovered that he was in an oceanmade cave for the sound of breaking ripples fell softly on his ears  on turning round a corner of rock the opening of the cave towards the sea suddenly appeared with a dazzling light like a great white gem  but another beautiful sight met his astonished gaze  this was erlings ship of war the swan which with its figurehead erect as though it were a living thing sat gracefully on the water above its own reflected image  all ready asked erling as a man stepped up to him  all ready replied thorer  get on board swart said erling we will teach these danes a lesson they will not forget as long as the springs flow  here alricwhere are ye lad  now unfortunately for himself as well as for his friend alric was almost too selfreliant in his nature  his active mind was too apt to exert itself in independent thought in circumstances where it would have been wiser to listen and obey  erling had turned with the intention of telling his little brother that he had started thus quietly in order that he might have the pleasure of capturing the scouting boat and of beginning the fight at the springs with a small band of tried men thus keeping the enemy in play until reinforcements should arrive for he shrewdly suspected that if the whole valley were to go out at once against the vikings they would decline the combat and make off  he had intended therefore to have warned alric to watch the swan past a certain point before sounding the alarm at ulfstede  but alric had already formed his own opinions on the subject and resolved to act on them  he suspected that erling in his thirst for glory meant to have all the fun to himself and to attack the danes with his single boats crew of fifty or sixty men  he knew enough of war to be aware that sixty men against six hundred would have very small chance of successin fact that the thing was sheer madnessso he resolved to balk and by so doing to save his headstrong brother  when erling turned as we have said he beheld alric running into the cave at full speed  instantly suspecting the truth he dashed after him but the boy was fleet and erling was heavily armed  the result was that the former escaped while the latter returned to the beach and embarked in the swan in a most unenviable state of mind  erlings longship was one of the smallersized war vessels of the period  it pulled twenty oarsten on each sideand belonged to the class named snekiars or cutters which usually had from ten to twenty rowers on a side  to each oar three men were apportionedone to row one to shield the rower and one to throw missiles and fight so that her crew numbered over sixty men  the forecastle and poop were very high and the appearance of height was still further increased by the figureheadthe neck and head of a swanand by a tail that rose from the sternpost over the steersmans head  both head and tail were richly gilt indeed the whole vessel was gaudily painted  all round the gunwales from stem to stern hung a row of shining red and white shields which resembled the scaly sides of some fabulous creature so that when the oars which gave it motion and not inaptly represented legs were dipped the vessel glided swiftly out of the cavern like some antediluvian monster issuing from its den and crawling away over the dark blue sea  a tall heavy mast rose from the centre of the ship its top was also gilded as well as the tips of the heavy yard attached to it  on this they hoisted a huge square sail which was composed of alternate stripes of red white and blue cloth  it need scarcely be said that erlings crew pulled with a will and that the waters of the fiord curled white upon the breast of the swan that night but the vikings boat had got too long a start of them so that when they doubled the ness and pulled towards the springs they discovered the enemy hurrying into their ships and preparing to push off from the land  now this did not fall in with erlings purpose at all for he was well aware that his little swan could do nothing against such an overwhelming force so he directed his course towards the mouth of a small stream beside which there was a spit of sand and just behind it a piece of level land of a few acres in extent covered with short grass  the river was deep at its mouth  about a hundred yards upstream it flowed out of a rugged pass in the mountains or cliffs which hemmed in the fiord  into this dark spot the northman rowed his vessel and landed with his men  the vikings were much surprised at this manoeuvre and seemed at a loss how to act for they immediately ceased their hurried embarkation and held a consultation  methinks they are mad said skarpedin on witnessing the movements of the swan  but we will give them occasion to make use of all the spirit that is in them  i had thought there were more men in the dale but if they be few they seem to be bold  they have wisely chosen their ground rocks however will not avail them against a host like ours  methinks some of us will be in valhalla tonight  saying this skarpedin drew up his men in order of battle on the little plain before referred to and advanced to the attack  erling on the other hand posted his men among the rocks in such a way that they could command the approach to the pass which their leader with a few picked men defended  on perceiving the intention of the danes to attack him erlings heart was glad because he now felt sure that to some extent he had them in his power  if they had on his first appearance taken to their ships they might have easily escaped or some of the smaller vessels might have pulled up the river and attacked his ship which in that case would have had to meet them on unequal terms but now that they were about to attack him on land he knew that he could keep them in play as long as he pleased and that if they should on the appearance of reinforcements again make for their ships he could effectively harass them and retard their embarkation  meditating on these things the young norseman stood in front of his men leaning on his battleaxe and calmly surveying the approaching foe until they were within a few yards of him  thorer he said at length raising his weapon slowly to his shoulder take thou the man with the black beard and leave yonder fellow with the red hair to me  thorer drew his sword and glanced along its bright blade without replying  indeed there was scarce time for reply  next moment the combatants uttered a loud shout and met with a dire crash  for some time the clash of steel the yells of maddened men the shrieks of the wounded and the wails of the dying resounded in horrible commotion among the echoing cliffs  the wisdom of erlings tactics soon became apparent  it was not until the onset was made and the battle fairly begun that the men whom he had placed among the rocks above the approach to the pass began to act  these now sent down such a shower of huge stones and masses of rock that many of the foe were killed and by degrees a gap was made so that those who were on the plain dared not advance to the succour of those who were fighting in the pass  seeing this erling uttered his warcry and collecting his men together acted on the offensive  wherever his battleaxe swung or thorers sword gleamed there men fell and others gave way till at last they were driven completely out of the pass and partly across the plain  erling took care however not to advance too far although skarpedin by retreating endeavoured to entice him to do so but drew off his men by sound of horn and returned to his old positionone man only having been killed and a few wounded  skarpedin now held a council of war with his chiefs and from the length of time they were about it erling was led to suspect that they did not intend to renew the attack at the same point or in the same manner  he therefore sent men to points of vantage on the cliffs to observe the more distant movements of the enemy while he remained to guard the pass and often gazed anxiously towards the ness round which he expected every minute to see sweeping the longships of ulf and his father    chapter six  evening in the hallthe scald tells of gundalfs wooingthe feast interrupted and the war clouds thicken  it is necessary now that we should turn backwards a little in our story to that point where erling left the hall at ulfstede to listen to the sad tale of swart  ulf and his friends not dreaming of the troubles that were hanging over them continued to enjoy their evening meal and listen to the songs and stories of the scald or to comment upon the doings of king harald haarfager and the prospects of good or evil to norway that were likely to result therefrom  at the point where we return to the hall ulf wore a very clouded brow as he sat with compressed lips beside his principal guest  he grasped the arm of his rude chair with his left hand while his right held a large and massive silver tankard  haldor on the other hand was all smiles and good humour  he appeared to have been attempting to soothe the spirit of his fiery neighbour  i tell thee ulf that i have as little desire to see king harald succeed in subduing all norway as thou hast but in this world wise men will act not according to what they wish so much as according to what is best  already the king has won over or conquered most of the small kings and it seems to me that the rest will have to follow whether they like it or no  common sense teaches submission where conquest cannot be  and does not patriotism teach that men may die said ulf sternly  aye when by warring with that end in view anything is to be gained for ones country but where the result would be first the embroiling of ones district in prolonged bloody and hopeless warfare and after that the depriving ones family of its head and of the kings favour patriotism says that to die would be folly not wisdom  tush man folk will learn to call thee haldor the mild  surely years are telling on thee  was there ever anything in this world worth having gained without a struggle  thou knowest ulf that i am not wont to be far from the front wherever or whenever a struggle is thought needful but i doubt the propriety of it in the present case  the subject however is open to discussion the question is whether it would be better for norway that the kings of horlingdal should submit to the conqueror for the sake of the general good or buckle on the sword in the hope of retrieving what is lost peace or warthat is the question  i say war cried ulf striking the board so violently with his clenched fist that the tankards and platters leaped and rang again  at this a murmur of applause ran round the benches of the friends and housemen  the young blades are ever ready to huzza over their drink at the thought of fighting but methinks it will not strengthen thy cause much friend ulf thus to frighten the women and spill the ale  ulf turned round with a momentary look of anger at this speech  the man who uttered it was a splendid specimen of a veteran warrior  his forehead was quite bald but from the sides and back of his head flowed a mass of luxuriant silky hair which was white as the driven snow  his features were eminently firm and masculine and there was a hearty goodhumoured expression about the mouth and a genial twinkle in his eyes especially in the wrinkled corners thereof that rendered the stout old man irresistibly attractive  his voice was particularly rich deep and mellow like that of a youth and although his bulky frame stooped a little from age there was enough of his youthful vigour left to render him a formidable foe as many a poor fellow had learned to his cost even in days but recently gone by  he was an uncle of ulf and on a visit to the stede at that time  the frown fled from ulfs brow as he looked in the old mans ruddy and jovial countenance  thanks guttorm said he seizing his tankard thanks for reminding me that grey hairs are beginning to sprinkle my beard come let us drink success to the right confusion to the wrong thou canst not refuse that haldor  nay said haldor laughing nor will i refuse to fight in thy cause and by thy side be it right or wrong when the thing decides for war  well said friend but come drink deeper  why i have taken thee down three pegs already said ulf glancing into haldors tankard  ho hilda fetch hither more ale lass and fillfill to the brim  the toast was drunk with right good will by allfrom ulf down to the youngest housecarle at the lowest end of the great hall  and now guttorm continued ulf turning to the bluff old warrior since thou hast shown thy readiness to rebuke let us see thy willingness to entertain  sing us a stave or tell us a saga kinsman as well thou knowest how being gifted with more than a fair share of the scalds craft  the applause with which this proposal was received by the guests and housecarles who crowded the hall from end to end proved that they were aware of guttorms gifts and would gladly hear him  like a sensible man he complied at once without affecting that air of false diffidence which is so common among modern songsters and storytellers  i will tell you said the old manhaving previously wet his lips at a silver tankard which was as bluff and genuine as himselfof king gundalfs wooing  many years have gone by since i followed him on viking cruise and gundalf himself has long been feasting in odins hall  i was a beardless youth when i joined him  king gundalf of orkedal was a goodly man stout and brisk and very strong  he could leap on his horse without touching stirrup with all his war gear on he could fight as well with his left hand as with his right and his battleaxe bit so deep that none who once felt its edge lived to tell of its weight  he might well be called a seaking for he seldom slept under a sooty roof timber  withal he was very affable to his men openhearted and an extremely handsome man  one summer he ordered us to get ready to go on viking cruise  when we were all aboun we set sail with five longships and about four hundred men and fared away to denmark where we forayed and fought a great battle with the inhabitants  king gundalf gained the victory plundered wasted and burned far and wide in the land and made enormous booty  he returned with this to orkedal  here he found his wife at the point of death and soon after she died  gundalf felt his loss so much that he had no pleasure in raumsdal after that  he therefore took to his ships and went again aplundering  we herried first in friesland next in saxland and then all the way to flanders so sings halfred the scald    gundalfs axe of shining steel   for the sly wolf left many a meal   the illshaped saxon corpses lay   heapd upthe witchwifes horses prey   she rides by night at pools of blood   where friesland men in daylight stood   her horses slake their thirst and fly   on to the field where flemings lie  note  ravens were the witchwifes horses  the old warrior half recited half sang these lines in a rich full voice and then paused a few seconds while a slight murmur arose from the earnest listeners around him  thereafter resumed guttorm we sailed to england and ravaged far and wide in the land  we sailed all the way north to northumberland where we plundered and thence to scotland where we marauded far and wide  then we went to the hebrides and fought some battles and after that south to man which we herried  we ravaged far around in ireland and steered thence to bretland which we laid waste with fire and swordalso the district of cumberland  then we went to valland the west coast of france from which we fared away for the south coast of england but missed it and made the scilly isles  after that we went to ireland again and came to a harbour into which we ranbut in a friendly way for we had as much plunder as our ships could carry  now while we were there a summons to a thing went through the country and when the thing was assembled a queen called gyda came to it  she was a sister of olaf quarram who was king of dublin  gyda was very wealthy and her husband had died that year  in the territory there was a man called alfin who was a great champion and singlecombat man  he had paid his addresses to gyda but she gave for answer that she would choose a husband for herself and on that account the thing was assembled that she might choose a husband  alfin came there dressed out in his best clothes and there were many welldressed men at the meeting  gundalf and some of his men had gone there also out of curiosity but we had on our badweather clothes and gundalf wore a coarse overgarment  we stood apart from the rest of the crowd gyda went round and looked at each to see if any appeared to her a suitable man  now when she came to where we were standing she passed most of us by with a glance but when she passed me i noticed that she turned half round and gave me another look which i have always held was a proof of her good judgment  however gyda passed on and when she came to king gundalf she stopped looked at him straight in the face and asked what sort of a man he was  he said i am called gundalf and am a stranger here  gyda replies wilt thou have me if i choose thee  he answered i will not say no to that then he asked her what her name was and her family and descent  i am called gyda said she and am daughter of the king of ireland and was married in this country to an earl who ruled over this district since his death i have ruled over it and many have courted me but none to whom i would choose to be married  she was a young and handsome woman  they afterwards talked over the matter together and agreed and so gundalf and gyda were betrothed  alfin was very ill pleased with this  it was the custom there as it is sometimes here if two strove for anything to settle the matter by holmgang  note or single combat so called because the combatants in norway went to a holm or uninhabited isle to fight and now alfin challenged gundalf to fight about this business  the time and place of combat were settled and it was fixed that each should have twelve men i was one of the twelve on our side  when we met gundalf told us to do exactly as we saw him do  he had a large axe and went in advance of us and when alfin made a desperate cut at him with his sword he hewed away the sword out of his hand and with the next blow hit alfin on the crown with the flat of his axe and felled him  we all met next moment and each man did his best but it was hard work for the irishmen fought well and two of them cut down two of our men but one of these i knocked down and gundalf felled the other  then we bound them all fast and carried them to gundalfs lodging  but gundalf did not wish to take alfins life  he ordered him to quit the country and never again to appear in it and he took all his property  in this way gundalf got gyda in marriage and he lived sometimes in england and sometimes in ireland  thikskul the scald says in regard to this    king gundalf wood queen gyda fair   with whom no woman could compare   and won her too with all her lands   by force of looks and might of hands   from irelands green and lovely isle   he carried off the queen in style   he made proud alfins weapon dull   and flattened down his stupid skull   this did the bold king gundalf do   when he went oer the sea to woo  the wholesale robbery and murder which was thus related by the old norse viking appeared quite a natural and proper state of things in the eyes of all save two of those assembled in the hall and the saga was consequently concluded amid resounding applause  it is to be presumed that never having seen or heard of any other course of life and having always been taught that such doings were quite in accordance with the laws of the land the consciences of the northmen did not trouble them at all events while we do not for a moment pretend to justify their doings we think it right to point out that there must necessarily have been a wide difference between their spirits and feelings and the spirits and feelings of modern pirates who know that they are deliberately setting at defiance the laws of both god and man  it has been said there were two in the hall at ulfstede who did not sympathise with the tale of the old warrior  the reader will scarce require to be told that one of these was hilda the sunbeam  the other was christian the hermit  the old man although an occasional visitor at the stede never made his appearance at mealtimes much less at the nightly revels which were held there but on that day he had arrived with important news just as guttorm began his story and would have unceremoniously interrupted it had not one of the young housecarles who did not wish to lose the treat detained him forcibly at the lower end of the hall until it was ended  the moment he was released the hermit advanced hastily and told ulf that from the door of his hut on the cliff he had observed bands of men hastening in all directions down the dale  thy news old man is no news said ulf the token for a thing has been sent out and it is natural that the bonders should obey the summons  we expect them  but come it is not often thou favourest us with thy company  sit down by me and take a horn of mead  the hermit shook his head  i never taste strong liquor  its tendency is to make wise men foolish he said  nay then thou wilt not refuse to eat  here hilda fetch thy friend a platter  i thank thee but having already supped i need no more food  i came but to bring what i deemed news  thou art churlish old man exclaimed ulf angrily sit down and drink else  come come interrupted haldor laying his hand on ulfs arm let the old man be he seems to think that he has something worth hearing to tell of let him have his say out in peace  go on said ulf gruffly  was the token sent out a baton or a split arrow asked the hermit  a baton said ulf  then why rejoined the other do men come to a peaceful thing with all their war gear on  what say ye are they armed exclaimed ulf starting up  this must be looked to  ho my carles all to arms  at that moment there was a bustle at the lower end of the hall and alric was seen forcing his way towards ulfs high seat  father he said eagerly addressing haldor short is the hour for acting and long the hour for feasting  haldor cast his eyes upon his son and said  what now is in the way  the danes said alric are on the fiordmore than six hundred men skarpedin leads them  one of them pitched me into the sea but i marked his neck to keep myself in his memory  they have plundered and burnt at the springs and erling has gone away to attack them all by himself with only sixty housecarles  you will have to be quick father  quick truly said haldor with a grim smile as he drew tight the buckle of his swordbelt  aye said ulf with six hundred danes on the fiord and armed men descending the vale methinks  oh  i can explain that cried alric with an arch smile erling made me change the baton for the split arrow when i was sent round with the token  that is good luck said haldor while ulfs brow cleared a little as he busked himself for the fight we shall need all our force  aye and all our time too said guttorm stoutheart as he put on his armour with the cheerful air of a man who dons his wedding dress come my merry men all  lucky it is that my longships are at hand just now ready loaded with stones    o a gallant sight it is to me   the warships darting oer the sea   a pleasant sound it is to hear   the war trump ringing loud and clear  ulf and his friends and housecarles were soon ready to embark for in those days the norseman kept his weapons ready to his hands being accustomed to sudden assaults and frequent alarms  they streamed out of the hall and while some collected stones to be used as missiles others ran down to the shore to launch the ships  meanwhile ulf haldor guttorm and other chief men held a rapid consultation as they stood and watched the assembling of the men of the district  it was evident that the split arrow had done its duty  from the grassy mound on which they stood could be seen on the one hand the dark recesses of horlingdal which were lost in the mists of distance among the glaciers on the fells and on the other hand the blue fiord with branching inlets and numerous holms while the skerries of the coast filled up the backgroundlooming faint and far off on the distant sea in whatever direction the eye was turned armed men were seen  from every distant gorge and valley on the fells they issued singly or in twos and threes  as they descended the dale they formed into groups and larger bands and when they gained the more level grounds around haldorstede the heavy tread of their hastening footsteps could be distinctly heard while the sunfor although near midnight now it was still above the horizonflashed from hundreds of javelins spears swords and bills glittered on steel headpieces and the rims of shields or trickled fitfully on suits of scale armour and shirts of ring mail  on the fiord boats came shooting forth from every inlet or creek making their appearance from the base of precipitous cliffs or darkmouthed caves as if the very mountains were bringing forth warriors to aid in repelling the foe  these were more sombre than those on the fells because the sun had set to them by reason of the towering hills and the fiord was shrouded in deepest gloom  but all in the approaching hoston water and landwere armed from head to foot and all converged towards ulfstede  when they were all assembled they numbered five hundred fighting men and a stouter or more valiant band never went forth to war  six longships were sufficient to embark them  three of these were of the largest sizehaving thirty oars on each side and carrying a hundred men  one of them belonged to haldor one to ulf and onebesides several smaller shipsto guttorm who chanced to be on viking cruise at the time he had turned aside to visit his kinsman  the warlike old man could scarce conceal his satisfaction at his unexpected good fortune in being so opportunely at hand when hard blows were likely to be going two of the other ships were cutters similar to erlings swan and carrying sixty men each and one was a little larger holding about eighty men  it belonged to glumm the gruff whose gruffness however had abated considerably now that there was a prospect of what we moderns would call letting the steam off in a vigorous manner  soon the oars were dipped in the fiord and the sails were set for a light favourable wind was blowing  in a short time the fleet rounded the ness and came in sight of the ground where erling and skarpedin were preparing to renew the combat    chapter seven  the tale returns to the springsdescribes a great land fight and tells of a peculiar style of extending mercy to the vanquished  in a previous chapter we left skarpedin discussing with his chiefs the best mode of attacking the small band of his opponents in the pass of the springs  they had just come to a decision and were about to act on it when they suddenly beheld six warships sweeping round the ness  now will we have to change our plans said skarpedin  thorvold agreed with this and counselled getting on board their ships and meeting the enemy on the water but the other objected because he knew that while his men were in the act of embarking erling would sally forth and kill many of them before they could get away  methinks said he i will take forty of my best men and try to entice that fox out of his hole before he has time to see the ships  grief only will come of that says thorvold  skarpedin did not reply but choosing forty of his stoutest carles he went to the pass and defied erling to come out and fight  now here am i erling with forty men  wilt thou come forth or is thy title of bold ill bestowed seeing thou hast more men than i  ill should i deserve the title replies erling if i were to meet thee with superior force  with that he chose thirty men and running down to the plain gave the assault so fiercely that men fell fast on every side and the danes gave back a little  when they saw this and that erling and thorer hewed men down wherever they went the danes made a shield circle round skarpedin as was the custom when kings went into battle because they knew that if he fell there would be no one so worthy to guide them in the fight with the approaching longships  thus they retreated fighting  when erling and his men had gone far enough they returned to the pass and cheered loudly as they went both because of the joy of victory and because they saw the warships of their friends coming into the bay  king haldor and his companions at once ran their ships on the beach near the mouth of the river and landing drew them up intending to fight on shore  skarpedin did not try to prevent this for he was a bold man and thought that with so large a force he could well manage to beat the northmen if they would fight on level ground  he therefore drew up his men in order of battle at one end of the plain and haldor the fierce to whom was assigned the chief command drew up the northmen at the other end  erling joined them with his band and then it was seen that the two armies were not equalthat of the northmen being a little smaller than the other  then haldor said let us draw up in a long line that they may not turn our flanks as they have most men  this was done and haldor advanced into the plain and set up his banner the danes in like manner advanced and planted their banner and both armies rushed to the attack which was very sharp and bloody  wherever the battle raged most fiercely there king haldor and erling were seen for they were taller by half a head than most other men  being clothed alike in almost every respect they looked more like brothers than father and son  each wore a gilt helmet and carried a long shield the centre of which was painted white but round the edge was a rim of burnished steel  each had a sword by his side and carried a javelin to throw but both depended chiefly on their favourite weapon the battleaxe for being unusually strong they knew that few men could withstand the weight of a blow from that  the defensive armour of father and son was also the samea shirt of leather sewed all over with small steel rings  their legs were clothed in armour of the same kind and a mantle of cloth hung from the shoulders of each  most of the chief men on both sides were armed in a similar way though not quite so richly and with various modifications for instance the helmet of thorvold was of plain steel and for ornament had the tail of the ptarmigan as its crest  skarpedins on the other hand was quite plain but partly gilded his armour was of pieces of steel like fish scales sewed on a leathern shirt and over his shoulders he wore as a mantle the skin of a wolf  his chief weapon was a billa sort of hook or short scythe fixed to a pole and it was very deadly in his hands most of the carles and thralls were content to wear thick shirts of wolf and other skins which were found to offer good resistance to a swordcut and some of them had portions of armour of various kinds their arms were spears bows arrows with stone heads javelins swords bills and battleaxes and shields  when both lines met there was a hard fight  the combatants first threw their spears and javelins and then drew their swords and went at each other in the greatest fury  in the centre haldor and erling went together in advance of their banner cutting down on both sides of them old guttorm stoutheart went in advance of the right wing also hewing down right and left  with him went kettle flatnose for that ambitious thrall could not be made to remember his position and was always putting himself in front of his betters in war yet it is due to him to say that he kept modestly in the background in time of peace  to these was opposed thorvold with many of the stoutest men among the danes  now old guttorm and kettle pressed on so hard that they were almost separated from their men and while guttorm was engaged with a very tall and strong man whom he had wounded severely more than once another stout fellow came between him and kettle and made a cut at him with his sword  guttorm did not observe him and it seemed as if the old stoutheart should get his deathwound there but the thrall chanced to see what was going on  he fought with a sort of hook like a reapinghook fixed at the end of a spear handle with the cutting edge inside  the men of horlingdal used to laugh at kettle because of his fondness for this weapon which was one of his own contriving but when they did so he was wont to reply that it was better than most other weapons because it could not only make his friends laugh but his enemies cry  with this hook the thrall made a quick blow at the dane the point of it went down through his helmet into his brain and that was his deathblow  well done kettle cried old guttorm who had just cleft the skull of his opponent with his sword  at this thorvold ran forward and said  well done it may be but well had it been for the doer had it not been done  come on thou flatnose  now thou must be a remarkably clever man retorted kettle with much of that rich tone of voice which many centuries later came to be known as the irish brogue for it is plain ye know my name without being told it  so saying with a sudden quick movement he got his hook round thorvolds neck  that is an ugly grip said thorvold making a fierce cut at the haft with his sword but kettle pulled the hook to him and with it came the head and that was thorvolds end  while this was going on at the right wing the left wing was led by ulf of romsdal and glumm the gruff but ulfs men were not so good as haldors men for he was not so wise a man as haldor and did not manage his house so well  it was a common saying among the people of horlingdal that haldor had under him the most valiant men in norwayand as the master was so were the men  haldor never went to sea with less than a fullymanned ship of thirty benches of rowers and had other large vessels and men to man them as well  one of his ships had thirtytwo benches of rowers and could carry at least two hundred men  he had always at home on his farm thirty slaves or thralls besides other serving people and about two hundred housecarles  he used to give his thralls a certain days work but after it was done he gave them leave and leisure to work in the twilight and at night for themselves  he gave them arable land to sow corn in and let them apply their crops to their own use  he fixed a certain quantity of work by the doing of which his slaves might work themselves free and this put so much heart into them that many of them worked themselves free in one year and all who had any luck or pluck could work themselves free in three years  ulf did this too but he was not so wise nor yet so kind in his way of doing it  with the money thus procured haldor bought other slaves  some of his freed people he taught to work in the herring fishery to others he taught some handicraft in short he helped all of them to prosperity so that many of the best of them remained fast by their old master although free to take service where they chose  thus it was that his men were better than those of his neighbour  ulfs men were nevertheless good stout fellows and they fought valiantly but it so happened that the wing of the enemy to which they were opposed was commanded by skarpedin of whom it was said that he was equal to any six men  in spite therefore of the courage and the strength of ulf and glumm the northmen in that part of the field began slowly to give back  ulf and glumm were so maddened at this that they called their men cowards and resolved to go forward till they should fall  uttering their warcry they made a desperate charge hewing down men like stalks of corn but although this caused the danes to give way a little they could not advance not being well backed but stood fighting and merely kept their ground  now it had chanced shortly before this that haldor stayed his hand and drew back with erling  they went out from the front of the fight and observed the left wing giving way  come let us aid them cried haldor  saying this he ran to the left wing with erling by his side  they two uttered a warcry that rose high above the din of battle like a roar of thunder and rushing to the front fell upon the foe  their gilt helmets rose above the crowd and their ponderous axes went swinging round their heads continually crashing down on the skulls of the danes with four such men as haldor erling ulf and glumm in front the left wing soon regained its lost ground and drove back the danes  nothing could withstand the shock  skarpedin saw what had occurred and immediately hastened to the spot where haldor stood sweeping down all who stood in his way  i have been searching for thee erling he cried going up to haldor and launching a javelin  haldor caught it on his shield which it pierced through but did him no hurt  mistaken thou art but thou hast found me now cried erling thrusting his father aside and leaping upon the dane  skarpedin changed his bill to his left hand drew his sword and made such a blow at his adversary that the point cut right through his shield  with a quick turn of the shield erling broke the sword short off at the hilt  skarpedin seized his bill and thrust so fiercely that it also went through the shield and stuck fast  erling forced the lower end or point of his shield down into the earth and so held it fast dropped his axe drew his sword and made it flash so quick round his head that no one could see the blade  it fell upon skarpedins neck and gave him a grievous wound cutting right through his armour and deep into his shoulder blade  a great cry arose at this  the danes made a rush towards their chief and succeeded in dragging him out of the fight  they put him on his shield and bore him off to his ship which was launched immediately this was the turningpoint in the day  everywhere the danes fled to their ships pursued by the victors  some managed to launch their vessels others were not so fortunate and many fell fighting while a few were taken prisoners  foreseeing that this would be the result haldor and erling called off their men hastened on board their ships and gave chase while the rest of the force looked after the prisoners and the booty and dressed their own and their comrades wounds  a bloody day this said ulf to guttorm as the latter came up wiping the blade of his sword  i have seen worse observed the old warrior carefully returning his weapon to its scabbard  the danes will long remember it observed glumm  the ravens will have a good feast tonight  and odins halls a few more tenants said guttorm    the danes came here all filled with greed   and left their flesh the crows to feed  but what is to be done with these he added pointing to the prisoners about twenty of whom were seated on a log with their feet tied together by a long rope while their hands were loose  kill them i suppose said ulf  there were thirty men seated there and although they heard the words they did not show by a single glance that they feared to meet their doom  just then swart of the springs came up  he had a great axe in his hands and was very furious  thou hast killed and burned my wife children and homestede he said fiercely addressing the prisoner who sat at the end of the log but thou shalt never return to denmark to tell it  he cut at him with the axe as he spoke and the man fell dead  one after another swart killed them  there was one who looked up and said  i will stick this fish bone that i have in my hand into the earth if it be so that i know anything after my head is cut off  his head was immediately cut off but the fish bone fell from his hand  beside him there sat a very handsome young man with long hair who twisted his hair over his head stretched out his neck and said dont make my hair bloody  a man took the hair in his hands and held it fast  then swart hewed with his axe but the dane twitched his head back so strongly that he who was holding his hair fell forward the axe cut off both his hands and stuck fast in the earth  who is that handsome man asked ulf  the man replied with look of scorn i am einar the son of king thorkel of denmark and know thou for a certainty that many shall fall to avenge my death  ulf said art thou certainly thorkels son  wilt thou now take thy life and peace  that depends replied the dane upon who it is that offers it  he offers who has the power to give itulf of romsdal  i will take it says he from ulfs hands  upon that the rope was loosed from his feet but swart whose vengeance was still unsatisfied exclaimed  although thou shouldst give all these men life and peace king ulf yet will i not suffer einar to depart from this place with life  so saying he ran at him with uplifted axe but one of the viking prisoners threw himself before swarts feet so that he tumbled over him and the axe fell at the feet of a viking named gills  gills caught the axe and gave swart his deathwound  then said ulf gills wilt thou accept life  that will i said he if thou wilt give it to all of us  loose them from the rope said ulf  this was done and the men were set free  eighteen of the danish vikings were killed and twelve got their lives upon that occasion    chapter eight  tells of discussions and exciting deeds at ulfstede  while the fight at the springs which we have just described was going on christian the hermit sat in the hall at ulfstede conversing with hilda and dame astrid and some of the other women  all the fighting men of the place had been taken awayonly one or two old men and alric were left behindfor ulf in his impetuosity had forgotten to leave a guard at home  i hope it will fare well with our men at the springs said hilda looking up with an anxious expression from the mantle with which her nimble fingers were busy  i hope so too said christian though i would rather that there had been no occasion to fight  no occasion to fight exclaimed alric who was dressing the feathers on an arrow which he had made to replace the one he lost in shooting at the daneand the losing of which by the way he was particularly careful to bring to remembrance as often as opportunity offered sometimes whether opportunity offered or not  no occasion to fight what would be the use of weapons if there were no fighting  where should we get our plunder if there were no fighting and our slaves why what would northmen find to do if there were no fighting  the hermit almost laughed at the impetuosity of the boy as he replied  it would take a wiser head than mine lad to answer all these questions more particularly to answer them to thy satisfaction notwithstanding it remains true that peace is better than war  that may be so said dame astrid but it seems to me that war is necessary and what is necessary must be right  i agree with that said ada with a toss of her pretty headfor it would seem that that method of expressing contempt for an adversarys opinion was known to womankind at least a thousand years ago if not longer  but thou dost not fight christian what has war done to thee that thou shouldst object to it so  what has war done for me exclaimed the old man springing up with sudden excitement and clasping his lean hands tight together has it not done all that it could do  woman it has robbed me of all that makes life sweet and left me only what i did not want  it has robbed me of wife and children and left a burdened life  yet noi sin in speaking thus  life was left because there was something worth living for something still to be done the truth of god to be proclaimed the good of man to be compassed  but sometimes i forget this when the past flashes upon me and i forget that it is my duty as well as my joy to say the lord gave and the lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the lord  the old man sat down again and leaned his brow on his hand  the women although sympathetic were puzzled by some of his remarks and therefore sat in silence for a little but presently the volatile ada looked up and said  what thinkest thou hilda in regard to war  i know not what to think replied hilda  nay then thy spirit must be flying from thee for thou wert not wont to be without an opinion on most things  why even erlings sister ingeborg has made up her mind about war i doubt not though she is too modest to express it  now this was a sly hit at ingeborg who was sitting by for she was well known to have a shrewish temper and to be selfwilled and opinionated in so much that most men kept out of her way  she was very unlike erling or her father and mother or her little sisters in this respect  i can express my opinion well enough when i have a mind said ingeborg sharply and as to war it stands to reason that a seakings daughter must approve of a seakings business  why the beautiful cloths and gold and jewels that are so plentiful in the dale would never have delighted our eyes if our men had not gone on viking cruise and fallen in with those rich traders from the far south lands  besides war makes our men brisk and handsome  aye exclaimed alric laughing especially when they get their noses cut off and their cheeks gashed  sometimes it takes them from us altogether observed a poor woman of the household the widow of a man who had been slain on a viking cruise after having had his eyes put out and being otherwise cruelly treated  that is the other side of the question said astrid  of course everything has two sides  we cannot change the plans of the gods sunshine and rain heat and cold come as they are sent  we must accept them as they are sent  that is true said christian and thou sayest wisely that we must accept things as they are sent but can it be said that war is sent to us when we rush into it of our own accord  defensive warfare truly is rightelse would this world be left in the sole possession of the wicked but aggressive warfare is not right  to go on viking cruise and take by force that which is not our own is sinful  there is a good way to prove the truth of these things  let me ask the question astrid how would thy husband like to have thee and all his property taken from him and ulfstede burned about his ears  methinks he would like it ill  then why should he do that to others which he would not like done to himself  these are strange words said astrid in surprise i know not that i have ever heard the like before  truly no said christian because the word of god has not yet been sounded in the dale  thou saidst just now that we cannot change the plans of the gods that would be true if ye had said the plans of god for there is but one god and his ways are unchangeable  but what if god had revealed some of his plans to man and told him that this revelation was sufficient to guide him in his walk through this life and to prepare him for the next  then would i think it mans wisdom to follow that guide carefully replied astrid  such plans do exist such a revelation has been made said the hermit and the name that stands on the forefront of it is jesus christ  as he spoke the hermit drew from his bosom a scroll of parchment which he unrolled slowly  this he said was a copy made by himself of part of the gospel  he had meant he said to have copied the whole of it but war had put an end to his labours at the same time that it deprived him of his earthly joys and drove him from his native land to be a wanderer on the earth  but if he continued the lord permits me to preach his gospel of truth and love and peace in norway i shall count the sufferings of this present time as nothing compared with the glory yet to be revealed  christian said astrid who appeared to have been struck by some reminiscence methinks i have heard ulf talk of a religion which the men of the south profess  he saw something of it when he went on viking cruise to the great fiord that runs far into the land the mediterranean and if my memory is faithful he said that they called themselves by a name that sounds marvellously like thine own  i suppose ulf must have met with christians after whom i call myself seeing that my own name is of consequence to no one said the hermit what said he about them  that they were a bad set replied astridmen who professed love to their fellows but were guilty of great cruelty to all who did not believe their faith  all who call themselves christians deserve not the name astrid some are hypocrites and deceivers others are foolish and easily deceived  they all make the same profession i am told said dame astrid  the men of norway are warriors returned the hermit and all profess couragenay when they stand in the ranks and go forth to war they all show the same stern face and front so that one could not know but that all were brave yet are they not all courageous as thou knowest full well  some it may be very few but some are cowards at heart and it only requires the test of the fight to prove them  so is it with professing christians  i would gladly tell the story of jesus if ye will hear me dame astrid  the matrons curiosity was excited so she expressed her willingness to listen and the hermit reading passages from his manuscript copy of the new testament and commenting thereon unfolded the old old story of gods wonderful love to man in jesus christ  while he was yet in the midst of his discourse the door of the hall was burst violently open and one of the servinggirls rushing in exclaimed that the danes were approaching from the fiord  the danes referred to composed a small party who had been sent off in a cutter by skarpedin redbeard to survey the coast beyond horlingdal fiord as he had intended after herrying that district to plunder still farther north  this party in returning had witnessed unseen the departure of the fleet of northmen  thinking it probable that the place might have been left with few protectors they waited until they deemed it safe to send out scouts and on their report being favourable they landed to make an attack on the nearest village or farm  on hearing the news all was uproar in ulfstede  the women rushed about in a distracted state imploring the few helpless old men about the place to arm and defend them  to do these veteran warriors justice they did their best  they put the armour that was brought to them on their palsied limbs but shook their heads sadly for they felt that although they might die in defence of the household they could not save it  meanwhile christian and alric proved themselves equal to the occasion the former although advanced in years retained much of his strength and energy and the latter still inflated with the remembrance of the fact that he had actually drawn blood from a fullgrown bearded dane and deeply impressed with the idea that he was the only ablebodied warrior in ulfstede at this crisis resolved to seize the opportunity and prove to the whole world that his boasting was at all events not empty  the first thing to be done is to bar the doors he cried starting up on hearing the servinggirls report  thou knowest how to do it christian run to the south door i will bar the north  the hermit smiled at the lads energy but he was too well aware of the importance of speed to waste time in talking  he dropped his outer garment and ran to the south door which was very solid  closing it and fastening the ponderous wooden bar which stretched diagonally across it he turned and ran to the chamber in which the weapons were kept  on the way he was arrested by a cry from alric  here here quick christian else we are lost  the hermit sprang to the north door with the agility of a youth  he was just in time  poor alric despite the strength of his bold heart and will had not strength of muscle enough to close the door which had somehow got jammed  through the open doorway christian could see a band of danish vikings running towards the house at full speed  he flung the door forward with a crash and drew the bar across just as the vikings ran against it  open open without delay cried a voice outside else will we tear out the heart of every man and child under this roof  we will not open we will defend ourselves to the last our trust is in god replied christian  and as to tearing out our hearts cried alric feeling emboldened now that the stout door stood between him and his foes if ye do not make off as fast as ye came we will punch out your eyes and roast your livers  the reply to this was a shower of blows on the door so heavy that the whole building shook beneath them and alric almost wished that his boastful threat had been left unsaid  he recollected at that moment however that there was a hole under the eaves of the roof just above the door  it had been constructed for the purpose of preventing attacks of this kind  the boy seized his bow and arrows and dashed up the ladder that led to the loft above the hall  on it he found one of the old retainers of the stede struggling up with a weighty iron pot from which issued clouds of steam  let me pass old ivor what hast thou there  boiling water to warm them gasped ivor i knew we should want it ere long  finn is gone to the loft above the south door with another pot  alric did not wait to hear the end of this answer but pushing past the old man hastened to the trapdoor under the eaves and opened it  he found however that he could not use his bow in the constrained position necessary to enable him to shoot through the hole  in desperation he seized a barrel that chanced to be at hand and overturned its contents on the heads of the foe  it happened to contain ryeflour and the result was that two of the assailants were nearly blinded while two others who stood beside them burst into a loud laugh and seizing the battleaxes which the others had been using continued their efforts to drive in the door  by this time old ivor had joined alric  he set down the pot of boiling water by the side of the hole and at once emptied its contents on the heads of the vikings who uttered a terrific yell and leaped backward as the scalding water flowed over their heads and shoulders  a similar cry from the other door of the house told that the defence there had been equally successful almost at the same moment alric discovered a small slit in the roof through which he could observe the enemy  he quickly sent through it an arrow which fixed itself in the left shoulder of one of the men  this had the effect of inducing the attacking party to draw off for the purpose of consultation  the breathingtime thus afforded to the assailed was used in strengthening their defences and holding a hurried council of war piling several heavy pieces of furniture against the doors and directing the women to make additions to these christian drew alric into the hall where the ancient retainers were already assembled  it will cost them a long time and much labour to drive in the doors defended as they are said the hermit  they will not waste time nor labour upon them said ivor shaking his hoary head  what think ye finn  the women who had crowded round the men looked anxiously at finn who was a man of immense bulk and had been noted for strength in his younger days but who was now bent almost double with age  fire will do the work quicker than the battleaxe answered finn with grim smile which did not improve the expression of a countenance already disfigured by the scars of a hundred fights and by the absence of an eyelong ago gouged out and left to feed the ravens of a foreign shore if this had only come to pass a dozen years ago he added while a gleam of light illumined the sound eye i might have gone off to valhalla with a straight hack and some credit  but mayhap a good onset will straighten it yet who knowsand i do feel as if i had strength left to send at least one foe out of the world before me  ivor the old nodded  yes he said i think they will burn us out  i had already feared this said christian with a look of perplexity what wouldst thou recommend should be done ivor  nothing more can be done than to kill as many as possible before we die  i pray the lord to help us in our extremity said christian but i believe it to be his will to help those who are willing to help themselves depending upon him for strength courage and victory  it may be that ulf and his men will soon return from the springs so that if we could only hold out for a short time all might be well  have ye nothing to suggest  as to ulf and the men returning from the springs said finn there is small chance of that before morning  with regard to holding out i know of nothing that will cause fire to burn slow once it is well kindled an hour hence and ulfstede will be in ashes as that sound surely tells  he referred to a crashing blow which occurred just then at the north door  nearly all present knew full well that it was the first bundle of a pile of faggots with which the assailants meant to set the house on fire  had this arm retained but a little of the strength it once knew continued finn bitterly as he stretched out the huge but withered limb things had not come to this pass so quickly  i remember the day now forty years ago when on the roof of this very house i stood alone with my bow and kept thirty men at bay for two full hours  but i could not now draw an arrow of alrics little bow to its head to save the lives of all present  but i can do it cried alric starting forward suddenly and if thou wilt show me the window in the roof i will  brave boy said old ivor with a kindly smile as he laid his hand on alrics head thy heart is large and it is sad that one so full of promise should come to such an end but it needs not that ye should fall before thy time  these shafts may do against the crows but they would avail nothing against men in mail  is there not a warriors bow in the house asked christian quickly  there is replied ivor but who will use it  i will  thou exclaimed ivor with a slight touch of contempt in his tone  hold thy peace ivor said hilda quickly  this man has saved my life once as thou knowest and well assured am i that what he undertakes to do he will accomplish  now thanks to thee hilda for that said the hermit heartily not that i boast of being sure to accomplish what i undertake yet i never offer to attempt what i have not some reasonable hope of being able to do  but it is not strange that this old warrior should doubt of the courage or capacity of one who preaches the gospel of peace nevertheless when i was a youth i fought in the army of the great thorfin and was somewhat expert in the use of the bow  it is possible that some of my ancient skill may remain and i am willing to use it in a good cause  i pray thee therefore let us not waste more time in useless talk but fetch me a bow and quiver and show me the window in the roof  ivor went at once to the place where the armour was kept and brought out the desired weapons which he placed in the hands of the hermit and watched his mode of handling them with some curiosity  christian unconscious of the look strung the bow and examined one of the arrows with the air of a man who was thoroughly accustomed to such weapons ivor regarded him with increased respect as he conducted him to the loft and opened the window  the hermit at once stepped out and was instantly observed by the danes who of course seized the opportunity and let fly several arrows at him which grazed him or stuck quivering in the roof close to the spot where he stood  he was not slow to reply  one of the vikings who was approaching the house at the moment with a bundle of faggots on his back received a shaft in his shoulder which caused him to drop his bundle and fly to the woods where he took shelter behind a tree almost before that shaft had reached its mark another was on the string and in another instant transfixed the biceps muscle of the right arm of one of the vikings who was preparing to discharge an arrow  he also sought shelter behind a tree and called to a comrade to come and assist him to extract the shaft  mine ancient skill said the hermit in an undertone as if the remark were made half to himself and half to ivor whose head appeared at the window and whose old countenance was wrinkled with a grin of delight at this unexpected display of prowess mine ancient skill it would seem has not deserted me for which i am thankful for it is an awful thing ivor more awful than thou thinkest to send a human being into eternity unforgiven  i am glad therefore to be able thus to render our assailants unfit for war without taking away their livesha that was better aimed than usual he added as an arrow passed through his jerkin and stuck deep into the roof  the man shoots well he would soon end the fight if i did notstopthat  at the secondlast word the hermit bent his bow at the last which was uttered with emphasis he let the arrow fly and sent it through the left hand of his adversary who instantly dropped his bow  at the same moment it seemed as though the whole band of vikings had become suddenly convinced that they stood exposed to the shafts of a man who could use them with unerring certainty for they turned with one consent and fled into the woodseach man seeking shelter behind the nearest tree  here they called to one another to stand forth and shoot at the hermit  go thou arne cried the leader thine aim is true  surely one old man is not to keep us all at bay  if my left hand were unscathed i would not trouble thee to do it thou knowest  i have no desire to get an arrow in mine eye cried arne see i did but show the tip of my right elbow just now and the skin of it is cut up as though the crows had pecked it  in the excess of his wrath arne extended his clenched fist and shook it at the hermit who instantly transfixed it with an arrow causing the foolish man to howl with pain and passion  i have always held and acted on the opinion said christian to ivor who was now joined by his comrade finn that whatever is worth doing at all is worth doing well  thou seest he continued wiping his brow with the sleeve of his coat it is only by being expert in the use of this weapon that i have succeeded in driving bark the danes without the loss of life  there is indeed a passage in the book of god which i hope to be spared to tell thee more about in time to come where this principle of thoroughness in all things is implied if not absolutely taughtnamely whatever thy hand findeth to do do it with thy might  a just maxim said finn shading his one eye with his hands and gazing earnestly into the woods and if acted upon makes a man fit for every duty that falls upon him but it seems to me that while we are talking here there is some movement going on  see christian since that is thy name they are retiring in haste and exposing themselves  now i pray thee as thine eye is so sure do drop a shaft on the nape of yonder fellows neck that we may have something to show of this nights work  i told thee finn that my desire is to avoid taking life  humph said finn testily whatever thy desire may be matters little now for he is beyond range  hark  that shout accounts for the flight of the danes  ulf must have returned  as he spoke a loud cry as if of men in conflict arose from the fiord immediately after the vikings who had not already taken to flight left their places of shelter and dashed into the underwood  the hermit let them go without moving a hand but alric who was actuated by no merciful principles suddenly opened the north door sprang out and let fly an arrow with so true an aim that it struck one of the danes between the shoulders  fortunately for him the dane had in accordance with the usual custom of the time hung his shield on his back when he took to flight so that the shaft rebounded from it and fell harmless to the ground  by this time the hermit had descended from the roof  running out he seized alric and dragging him into the house reclosed the door  ye know not foolish boy whether or not this is ulf whom we hear  as he spoke the tramp of approaching footsteps and the voices of excited men were heard outside  the door flew open and ulf erling and haldor with a number of the housecarles strode into the hall and flung down their arms  not much too soon it would seem said ulf with a look of stern joy  thou wouldst have been altogether too late ulf said astrid had not christian been here to save us  how so exclaimed ulf turning with an enquiring look to the hermit hast turned warrior after all thy preaching of peace  but thou art pale  ho fetch a horn of ale here fighting has disagreed with thy stomach old man  i think said christian pressing his hand to his side that one of these arrows must have  he paused suddenly and would have fallen to the ground had not erling caught him  letting him gently down at full length our hero raised his head on his knee while hilda came forward with a horn of ale  as she kneeled by the old mans side she glanced anxiously at her lovers face which was covered with blood and dust and presented anything but an attractive appearance  hast thou been wounded whispered hilda  no not wounded muttered erling but  not wounded exclaimed ulf who overheard the words but misunderstood their application not wounded  why erling where have thy wits gone the man is wellnigh dead from loss of blood  see his jerkin is soaking  bring hither bandages come let me see the wound  if the old man has indeed saved ulfstede this day eternal disgrace would be our due did we let his life slip out under our rooftree for want of proper care  and harkee get ready all the dressings thou hast for wounded men enough will be here ere long and let the boards be spread with the best of meat and ale for we have gone through hard work today and there is harder yet in store for us i trow  thus admonished the women went to make preparation for the reception of the wounded and the entertainment of those who had been more fortunate in the recent conflict  meanwhile the hermit was conveyed to ulfs own bed and his wound which proved to be less serious than had been feared was carefully dressed by hilda to whom erling in the most attentive and disinterested manner acted the part of assistantsurgeon    chapter nine  shows how the ancient seakings transacted national business  scant was the time allowed the men of horlingdal for refreshment and rest after the battle of the springs for the assembling of thingsmen armed to the teeth as well as the news that king harald threatened a descent on them rendered it necessary that a district thing or council should be held without delay  accordingly after brief repose haldor the fierce who had returned with erling to his own house up the dale arose and ordered the horn to be sounded for a thing  several hundreds of men had by that time assembled and when they all came together they formed an imposing band of warriors whom any wise king would have deemed it advisable to hold converse with if possible on friendly terms  when the thing was seated haldor rose and amid profound silence said  men of horlingdal king harald haarfager has sent round the messagetoken for a thing to be held at the springs  the token sent was one of peace  the token of war was sent round instead as ye know whether this was wise or not does not much concern us now as ye have seen with your own eyes that there was good fortune in the change for we knew not when the token was forwarded of the urgent need that should arise at the springs for our weapons  but now that the danes have been sent homeexcepting that goodly number who have gone to valhallas halls to keep company with odin and departed warriorsit seems to me that we should meet the king in the manner which he desires until he shall give us occasion to assume arms in defence of our laws and i would here remind you that harald is our rightful king udalborn to the kingdom of norway his title having been stated and proved at all the district things beginning with the ore thing of drontheim and having been approved by all the people of norway  i therefore counsel pacific measures and that we should go to the springs unarmed  when haldor sat down there was a slight murmur of assent but most of those present remained silent wishing to hear more  then up started ulf and spoke with great heat  i agree not with haldor he said sternly  who does not know that harald is rightful king of norway that he is descended in a direct line from the godars who came over from the east with odin and has been fairly elected king of norway  but who does not know also that our laws are above our king that harald is at this time trampling on these laws and is everywhere setting at defiance the small kings who are as truly udalborn to their rights and titles as himself  at this point ulfs indignation became so great that he found he could not talk connectedly so he concluded by counselling that they should go to the springs fully armed and ready to brave the worst  there was a loud shout of approval and then erling started up  his manner and tone were subdued but his face was flushed and men could see as he went on that he was keeping down his wrath and his energy  i like it ill he said to disagree on this point with my father but ulf is right  we all know that harald is king of norway by law and we do not meet here to dispute his title but we also know that kings are not gods  men create a law and place it over their own heads so that the lawmakers as well as those for whom it is made must bow before it but when it is found that the law works unfairly the lawmaker may repeal it and cast it aside as useless or unworthy  so kings were created for the sole purpose of guiding nations and administering laws in order that national welfare might be advanced  the moment they cease to act their part that moment they cease to be worthy kings and become useless  but if in addition to this they dare to ignore and break the laws of the land then do they become criminal they deserve not only to be cast aside but punished  if in defence of our rights we find it necessary to dethrone the king we cannot be charged with disloyalty because the king has already dethroned himself  erling paused a moment at this point and a murmur of approval ran through the circle of his auditors  when harald haarfagers father he resumed halfdan the black ruled over norway he made laws which were approved by the people  he obeyed them himself and obliged others to observe them and that violence should not come in the place of the laws he himself fixed the number of criminal acts in law and the compensations mulcts or penalties for each case according to everyones birth and dignity from the king downwards so that when disputes were settled at the things the utmost fair play prevaileddeath for death wound for wound or if the parties chose matters could be adjusted by payments in moneyeach injury being valued at a fixed scale or matters might be settled and put right by single combat  all this ye know full well halfdan the black compassed and settled in a legal manner and the good that has flowed from his wise and legal measures for i hold that a king is not entitled to pass even wise laws illegally has been apparent to us ever since  but now all this is to be overturnedwith or without the consent of the thingsbecause a foolish woman forsooth has the power to stir up the vanity of a foolish king  shall this be so  is our manhood to be thus riven from us and shall we stand aloof and see it done or worse still be consenting unto it  let death be our portion first  it has been rumoured that the people of southern lands have done thisthat they have sold themselves to their kings so that one mans voice is law and paid troops of military slaves are kept up in order that this one man may have his full swing while his favourites and his soldierslaves bask in his sunshine and fatten on the people of the land  it is impossible for us of norway to understand the feelings or ideas of the men who have thus sold themselvesfor we have never known such tyrannyhaving as the scalds tell us enjoyed our privileges held our things and governed ourselves by means of the collective wisdom of the people ever since our forefathers came from the east but i warn ye that if this man harald haarfager is allowed to have his will our institutions shall be swept away our privileges will depart our rights will be crushed and the time will come when it shall be said of norsemen that they have utterly forgotten that they once were free again i ask shall we tamely stand aside and suffer this to be  shall our children ever have it in their power to say there was a time when our meanspirited forefathers might have easily stopped the leak that caused the flood by which we are now borne irresistibly downward  i repeat let us rather perish  let us go armed to the springs and tell the king that heequally with ourselvesis subject to the laws of the land  erling delivered the last sentence in a voice of thunder and with a fierce wave of the hand that drew forth shouts of enthusiastic applause  instantly glumm started up forgetful in the heat of the moment of the jealousy that had so recently sprung up between him and his friend  i am not a speaker he shouted gruffly but poor is the man who cannot back up and egg on his friend  erling speaks the truth and all i have to suggest is that he should be sent by us to tell all this to king harald haarfagers face  glumm sat down with the prompt decision of a man who has thoroughly delivered himself of all that he intends to say and many in the assembly testified their approval of his sentiments  at this point ivor the old arose and gave it as his opinion that the sooner the king should be brought off his high horse the better whereupon finn the oneeyed suggested with a laugh that the old hermit should be sent with his bow and arrow to teach him due submission to the laws  then there was a good deal of confused and not a little passionate discussion which waxed louder and more vehement until guttorm stoutheart stood up and although not a dalesman requested the attention of the assembly for a few minutes  it is obvious he said in the hearty tones of a man who knows that he is sure of carrying a large portion of his audience along with himit is obvious that you are all pretty much of one mind as to the principle on which we should act at this time and my good friend haldor the fierce who seems of late to have changed his nature and should methinks in future be styled haldor the mild is evidently on the losing side  the only thing that concerns us it seems to me is the manner in which we shall convey our opinion to the kinghow we shall best as the scald says    whisper in the kings unwilling ear   that which is wholesome but unsweet to hear  now to the quickwitted among you various methods will doubtless have already been suggested and i am perchance only echoing the sentiments of many here when i say that it would be worthy of the men of horlingdal that they should fight the king at once and put a stop to the burnings hangings torturings jarlmakings and subduings of which he has been so guilty of late and which i confess is so unlike his free generous manly character that i have found it hard to believe the reports which have reached my ears and which after all can only be accounted for by the fact that he is at present led by the nose by that worst of all creatures a proud imperious girl who has the passions of a warrior and the brains of a bairn  another method which would signify at least our contempt for haralds principles would be the sending of a thrall to him with a reapinghook and a request that he would cut off his own head and give it to us in token that having ceased to be a king he is resolved no longer to continue to be a dishonoured man  and that reminds me of one of ulfs thralls named kettle flatnose who could assist harald nobly in the work of beheading himself for last night when he and i fought side by side against the danes he used a hook of his own making with such effect that i was fain to pause and laugh while myself in the very act of splitting an iron headpiece  but perchance that is not a suitable method of compassing our ends besides it would cost the thrall his life and i should be sorry to aid in bringing about the death of kettle flatnose whose island is a happy one if it counts many such clearheaded and ablebodied warriors  but another plan was proposed by glumm the gruff which seemed to me to have the approval of many present and assuredly it has mine that we should send king erling at once to harald to tell him our opinions to his face to sound him as to his intentions and to bring back the news as fast as possible so that we may go armed or unarmed to the springs as prudence may direct  moreover as it would be unfair to send a man alone on such a dangerous errand i would suggest that he should have a comrade to keep him company and share his fortunes and that for this end none better could be found than glumm the gruff himself  this speech settled the mind of the meeting  after a little more talk it was finally arranged that erling and glumm should go at once to meet king harald who could not yet it was thought have arrived at the springs and endeavour to find out his temper of mind in regard to the men of horlingdal  after that the thing broke up and the members dispersed to partake of midagmad or dinner in the dwellings of their various friends    chapter ten  proves that the best of friends may quarrel about nothing and that war has two aspects  now erling said glumm with a face so cheerful that had the expression been habitual he never would have been styled the gruff i will go home with thee and wait until thou art busked after which we will go together to my house and have a bite and a horn of mead before setting out on this expedition  i thank the stoutheart for suggesting it for the business likes me well  thou wert ever prone to court danger glumm said erling with a laugh as they hurried towards haldorstede and methinks thou art going to be blessed with a full share of it just now for this harald haarfager is not a man to be trifled with  although thou and i could hold our own against some odds we shall find the odds too much for us in the kings camp should he set his face against us  however the cause is a good one and to say truth i am not sorry that they had the goodness to pitch on thee and me to carry out the plan  thus conversing they arrived at ulfstede where herfrida met them at the door and was soon informed of their mission  she immediately went to an inner closet where the best garments and arms were kept and brought forth erlings finest suit of armour in order that he might appear with suitable dignity at court  she made him change his ordinary shoes for a pair made of tanned leather on which he bound a pair of silver spurs which had been taken from a cavalier of southern lands in one of haldors viking cruises she brought and assisted him to put on a new suit of mail every ring of which had been brightly polished by the busy hands of ingeborg who was unusually fond of meddling with everything that pertained to the art of war also a new swordbelt of yellow leather ornamented with gold studs  on his head she placed a gilt helmet with his favourite crest a pair of hawks wings expanded upwards and a curtain of leather covered with giltsteel rings to defend the neck  over his shoulders she flung a short scarlet cloak which was fastened at the throat by a large silver brooch similar to the circular brooches which are still to be found in the possession of the rich bonders of norway  then she surveyed her stalwart son from head to foot and said that he would stand comparison with any king in the land small or great  at this erling laughed and asked for his sword  which one my son  the short one mother  i had indeed thought of taking my good old axe with me but that would not look well in a man bent on a mission of peace  would it glumm  and if i should have to fight why my short sword is not a light one and by putting to a little more force i can make it bite deep enough  so now glumm i am ready for the road farewell mother  the young men went out and hastened down the valley to glummstede near horlingend  now it chanced that hilda and her fostersister ada had resolved about that time of the day to walk up the dale together and as there was only one road on that side of the river of necessity they were met by their lovers and it so fell out that the meeting took place in a picturesque part of the dale where the road passed between two high precipitous cliffs  the instant that adas eyes fell on glumm her active brain conceived the idea of treating him to a disappointment so she said hurriedly to her friend  hilda wilt thou manage to lead glumm aside and keep talking to him for a short time while i speak with erling  i want to ask him something about that swordbelt which i am making for glumm and which i intend to send him as the gift of an enemy  i will do as ye desire replied hilda with a feeling of disappointment but with what truth canst thou send it ada as an enemys gift  simple hilda said the other with a laugh am i not an enemy to his peace of mind  but hush they will overhear us  it chanced that hilda was on the same side of the road with erling and ada on that with glumm and both youths observed this fact with secret satisfaction as they approached and wished the maids good day but just as they were about to shake hands ada crossed in front of her companion and taking erlings outstretched hand said  erling i am glad to meet thee because i have a knotty point which i wish thine aid to disentangle  i will turn and walk with thee a short way because i know thy business is pressing  it is always so with men is it not  i know not answered erling smiling at the girls arch look despite his surprise and chagrin at the unexpected turn affairs had taken for he had noted the readiness with which hilda had turned towards glumm and almost as he imagined led him aside purposely  but it seems to me ada that however pressing a mans business may be woman has the power to delay it  nay then if thine is indeed so pressing just now said ada with a toss of the head which glumm who walked behind with hilda took particular note of i will not presume to  now ada said erling with a light laugh thou knowest that it is merely waste of time to affect indignation  i know thee too well to be deceived  come what is it that ye would consult me about not the forging of a battleaxe or spearhead i warrant me  nay but a portion of armour scarce less important though not so deadly  what say you to a swordbelt  well i am somewhat skilled in such gear  i am ornamenting one for a friend of thine erling but i will not tell his name unless i have thy promise not to mention to him anything about our conversation  i promise said erling with an amused glance  it is for glumm  for glumm repeated erling in surprise does glumm then know  know what asked ada as erling stopped abruptly  does he know that thou art making this belt for him  know it why how could it be a secret if he knew it  ah true iwell  besides continued ada i am not making it i said i was going to ornament it  now it is with reference to that i would consult thee  here ada became so deeply absorbed in the mysteries of ornamental armour that she constrained erling at least to appear interested although poor man his heart was behind him and he had much difficulty in resisting the desire to turn round when he heard hildas voicewhich by the way was heard pretty constantly for glumm was so uncommonly gruff and monosyllabic in his replies that she had most of the talking to herself  this unpleasant state of things might have lasted a considerable time had not the party reached the path which diverged to the left and crossing the river over a narrow bridge composed of two tall trees thrown across led to glummstede  here erling stopped suddenly and wheeling round said  i regret that we cannot go farther down the dale today as glumm and i must fare with all speed to the springs to meet king harald  i trust thine errand is one of peace said hilda in a slightly anxious tone  to judge by their looks said ada glancing expressively at glumm i should say that their intentions were warlike  despite our looks replied erling with a laugh our business with the king is of a peaceful nature and as it is pressing ye will excuse us if  oh it is pressing after all cried ada come sister let us not delay them  so saying she hurried away with her friend and the two youths strode on to glummstede in a very unenviable frame of mind  having refreshed themselves with several cuts of fresh salmondrawn that morning from the foaming riverand with a deep horn of homebrewed ale the young warriors mounted a couple of active horses and rode up the mountain path that led in a zigzag direction over the fells to the valley of the springs  they rode in silence at firstpartly because the nature of the track compelled them to advance in single file and partly because each was in the worst possible humour of which his nature was capable while each felt indignant at the other although neither could have said that his friend had been guilty of any definable sin  it may here be mentioned in passing that glumm had clothed and armed himself much in the same fashion as his companion the chief difference being that his helmet was of polished steel and the centre of his shield was painted red while that of erling was white  his only offensive weapons were a dagger and the long twohanded sword which had been forged for him by his friend which latter was slung across his back  an hour and a half of steady climbing brought the youths to the level summit of the hills where after giving their steeds a few minutes to breathe they set off at a sharp gallop  here they rode side by side but the rough nature of the ground rendered it necessary to ride with care so that conversation although possible was not in the circumstances very desirable  the silence therefore was maintained all the way across the fells  when they came to descend on the other side they were again obliged to advance in single file so that the silence remained unbroken until they reached the base of the mountains  here erlings spirit revived a little and he began to realise the absurdity of the conduct of himself and his friend  why glumm he exclaimed at last a dumb spirit must have got hold of us  what possesses thee man  truly it takes two to make a conversation said glumm sulkily  that is as thou sayest friend yet i am not aware that i refused to talk with thee retorted erling  nor i with thee said glumm sharply and thy tongue was glib enough when ye talked with ada in horlingdal  a light flashed upon erling as his friend spoke  why glumm he said lightly a pretty girl will make most mens tongues wag whether they will or no  glumm remembered his own obstinate silence while walking with hilda and deeming this a studied insult he became furious reined up and said  come erling if ye wish to settle this dispute at once we need fear no interruption and here is a piece of level sward  nay man be not so hot said erling with a smile that still more exasperated his companion besides is it fair to challenge me to fight with this light weapon while thou bearest a sword so long and deadly  that shall be no bar cried the other unslinging his twohanded sword thou canst use it thyself and i will content me with thine  and pray how shall we give account of our mission said erling if you and i cut each others heads off before fulfilling it  that would then concern us little said glumm  nay thou art more selfish than i thought thee friend  for my part i would not that she should think me so regardless of her welfare as to leave undelivered a message that may be the means of preventing the ruin of horlingdal  my regard for ada seems to sit more heavily on me than on thee  at this glumm became still more furious  he leaped off his horse drew his sword and flinging it down with the hilt towards erling cried in a voice of suppressed passion  no longer will i submit to be trifled with by man or woman  choose thy weapon erling  this matter shall be settled now and here and the one who wins her shall prove him worthy of her by riding forth from this plain alone  if thou art bent on equal combat we can fall to with staves cut from yonder tree or for the matter of that we can make shift to settle it with our knives  what has womans love unmanned thee  at this erling leaped out of the saddle and drew his sword  take up thy weapon glumm and guard thee  but before we begin perhaps it would be well to ask for whose hand it is that we fight  have we not been talking just now of ada the darkeyed said glumm sternly as he took up his sword and threw himself into a posture of defence with the energetic action of a man thoroughly in earnest  then is our combat uncalled for said erling lowering his point for i desire not the hand of ada though i would fight even to the death for her blueeyed sister could i hope thereby to win her love  art thou in earnest demanded glumm in surprise  i never was more so in my life replied erling would that hilda regarded me with but half the favour that ada shows to thee  there thou judgest wrongly said glumm from whose brow the frown of anger was passing away like a thundercloud before the summer sun  i dont pretend to understand a girls thoughts but i have wit enough to see what is very plainly revealed  when i walked with hilda today i noticed that her eye followed thee unceasingly and although she talked to me glibly enough her thoughts were wandering so that she uttered absolute nonsense at timesinsomuch that i would have laughed had i not been jealous of what i deemed the mutual love of ada and thee  no erling thy suit will prosper depend ont  it is i who have reason to despond for ada loves me not  erling who heard all this with a certain degree of satisfaction smiled shook his head and said  nay then glumm thou too art mistaken  the darkeyed ada laughs at everyone and besides i have good reason to know that her interest in thee is so great that she consulted me today aboutabouta  the promise of secrecy that he had made caused erling to stammer and stop  about what asked glumm  i may not tell thee friend  she bound me over to secrecy and i must hold by my promise but this i may say that thou hast fully greater cause for hope than i have  then it is my opinion said glumm that we have nothing to do but shake hands and proceed on our journey  erling laughed heartily sheathed his sword and grasped his friends hand after which they remounted and rode forward but they did not now ride in silence  their tongues were effectually loosened and for some time they discussed their respective prospects with all the warmth and enthusiasm of youthful confidants  but ada perplexes me suddenly exclaimed glumm in the midst of a brief pause i know not how to treat her  if thou wilt take my advice glumm i will give it thee  what is that asked glumm  there is nothing like fighting a woman with her own weapons  a pretty speech said glumm to come from the lips of a man who never regards the weapons of his foes and can scarce be prevailed on to carry anything but a beloved battleaxe  the case is entirely the reverse when one fights with woman replied erling  in war i confess that i like everything to be straightforward and downright because when things come to the worst a man can either hew his way by main force through thick and thin or die  truly i would that it were possible to act thus in matters of love also but this being impossibleseeing that women will not have it so and insist on dallyingthe next best thing to be done is to act on their own principles  fight them with their own weapons  if a woman is outspoken and straightforward a man should be the sameand rejoice moreover that he has found a gem so precious  but if she will play fast and loose let a manif he does not give her up at oncedo the same  give ada a little taste of indifference glumm and thou wilt soon bring her down  laugh at her as well as with her  show not quite so much attention to her as has been thy wont and be more attentive to the other girls in the dale  to hilda for instance said glumm slyly  aye even so an it please thee rejoined erling but rest assured thou wilt receive no encouragement in that quarter for hilda the sunbeam is the very soul of innocence truth and straightforwardness  not less so is ada said glumm firing up at the implied contrast  erling made a sharp rejoinder to which glumm made a fierce reply and it is probable that these hotblooded youths having quarrelled because of a misunderstanding in regard to their mistresses would have come to blows about their comparative excellence had they not come suddenly upon a sight which for the time banished all other thoughts from their minds  during the discussion they had been descending the valley which terminated in the plain where the recent battle of the springs had been fought  here as they galloped across the field which was still strewn with the bodies of the slain they came upon the blackened ruins of a hut around which an old hag was moving actively engaged apparently in raking among the ashes with a forked stick for anything that she could draw forth  near to her a woman who had not yet reached middle age was seated on the burnt earth with her hands tightly clasped and her bloodshot eyes gazing with a stony stare at a blackened heap which lay on her lap  as the young men rode up they saw that part of the head and face of a child lay in the midst of the charred heap with a few other portions of the little one that had been only partially consumed in the fire  the northmen did not require to be told the cause of what they saw  the story was too plainly written in everything around them to admit of uncertainty had they even been ignorant of the recent fight and its consequences  these were two of the few survivors of that terrible night who had ventured to creep forth from the mountains and search among the ashes for the remains of those whose smiles and voices had once made the sunshine of their lives  the terrible silence of these voices and the sight of these hideous remains had driven the grandmother of the household raving mad and she continued to rake among the still smouldering embers of the old house utterly regardless of the two warriors and only complaining in a querulous tone now and then that her daughter should sit there like a stone and leave her unaided to do the work of trying to save at least some of the household from the flames  but the daughter neither heard nor cared for her  she had found what was left of her idolher youngest childonce a ruddy fearless boy with curly flaxen hair who had already begun to carve model longships and wooden swords and to talk with a joyous smile and flashing eye of war but nowthe fair hair gone and nothing left save a blackened skull and a small portion of his face scarcely enoughyet to a mother far more than enoughto recognise him by  erling and glumm dismounted and approached the young woman but received no glance of recognition  to a remark made by erling no reply was given  he therefore went close to her and bending down laid his large hand on her head and gently smoothed her flaxen hair while he spoke soothingly to her  still the stricken woman took no notice of him until a large hot tear which the youth could not restrain dropped upon her forehead and coursed down her cheek  she then looked suddenly up in erlings face and uttered a low wail of agony  would ye slay her too shrieked the old woman at that moment coming forward with the pole with which she had been raking in the ashes as if she were going to attack them  glumm turned aside the point of the pole and gently caught the old woman by the arm  oh spare her she cried falling on her knees and clasping her withered hands spare her she is the last leftthe last  i tried to save the othersbut but they are goneall gone  will ye not spare her  they wont harm us mother said the younger woman huskily  they are friends  i know they are friends  come sit by me mother  the old woman who appeared to have been subdued by exhaustion crept on her hands and knees to her side and laying her head on her daughters breast moaned piteously  we cannot stay to aid thee said erling kindly but that matters not because those will soon be here who will do their best for thee  yet if thou canst travel a few leagues i will give thee a token which will ensure a good reception in my fathers house  knowest thou haldorstede in horlingdal  i know it well answered the woman  here is a ring said erling which thou wilt take to herfrida the wife of haldor and say that her son erling sent thee and would have thee and thy mother well cared for  he took from his finger as he spoke a gold ring and placed it in the womans hand but she shook her head sadly and said in an absent tone i dare not go  swart might come back and would miss me  art thou the wife of swart of the springs  yes and he told me not to quit the house till he came back  but that seems so long long ago and so many things have happened since that  she paused and shuddered  swart is dead said glumm  on hearing this the woman uttered a wild shriek and fell backward to the earth  now a plague on thy gruff tongue said erling angrily as he raised the womans head on his knee  did you not see that the weight was already more than she could bear  get thee to the spring for water man as quickly as may be  glumm whose heart had already smitten him for his inconsiderate haste made no reply but ran to a neighbouring spring and quickly returned with his helmet full of water  a little of this soon restored the poor woman and also her mother  now haste thee to horlingdal said erling giving the woman a share of the small supply of food with which he had supplied himself for the journey  there may be company more numerous than pleasant at the springs tomorrow and a hearty welcome awaits thee at haldorstede  saying this he remounted and rode away  i was told last night by hilda said erling that when we were out after the danes and just before the attack was made by the men of their cutter on ulfstede the hermit had been talking to the women in a wonderful way about war and the god whom he worships  he thinks that war is an evil thing that to fight in selfdefencethat is in defence of home and countryis right but that to go on viking cruise is wrong and displeasing to god  the hermit is a fool said glumm bluntly  nay he is no fool said erling  when i think of these poor women i am led to wish that continued peace were possible  but it is happily not possible therefore it is our business to look upon the bright side of war said glumm  that may be thy business glumm but it is my business to look upon both sides of everything  what would it avail thee to pitch and paint and gild the outside of thy longship if no attention were given to the timbering and planking of the inside  that is a different thing said glumm  yes truly yet not different in this that it has two sides both of which require to be looked at if the ship is to work well  i would that i knew what the men of other lands think on this point for the hermit says that there are nations in the south where men practise chiefly defensive warfare and often spend years at a time without drawing the sword  right glad am i said glumm with a grim smile that my lot has not fallen among these  do you know continued erling that i have more than once thought of going off on a cruise far and wide over the world to hear and see what men say and do  but something i know not what prevents me  perchance hilda could tell thee said glumm  erling laughed and said there was some truth in that but checked himself suddenly for at that moment a man in the garb of a thrall appeared  ho fellow cried glumm hast heard of king harald haarfager of late  the king is in guestquarters in updal answered the thrall in the house of jarl rongvold my master  we must speed on said erling to glumm if we would speak with the king before suppertime  if you would speak with the king at all said the thrall the less you say to him the better for he is in no mood to be troubled just now he sets out for the springs tomorrow morning  without making a reply the youths clapped spurs to their horses and galloped away    chapter eleven  describes our heros interview with jarl rongvold and king harald haarfager  late in the evening erling and glumm arrived in the neighbourhood of the house of jarl rongvold where king harald haarfager was staying in guestquarters with a numerous retinue  in the days of which we write there were no royal palaces in norway the kings spent most of their timewhen not engaged in war or out on viking cruisesin travelling about the country with a band of herdmen or menatarms in guestquarters  wherever they went the inhabitants were bound by law to afford them houseroom and good cheer at their own cost and the kings usually made this tax upon their people as light as possible by staying only a few days at each place  rongvold who entertained the king at this time was one of those jarls or earlsrulers over districts under himselfof whom he had recently created many throughout the land to supersede those small independent kings who refused to become subject to him  he was a stout warrior an able courtier and a very dear friend of the king  just before his arrival at jarl rongvolds house king harald had completed a considerable part of the programme which he had laid down in the great work of subduing the whole of norway to himself  and wild bloody work it had been  hearing that several of the small kings had called a meeting in the uplands to discuss his doings harald went with all the men he could gather through the forests to the uplands came to the place of meeting about midnight without being observed by the watchmen set the house on fire and burnt or slew four kings with all their followers  after that he subdued hedemark ringerige gudbrandsdal hadeland raumarige and the whole northern part of vingulmark and got possession of all the land as far south as the glommen  it was at this time that he was taunted by the girl gyda and took the oath not to clip his hair until he had subdued the whole landas formerly related  after his somewhat peculiar determination he gathered together a great force and went northwards up the gudbrandsdal and over the doverfielde  when he came to the inhabited land he ordered all the men to be killed and everything wide around to be delivered to the flames  the people fled before him in all directions on hearing of his approachsome down the country to orkadal some to gaulerdal and some to the forests but many begged for peace and obtained it on condition of joining him and becoming his men  he met no decided opposition till he came to orkadal where a king named gryting gave him battle  harald won the victory king gryting was taken prisoner and most of his men were killed  he took service himself however under the king and thereafter all the people of orkadal district swore fidelity to him  many other battles king harald fought and many other kings did he subdueall of which however we will pass over at present merely observing that wherever he conquered he laid down the law that all the udal property should belong to him and that the bondersthe hitherto free landholdersboth small and great should pay him land dues for their possessions  it is due however to harald fairhair to say that he never seems to have aimed at despotic power for it is recorded of him that over every district he set an earl or jarl to judge according to the law of the land and to justice and also to collect the land dues and the fines and for this each earl received a third part of the dues and services and fines for the support of his table and other expenses  every earl had under him four or more bersers on each of whom was bestowed an estate of twenty merks yearly for which he was bound to support twenty menatarms at his own expenseeach earl being obliged to support sixty retainers  the king increased the land dues and burdens so much that his earls had greater power and income than the kings had before and when this became known at drontheim many of the great men of that district joined the king  wherever harald went submission or extinction were the alternatives and as he carried things with a high hand using fire and sword freely it is not a matter of wonder that his conquests were rapid and complete it has been said of harald fairhair by his contemporaries handed down by the scalds and recorded in the icelandic sagas that he was of remarkably handsome appearance great and strong and very generous and affable to his men  but to return  it was late in the evening as we have said when erling and glumm reached the vicinity of jarl rongvolds dwelling  before coming in sight of it they were met by two of the mounted guards that were posted regularly as sentries round the kings quarters  these challenged them at once and on being informed that they desired to have speech with the king on matters of urgency conveyed them past the inner guard to the house  the state of readiness for instant action in which the men were kept did not escape the observant eyes of the visitors  besides an outlying mounted patrol which they had managed to pass unobserved and the sentries who conducted them they found a strong guard round the range of farm buildings where the king and his men lay  these men were all well armed and those of them who were not on immediate duty lay at their stations sound asleep each man with his helmet on his head his sword under it his right hand grasping the hilt and his shield serving the purpose of a blanket to cover him  although the young men observed all this they did not suffer their looks to betray idle curiosity but rode on with stern countenances looking apparently straight before them until they reined up at the front door of the house  in a few minutes a stout handsome man with white hair came out and saluted erling in a friendly way  this was jarl rongvold who was distantly related to him  i would i could say with truth that i am glad to see thee cousin he said but i fear me that thine errand to the king is not likely to end in pleasant intercourse if all be true that is reported of the folk in horlingdal  thanks kinsman for the wish if not for the welcome replied the youth somewhat stiffly as he dismounted but it matters little to me whether our intercourse be pleasant or painful so long as it is profitable  the men of horlingdal send a message to harald haarfager can my companion and i have speech with him  i can manage that for thee yet would i counsel delay for the king is not in a sweet mood tonight and it may go ill with thee  i care not whether the kings mood be sweet or sour replied erling sternly  whatever he may become in the future harald is not yet the allpowerful king he would wish to be  the men of horlingdal have held a thing and glumm and i have been deputed to see the king convey to him their sentiments and ask his intentions  a grim smile played on the jarls fine features for a moment as he observed the blood mantling to the youths forehead  no good will come to thee or thine kinsman by meeting the king with a proud look  be advised erling he continued in a more confidential tone it is easier to swim with the stream than against itand wiser too when it is impossible to turn it  thou hast heard no doubt of haralds doings in the north  i have heard said erling bitterly  well be he right or be he wrong it were easier to make the glommen run up the fells than to alter the kings determination and it seems to me that it behoves every man who loves his country and would spare further bloodshed to submit to what is inevitable  every lover of his country deems bloodshed better than slavery said erling because the death of a few is not so great an evil as the slavery of all  aye when there is hope that good may come of dying rejoined the jarl but now there is no hope  that is yet to be proved said the youth and glumm uttered one of those emphatic grunts with which men of few words are wont to signify their hearty assent to a proposition  tut kinsman continued rongvold with a look of perplexity i dont like the idea of seeing so goodly a youth end his days before his right time  let me assure thee that if thou wilt join us and win over thy friends in horlingdal a splendid career awaits thee for the king loves stout men and will treat thee well he is a good master  it grieves me that one whose blood flows in my veins should call any man master said erling  now a plague on thee for a stupid hotblood cried the jarl if thou art so displeased with the word i can tell thee that it need never be used for if ye will take service with the king he will give thee the charge and the revenues of a goodly district where thou shalt be master and a jarl too  i am a king said erling drawing himself proudly up  thinkest thou i would exchange an old title for a new one which the giver has no right to create  glumm uttered another powerfully emphatic grunt at this point  besides continued erling i have no desire to become a scattgatherer  the jarl flushed a little at this thrust but mastering his indignation said with a smile  nay then if ye prefer a warriors work there is plenty of that at the disposal of the king  i have no particular love for war said erling  jarl rongvold looked at his kinsman in undisguised amazement  truly thou art well fitted for it if not fond of it he said curtly but as thou art bent on following thine own nose thou art like to have more than enough of that which thou lovest notcome i will bring thee to the king  the jarl led the two young men into his dwelling where nearly a hundred menatarms were carousing  the hall was a long narrow and high apartment with a table running down each side and one at either end in the centre of each table was a raised seat on which sat the chief guests but at the moment they entered the highest of these seats was vacant for the king had left the table  the fireplace of the hall was in the centre and the smoke from it curled up among the rafters which it blackened before escaping through a hole in the roof  as all the revellers were armed and many of them were moving about the hall no notice was taken of the entrance of the strangers except that one or two near whom they passed remarked that jarl rongvold owned some stout menatarms  the king had retired to one of the sleepingchambers off the great halt in which he sat at a small window gazing dreamily upon the magnificent view of dale fell fiord and sea that lay stretched out before the house  the slanting rays of the sun shone through the window and through the heavy masses of the kings golden hair which fell in enormous volumes like a lions mane on a pair of shoulders which were noted even in that age of powerful men for enormous breadth and strength  like his men king harald was armed from head to foot with the exception of his helmet which lay with his shield on the low wolfskin couch on which he had passed the previous night  he did not move when the jarl and the young men entered but on the former whispering in his ear he let his clenched fist fall on the window sill and turning with a frown on his bold handsome face looked long and steadily at erling  and well might he gaze for he looked upon one who bore a singularly strong resemblance to himself  there was the same height and width and massive strength the same bold fearless look in the clear blue eyes and the same firm lips but erlings hair fell in softer curls on his shoulders and his brow was more intellectual being a younger man his beard was shorter  advancing a step after jarl rongvold had left the room erling stated the sentiments of the men of horlingdal in simple blunt language and ended by telling the king that they had no wish to refuse due and lawful allegiance to him but that they objected to having the old customs of the land illegally altered  during the progress of his statement both erling and glumm observed that the kings face flushed more than once and that his great blue eyes blazed with astonishment and suppressed wrath  after he had concluded the king still gazed at him in ominous silence  then he said sternly  for what purpose camest thou hither if the men of horlingdal hold such opinions  we came to tell you king harald what the men of horlingdal think and to ask what you intend to do  there was something so cool in this speech that a sort of grin curled the kings moustache and mingled with the wrath that was gathering on his countenance  ill tell thee what i will do he said drawing his breath sharply and hissing the words i will march into the dale and burn and s he stopped abruptly and then in a soft tone added but what will they do if i refuse to listen to them  i know not what the men of horlingdal will do replied erling but i will counsel them to defend their rights  at this the king leaped up and drew his sword half out of its scabbard but again checked himself suddenly for as the saga tells us it was his invariable rule whenever anything raised his anger to collect himself and let his passion run off and then take the matter into consideration coolly  go he said sitting down again at the window i will speak with thee on this subject tomorrow  erling who during the little burst of passion had kept his blue eyes unflinchingly fixed on those of the king bowed and retired followed by glumm whose admiration of his friends diplomatic powers would have been unbounded had he only wound up with a challenge to the king then and there to single combat    chapter twelve  describes a terrific and unequal combat  now kinsman let me endeavour to convince thee of thy folly said jarl rongvold to erling on the morning that followed the evening in which the interview with the king had taken place as they walked in front of the house together  it needs no great power of speech to convince me of that said erling the fact that i am still here after what the king let out last night convinces me without your aid that i am a fool  and pray what said he that has had such powerful influence on thine obtuse mind  truly he said little but he expressed much  he gave way to an unreasonable burst of passion when i did but claim justice and assert our rights and the man must be slowwitted indeed who could believe that subdued passion is changed opinion  however i will wait for another interview until the sun is in the zenithafter that i leave whatever be the consequences  so it were well kinsman that you should see and advise with your master  the jarl bit his lip and was on the point of turning away without replying when a remarkably stout and tall young man walked up and accosted them  this is my son rolf said the jarl turning round hastilyour kinsman erling the bold  i go to attend the king  make the most of each other for ye are not likely to be long in company  are you that rolf who is styled ganger enquired erling with some interest  aye replied the other gruffly  at least i am rolf  men choose to call me ganger because i prefer to gang on my legs rather than gang on the legs of a horse  they say it is because no horse can carry me but thou seest that that is a lie for i am not much heavier than thyself  i should like to know thee better kinsman said erling  rolf ganger did not respond so heartily to this as erling wished and he felt much disappointed for being a man who did not often express his feelings he felt all the more keenly anything like a rebuff  what is your business with the king asked rolf after a short pause  to defy him said our hero under the influence of a burst of mingled feelings  rolf ganger looked at erling in surprise  thou dost not like the king then  i hate him  so do i said rolf  this interchange of sentiment seemed to break down the barriers of diffidence which had hitherto existed between the two for from that moment their talk was earnest and confidential  erling tried to get rolf to desert the kings cause and join his opponents but the latter shook his head and said that they had no chance of success and that it was of no use joining a hopeless cause even although he had strong sympathy with it  while they were conversing jarl rongvold came out and summoned erling to the presence of the king  this was the first and last interview that our hero had with that rolf ganger whose namealthough not much celebrated at that timewas destined to appear in the pages of history as that of the conqueror of normandy and the progenitor of line of english kings  i have sent for thee erling said the king in a voice so soft yet so constrained that erling could not avoid seeing that it was forced to tell thee thou art at liberty to return to thy dalesmen with this messageking harald respects the opinions of the men of horlingdal and he will hold a thing at the springs for the purpose of hearing their views more fully stating his own and consulting with them about the whole matterart satisfied with that he asked almost sternly  i will convey your message said erling  and the sooner the better said the king  by the way there are two roads leading to the springs i am told is it so he added  there are said erling one goes by the uplands over the fells the other through the forest  which would you recommend me to follow when i fare to the springs  the forest road is the best  it is that which thou wilt follow i suppose  it is replied erling  well get thee to horse and make the most of thy time my berserk here will guide thee past the guards  as he spoke a man who had stood behind the king motionless as a statue advanced towards the door  he was one of a peculiar class of men who formed part of the bodyguard of the king  on his head there was a plain steel helmet but he wore no serk or shirt of mail hence the name of berserk or bare of serk and he was like the rest of his comrades noted for being capable of working himself up into such a fury of madness while in action that few people of ordinary powers could stand before his terrible onset  he was called hake the berserk of hadeland and was comparatively short in stature but looked shorter than he really was in consequence of the unnatural breadth and bulk of his chest and shoulders  hake led erling out to the door of the house where they found glumm waiting with two horses ready for the road  thou art sharp this morning glumm  better to be too sharp than too blunt replied his friend  it seemed to me that whatever should be the result of the talk with the king today it were well to be ready for the road in good time  what is yonder bigshouldered fellow doing  hush glumm said erling with a smile thou must be respectful if thou wouldst keep thy head on thy shoulders  that is hake of hadeland king haralds famous berserk  he is to conduct us past the guards  i only hope he may not have been commissioned to cut off our heads on the way  but i think that perchance you and i might manage him together if our courage did not fail us  glumm replied with that expression of contempt which is usually styled turning up ones nose and erling laughed as he mounted his horse and rode off at the heels of the berserk  he had good reason to look grave however as he found out a few moments later  just as they were about to enter the forest a voice was heard shouting behind and jarl rongvold was seen running after them  ho stay kinsman go not away without bidding us farewell  a safe and speedy journey lad and give my good wishes to the old folk at haldorstede  say that i trust things may yet be happily arranged between the men of horlingdal and the king  as he spoke the jarl managed to move so that erlings horse came between him and the berserk then he said quickly in a low but earnest whisper  the king means to play thee false erling  i cannot explain but do thou be sure to take the road by the fells and let not the berserk know  thy life depends on it  i am ordered to send this berserk with a troop of nineteen men to waylay thee  they are to go by the forest roadthere thou canst not doubt my friendship for thee for now my life is in thy hands  haste thou hast no chance against such odds farewell glumm he added aloud give my respects to ulf when next ye see him  jarl rongvold waved his hand as he turned round and left his friends to pursue their way  they soon reached the point where they had met the two guards on the previous day  after riding a little farther so as to make sure of being beyond the outmost patrol the berserk reined up  here i leave you to guard yourselves he said  truly we are indebted to thee for thy guidance thus far said erling  if you should still chance to meet with any of the guards they will let you pass no doubt  no doubt replied erling with a laugh and should they object we have that which will persuade them  he touched the hilt of his sword and nodded goodhumouredly to the berserk who did not appear to relish the jest at all  your road lies through the forest i believe said hake pausing and looking back as he was about to ride away  that depends on circumstances said erling  if the sun troubles me i may go by the forestif not i may go by the fells  but i never can tell beforehand which way my fancy may lead and i always follow it  so saying he put spurs to his horse and galloped away  the berserk did the same but it was evident that he was ill at ease for he grumbled very much and complained a good deal of his ill luck he did not however slacken his pace on that account but rather increased it until he reached rongvoldstede where he hastily summoned nineteen armed men mounted a fresh horse and ordering them to follow dashed back into the forest at full speed  for some time he rode in silence by the side of a stout man who was his subordinate officer  krake he said at length i cannot make up my mind which road this erling and his comrade are likely to have taken so as we must not miss our men the kings commands being very positive i intend to send thee by the mountain road with nine of the men and go myself by the forest with the other nine  we will ride each at full speed and will be sure to overtake them before they reach the split rock on the fells or the doublestemmed pine in the forest  if thou shalt fall in with them keep them in play till i come up for i will hasten to join thee without delay after reaching the double pine  if i meet them i will give the attack at once and thou wilt hasten to join me after passing the split rock  now away for here our roads part  in accordance with this plan the troop was divided and each portion rode off at full speed  meanwhile erling and glumm pursued their way chatting as they rode along and pausing occasionally to breathe their horses  what ails thee erling said glumm abruptly  one would fancy that the fair hilda was behind thee so often hast thou looked back since the berserk left us  it is because the fair hilda is before me that i look so often over my shoulder for i suspect that there are those behind us who will one day cause her grief replied erling sadly then assuming a gay air he addedcome friend glumm i wish to know thy mind in regard to a matter of some importance  how wouldst thou like to engage single handed with ten men  glumm smiled grimly as he was wont to do when amused by anything which to say truth was not often  truly said he my answer to that must depend on thine answer to thisam i supposed to have my back against a cliff or to be surrounded by the ten  with thy back guarded of course  in that case i should not refuse the fight but i would prefer to be more equally matched said glumm two to one now is a common chance of war as thou knowest full well  i myself have had four against me at one timeand when one is in good spirits this is not a serious difficulty unless there chance to be a berserk amongst them even in that case by the use of a little activity of limb one can separate them and so kill them in detail  but ten are almost too many for one man however bold big or skilful he may be  then whatwouldst thou say to twenty against two asked erling giving a peculiar glance at his friend  that were better than ten to one because two stout fellows back to back are not easily overcome if the fight be fair with sword and axe and arrows or spears be not allowed  thou and i erling might make a good stand together against twenty for we can use our weapons and are not small men  nevertheless i think that it would be our last fight though i make no doubt we should thin their number somewhat  but why ask such questions  because i have taken a fancy to know to what extent i might count on thee in case of surprise  to what extent said glumm flushing and looking his friend full in the face  hast known me so long to such small purpose that ye should doubt my willingness to stand by thee to the death if need be against any odds  nay be not so hasty glumm  i doubt not thy courage nor thy regard for me but i had a fancy to know what amount of odds thou wouldst deem serious for i may tell thee that our powers are likely to be put to the proof today  my kinsman jarl rongvold told me at parting that twenty menand among them hake the berserkare to be sent after us and are doubtless even now upon our track  then why this easy pace said glumm in a tone of great surprise surely there is no reason why we should abide the issue of such a combat when nothing is to be gained by it and much to be lost for if we are killed who will prepare the men of horlingdal for the kings approach and tell of his intentions  that is wisely spoken glumm nevertheless i feel disposed to meet king haralds men  this spirit accords ill with the assertion that thou art not fond of war returned glumm with a smile  i am not so sure of that rejoined erling with a look of perplexity it is more the consequences of warits evil effects on communities on women and childrenthat i dislike than the mere matter of fighting which although i cannot say i long for it as some of our friends do i can truly assert i take some pleasure in when engaged in it  besides in this case i do not wish to meet these fellows for a mere piece of brag but i think it might teach king harald that he has to do with men who have heart and skill to use their weapons and show him what he may expect if he tries to subdue this district  however be that as it may the question is shall we hang back and accept this challengefor such i regard itor shall we push on  yonder is an answer to that question which settles it for us said glumm quietly pointing to a ridge on the right of the bridle path which rose high above the tree tops  a troop of horsemen were seen to cross it and gallop down the slope where they quickly disappeared in the forest  how many didst thou count asked erling with a look of surprise  only ten answered glumm  come cried erling cheerfully as he drew his sword the odds are not so great as we had expected  i suppose that king harald must have thought us poorlooking warriors or perchance he has sent ten berserkers against us  anyhow i am content  only one thing do i regret and that is that among the other foolish acts i have been guilty of at this time i left my good battleaxe behind me  this is a level piece of sward  shall we await them here  aye was glumms laconic answer as he felt the edge of his long twohanded sword settled himself more firmly on his seat and carefully looked to the fastenings of his armour  erling did the same and both drew up their steeds with their backs towards an impenetrable thicket  in front lay a level stretch of ground encumbered only here and there with one or two small bushes beyond which they had a view far into the dark forest where the armour of the approaching horsemen could be seen glancing among the tree stems  it is likely muttered erling that they will try to speak us fair at first  most assassins do to throw men off their guard  i counsel that our words be few and our action quick  glumm gave vent to a deep short laugh which sounded however marvellously like a growl and again said  aye  next moment the ten horsemen galloped towards them and reined up at the distance of a few yards while two of them advanced  one of these who was no other than krake the berserk said in a loud commanding voice  yield thee erling in the name of the king  that for the king cried erling splitting the head of krakes horse with the edge of his sword and receiving krake himself on the point of it as he fell forward so that it went in at his breast and came out at his back  at the same time glumms horse sprang forward his long sword whistled sharply as it flashed through the air and next moment the head of the second man was rolling on the ground  so sudden was the onset that the others had barely time to guard themselves when glumms heavy sword cleft the top of the shield and the helmet of one tumbling him out of the saddle while the point of erlings lighter weapon pierced the throat of another  the remaining six turned aside right and left so as to divide their opponents and then attacked them with great furyfor they were all brave and picked men  at first erling and glumm had enough to do to defend themselves without attempting to attack but at a critical moment the horse of one of glumms opponents stumbled and his rider being exposed was instantly cut down  glumm now uttered a shout for he felt sure of victory having only two to deal with  erlings sword proved to be too short for such a combat for his enemies were armed with long and heavy weapons and one of them had a spear  he eluded their assaults however with amazing activity and wounded one of them so badly that he was obliged to retire from the fray  seeing this our hero made a sudden rush at one of the men who fought with a battleaxe seized the axe by the handle and with one sweep of his sword lopped off the mans arm  then did erling also feel that victory was secure for he now wielded an axe that was almost as good and heavy as his own and only one man stood before him  under the impulse of this feeling he uttered a shout which rang through the forest like the roar of a lion  now well would it have been for both erling and glumm if they had restrained themselves on that occasion for the shouts they uttered served to guide two bands of enemies who were in search of them  it will be remembered that hake the berserk had gone after our heroes by the forest road but not finding them so soon as he had anticipated and feeling a sort of irresistible belief that they had after all gone by the fells he altered his own plans in so far that he turned towards the road leading by the mountains before he reached the pine with the double stem  thus he just missed those whom he sought and after some time came to the conclusion that he was a fool and had made a great mistake in not holding to his original plan  by way of improving matters he divided his little band into two and sending five of his men in one direction rode off with the remaining four in another  krake on the contrary had fulfilled his orders to the letter had gone to the split rock and then hastened to the doublestemmed pine not far from which as we have seen he found the men of whom he was in search and also met his death  one of the bands of five men chanced to be within earshot when erling shouted and they immediately bore down in the direction and cheered as they came in sight of the combatants  the three men who yet stood up to our friends wheeled about at once and galloped to meet them only too glad to be reinforced at such a critical moment  there was a little stream which trickled over the edge of a rock close to the spot where the combat had taken place  erling and glumm leaped off their horses as if by one impulse and running to this drank deeply and hastily  as they ran back and vaulted into their saddles they heard a faint cheer in the far distance  ha exclaimed erling harald doubtless did send twenty men after all for here come the rest of them  it is good fortune that a berserk is seldom a good leaderhe should not have divided his force  these eight must go down friend glumm before the others come up else are our days numbered  the expression of glumms bloodstained visage spoke volumes but his tongue uttered never a word  indeed there was no time for further speech for the eight men who had conversed hurriedly together for a few seconds were now approaching  the two friends did not await the attack but setting spurs to their horses dashed straight at them two were overturned in the shock and their horses rolled on them so that they never rose again  on the right erling hewed down one man and on the left his friend cut down another  they reined up turned round and charged again but the four who were left were too wise to withstand the shock they swerved aside  in doing so the foot of one of their horses caught in a bramble  he stumbled and the rider was thrown violently against a tree and stunned so that he could not remount this was fortunate for erling and glumm were becoming exhausted and the three men who still opposed them were comparatively fresh  one of these suddenly charged glumm and killed his horse  glumm leaped up and drawing his knife stabbed the horse of the other to the heart  as it fell he caught his rider by the right wrist and with a sudden wrench dislocated his arm  erling meanwhile disabled one of the others and gave the third such a severe wound that he thought it best to seek safety in flight  erling now turned to glumm and asked if he thought it would be best to ride away from the men who were still to come up or to remain and fight them also  if there be five more said glumm leaning against a tree and removing his helmet in order to wipe his brow then is our last battle fought for although i have that in me which could manage to slay one i have not strength for two much less three  besides my good steed is dead and we have no time to catch one of the others  now will i become a berserk cried erling casting his gilt helmet on the ground and undoing the fastenings of his coat of mail  armour is good when a man is strong but when he is worn out it is only an encumbrance  i counsel thee to follow my example  it is not a bad one said glumm also throwing down his helmet and stripping off his armour  ha there are more of them than we counted onsix  as he spoke six horsemen were seen approaching through the distant glades of the forest  the two friends ran to the fountain before mentioned slaked their thirst and hastily bathed their heads and faces then seizing their swords and shields and leaving the rest of their armour on the sward they ran to a rugged part of the ground where horses could not act mounting to the highest point of a rocky mound they awaited the approach of their foes  quickly they came forward their faces blazing with wrath as they rode over the field of battle and saw their slaughtered comrades  hake the berserk rode in front and advancing as near as possible to the place where his enemies stood said tauntingly  what are ye so fearful of only six men after having slain so many  small meat would we make of thee and thy men so that the crows might pick it easily if we were only half as fresh as ye are said erling but we chose to rest here awhile so if ye would fight ye must come hither to us on foot  nay but methinks it would be well for both parties returned the berserk that they should fight on level ground  erling and glumm had thrown themselves on the rocks to get as much rest as possible before the inevitable combat that was still before them they consulted for a few seconds and then the former replied  we will gladly come down if ye will meet us on foot  agreed cried the berserk leaping off his horse and leading it to a neighbouring tree to which he fastened it  the others followed his example  then our two heroes arose and stretched themselves  it has been a good fight said erling  men will talk of it in days to come after we are far away in the world of spirits  there was deep pathos in the tone of the young warrior as he spoke these words and cast his eyes upwards to the blue vault as if he sought to penetrate that spirit world on the threshold of which he believed himself to stand  if we had but one hours rest or one other man on our side but he stopped suddenly for the six men now stood in the middle of the little plain where erling and glumm had fought so long and so valiantly that day and awaited their coming  hastily descending the mound the two friends strode boldly towards their opponents scorning to let them see by look or gesture that they were either fatigued or depressed  as they drew near erling singled out hake and glumm went towards a tall powerful man who stood ready with a huge sword resting on his shoulder as if eager to begin the combat  glumm had arranged in his own mind that that man and he should die together  beside him stood a warrior with a battleaxe and a steel helmet on his head  before glumm could reach his intended victim the tall mans sword flashed in the air like a gleam of light and the head with the steel helmet went spinning on the ground  thats the way that kettle flatnose pays off old scores cried the irish thrall turning suddenly upon his late friends and assailing one of them with such fury that he cut him down in a few seconds and then ran to draw off one of the two who had attacked erling  glumms amazement at this was as may well be believed excessive but it was nothing to the intensity of his joy when he found suddenly that the fight was now equalised and that there stood only one man to oppose him  his heart leaped up  new life gave spring to his muscles and to these new feelings he gave vent in one loud shout as he sprang upon his adversary and cleft him to the chin with one sweep of his sword  meanwhile kettle flatnose had killed his man and he was about to come up behind hake and sweep off his head when he was seized by glumm and dragged violently back  would ye rob erling of the honour of slaying this noted berserk he said sternly  truly replied kettle somewhat abashed i did not know that he was noted and as for the honour of it i do think that erling seems to have got honour enough today if all this be his work to content him for some time to come but as ye will he added putting the point of his sword on the ground and resting his arms on the hilt  glumm also leaned on his sword and standing thus these two watched the fight  now it may perhaps seem to some readers that as the other men had been disposed of so summarily it was strange that erling the bold should be so long in dispatching this one but for our heros credit we must point out several facts which may have perhaps been overlooked  in the first place kettle flatnose was a thoroughly fresh man when he began the fight and although he killed two men it must be remembered that one of these was slain while off his guard  then glumm did indeed slay his man promptly but he was one of king haralds ordinary menatarms whereas erling was opposed by one of the most celebrated of the kings warriorshake the berserk of hadelanda man whose name and prowess were known far and wide not only in norway but in denmark and all along the southern shores of the baltic  it would have been strange indeed had such a man fallen easily before any human arm much more strange had he succumbed at once to one that had been already much exhausted with fighting  true to the brotherhood to which he belonged the berserk attacked erling with incredible fury  he roared more like a mad bull than a man as he made the onset his eyes glared his mouth foamed and he bit his shield as he was driven back  being fresh he danced round erling perpetually springing in to cut and thrust and leaping back to avoid the terrific blows which the latter fetched at him with his weighty axe once he made a cut at erlings head which the latter did not attempt to parry intending to trust to his helmet to defend him and forgetting for the moment that he had cast that useful piece of armour on the plain  luckily the blow was not truly aimed  it shore a lock from erlings head as he swung his axe against his opponents shield and battered him down on his knees but the berserk leaped up with a yell and again rushed at him  hake happened just then to cast his eyes on the two men who were quietly looking on and he so managed the fight for a few moments afterwards that he got near to them  then turning towards them with a howl of demoniacal fury he made a desperate cut at the unsuspecting glumm who was taken so thoroughly by surprise that he made no movement whatever to defend himself  fortunately  kettle flatnose was on the alert but he had only time to thrust his sword awkwardly between glumms head and the descending weapon  the act prevented a fatal gash but it could not altogether arrest the force of the blow which fell on the flat of his sword and beat it down on glumms skull so violently that he was instantly stretched upon the green sward erlings axe fell on the helm of the berserk almost at the same time even in that moment of victory a feeling of respect for the courage and boldness of this man touched the heart of erling who with the swiftness of thought put in force his favourite practicehe turned the edge of the axe and the broad side of it fell on the steel headpiece with tremendous force causing the berserk of hadeland to stretch himself on the green sward beside glumm the gruff thus ending the famous battle of the berserkers and the bold in regard to which thikskul the scald writes    the bold one and his doughty friend   glumm the gruff of horlingsend   faced fought and felled and bravely slew   full twenty mena berserk crew   sent by king harald them to slay   but much he rued itlackaday   the heroes cut and hacked them sore   hit split and slashed them back and fore   and left them lying in their gore    chapter thirteen  shows that eloquence does not always flow when it is expected and that glumm begins a new course of action  on examination it was found that glumms hurt was not severe  he had merely been stunned by the force of the blow and there was a trifling wound in the scalp from which a little blood flowed  while kettle held a helmet full of water and erling bathed the wound the latter said  how comes it kettle that ye discovered our straits and appeared so fortunately  kettle laughed and said the truth is that accident brought me here you know that i had all but wrought out my freedom by this time but in consideration of my services in the battle at the springs ulf set me free at once and this morning i left him to seek service with king harald haarfager  that was thankless of thee said erling  so said ulf rejoined kettle nevertheless i came off and was on my way over the fells to go to the king when i fell in with hake the berserkthough i knew not that it was heand joined him  erling frowned and looked enquiringly at kettle as he said  but what possessed thee that thou shouldst quit so good a master for one so bad and how comes it thou hast so readily turned against the kings men  little wonder that you are perplexed said kettle seeing that ye know not my motive  the truth is that i had a plan in my head which was to enter haralds service that i might act the spy on him and so do my best for one who all the time i have been in thraldom has been as kind to me as if he had been my own father  thou meanest ulf said erling  i do replied kettle with enthusiasm and id willingly die for him if need be  as ye know full well it needs no wizard to tell that such men as ulf and your father will not easily be made to bend their necks to the kings yoke and for this i honour them because they respect the law of the land more than they respect the king  happy is the nation where such men abound and in saying this i do no dishonour to the king but the reverse  erling looked in surprise at kettle while he continued to bathe the face of his still unconscious friend for his language and bearing were much altered from what they had been when he was in thraldom and there was an air of quiet dignity about him which seemed to favour the common report that he had been a man of note in his own land  well continued kettle it is equally certain that harald is not a man who will tamely submit to be thwarted in his plans so i had made up my mind to take service with him in order that i might be able to find out his intentions and observe his temper towards the men of horlingdal and thus be in a position to give them timely warning of any danger that threatened  on my way hither i met hake as i have said  on hearing that he belonged to king harald i told him that i had just got my freedom from ulf and wished to join the king  he seemed very glad and said he thought i would make a good berserk told me that he was out in search of some of the kings enemies and proposed that i should assist him  of course this suited me well but it was only when we found you that i became aware who the kings enemies were and resolved to act as ye have seen me do  i did not choose to tell ulf my intention lest my plan should miscarry but now that i find who the king counts his foes and know how sharply he intends to treat them it seems to me that i need go no farther  truly thou needst not said erling for harald is in the worst possible humour with us all and did his best to stop me from going home to tell the fact  then is my mission ended  i will return to ulfstede said kettle throwing the water out of his helmet and replacing it on his head as he rose and grasped his sword  meanwhile i will cut off hakes head and take it back with me  thou wilt do so at thy peril said erling hake fell to my hand and i will finish the work which i have begun  do thou go catch three or four of the horses for i see that glumm is recovering  i will not interfere with your business said kettle with a laugh only i thought you meant to leave his carcass lying there unheeded and was unwilling to go off without his head as a trophy  kettle went to catch the horsesthree of which he tied to trees to be ready for them while he loaded the fourth with the most valuable of the arms and garments of the slain  meanwhile glumm groaned and sitting up rubbed his head ruefully  i thought someone had sent me to valhalla he said fetching a deep sigh  not yet friend glumm not yet  there is still work for thee to do on earth and the sooner ye set about doing it the better for methinks the king will wonder what has become of his berserkers and will send out men in search of them ere long  canst mount thy horse  mount him aye said glumm leaping up but staggering when he had gained his legs so that erling had to support him for a few minutes he put his hand to his forehead and observing blood on it asked is the wound deep  only a scratch said erling but the blow was heavy  if the sword of kettle flatnose had not caught it in time it would have been thy death  truly it has not been far from that as it is for my head rings as if the brain were being battered with thors hammer  come let us mount  as he spoke kettle brought forward the horses  glumm mounted with difficulty and they all rode away  but erling had observed a slight motion of life in the body of hake and after they had gone a few yards he said ride on slowly glumm i will go back to get a ring from the finger of the berserk which i forgot  he turned and rode quickly back to the place where the berserks body lay dismounted and kneeled beside it  there was a large silver ring on the middle finger of hakes right hand which he took off and put on his own finger replacing it with a gold one of his own  then he ran to the spring and filling his helmet with water came back and laved the mans temples therewith at the same time pouring a little of it into his mouth  in a few minutes he began to show symptoms of revival but before he had recovered sufficiently to recognise who his benefactor was erling had vaulted into the saddle and galloped away  they arrived at glummstede that evening about suppertime but glumm was eager to hear the discussion that was sure to take place when the news of the fight and of haralds state of mind was told so he rode past his own home and accompanied his friend to ulfstede  we cannot say for certain that he was uninfluenced by other motives for glumm as the reader knows was not a communicative man he never spoke to anyone on the subject we incline however to the belief that there were mingled ideas in his brain and mixed feelings in his heart as he rode to ulfstede  great was the sensation in the hall when erling glumm and kettle entered with the marks of the recent fight still visible upon them especially on glumm whose scalp wound being undressed permitted a crimson stream to trickle down his facea stream which in his own careless way he wiped off now and then with the sleeve of his coat thereby making his aspect conspicuously bloody  tremendous was the flutter in adas heart when she saw him in this plight for well did she know that deeds of daring had been done before such marks could have been left upon her gruff lover  the hall was crowded with armed men for many bonders had assembled to await the issue of the decision at the thing and much anxiety as well as excitement prevailed  ulf recognised his late thrall with a look of surprise but each of them was made to quaff a brimming tankard of ale before being allowed to speak  to say truth they were very willing to accept the draught which after the fatigues they had undergone tasted like nectar  erling then stood up and in the midst of breathless silence began to recount the incidents which had befallen him and his companion while in the execution of their mission  in the first place he said it is right to let ye all know that the kings countenance towards us is as black as a thundercloud and that we may expect to see the lightning flash out before long  but it is some comfort to add that glumm and kettle and i have slain or rendered unfit to fight twenty of haralds men  in the midst of the murmur of congratulation with which this announcement was received erling observed that hilda who had been standing near the door went out  the result of this was that the poor youths spirit sank and it was with the utmost difficulty he plucked up heart to relate the incidents of the fight in which he said so little about himself that one might have imagined he had been a mere spectator passing from that subject as quickly as possible he delivered his opinion as to the hopes and prospects before them and cutting his speech short abruptly quitted the hall  any little feeling of disappointment that might have been felt at the lame way in which erling had recounted his exploits was however amply compensated by glumm who although usually a man of few words had no lack of ideas or of power to express them when occasion required in a terse stern style of his own which was very telling  he gave a faithful account of the fight making mention of many incidents which his friend had omitted to touch on and dwelling particularly on the deeds of kettle  as to that flatnosed individual himself when called upon to speak he addressed the assembly with a dignity of manner and a racy utterance of language which amazed those who had only known him as a thrall and who now for the first time met him as a freed man  he moreover introduced into his speech a few touches of humour which convulsed his audience with laughter and commented on the condition of affairs in a way that filled them with respect so that from that hour he became one of the noted men of the dale  erling meanwhile hurried towards one of the cliffs overlooking the fiord  he was well acquainted with hildas favourite haunts and soon found her seated on a bank with a very disconsolate look which however vanished on his appearing  wherefore didst thou hasten away just as i began to speak hilda he said somewhat reproachfully as he sat down beside her  because i did not wish to hear details of the bloody work of which thou art so fond  why wilt thou always be seeking to slay thy fellows  the girl spoke in tones so sad and desponding that her lover looked upon her for some time in silent surprise  truly hilda he said the fight was none of my seeking  did i not hear thee say she replied that kettle and glumm and thou had slain twenty of the kings men and that ye regarded this as a comforting thought  aye surely but these twenty men did first attack glumm and me while alone and we slew them in selfdefence  never had i returned to tell it had not stout kettle flatnose come to our aid  thank heaven for that said hilda with a look of infinite relief how did it happen  come  i will tell thee all from first to last  and here is one who shall judge whether glumm and i are to blame for slaying these men  as he spoke the hermit approached  the old man looked somewhat paler than usual owing to the loss of blood caused by the wound he had received in his recent defence of ulfstede  erling rose and saluted him heartily for since the memorable prowess in the defence of ulfstede christian had been high in favour among the people of the neighbourhood  hilda and i were considering a matter of which we will make thee judge said erling as they sat down on the bank together  i will do my best said the hermit with a smile if hilda consents to trust my judgment  that she gladly does said the maid  well then i will detail the facts of the case said erling but first tell me what strange marks are those on the skin thou holdest in thy hand  these are words said the hermit carefully spreading out a roll of parchment on which a few lines were written  erling and hilda regarded the strange characters with much interest indeed the young mans look almost amounted to one of awe for he had never seen the scroll before although hilda to whom it had several times been shown and explained had told him about it  these marks convey thoughts said christian laying his forefinger on the characters  can they convey intricate thoughts asked erling such as are difficult to express  aye there is no thought which can quit the tongue of one man and enter the understanding of another which may not be expressed by these letters in different combinations  dim ideas of this have been in my mind said erling since i went on viking cruise to the south when first i heard of such a power being known to and used by many but i believed it not  if this be as thou sayest and these letters convey thy thoughts then though absent thy thoughts might be known to meif i did but understand the tracing of them  most true returned the hermit and more than that there be some who though dead yet speak to their fellows and will continue to do so as long as the records are preserved and the power to comprehend them be maintained  mysterious power said erling i should like much to possess it  if thou wilt come to my poor abode on the cliff i will teach it thee a few months or less will suffice  even hilda knows the names of the separate signs and she has applied herself to it for little more than a few days  hildas face became scarlet when erling looked at her in surprise but the unobservant hermit went on to descant upon the immense value of written language until hilda reminded him that he had consented to sit in judgment on a knotty point  true i had forgottencome now erling let me hear it  the youth at once began and in a few minutes had so interested his hearers that they gazed in his face and hung upon his words with rapt attention while he detailed the incidents of the combats with a degree of fluency and fervour that would have thrown the oratory of glumm and kettle quite into the shade had it been told in the hall  while erling was thus engaged his friend glumm having finished the recital of his adventures for the twentieth time and at the same time eaten a good supper was advised by his companions to have the wound in his head looked to  what hast thou not had it dressed yet asked ulf why that is very foolish  knowest thou not that a neglected wound may compass thy death come hither ada thy fingers are skilled in such offices  take glumm to an inner chamber and see if thou canst put his head to rights  methinks cried guttorm stoutheart with a laugh that she is more likely to put his heart wrong than his head right with these wicked black eyes of hers  have a care glumm they pierce deeper than the sword of the berserk  ada pretended not to hear this but she appeared by no means displeased as she led glumm to an inner chamber whither they were followed by alric whose pugnacious soul had been quite fascinated by the story of the recent fight and who was never tired of putting questions as to minute points  as glumm sat down on a low stool to enable ada to get at his head she said for she was very proud of her lovers prowess and her heart chanced to be in a melting mood that night thou hast done well today it would seem  it is well thou thinkest so replied glumm curtly remembering erlings adviceno boy he added in reply to alric i did not kill the one with the black helmet it was erling who gave him his deathblow  did hake the berserk look dreadfully fierce asked alric  he made a few strange faces replied glumm  the wound is but slight observed ada in a tone that indicated a little displeasure at the apparent indifference of her lover  it might have been worse replied glumm  do tell me all about it again entreated alric  not now said glumm ill repeat it when hilda is by she has not heard it yetmethinks she would like to hear it  hilda like to hear it cried the lad with a shout of laughter why she detests fighting almost as much as the hermit does though i must say for a man who hates it he can do it wonderfully well himself  but do tell me glumm what was the cut that erling gave when he brought down that second man you knowthe big one  which the man whose head he chopped off with half of the left shoulder  no that was the fourth  i mean the other one with  oh the one he split the nose of by accident before battering down with  no no cried alric i mean the one with the black beard  ha exclaimed glumm that wasnt the second man his fall was much further on in the fight just after erling had got hold of the battleaxe  he whirled the axe round his head brought it from over the left down on blackbeards right shoulder and split him to the waist  now that is finished said ada sharply as she put away the things that she had used in the dressing of the wound  i hope that every foe thou hast to deal with in future may let thee off as well  i thank thee ada both for the dressing and the good wish said glumm gravely as he rose and walked into the hall followed by his persevering and insatiable little friend  ada retired hastily to her own chamber where she stood for a moment motionless then twice stamped her little foot after which she sat down on a stool and covering her face with both hands burst into a passionate flood of tears    chapter fourteen  in which alric boasts a little discovers secrets confesses a little and distinguishes himself greatly  next day there was great bustle at ulfstede and along the shores of the fiord for the men of horlingdal were busy launching their ships and making preparations to go to the springs to meet and hold council with king harald haarfager  it had been finally resolved without a dissentient voice that the whole district should go forth to meet him in arms and thus ensure fair play at the deliberations of the thing  even haldor no longer objected but on the contrary when he heard his sons account of his meeting with the king and of the dastardly attempt that had been made to assassinate him and his friend there shot across his face a gleam of that wild ferocity which had procured him his title  it passed quickly away however and gave place to a look of sad resignation which assured those who knew him that he regarded their chance of opposing the king successfully to be very small indeed  the fleet that left the fiord consisted of the longships of ulf haldor erling glumm and guttorm besides an innumerable flotilla of smaller crafts and boats  many of the men were well armed not only with firstrate weapons but with complete suits of excellent mail of the kinds peculiar to the periodsuch as shirts of leather with steel rings sewed thickly over them and others covered with steel scales while of the poorer bonders and the thralls some wore portions of defensive armour and some trusted to the thick hides of the wolf which were more serviceable against a swordcut than many people might suppose  all had shields however and carried either swords bills spears javelins axes or bows and arrows so that numbering as they did about a thousand men they composed a formidable host  while these rowed away over the fiord to the springs to make war or peaceas the case might bewith king harald a disappointed spirit was left behind in horlingdal  im sure i cannot see why i should not be allowed to go too said little alric on returning to haldorstede after seeing the fleet set forth  of course i cannot fight so well as erling yet but i can do something in that way and can even face up to a fullgrown man when occasion serves as that redhaired dane knows full well methinks if he has got any power of feeling in his neck  this was said to herfrida who was in the great hall spreading the board for the midday meal and surrounded by her maidens some of whom were engaged in spinning or carding wool while others wove and sewed or busied themselves about household matters  have patience my son said herfrida  thou art not yet strong enough to go forth to battle  doubtless in three or four years  three or four years exclaimed alric to whom such a space of time appeared an age  why there will be no more fighting left to be done at the end of three or four years  does not father say that if the king succeeds in his illegal plans all the independence of the small kings will be gone for ever andandof course i am old enough to see that if the small kings are not allowed to do as they please there will be no more occasion for warnothing but a dull time of constant peace  herfrida laughed lightly while her warlike son strutted up and down the ancestral hall like a bantam cock frowning and grunting indignantly as he brooded over the dark prospects of peace that threatened his native land and thought of his own incapacity on account of youth to make glorious hay while yet the sun of war was shining  mother he said stopping suddenly and crossing his arms as he stood with his feet planted pretty wide apart after the fashion of those who desire to be thought very resolutemother i had a dream last night  tell it me my son said herfrida sitting down on a low stool beside the lad  now it must be known that in those days the northmen believed in dreams and omens and warningsindeed they were altogether a very superstitious people having perfect faith in giants good and bad elves dark and bright wraiths and fetches and guardian spirits insomuch that there was scarcely one among the grownup people who had not seen some of these fabulous creatures or who had not seen some other people who had either seen them themselves or had seen individuals who said they had seen them  there were also many clearsighted or foresighted old men and women who not only saw goblins and supernatural appearances occasionally and as it were accidentally like ordinary folk but who also had the giftso it is saidof seeing such things when they pleasedenjoyed as it were an unenviable privilege in that way  it was therefore with unusual interest that herfrida asked about her sons dream  it must have been mara nightmare i think he said for though i never had it before it seemed to me very like what guttorm stoutheart says he always has after eating too hearty a meal  relate it my son  well you must know said alric with much gravity and importance for he observed that the girls about the room were working softly that they might hear him i dreamed that i was out on the fells and there i met a dreadful wolf as big as a horse with two heads and three tails or three heads and two tails i mind not which but it gave me little time to notice it for before i was aware it dashed at me and i turned to run but my feet seemed to cleave to the earth and my legs felt heavy as lead so that i could scarce drag myself along yet strange to say the wolf did not overtake me although i heard it coming nearer and nearer every moment and i tried to shout but my voice would not come out  what hadst thou to supper last night asked herfrida  let me think replied the boy meditatively i had four cuts of salmon three rolls of bread and butter half a wildduck two small bits of saltfish some eggs a little milk and a horn of ale  it must have been mara said she thoughtfully but go on with thy dream  well just as i came to the brink of the river i looked back and saw the wolf close at my heels so i dropped suddenly and the wolf tumbled right over me into the water but next moment it came up in the shape of another monster with a fishs tail which made straight at me  then it all at once came into my head that my guardian spirit was behind me and i turned quickly round but did not see it  art thou quite sure of that my son  herfrida asked this in a tone of great anxiety for to see ones own guardian spirit was thought unlucky and a sign that the person seeing it was fey or deathdoomed  im quite sure that i did not replied alric to the manifest relief of his mother but i saw a long pole on the ground which i seized and attacked the beast therewith and a most notable fight we had  i only wish that it had been true and that thou hadst been there to see it mara fled away at once for i felt no more fear but laid about me in a way that minded me of erling  indeed i dont think he could have done it better himself  oh how i do wish sometimes that my dreams would come true  however i killed the monster at last and hurled him into the river after which i felt tossed about in a strange way and then my senses left me and then i awoke  what thinkest thou of the dream said herfrida to a wrinkled old crone who sat on a low stool beside the fire  the witchlike old creature roused herself a little and said  good luck is in store for the boy  thanks for that granny said alric canst say what sort o good luck it is  no my knowledge goes no further  it may be good luck in great things it may be only in small matters perhaps soon perhaps a long time hence i know not  having ventured this very safe and indefinite prophecy the old woman let her chin drop on her bosom and recommenced the rocking to and fro which had been interrupted by the question while alric laughed and taking up a threepronged spear said that as he had been disappointed in going to see the fun at the springs he would console himself by going and sticking salmon at the foss waterfall  wilt thou not wait for midday meal said herfrida  no mother this roll will suffice till night  and then thou wilt come home ravening and have mara again  be it so  id run the risk of that for the sake of the chance of another glorious battle such as i had last night  saying this the reckless youth sallied forth with the spear or leister on his shoulder and took the narrow bridle path leading up the glen  it was one of those calm bright days of early autumn in which men feel that they draw in fresh life and vigour at each inhalation  with the fragrant odours that arose from innumerable wild flowers including that sweetest of plants the lily of the valley was mingled the pleasant smell of the pines which clothed the knolls or hung here and there like eyebrows on the cliffs  the river was swollen considerably by recent heat which had caused the great glaciers on the mountain tops to melt more rapidly than usual and its rushing sound was mingled with the deeper roar of the foss or waterfall which leaped over a cliff thirty feet high about two miles up the valley  hundreds of rills of all sizes fell and zigzagged down the mountains on either side some of them appearing like threads of silver on the precipices and all river and rills being as cold as the perpetual icefields above which gave them birth  birds twittered in the bushes adding sweetness to the wild music and bright greens and purples lit up by gleams of sunshine threw a charm of softness over the somewhat rugged scene  the norse boys nature was sensitive and peculiarly susceptible of outward influences  as he walked briskly along casting his eager gaze now at the river which foamed below him and anon at the distant mountain ridges capped with perennial snows he forgot his late disappointment or which is the same thing drowned it in present enjoyment  giving vent to his delight much as boys did a thousand years later by violent whistling or in uproarious bursts of song he descended to the rivers edge with the intention of darting his salmon spear when his eye caught sight of a womans skirt fluttering on one of the cliffs above  he knew that hilda and ada had gone up the valley together on a visit to a kinswoman for herfrida had spoken of expecting them back to midday meal guessing therefore that it must be them he drew back out of sight and clambered hastily up the bank intending to give them a surprise  he hid himself in the bushes at a jutting point which they had to pass and from which there was a magnificent view of the valley the fiord and the distant sea  he heard the voices of the two girls in animated conversation as they drew near and distinguished the name of glumm more than once but not being a gossip by nature he thought nothing of this and was intent only on pouncing out on them when they should reach a certain stone in the path  truth constrains us to admit that our young friend like many young folk of the present day was a practical jokeryet it must also be said that he was not a very bad one and to his honour be it recorded he never practised jokes on old people  it chanced however that the two friends stopped short just before reaching the stone so that alric had to exercise patience while the girls contemplated the viewat least while hilda did so for on adas face there was a frown and her eyes were cast on the ground  how lovely horlingdal looks on such a day observed hilda  i have no eyes for beautiful things tonight said ada pettishly i cannot get over itsuch cool thankless indifference when i took the trouble to dress hishisstupid head and then not satisfied with telling the whole story over to thee who cares no more for it than if it were the slaying of half a dozen sheep he must needs go and pay frequent visits to ingeborg and to halgerda of the fossandandbut i know it is all out of spite and that he does not care a bodkin for either of them yet i cannot bear it and i wont bear it so he had better look to himself  and yet i would not for the best mantle in the dale that he knew i had two thoughts about the matter  but why play fast and loose with him said hilda with a laugh at her companions vehemence  because i like it and i choose to do so  but perchance he does not like it and does not choose to be treated so  i care not for that  truly thy looks and tone belie thee said hilda smiling  but in all seriousness ada let me advise thee again to be more considerate with glumm for i sometimes think that the men who are most worth having are the most easily turned aside  hast thou found it so with erling demanded ada halfangrily  hilda blushed scarlet at this and said  i never thought of erling in this light at least i neverhe never that is  fortunately at this point alric in his retreat among the bushes also blushed scarlet for it only then flashed upon him that he had been acting the mean part of an eavesdropper and had been listening to converse which he should not have heard  instead therefore of carrying out his original intention he scrambled into the path with as much noise as possible and coughed as he came awkwardly forward  why the wicked boy has been listening cried ada laying her hand upon the lads shoulder and looking sternly into his face  i have said alric bluntly  and art thou not ashamed  i am he replied with a degree of candour in his selfcondemnation which caused ada and hilda to burst into a hearty fit of laughter  but said ada becoming grave again thou hast heard too much for thy good  i know it he replied and im sorry ada but cannot help it now this will i say however i had no wish or intention to hear when i hid myself  my desire was only to startle thee and hilda and before i thought what thou wert talking of the thing was out and now i have got it i cannot unget it  true but thou canst keep it said ada  i can and ye may rest assured no word or look of mine shall betray thee  ill even try to conceal it from myself and think it was a dream unless indeed i see a good chance of helping thee in this affair  alric laughed as he said this and the girls joined him after which they all went on towards haldorstede together  on reaching the place where alric had intended to fish ada suggested that he should go and try his fortune so he ran down to the river and the girls followed him to the bank  the spot selected was a rapid which terminated in a small and comparatively quiet but deep pool  we say comparatively because in the state of the river at that time even in the quietest places there was considerable commotion  just below the pool the river opened out into a broad shallow over which it passed in noisy foam but with little depth except in the centre  below this again it narrowed and formed another deep pool  alric ran into the water till he was about kneedeep and then plunged his spear  nothing resulted from the first plunge but the effect of the second was more tremendous than had ever before happened to the young sportsman for the pole of the trident received a twist so violent that it would infallibly have been torn from the boys grasp had he not held on with the tenacity of a vice and allowed himself to be dragged bodily into the pool  as we have said the pool was deep but that was nothing to alric who could swim like a duck  the norse maidens who watched him knew this and although slightly alarmed felt on the whole more inclined to laugh than to tremble as his head emerged and sank again several times while the fish which he had struck dragged him about the pool  after a few seconds of violent and wild exertion it rushed down the pool into the rapid and then it was that the girls perceived that alric had struck and was clinging to one of the largestsized salmon that ever appeared in horlingdal river  fortunate it was for the boy that the fish took the rapid for it had almost choked him in the deep pool but now he scrambled on his feet and began to do battle gallantlyendeavouring to thrust the fish downwards and pin it to the stones whenever it passed over a shallow part on which occasions its back and silver sides became visible and its great tailwide spreading like a modern ladys fanflashed in the air as it beat the water in terror or fury  alrics spirit was ablaze with excitement for the fish was too strong for him so that every time it wriggled itself he was made to shake and stagger in a most ridiculously helpless manner and when it tried to bolt he was pulled flat down on his face and had to follow itsometimes on his knees sometimes at full length for over and over again when he was about to rise or had halfrisen there was another pull and down he went again quite flat while the roaring torrent went right over him  but no limpet ever stuck to rock with greater tenacity than did alric to the handle of that trident and it is but just to add for the information of those who know it not that the difficulty of retaining ones foothold on the pebbly bed of a river when kneedeep in a foaming rapid is very great indeed even when one has nothing more to do than attend to the balancing of ones own bodymuch greater of course in circumstances such as we describe  at last the salmon made a rush and was swept over a shallow part of the rapid close under the bank on which the girls stood  here alric succeeded in thrusting it against a large stone  for the first time he managed to stand up erect and although holding the fish with all his might looked up and breathed or rather gasped freely  hoch hah what a fish skho  oh i wish we could help thee exclaimed the girls with flashing eyes and outstretched hands as if they could hardly restrain themselves from leaping into the water which was indeed the case  nno ye cant s not possblehah my oh there e goes again stswash  down he went flat as he spoke and water stopped his utterance while the fish wriggled into the centre of the channel and carried him into the deep pool below  here the scene was not quite so exciting because the battle was not so fierce  the salmon had it all his own way in the deep water and dragged his attached friend hither and thither as he pleased  on the other hand alric ceased to contend and merely held on with his right hand while with his left he kept his head above water  the pool circled about in large oily wavelets flecked with foam so that there was a great contrast in all this to the tremendous turmoil of the raging rapid  but the comparative calm did not last long  the huge fish made a frantic and apparently a last effort to get free  it rushed down to the foot of the pool and passed over the edge into the next rapid  the girls shrieked when they saw this for unlike the former this one was a deep rush of the river between narrower banks where its course was obstructed by large rocks  against these the stream beat furiously alric knew the spot well and was aware of the extreme danger of his position  he therefore made a violent effort to drag the fish towards a point where there was a slight break or eddy among a number of boulders intending to let him go if necessary rather than lose his life  he succeeded however in getting upon one of the rocks quite close to the bank and then endeavoured to lift the fish out of the water  in this also he was successful made a splendid heave and flung it with all his force towards the bank on which it alighted trident and all at the feet of hilda  but in letting go his hold of the handle alric lost his balance flung his arms above his head in a vain endeavour to recover himself and with a loud shout fell back into the roaring torrent and was swept away  a few moments sufficed to carry him into the pool below to the edge of which the girls rushed and found that he was floating round and round in a state of insensibility every moment passing near to the vortex of the rapid that flowed out of it  hilda at once rushed in waistdeep and caught him by the collar  she would have been swept away along with him but ada also sprang forward and grasped hilda by the mantle  she could not however drag her back neither could hilda in any way help herself  thus they stood for a few moments swaying to and fro in the current and doubtless one or more of them would have soon been carried down had not efficient aid been at hand  high up on the cliff over the scene where this incident occurred christian the hermit was seated on a log before his door  he sat gazing dreamily out upon the landscape when alric began to fish but seeing the danger to which the lad exposed himself after he had speared the fish and fearing that there might be need of his aid he quickly descended to the scene of action  he did not arrive a moment too soon for the whole event occurred very rapidly  running to the rescue he caught ada round the waist with both hands and drew her gently back she was soon out of danger after which there was no great difficulty in dragging the others safely to land  at once the hermit stripped off the boys coat loosened the kerchief that was round his throat and sought by every means in his power to restore him to consciousness  his efforts were successful  the boy soon began to breathe and in a short time stood up swaying himself to and fro and blinking  the first thing he said was  where is the salmon  the salmon  oh i forgot all about it said ada  never mind it dear alric said hilda  never mind it he cried starting into sudden animation what have ye left it behind  saying this he burst away from his friends and ran up the bank of the river until he came to where the fish was lying still impaled on the barbed prongs of the trident  the run so far restored him that he had sufficient strength to shoulder the fish although it afterwards turned out to be a salmon of thirtyfive pounds weight and he quickly rejoined his friends who returned with him to haldorstede where you may be quite sure he gave a graphic account of the adventure to willing and admiring ears  so granny he said at the conclusion of the narrative to the old crone who was still seated by the fire thy prophecy has come true sooner than ye expected and it has come doubly true for though the good luck in store for me was a matter of small general importance no one can deny that it is a great fish    chapter fifteen  treats of ancient diplomacy among the norsemen and shows how our hero turns the tables on a wouldbe assassin  when king harald heard the news of the defeat of hake and the slaughter of his men by erling and glumm great was his wrath at first and jarl rongvold had much ado to appease him and prevent him from going at once to horlingdal to ravage it with fire and sword  but when he had cooled a little and heard the details of the fight from hake himself his anger against the young warriors changed into admiration of their dauntless courage  harald fairhair was a kingly man in spirit as well as in appearance and was above encouraging a mean or vengeful mood  he was indeed fierce and violent in his rage and often did things which when read of in the calm of a comparatively peaceful time make one shudder but it must not be forgotten that the age in which he lived was a cruel and bloody one and in norway without one touch of the gentle religion of christ to soften its asperities  he could never have retained his power and rule over the stern warriors of his day had he not possessed much of their own callous indifference to the horrors and cruelties of war  thou hadst tougher work than thou countedst on it would seem he said to hake then turning to jarl rongvold with a laugh methinks i would fain have this erling the bold and his friend glumm the gruff among my menatarms  i fear sire that they will not be easily induced to enter thy service for they are both seakings and independent spirits  such men have submitted to us before now said the king with a peculiar glance  most true returned the jarl flushing but all men have not the same belief in your wisdom  that may be yet methinks i could tame this seakingthis erling perchance costly gifts might win him or it may be that rough blows would suit him better  what thinkest thou hake thou hast had some experience in that way  if you mean sire that you have a mind to receive rough blows at his hand i will guarantee him both able and willing to gratify you  i know not the weight of thors hammer but i am bound to say that it occurred to my mind when erlings axe came down on my steel headpiece and set a host of stars dancing in my brain  i believe thee said the king smiling grimly and thy visage speaks for itself  this was indeed the case  the berserks countenance was very pale  he still suffered from the crashing blow with which he had been felled and his heart rankled under his defeat for he was not aware that the blow heavy though it was had been delivered in mercy or that if his enemy had not turned aside the edge of his axe it would have cleft him to the chin  perchance if he had known this it would not have improved the state of his feelings for hake possessed no nobility of spirit  it may be continued harald that thou shalt have another opportunity of measuring swords with this seaking  meanwhile jarl rongvold go thou with rolf and bring round the dragon and the other longships to the fiord for i mistrust the men of this district and will fare to the springs by sea  in accordance with these instructions the jarl brought the kings fleet round without delay  on the following morning they embarked and set sail for the appointed place of meeting  here the fleet under haldor and ulf had already cast anchor  the ships lay close to the rocks near the mouth of the river into which erling had thrust his cutter just before the battle with the danes and a fine sight it was to behold these with their painted shields and gilded masts and figureheads lying in the still water crowded with armed warriors while haralds longship the dragon and all his other vessels came by twos and threes into the fiord the oars tossing foam on the blue waters and the gaily coloured sails swelling out before a gentle breeze  the king laid his ship alongside of a point of rocks on the south side of the bay  then when all the fleet had assembled both parties landed and the thing was summoned by sound of horn  it was held on the level ground where the recent battle had been fought  there were still strewn about many evidences of the ferocity of that fight and when the king looked upon the host of stout and wellarmed men who had assembled not only from horlingdal but from the whole of the surrounding district he felt that however much he might wish to force obedience on his subjects discretion was at that time the better part of valour  when the thing was assembled the king stood up to speak and there was probably not a man upon the ground who did not in his heart acknowledge that the tall stout warrior with the thick mass of golden locks and the large masculine features was as far as physique went a worthy wearer of the crown of norway  it may be added that physique went a very long way indeed in those days yet it is due to the northmen to say that at the same time intellect was held in higher repute among them than among any of the feudally governed nations of europe  one evidence of this was that at the things the best speaker no matter what his rank had a better chance of swaying the people than the king himself while in other countries might to a large extent was right and no one dared to open his mouth against him who chanced to be in power  but king harald haarfagers power lay not merely in his personal appearance and indomitable will  he was also a good speaker and like all good speakers in a wrong cause was an able sophist  but he had men to deal with who were accustomed to think and reason closely as must ever be more or less the case with a selfgoverned people  there were acute men there men who had the laws of the land by heart in the most literal sense of those wordsfor there were no books to consult and no precedents to cite in those days and his hearers weighed with jealous care each word he said  the king began by complimenting the men of the district for their spirit and their resolution to defend the laws of the realm and he enlarged a little on these laws and on the wisdom of his own father halfdan the black and the men of his time who had made and modified many of them  then he went on to say that with time the circumstances of nations altered and that with these alterations there arose a necessity for the alteration and modification of old laws as well as for the making of new ones  he deprecated the idea that he wished as had been said of him to trample the laws under his feet and rule the country according to his own will and pleasure  nothing was further from his intention or his desire  his wish was to amend the laws especially those of them that touched on the relative position of king and people  up to this point the people heard him with respectful attention and hundreds of those who were more addicted to fighting than to reasoning especially among the younger men began to think that after all harald entertained exceedingly just opinions and appeared to possess a spirit of candour and fair play which did not seem to justify the outcry that had been raised against him  even these however remembered that it was not very long since a small king of one of the northern glens had been summoned by harold to submit to his views of government and on his declining to do so had been burnt with all his family and followers in his own house contrary to law  they therefore knitted their brows and waited to hear more  the king then began to explain his ideas with regard to the royal authority over the chief men of the districts some of which are already known to the reader  at this point the assembly listened with deep earnest attention  some of the men sat with hands clasped on their knees and with stern downcast brows  some gazed up at the clouds with the peculiar expression of men who listen and weigh arguments  others leaned on their swords or shields and with compressed lips and suspicious gaze looked the king full in the face while a few regarded him with a sneer but the expression on the faces of the greater part denoted manliness of feeling and honesty of purpose  after harald had stated his views and assured them that his great aim was to consolidate the kingdom and to prevent the evils that flowed from the almost unlimited independence of the petty kings he asked the assembly to aid him in carrying out his wishes and to set an example of fidelity and obedience which would restrain others from showing that unseemly opposition to him which had only resulted in severe and merited punishment  he then sat down amid a murmur of mingled applause and disapprobation  after a few minutes of animated converse among themselves there arose an old man with a bald head a flowing beard and sightless eyes  he was the lagman or district judge and lawexpounder of horlingdal deep silence ensued and he said in a decided though somewhat tremulous tone  king harald i am a very old man now and can remember the time when your noble sire halfdan the black ruled in norway  i have fought by his side and lost my eyes in his servicein a fight in which our opponents gave us the toothache  norse expression signifying the worst of it i have also heard him speak those words of wisdom to which you have referred and have seen him bow to the laws which were made not by himself but by him in conjunction with the thing legally assembled for the purpose  there was a loud murmur of applause at this point  and now that we have heard the kings opinions continued the old man turning to the people and know that his intentions are good although the manner in which he has set about carrying them into effect is undoubtedly wrong my counsel is that we nevertheless submit to him in this matter for we know that a great number of the small kings have already submitted and it were better to have a beneficial changeeven when not carried out exactly according to lawthan to plunge this country into prolonged and useless warfare in which much blood will assuredly be spilt and nothing of any value gained  the lagman sat down but only a few of those present indicated their approval of his sentiments  immediately haldor the fierce stood up and men could see that his spirit was stirred within him for a dark frown lowered on a brow which was at most times fair and unruffled like the summer sky  there was deep silence in the assembly before he began to speak and the king despite the suppressed anger which rankled in his breast could not choose but look upon his commanding figure with respect also with surprise for he recognised the strong resemblance between him and erling though he knew not their relationship  i agree not said haldor with what has just been said by our respected lagman  a change even for the better ought never to be accepted if not made according to law no one can say that any change will certainly be for the better until it is tried and should this one perchance turn out for the worse then shall we have neither advantage nor law on our side  for my part i had rather see my country plunged into warfarewhich no one unless he is gifted with the foreknowledge of the gods can say will be either prolonged or uselessthan see her laws trampled under foot for well do i know that if the king be permitted to make himself an outlaw blood will be kept boiling perpetually from one end of the land to the other and it were better methinks that that blood should spill than boil  my counsel is that the king be advised to call a thing in the regular way so that the changes he would make shall be fully considered and either be made law or rejected for if he attempts to enforce his plans on us as he has done on other small kings we will assuredly resist him as long as there is a man left in the district to wield a battleaxe  there was a great shout and clash of arms when this was said and the kings face became crimson with rage for he saw clearly that the feeling of the majority was against him  at this point jarl rongvold stood up and spoke in the bland tones of a man who wishes to throw oil on troubled waters  he said that it was his earnest entreaty to the bonders and householding men both great and small then and there assembled that they should calmly consider the proposals of the king and not allow themselves to be carried away by unsound reasoning although it might seem very plausible for he was certain that the kings desire was the good of the country and although circumstances had rendered it necessary that some of the rebellious should be punished no one could say that the king was not willing and ready to do all that he did in a fair open and straightforward manner  at this erling was unable to restrain himself  he sprang up and with a passionate flow of words that burst forth like a mountain torrent exclaimed  thinkest thou jarl rongvold that our brains are so addled that we cannot distinguish between black and white  is thy memory so short is thy slavery to the king so complete that thou must say evil is good and good evil  hast thou and has the king so soon forgotten that two strangers came to the court with a message from one of the legal assemblies of this landthat trusting to the honour of the king they came without following and with only such arms as were needful for personal defenceand that the honour to which they trusted was not proof against the temptation to send a noted berserk and nineteen men to waylay and slay them  is all this clean gone from your memory jarl and king or is your wit so small that ye should think we will believe in soft words about fair play when such foul deeds are so recent that the graves are yet wet with the blood of those whom glumm and i were compelled to slay in selfdefence  at this the king started up and his face became white and red by turns as he said  ye shall both of you rue this day erling and glumm  erling made no reply but glumm started up and was in so great a passion that he could hardly speak nevertheless he made shift to splutter out  threats king harald are like water spilt on a shield which can only rust if left there i wipe them off and fling them away  he could add no more but with a contemptuous motion of the hand he struck his fist violently against his shirt of mail and the bonders laughed while they applauded him  then stood up a man in the troop of the springdal men who was of great stature and grim countenance clad in a leather cloak with an axe on his shoulder and a great steel hat upon his head  he looked sternly and said  when rights are not respected then the crows flap their wings and caw for they know that ere long they shall glut themselves with human blood  he sat down and immediately after ulf of romsdal stood up  ulf had fully as much fire as erling or glumm but he possessed greater power of selfrestraint and as he spoke with deliberation his words had all the more weight  he said  king harald when in the exercise of our udal rights we bonders elected thee to be our king at the thing held in drontheim we stated and traced thy descent from odin through the vingling dynasty proved thy udal right to the crown and truly thought that we had placed it on the head of one who would walk in the footsteps of his father and respect that authority and power in virtue of which he held his own high position but we now find that thou hast constituted thyself a law higher than the law which made thee what thou art and thou now wouldst have us of our own free will bend our necks so low that thou mayest with the more ease set thy foot on them and keep us down  we have served thee in all good faith up to the present time we have readily met thy demands for men ships arms and money by calling together our assemblies and voting these supplies and now thou wouldst rob us of this our old right and tax us without our consent so that thou mayest raise men for thyself and have it all thine own way  this must not shall not be  even now we bonders will unanimously hold by the law if it be passed in the proper assembly and receives our yea and we will follow thee and serve thee as our king as long as there is a living man amongst us  but thou king must use moderation towards us and only require of us such things as it is lawful or possible for us to obey thee in  if however thou wilt take up this matter with a high hand and wilt try thy power and strength against us we have resolved among ourselves to part with thee and to take to ourselves some other chief who will respect those laws by which alone society can be held together  now king harald thou must choose one or other of these conditions before the thing is ended  the loud applause which followed this speech showed that the bonders heartily sympathised with it and indeed several of them rose and said that it expressed their will exactly and they would stand or fall by what had been spoken  when silence had been restored jarl rongvold who had whispered in the kings ear some earnest words stood forth and said  it is king haralds will to give way to you in this matter for he does not wish to separate himself from your friendship  this brought the thing to a close  thereafter the two parties returned to their ships intending to feast and pass the night in them  the king was very affable and invited haldor and some of the others whose language had been comparatively moderate to feast with him but they declined the honour and retired to their own ships  in the evening while the sounds of revelry were heard everywhere a boat approached erlings ship  it was rowed by a single man who when it touched her side leaped on board and went aft to where erling was seated with guttorm stoutheart  king harald would speak with thee said the man who was no other than hake the berserk  methinks his intentions can scarce be friendly said erling with a grim smile when he sends so trusty a messenger  it may be so replied hake coolly but that is nothing to me  my business is to deliver the message and offer to conduct thee to him  and pray what surety have i that thou wilt not upset me in the fiord asked erling laughing  the surety that if i upset thee we shall be on equal terms in the water replied hake gruffly  nay that depends on which of us can swim best returned erling and truly if thou canst fight as well in the water as on the land we should have a rare struggle hake  am i to say to the king that thou art afraid of him asked the berserk with a look of scorn  yea truly if it is thy desire to tell him a lie retorted erling but get thee into the boat fellow i will follow anon  hake turned on his heel and returned to the boat while erling took guttorm aside  now art thou fey  deathdoomed said guttorm  what has made thee so tired of life that thou shouldest put thy neck under his heel thus readily  fear not my friend said erling now that i have seen king harald a second time i think him a better man than at first i did  ambition will no doubt lead him to do many things that are contrary to his nature but i do not think he will violate the laws of hospitality after what has passed  however i may be wrong so i would ask thee guttorm to go aboard of your ship which lies nearest to that of the king and should ye see anything like a struggle or hear a shout do thou haste to the rescue  i will have my men also in readiness  while the stouthearted old seaking in compliance with this request got into a small boat and rowed to his own vessel erling gave particular directions to his chief housecarle to keep a sharp lookout and be ready to act at a moments notice  then he went into hakes boat and was rowed alongside the dragon where the king received him with much condescension and took him aft to the cabin under the high poop  here he offered him a horn of ale which however erling declined and then began to use his utmost powers of persuasion to induce him to enter his service  at first he tried to influence him by flattery and commended him for his bold and straightforward conduct at the thing which he said showed to all men that he merited well his distinctive title but on finding that our hero was not to be won by flattery he quickly and adroitly changed his ground began to talk of the future prospects of norway and the necessity for improved legislation  in this he was so successful that he secured the interest and to some extent the sympathy of the young warrior who entered eagerly and somewhat more respectfully into the discussion  but sire he said at the close of one of the kings remarks if these are your sentiments why did you not state them more fully today at the thing and why should you not even now call a meeting of the stor thing and have the matter properly discussed by all in the land who have a right to speak  hadst thou had any experience of kingcraft erling thou hadst not asked the question  if i were now to do as thou dost suggest the numerous small kings who have already been put down by force would band against me and bring such a following of opponents to the thing that fair discussion would be out of the question  erling thought in his own mind one false step always necessitates another you should have called a meeting of the thing before putting down anyone however he did not give utterance to the thought but said  i think you are mistaken sire there may be many who out of revenge might oppose you but certain am i that those who would vote for that which is for the wellbeing of the land would form a vast majority besides it is the only course left open to you  at this the king flushed with a feeling of anger and drawing himself up touched the hilt of his sword without uttering a word  when i said the only course remarked erling i meant the only lawful course  sorry should i be to see you king harald draw the sword in a bad cause but if you do be assured that thousands of good blades will gleam in opposition  at this the kings eyes flashed and turning suddenly upon erling he shook back the masses of his yellow hair with lionlike ferocity exclaiming  dost thou dare to speak thus to me in mine own ship erling  it is because i am in your ship that i dare  were i in my own the laws of hospitality had shut my mouth  knowest thou not said the king waxing still more angry at the rebuke conveyed in this speech and laying his hand on his sword that i have power to shut thy mouth now and for ever  it may be so and it may be not so replied erling stepping back and laying his hand on the hilt of his own weapon  at this the king laughed sarcastically  and if said he thou hadst the power and skill to overcome my feeble arm hast thou the folly to think that ye could clear the dragon of all her men  erling replied the remembrance king harald of the way in which i treated some of thy men in the woods not long ago inclines me to believe that i could give them some trouble to slay me and the thought of that transaction induced me before i came hither to make such arrangements that at all events my fall should not go unavenged  for a moment or two the kings countenance lowered ferociously on the youth and he ground his teeth together as if unable to restrain his passion but suddenly he uttered a short laugh and said  truly thou shouldst have been styled prudent as well as bold  but go i will take counsel with others and perhaps thou shalt hear again of this matter  our hero retired immediately but he observed in passing that hake was summoned to attend the king and that another man stepped into the boat to row him to his own ship  is all well growled the rich voice of old guttorm as he passed the vessel of that worthy  erling told the rower to stop and glancing up beheld the stern yet goodhumoured visage of his bluff friend looking over the rows of bright shields that hung on the bulwarks  all is well replied erling  it is well for the king that it is so rejoined guttorm for my hand was itching to give him a taste of our northern metal  assuredly if a mouse had but squeaked on board the dragon i had deemed it sufficient ground on which to have founded an immediate onslaught  but get thee to bed erling and let me advise thee to sleep with thy windward eye open  trust me said erling with a laugh as he pushed off i will not sleep with both eyes shut tonight  getting on board his own ship erling said to his footboy  i will not sleep in my bed tonight for i suspect there may be treachery abroad  thou shalt keep watch therefore in case anything may happen in the night and if thou shalt see me strive with anyone do not alarm the men  meanwhile go thou and fetch me a billet of wood and let it be a large one  the boy quickly brought from the hold one of the largest billets of wood he could find and gave it to his master who laid it in his own bed which was under a small tent spread over the aft part of the vessel close to the poop  having covered it up carefully he sent the boy forward and went himself to lie down elsewhere  at midnight a boat was rowed stealthily alongside  it was guided by one man and moved so silently that the lightest sleeper on board could not have been awakened by it  the man stepped on board lifted up the cloth of the tent over the bulwarks looked cautiously all round him and then went up and struck in erlings bed with a great axe so that it stuck fast in the billet of wood  next instant the man felt his neck in a grip like that of an iron vice and his face was thrust upon the ground and held there while a heavy knee pressed into the small of his back so that he was utterly unable to rise  erlings footboy saw the whole of this and heard what followed for the curtain of the tent was raised but he moved neither hand nor foot though he held a spear ready for instant action if required  it ill becomes thee hake said erling to seek my life a second time after making such poor work of it the first  what wilt thou not lie quiet  while he was speaking the berserk struggled with the fury of a madman to free himself but erlings grip perhaps his own wisdom also prevented him from shouting and erlings knee prevented the struggles from making much noise  finding however that he would not be quiet our hero tightened the pressure of his left hand until the tongue and eyes of the berserk began to protrude and his face to get black while with his right hand he drew his knife and ran the point of it about a quarter of an inch into the fleshy part of hakes back  the effect was instantaneous  hake could face danger and death bravely and could hurl defiance at his foe with the best when on his legs but when he felt the point of the cold steel and knew that the smallest impulse would cause it to find a warm bed in his heart his fury vanished  brave and bold though he was and a berserk to boot he sank quietly down and lay perfectly still  erling at once relaxed the pressure of his fingers and allowed hake to breathe but he let the point of the knife remain that it might refresh his memory while he read him a lesson  now hake let me tell thee that thou richly deservest to lose thy life for twice hast thou sought to take mine in an unfair way and once have i spared thine  however thou art but a tool after all so i will spare it againand i do it the more readily that i wish thee to convey a message to thy master king harald who i doubt not has sent thee on this foul errand  erling here signalled to his footboy whom he directed to bind hakes arms securely behind his back  this having been done erling suffered him to rise and stand before him  see now he said taking a silver ring from his finger knowest thou this ring hake  ah i see by thy look that thou dost  well i will return it to thee and claim mine own  he turned the berserk round took off the gold ring which he had placed on his finger on the day of the fight and put the silver one in its place  by these tokens said he thou mayest know who it was that cared for thee in the wood after the fight and restored thy consciousness instead of cutting off thy head as he might easily have done  i know not why i did it hake save that the fancy seized me for thou art an undeserving dog  but now we will take thee back to thy master and as our message can be conveyed without the use of speech we will bind up thy mouth  so saying erling gagged the berserk who looked dreadfully sulky with a strip of sailcloth  then he made him sit down and tied his legs together with a piece of rope after which he lifted him in his arms to the side of the ship and laid him down  go fetch me a stout carle he said to the footboy who went forward and immediately returned with a strapping manatarms  the man looked surprised but asked no questions as erling directed him in a low tone to assist in lifting the prisoner into the boat as quietly as possible  then they placed the lump of wood with the axe sticking in it beside him  this accomplished they rowed silently to the side of the dragon where a sentinel demanded what they wanted  we bring a prisoner to king harald answered erling  we have him here tied hand and foot  who is he asked the sentinel for there was not so much light as is usual at midnight of that time of the year owing to a mist on the sea  thou shalt see when he is aboard  hoist him up then said the man erling and his carle raised hake over the bulwarks and let him drop heavily on the deck  then erling seized the lump of wood and hurled it on board with considerable force so that hitting the sentinel on the head it bounded onwards to the after part of the ship and struck against the tent under which harald lay  the king sprang out sword in hand but erling had pushed off and was already enveloped in the mist  as they rowed away they heard a great clamour on board the dragon but it was quickly hushed by a stern voice which erling knew to be that of the king  no pursuit was attempted  erling got back to his own ship and setting a watch lay down to rest  in the morning no notice was taken of what had occurred during the night  the king evidently pretended that he knew nothing about the matter  he again met with the chief men of the district and made them many promises and many complimentary speeches but in his heart he resolved that the day should come when every one of them should either bow before his will or lose his life  the bonders on the other hand listened with due respect to all the king said but it need scarcely be added that their lips did not express all their thoughts for while the sanguine and more trustful among them felt some degree of hope and confidence there were others who could not think of the future except with the most gloomy forebodings  in this mood the two parties separated  the king sailed with his warships out among the skerries intending to proceed north to drontheim while haldor the fierce with his friends and men went back to horlingdal    chapter sixteen  relates to such elementary matters as the a b c and touches on lovemaking in the olden time  after the occurrence of the events just narrated king haralds attention was diverted from the people of horlingdal and the neighbouring districts by the doings of certain small kings against whom it became necessary that he should launch his whole force  these were king hunthiof who ruled over the district of more and his son solve klofe also king nokve who ruled over romsdal and was the brother of solves mother  these men were great warriors  hearing that king harald was sailing north they resolved to give him battle  for this purpose they raised a large force and went out among the skerries to intercept him  we do not intend here to go into the details of the fight that followed or its consequences  it is sufficient for the proper development of our tale to say that they met at an island in north more named solskiel where a pitched battle was fought and gained by harald  the two kings were slain but solve klofe escaped and afterwards proved a great thorn in haralds side plundering in north more killing many of the kings men pillaging some places burning others and generally making great ravage wherever he went so that what with keeping him and similar turbulent characters in check and establishing law and order in the districts of the two kings whom he had slain king harald had his hands fully occupied during the remainder of that summer and was glad to go north to spend the winter peacefully in drontheim  the families and neighbours therefore of those with whom our tale has chiefly to do had rest during that winter  how some of them availed themselves of this period of repose may be gathered from a few incidents which we shall now relate  in the first place erling the bold spent a large proportion of his time in learning the alphabet  now this may sound very strange in the ears of many people in modern times but their surprise will be somewhat abated when we tell them that the art of writing was utterly unknown though probably not unheard of in norway at the end of the ninth century and long after that so that erling although a gentleman of the period and a seaking to boot had not up to the time we write of learned his a b c  it is just possible that antiquaries recalling to mind the fact that the art of writing was not introduced among the norse colonists of iceland until the eleventh century may be somewhat surprised to learn that our hero acquired the art at all  but the fact is that there always have been in all countries men who were what is popularly termed born before their timemen who were in advance intellectually of their agemen who overleaping the barriers of prejudice managed to see deeper into things in general than their fellows and to become more or less famous  now our hero erling the bold was one of those who could see beyond his time and who became almost prophetically wise that is to say he was fond of tracing causes onwards to their probable effects to the amusement of the humorous the amazement of the stupid and the horrification of the few who even in those days of turmoil trembled at the idea of change  everything therefore that came under his observation claimed and obtained his earnest attention and was treated with a species of inductive philosophy that would have charmed the heart of lord bacon had he lived in those times  of course this new wonder of committing thoughts to parchment which the hermit had revealed to him was deeply interesting to erling who began to study it forthwith and we beg leave to tell antiquaries that we have nothing to do with the fact that no record is left of his studiesno scrap of his writing to be found  we are not responsible for the stupidity or want of sympathy in his generation  doubtless in all ages there have been many such instances of glorious opportunities neglected by the worldneglected too with such contempt that not even a record of their having occurred has been made  perchance some such opportunities are before ourselves just now in regard to our neglect of which the next generation may possibly have to hold up its hands and turn up its eyes in amazement but be this as it may the fact remains that although no record is handed down of any knowledge of letters at this period in norway erling the bold did nevertheless become acquainted with them to some extent  erling began his alphabet after he had passed the mature age of twenty years and his teacher was the fair hilda  it will be remembered that in one of their meetings the hermit had informed erling of his having already taught the meaning of the strange characters which covered his parchments to the norse maiden and that she had proved herself an apt scholar  erling said nothing at the time except that he had a strong desire to become better acquainted with the writing in question but he settled it then and there in his heart that hilda and not the hermit should be his teacher  accordingly when the fishings and fightings of the summer were over the young warrior laid by his sword lines and trident and seating himself at hildas feet went diligently to work  the schoolroom was the hermits hut on the cliff which overlooked the fiord  it was selected of necessity because the old man guarded his parchments with tender solicitude and would by no means allow them to go out of his dwelling except when carried forth by his own hand  on the first occasion of the meeting of the young couple for study christian sat down beside them and was about to expound matters when erling interposed with a laugh  no no christian thou must permit hilda to teach me because she is an old friend of mine who all her life has ever been more willing to learn than to teach  therefore am i curious to know how she will change her character  be it so my son said the hermit with a smile folding his hands on his knee and preparing to listen and if need be to correct  be assured erling said hilda that i know very little  enough for me no doubt returned the youth  for a day or two perhaps said the tooliteral hilda but after that christian will have  after that interrupted erling it will be time enough to consider that subject  hilda laughed and asked if he were ready to begin  to which erling replied that he was and sitting down opposite to his teacher bent over the parchment which for greater convenience she had spread out upon her knee  well began hilda with a slight feeling of that pardonable selfimportance which is natural to those who instruct others older than themselves that is the first letter  which asked erling gazing up in her face  that one there with the long tail to it  dost thou see it  yes replied the youth  how canst thou say so erling remonstrated hilda when thou art looking all the time straight in my face  but i do see it returned he a little confused i am looking at it now  well said she that is  thou art looking at it upside down my son said the hermit who had been observing them with an amused expression of countenance  oh so he is i never thought of that cried hilda laughing thou must sit beside me erling so that we may see it in the same way  this one now with the curve that way she went on dost thou see it  see it thought erling of course i see it the prettiest little hand in all the dale  but he only said  how can i see it hilda when the point of thy finger covers it  oh well drawing the finger down a little thou seest it now  yes  well that iswhy where is christian she exclaimed looking up suddenly in great surprise and pointing to the stool on which the hermit certainly had been sitting a few minutes before but which was now vacant  he must have gone out while we were busy with thethe parchment said erling also much surprised  he went like a mouse then said hilda for i heard him not  nor i added her companion  very strange said she  now there was nothing particularly strange in the matter  the fact was that the old man had just exercised a little of erlings philosophy in the way of projecting a cause to its result  as we have elsewhere hinted the hermit was not one of those ascetics who in ignorance of the truth banished themselves out of the world  his banishment had not been selfimposed  he had fled before the fierce persecutors  they managed to slay the old mans wife however before they made him take to flight and seek that refuge and freedom of conscience among the pagan northmen which were denied him in christian europe  in the first ten minutes after the a b c class began he perceived how things stood with the young people and wisely judging that the causes which were operating in their hearts would proceed to their issue more pleasantly in his absence he quietly got up and went out to cut firewood  after this the hermit invariably found it necessary to go out and cut firewood when erling and hilda arrived at the school which they did regularly three times a week  this of course was considered a very natural and proper state of things by the two young people for they were both considerate by nature and would have been sorry indeed to have interrupted the old man in his regular work  but erling soon began to feel that it was absolutely essential for one of them to be in advance of the other in regard to knowledge if the work of teaching was to go on for while both remained equally ignorant the fiction could not be kept up with even the semblance of propriety  to obviate this difficulty he paid solitary nocturnal visits to the hut on which occasions he applied himself so zealously to the study of the strange characters that he not only became as expert as his teacher but left her far behind and triumphantly rebutted the charge of stupidity which she had made against him  at the same time our hero entered a new and captivating region of mental and spiritual activity when the hermit laid before him the portions of holy scripture which he had copied out before leaving southern lands and expounded to him the grand the glorious truths that god had revealed to man through jesus christ our lord  and profoundly deep and startling even to himself were the workings of the young norsemans active mind while he sat there night after night in the lone hut on the cliff poring over the sacred rolls or holding earnest converse with the old man about things past present and future    chapter seventeen  in which glumm takes to hunting on the mountains for consolation and finds it unexpectedly while alric proves himself a hero  i go to the fells today said glumm to alric one morning as the latter opened the door of glummstede and entered the hall  i go also said alric leaning a stout spear which he carried against the wall and sitting down on a stool beside the fire to watch glumm as he equipped himself for the chase  art ready then for the day is late said glumm  all busked replied the boyi say glumm is that a new spear thou hast got  aye i took it from a swedish viking the last fight i had off the coast  we had a tough job of it and left one or two stout men behind to glut the birds of odin but we brought away much booty  this was part of it he added buckling on a long huntingknife which was stuck in a richly ornamented sheath and that silver tankard too besides the red mantle that my mother wears and a few other thingsbut my comrades got the most of it  i wish i had been there glumm said alric  if hilda were here lad she would say it is wrong to wish to fight  hilda has strange thoughts observed the boy  so has erling remarked his companion  and so has ada said alric with a sly glance  glumm looked up quickly  what knowest thou about ada said he  the sly look vanished before glumm had time to observe it and an expression of extreme innocence took its place as the lad replied  i know as much about her as is usual with one who has known a girl and been often with her since the day he was born  true muttered glumm stooping to fasten the thongs that laced the untanned shoes on his feet  ada has strange thoughts also as thou sayest  come now take thy spear and let us be gone  where shall we go today asked alric  to the wolfs glen  to the wolfs glen that is far  is it too far for thee lad  nay twice the distance were not too far for me returned the boy proudly but the day advances and there is danger without honour in walking on the fells after dark  the more need for haste said glumm opening the door and going out  alric followed and for some time these two walked in silence as the path was very steep and so narrow for a considerable distance that they could not walk abreast  snow lay pretty thickly on the mountains particularly in sheltered places but in exposed parts it had been blown off and the hunters could advance easily  in about ten minutes after setting out they lost sight of glummstede  as they advanced higher and deeper into the mountains the fiord and the sea with its innumerable skerries was lost to view but it was not until they had toiled upwards and onwards for nearly two hours that they reached those dark recesses of the fells to which the bears and wolves were wont to retreat after committing depredations on the farms in the valleys far below  there was something in the rugged grandeur of the scenery here in the whiteness of the snow the blackness of the rocks which peeped out from its voluminous wreaths the lightness of the atmosphere and above all the impressive silence which possessed an indescribable charm for the romantic mind of alric and which induced even the stern matteroffact glumm to tread with slower steps and to look around him with a feeling almost akin to awe  no living thing was to be seen either among the stupendous crags which still towered above or in the depths which they had left below but there were several footprints of wolves all of which glumm declared after careful examination to be old  see here lad he said turning up one of these footprints with the butt of his spear observe the hardish ball of snow just under the print that shows that the track is somewhat old  if it had been quite fresh there would have been no such ball  thou must think my memory of the shortest glumm for i have been told that every time i have been out with thee  true but thou art so stupid said glumm laying his spear lightly across the boys shoulders that i have thought fit to impress it on thee by repetition having an interest in thine education although thou dost not deserve it  i deserve it mayhap more than ye think  how so boy  why because i have for a long time past taken an uncommon interest in thy welfare  glumm laughed and said he did not know that there was any occasion to concern himself about his welfare  oh yes there is cried alric for when a man goes moping about the country as if he were fey or as if he had dreamed of seeing his own guardian spirit his friends cannot help being concerned about him  why what is running in the lads head said glumm looking with a perplexed expression at his young companion  nothing runs in my head save ordinary thoughts  if there be any unusual running at all it must be in thine own  speak thou little fox said glumm suddenly grasping alric by the nape of the neck and giving him a shake  nay then if that is thy plan said the boy give it a fair trial shake away and see what comes of it  thou mayest shake out blood bones flesh and life too and carry home my skin as a trophy but be assured that thou shalt not shake a word off my tongue  boldly spoken said glumm laughing as he released the lad but i think thy tone would change if i were to take thee at thy word  that it would not  thou art not the first man whom i have defied aye and drawn blood from as that redhaired dane  alric stopped suddenly  he had reached that age when the tendency to boast begins at least in manly boys to be checked by increasing good sense and good taste  yet it is no disparagement of alrics character to say that he found it uncommonly difficult to refrain when occasion served from making reference to his first warlike exploit even although frequent rebukes and increasing wisdom told him that boasting was only fit for the lips of cowards  why do ye stop asked glumm who quite understood the boys feelings and admired his exercise of selfcontrol  bebecause i have said enough  good is it observed the other when man or boy knows that he has said enough and has the power to stop when he knows it  but come alric thou hast not said enough to me yet on the matter thatthat  what matter asked alric with a sly look  why the matter of my welfare to be sure  ah true  well methinks glumm that i could give thee a little medicine for thy mind but i wont unless ye promise to keep thy spear off my back  i promise said glumm whose curiosity was aroused  it is a sad thing when a man looks sweet and a maid looks sour but there is a worse thing that is when the maid feels sour  thou lovest ada  hold cried glumm turning fiercely on his companion and let not thy pert tongue dare to speak of such things else will i show thee that there are other things besides spears to lay across thy shoulders  now art thou truly glumm the gruff cried alric laughing as he leaped to the other side of a mass of fallen rock but if thy humour changes not i will show thee that i am not named lightfoot for nothing come dont fume and fret there like a bear with a headache but let me speak and i warrant me thou wilt be reasonably glad  go on then thou incorrigible  very well but none of thy hard names friend glumm else will i set my big brother erling at thee  there now dont give way again  what a stormcloud thou art  will the knowledge that ada loves thee as truly as thou lovest her calm thee down  i see thou hast discovered my secret said glumm looking at his little friend with a somewhat confused expression though how the knowledge came to thee is past my understanding  yet as thou art so clever a warlock i would fain know what ye mean about adas love for me  hadst thou said her hatred i could have believed thee without explanation  let us go on then said alric for there is nothing to be gained and only time to be lost by thus talking across a stone  the path which they followed was broad at that part and not quite so rugged so that alric could walk alongside of his stout friend as he related to him the incident that was the means of enlightening him as to adas feelings towards her lover  it was plain from the expression on the norsemans face that his soul was rejoiced at the discovery and he strode forward at such a pace that the boy was fain to call a halt  thinkest thou that my legs are as long as thine he said stopping and panting  glumm laughed and the laugh was loud and strong  he would have laughed at anything just then for the humour was upon him and he felt it difficult to repress a shout at the end of it  come on alric i will go slower  but art thou sure of all this  hast not mistaken the words  mistaken the words cried the boy why i tell thee they were as plain to my ears and my senses as what thou hast said this moment  good said glumm and now the question comes up how must i behave to her  but thou canst not aid me herein for in such matters thou hast had no experience  out upon thee for a stupid monster said the boy have i not just proved that my experience is very deep  i have not indeed got the length thou hastof wandering about like a poor ghost or a halfwitted fellow but i have seen enough of such matters to know what common sense says  and pray what does common sense say  why it says act towards the maid like a sane man and above all a true man  dont go about the land gnashing thy teeth until everyone laughs at thee  dont go staring at her in grim silence as if she were a wraith and more particularly dont pretend to be fond of other girls for thou didst make a pitiful mess of that attempt  in short be glumm without being gruff and dont try to be anybody else  be kind and straightforward to her worship her or as kettle flatnose said the other day kiss the ground she walks on if thou art so inclined but dont worry her life out  show that thou art fond of her and willing to bide her time  go on viking cruise for the proverb says that an absent body makes a longing spirit and bring her back shiploads of kirtles and mantles and armlets and gold and silver ornamentsthats what common sense says glumm and a great deal more besides but i fear much that it is all wasted on thee  heyday exclaimed glumm what wisdom do i hear  assuredly we must call thee alric hinn frode hereafter  one would think thou must have been born before thine own grandfather  truly that is not so difficult to fancy retorted alric  even now i feel like a greatgrandfather while i listen to thee  there wants but a smooth round face and a lisping tongue to make thine appearance suitable to thy wisdom  but what is this that we have here  the boy pointed to a track of some animal in the snow a few yards to one side of the path  a wolf track said glumm turning aside  a notably huge one remarked the boy  and quite fresh said the man  which is proved rejoined alric in a slow solemn voice by the fact that there is no ball of snow beneath the  hold thy pert tongue said glumm in a hoarse whisper the brute must be close to us  do thou keep in the lower end of this gorgesee yonder where it is narrow  i will go round to the upper end perchance the wolf is there  if so we stand a good chance of killing him for the sides of the chasm are like two walls all the way up  but added glumm hesitating a moment and looking fixedly at the small but sturdy frame of his companion whose heightened colour and flashing eyes betokened a roused spirit i doubt thythat isi have no fear of the spirit if the body were a little bigger  take thine own big body off glumm said alric and leave me to guard the pass  glumm grinned as he turned and strode away  the spot which the hunters had reached merits particular notice  it was one of those wild deep rents or fissures which are usually found near the summits of almost inaccessible mountains  it was not however at the top of the highest range in that neighbourhood being merely on the summit of a ridge which was indeed very highperhaps five or six thousand feetbut still far below the serried and shattered peaks which towered in all directions round horlingdal shutting it out from all communication with the rest of the world except through the fiord and the pass leading over to the springs  on the place where alric parted from his friend the rocks of the gorge or defile rose almost perpendicularly on both sides and as he advanced he found that the space between became narrower until at the spot where he was to take his stand there was an opening of scarcely six feet in width  beyond this the chasm widened a little until at its higher end it was nearly twenty yards broad but owing to the widening nature of the defile the one opening could not be seen from the other although they were little more than four hundred yards apart  the track of the wolf led directly through the pass into the gorge  as the lad took his stand he observed with much satisfaction that it was that of an unusually large animal  this feeling was tempered however with some anxiety lest it should have escaped at the other opening  it was also mixed with a touch of agitation for although alric had seen his friend and erling kill wolves and bears too he had never before been left to face the foe by himself and to sustain the brunt of the charge in his own proper person  beyond an occasional flutter of the heart however there was nothing to indicate even to himself that he was not as firm as the rock on which he stood  now let it not be supposed that we are here portraying a hero of romance in whom is united the enthusiasm of the boy with the calm courage of the man  we crave attention more particularly that of boys to the following observations  in the highly safe and civilised times in which we live many thousands of us never have a chance from personal experience of forming a just estimate of the powers of an average man or boy and we are too apt to ascribe that to heroism which is simply due to knowledge  a man knows that he can do a certain thing that seems extremely dangerous therefore he does it boldly not because he is superlatively bold by any means but because he knows there is no riskat least none to him  the proverb that familiarity breeds contempt applies as truly to danger as to anything else and well is it for the world that the majority of human beings are prone to familiarise themselves with danger in spite of those wellmeaning but weak ones who have been born with a tendency to say perpetually take care dont run such risk etcetera whatever thy hand findeth to do do it with thy might and man has echoed the sentiment in the proverb whatever is worth doing is worth doing well  do you climbthen do it welldo it in such circumstances that your spirit will get used to seeing profound depths below you without your heart melting into hot water and your nerves quaking  do you leapthen do it welldo it so that you may be able to turn it to some good account in the day of trial do it so that you may know how to leap off a runaway carriage for instance without being killed  learn to jump off high cliffs into deep water so that should the opportunity ever offer you may be able to plunge off the high bulwarks of a vessel to save a sister or mother or child with as little thought about yourself as if you were jumping off a sofa observe we do not advocate recklessness  to leap off a cliff so high that you will be sure to be killed is not leaping well but neither is it well to content yourself with a jump of three or four feet as your utmost attainment because that is far short of many a leap which may have to be taken in this world to save even your own life not to mention the lives of others  but enough of this disquisition which the reader will observe has been entered upon chiefly in order to prove that we do not ascribe heroic courage to alric when we say that having been familiar with danger from his birth he prepared to face a wolf of unknown size and ferocity with considerable coolness if not indifference to danger  glumm meanwhile reached the other end of the ravine and there to his intense disappointment found the track of the wolf leading away towards the open mountains beyond  just where it left the ravine however the animal had run about so much that the track was crossed and recrossed in confusion  glumm therefore had difficulty at first in following it up but when he did so great was his joy to find that it doubled back and reentered the defile  pressing quickly forward he came to a broken part near the centre where among a heap of grey weatherworn rocks he perceived two sharppointed objects like a pair of erect ears  to make certain he hurled a stone towards the place  the objects instantly disappeared  immediately afterwards a long grey back and a bushy tail were visible as the wolf glided among the rocks making for the side of the precipice with the intention doubtless of rushing past this bold intruder  glumm observed the movement and promptly went in the same direction the wolf noticed this and paused abruptlyremaining still as if uncertain what to do  the hunter at once put to flight his uncertainty by gliding swiftly towards him  seeing this the wolf abandoned the attempt at concealment and bounded into the centre of the ravine where with his bristles erect his back slightly arched and all his glittering teeth and bloodred gums exposed he stood for a moment or two the very picture of intensified fury  the hunter advanced with his spear levelled steadily but not hastily because there was sufficient space on either hand to render the meeting of the animal in its rush a matter of extreme difficulty while at every step he took the precipices on either side drew closer together  the brute had evidently a strong objection to turn back and preferred to run the risk of passing its foe for it suddenly sprang to one side and ran up the cliff as far as possible like a cat while it made for the upper end of the ravine  the norseman whose powerful frame was by this time strung to intensity of action leaped to the same side with the agility of a panther and got in before it  the wolf did not stop but with a ferocious growl it swerved aside and bounded to the other side of the ravine  again the hunter leaped across and stood in its way  he bent forward to resist the animals weight and impetus but the baffled wolf was cowed by his resolute front  it turned tail and fled followed by glumm with a wild halloo  when the first growl was heard by alric it strung him up to the right pitch instantly and the next one caused the blood to rush to his face for he heard the halloo which glumm uttered as he followed in pursuit the distance was short  another moment and the boy saw the infuriated animal springing towards him with glumm rushing madly after it  alric was already in the centre of the pass with the spear levelled and his body bent in anticipation of the shock  the wolf saw him but did not check its pacewith a furious norseman bounding behind there was no room for hesitation  it lowered its head increased its speed and ran at the opening like a thunderbolt  when within three yards of the boy it swerved and leaping up pawed the cliff on the left while in the air  alric had foreseen thishis only doubt had been as to which side the brute would incline to  he sprang at the same moment and met it full in the face as it came down  the point of his spear entered the wolfs chest and penetrated deep into its body  a terrific yell followed  the spear handle broke in the middle and the boy fell on his face while the wolf went right over him yelling and biting the spear as carried on by its impetus it rolled head over heels for several yards among the rocks  alric jumped up unhurt and for want of a better weapon seized a mass of stone which he raised above his head and hurled at the wolf hitting it fairly on the skull  at the same moment glumm ran up intending to transfix the brute with his spear  hold thy hand glumm gasped the boy  glumm checked himself  in truth it needs no more he said bringing the butt of his weapon to the ground and leaning on it while he looked on at the last struggles of the dying wolf  fairly done lad he added with a nod of approval this will make a man of thee  the boy did not speak but stood with his chest still heaving his breath coming fast and the expression of triumph on his countenance showing that for him a new era had opened upthat the days of boasting had ended and those of manly action had fairly and auspiciously begun    chapter eighteen  shows what some of the men of old could do in cold blood and treats of heathen festivities at haralds court mingled with plot and counter plot  winterwith its frost and snow its long nights and its short days its feasts in the great halls and its tales round the roaring wood fires at length began to pass away and genial spring advanced to gladden the land of norway  the white drapery melted in the valleys leaving brilliant greens and all the varied hues of rugged rocks to fill the eyes with harmonious colour  high on the mighty fells the great glaciersunchanging almost as the everlasting hillsgleamed in the sunlight against the azure sky and sent floods of water down into the brimming rivers  the scalds ceased to some extent those wild legendary songs and tales with which they had beguiled the winter nights and joined the norsemen in their operations on the farms and on the fiords  men began to grow weary of smoked rafters and frequent festivities and to long for the free fresh air of heaven  some went off to drive the cattle to the saeters or mountain pastures others set out for the fisheries and not a few sailed forth on viking cruises over the then almost unknown sea  our friends of horlingdal bestirred themselves like others in these varied avocations and king harald fairhair uprising from his winter lair in drontheim like a giant refreshed assembled his men and prepared to carry out his political plans with a strong hand  but resolute men cannot always drive events before them as fast as they would wish  summer was well advanced before the king was ready to take action  there was a man of the drontheim district named hauskuld who was noted for ferocity and wickedness  he was also very strong and courageous so that king harald made him one of his berserks  one morning the king sent for this man and said to him  hauskuld i have a business for thee to do which requires the heart of a brave fellow  there is a man near horlingdal who has not only refused to submit to my will but has gathered a band of seventy men or more about him and threatens to raise the country against me  it does not suit me to go forth to punish this dog just now for my preparations are not yet complete  nevertheless it is important that he should be crushed as he dwells in the heart of a disaffected district  it is therefore my purpose to send thee with a small body of picked men to do thy worst by him  that suits me well said hauskuld what is his name  atli answered the king  he is my fosterbrother said hauskuld with a peculiar and unpleasant smile  the king looked a little perplexed  thou wilt not have much heart to the business if that be so he said  when you command sire it is my duty to obey replied hauskuld  nay but i can find other stout men for this thing  there is hake of hadeland  go send him hither  i will not put this on thy shoulders  sire you are considerate said hauskuld but this fosterbrother of mine i count an enemy for reasons that i need not tell  besides he is said to be a warlock and for my part i firmly believe that he is in league with nikke so that it would be a service to the gods to rid the world of him  if you will permit me i will gladly go on this errand and as this atli is a stout man it would be well to take hake and a few of the berserkers along with me  do as thou wilt replied the king with a wave of his hand as he turned away only what thou doest see thou do it well and quickly  the berserk shouldered his battleaxe and left the hall  as he walked away the king stood in the doorway looking after him with a mingled expression of admiration and dislike  a stalwart knave he muttered to himself while a grim smile played on his large handsome features a good fighting brute no doubt but with such a spirit a bad servant i fear  there are many such in your army said a deep stern voice behind him  the king turned quickly round with a look of anger and fixed a searching glance on the huge form of rolf ganger who stood leaning on the hilt of his sword with a quiet almost contemptuous smile on his face  it is well known that birds of a feather are fond of flying in company said the king with a flushed countenance no doubt thou speakest from personal knowledge and experience  it was now rolfs turn to flush but the king did him injustice having no ground for such a speech further than a knowledge that there existed between them mutual antipathy which neither was particularly careful to conceal  have i done aught to merit such words demanded rolf sternly  harald was on the point of making an angry rejoinder but placing a powerful restraint upon himself he said  it may be that thine actions are loyal but rolf thy words are neither wise nor true  it is not wise to attempt to shake my confidence in my followers and it is not true that many of them are untrustworthy but if thou wouldst prove thyself a real friend go get thy longships ready with all speed for we fare south a few days hence and there will be work for the weapons of stout men ere long  i go to prepare myself for the fight king harald returned rolf but i have no occasion to give thee further proof of friendship  the world is wide enough for us both  my ocean steeds are on the fiord henceforth i will fight for my own hand  for one moment the king felt an almost irresistible impulse to draw his sword and hew down the bold rolf but with characteristic selfrestraint he crushed down his wrath at the time and made no reply good or bad as the other turned on his heel and left him  when he had gone some distance the king muttered between his set teeth  another good fighting brute and bad servant  let him go  better an open foe than an unwilling friend  that night hauskuld and hake set sail southward with a small body of picked men and rolf ganger with a large body of devoted followers left haralds camp and travelled eastward  in the course of several days hauskuld and his men arrived at the small fiord near the head of which stood the dwelling of atli  this atli was an unusually intelligent man a man of great influence in his district and one who like erling the bold was determined to resist the tyranny of harald fairhair  a large force had been gathered by him towards the end of winter and at the time of hauskulds visit he was living in his own house with about seventy chosen men unfortunately for these the peaceful winter had induced them to relax a little in vigilance  knowing from the report of spies that the king was still feasting in the drontheim district they felt quite safe and for some time past had neglected to set the usual night watch which in time of war was deemed indispensable  thus it happened that when hauskuld and his men came upon them in the dead of a dark night they found everything quiet and went up to the door of the house unchallenged  on trying the latch they found it fast but from the sounds within they knew that a great many men were sleeping there hauskuld and hake had approached the house alone  they now returned to their companions who were concealed in the deep shades of the neighbouring woods  what dost thou advise asked hake of his brother berserk  that we burn them all in their nest replied hauskuld  what fosterbrother too said the other  aye wherefore not  he is a warlock  so are most of the men with him burning is their due  there is wood enough here for that purpose said hake with a grim smile  hauskuld immediately directed the greater part of his force to gather dry wood and silently pile it all round the house while he and hake with a few men stood in front of the doors and windows to guard them the work was accomplished in a much shorter time than might have been expected for those who performed it were strong and active and well accustomed to such deeds  in less than an hour the whole of atlis house was surrounded by a thick pile of dry inflammable brushwood  when it was all laid the men completely surrounded the house and stood with arrows fitted to the strings and swords loosened in the sheaths  then hauskuld and several others applied lights to the brushwood at various points  for a few seconds there was an ominous crackling accompanied by little flashes of flame then a dense smoke rose up all round presently the rushing fire burst through the black pall with a mighty roar and lit up the steading with the strength of the sun at noonday while flame and smoke curled in curious conflict together over the devoted dwelling and myriads of sparks were vomited up into the dark sky  at the same instant doors and windows were burst open with a crash and a terrible cry arose as men half clad and partly armed leaped out and rushed through the circle of fire with the flame kindling on their hair and garments  not less relentless than the fire was the circling foe outside whizzing arrows pierced the scorched breasts of some and many fell dead  others rushed madly on sword or spear point and were thrust violently back into the fire or fell fighting desperately for their lives  some of the attacking party were killed and a few wounded but not one of the assailed succeeded in bursting through the line  atli and all his followers perished there  it is dreadful to think that such diabolical deeds were ever done but still more dreadful is it to know that the spirit which dictated such atrocities still haunts the breast of fallen men for the annals of modern warfare tell us all too plainly that unregenerate man is as capable of such deeds now as were the norsemen in days of old  having fulfilled his mission hauskuld left the place as quickly as possible and hastened back to drontheim not however without learning on the way that preparations were being secretly made all over that district to resist the king and that in particular solve klofe was in the fiord at horlingdal with several ships of war doing his best to fan the flame of discontent which was already burning there briskly enough of its own accord  on returning again to king haralds quarters hauskuld found that energetic monarch engaged in celebrating one of the heathen feasts and deemed it prudent for some hours to avoid his master knowing that when heated with deep potations he was not in the best condition to receive or act upon exasperating news  he therefore went into the great hall where the king and his guests were assembled and quietly took his place at the lower end of one of the long tables near the door  as is usual with men of inferior and debased minds the berserk misunderstood and misjudged his master  he had counted on escaping notice but the kings eye fell on him the instant he entered the hall and he was at once summoned before him and bidden tell his tale  while he related the details of the dreadful massacre hauskuld felt quite at ease little dreaming that the kings fingers twitched with a desire to cut him down where he stood but when he came to speak of the widespread disaffection of the people in the south he stammered a little and glanced uneasily at the flushed countenance of the king fearing that the news would exasperate him beyond endurance  great therefore was his surprise when harald affected to treat the matter lightly made some jesting allusion to the potent efficacy of the sword in bringing obstinate people to reason and ordered one of the waitinggirls to fetch the berserk a foaming tankard of ale  there drink hauskuld my bold berserk drink down to a deeper peg man  after such warm work as thou hast had that will serve to cool thy fiery spirit  drink to the gods and pray that thou mayest never come to die like an old woman in thy beddrink i say drink deep  the king laughed jovially almost fiercely in his wild humour as he made this allusion to the wellknown objection that the norse warriors of old had to dying peacefully in bed but for the life of him he could not resist the temptation as he turned on his seat to touch with his elbow the huge silver tankard which the berserk raised to his lips  the instantaneous result was that a cataract of beer flowed down hauskulds face and beard while the rafters rang with a shout of laughter from the seakings and courtmen who sat in the immediate neighbourhood of the kings high seat  of course harald blamed himself for his clumsiness but he too laughed so heartily that the masses of his fair hair shook all over his shoulders while he ordered another tankard to be filled for his brave berserk  that brave individual however protested that he had had quite enough and immediately retired with a very bad grace to drink his beer in comfort out of a horn cup among kindred spirits  immediately after he was gone the king sent for hake for whom he also ordered a silver tankard of ale but to him the king spoke earnestly and in a low whispering voice while his courtiers perceiving that he wished his converse with the berserk to be private quaffed their liquor and talked noisily  the young woman who filled hakes tankard at the kings bidding was no other than gunhild the unfortunate widow of swart of the springs  for some time after the death of her husband she had dwelt at haldorstede and had experienced much kindness at the hands of the family but having taken a longing to visit her relatives who belonged to the drontheim district she was sent thither and had become a member of haralds household through the influence of king hakon of drontheim the father of ada of horlingdal  hakon had from necessity and much against his inclination become one of harald fairhairs jarls  during the feast of which we write he sat on the kings left hand  after filling hakes tankard gunhild retired but remained within earshot  hake said the king leaning over the arm of his high seat it is now time that we were moving south and the news thou hast brought decides me to complete my arrangements without delay  it seems that ulf of romsdal and that fellow erling the bold with his fierce father are making great preparations for war  truly they are said hake  i saw as much with my own eyes  but may this not be for the purpose of going on viking cruise  had that been so mine ears would have guided me and we had brought a different report but when men talk loudly and ill of the king and knit their brows and wish for a south wind it needs not the wisdom of a warlock to fathom their meaning  moreover he continued earnestly i have heard that news has come from the southland that the people of hordaland and rogaland agder and thelemark are gathering and bringing together ships men and armswhat can all this mean if it be not resistance to the king  right said harald thoughtfully  now hake i will tell thee what to do and see thou waste not time about it  most of my ships are ready for sea  a few days more will suffice to complete them for a cruise and then will i sail forth to teach these proud men humility  meanwhile do thou get ready the ships under thy charge and send hauskuld in a swift boat with a few chosen men south to horlingdal fiord  there let him watch the proceedings of the peopleparticularly of that fellow erling and his kinand when he has seen enough let him sail north to give me warning of their movements  they shall be saved the trouble of coming here to meet me for i will fare south and slay them all root and branch  let thy tongue be quiet and thy motions swift and caution hauskuld also to be discreet  another draught of ale hake and then to thy duty  these last words the king spoke aloud and while the berserk was drinking he turned to converse with hakon of drontheim but finding that that chief had left the board he turned to one of the courtiers and began to converse on the news recently brought from the south  gunhild meanwhile slipped out of the hall and found king hakon hasting to his house  ye heard what the king threatened she said plucking him by the sleeve  i did and willbut why dost thou speak to me on this subject asked hakon warily  because i know your daughter ada is among the doomed and ye would not see her perish  my heart is in the house of haldor the fierce  great kindness have i received there therefore would i go and warn them of what is coming  i have friends here and can get a swift cutter to bear me south  shall i tell them to expect aid from you  hakon was glad to hear this and told her to inform haldor that he would soon be in the fiord with his longship that he would aid the people of horlingdal in resisting harald and that it was probable rolf ganger would also join them  bearing these tidings gunhild left drontheim secretly and in a swift boat with a stout crew set off for the south a considerable time before hauskuld sailed although that worthy did his best to carry out his masters commands without delay  king hakon also pushed forward his preparations and that so briskly that he too was enabled to start before the berserk  meanwhile king harald gave himself up entirely to festivitylaughed and talked with his courtiers and seemed so light of heart that the greater part of his followers thought him to be a careless hearty man on whom the weighty matters of the kingdom sat very lightly  but jarl rongvold knew that this freeandeasy spirit was affected and that the kings mind was much troubled by the state of things in several parts of the kingdom  he also knew however that harald had an iron will which nothing could bend from its purpose and he felt convinced that the course which his sovereign pursued would end either in his total overthrow or in the absolute subjection of norway  it happened that at this time one of the festivals of sacrifice was being celebrated by the people of the drontheim country  it was an old custom that when there was sacrifice all the bonders should come to the spot where the heathen temple stood and bring with them all that they required while the festival of the sacrifice lasted  the men were expected to bring ale with them and all kinds of cattle as well as horses which were to be slaughtered boiled and eaten  in order to conciliate the people the king on this occasion issued a proclamation that he meant to pay all the expenses of the festival this had the double effect of attracting to the locality a vast concourse of people and of putting them all in great good humour so that they were quite ready to listen to and fall in with the plans of the king whatever these might be  of course there were many freeborn noblespirited udallers who could not thus be tickled into the selling of their birthright but haralds tremendous energy and power coupled with his rigorous treatment of all who resisted him had the effect of reducing many of these to sullen silence while some made a virtue of necessity and accepted the fate which they thought it impossible to evade  on the evening of the day of which we write the fire was kindled in the middle of the floor of the temple and over it hung the kettles  full goblets were handed across the fire and the king blessed the full goblets and all the meat of the sacrifice  then first odins goblet was emptied for victory and power to the king thereafter niords and freyas goblets for peace and a good season  after that there was much feasting and when the ale began to mount to the brains of the revellers many of them stood up and raising aloft the braga goblet that over which vows were wont to be madebegan in more or less bombastic strains to boast of what they meant to do in the future having exhausted all other sentiments the guests then emptied the remembrance goblet to the memory of departed friends  soon the desire for song and story began to be felt and there was a loud call for the scald  whereupon clearing his throat and glancing round on the audience with a deprecatory airjust as amateur scalds of the present day are wont to dothiodolph hinn frode of huina stood up to sing  his voice was mellow and his music wild  the subject chosen showed that he understood how to humour both king and people and if the song was short it was much to the point    song of the scald    of cup and platter need has none   the guest who seeks the generous one   harald the bounteouswho can trace   his lineage from the giant race   for haralds hand is liberal free   the guardian of the temple he   he loves the gods his open hand   scatters his swords gains oer the land  the scald sat down with the prompt energy of a man who believes he has said a good thing and expects that it will be well received  he was not disappointed for the rafters rang with the wild huzzas of the revellers as they leaped to their feet and shouted victory to the king  this was just what the king wanted and he carefully fanned the flame which the scald had so judiciously kindled  the result was that when he afterwards called for men to go forth with him to do battle with the turbulent spirits of horlingdal hundreds of those who would otherwise have been malcontent or lukewarm followers busked themselves eagerly for the fight and flocked to his standard  his longships were crowded with picked men and war vessels of all sizesfrom little boats to dragons with thirty banks of rowersaugmented his fleet  at length he sailed from drontheim with perhaps the strongest armament that had ever swept over the northern sea    chapter nineteen  tells something of the doings of solve klofe and others and treats of a few of the marvellous adventures of guttorm stoutheart  the scene is changed  it is night yet how different from night in most other inhabited parts of the earth  the midnight sun is just sinking beneath the horizon close to the spot whence in about twenty minutes he will rise to repeat his prolonged course of nearly fourandtwenty hours through the northern sky  but if the darkness of night is absent its deep quietude is there  the mighty cliffs that rise like giant walls to heaven casting broad heavy shadows over the sea send forth no echoes for the innumerable birds that dwell among them are silently perched like snowflakes on every crag or nestled in every crevice buried in repose  the sea resembles glass and glides with but a faint sigh upon the shore  all is impressively still on mountain and fiord everything in nature is asleep excepting the wakeful eye of day the hum of distant rills the boom of inland cataracts and the ripple on the shore  these sounds however do but render the universal silence more profound by suggesting the presence of those stupendous forces which lie latent everywhere  a white mist floats over the sea like a curtain of gauze investing insignificant objects with grandeur and clothing caverns cliffs and mountain gorges with unusual sublimity  only one object suggestive of man is visible through the haze  it is a shipof the old oldfashioned buildwith high stem and stern and monstrous figurehead  its forefoot rests upon the strip of gravel in yonder bay at the foot of the cliff whose summit is lost in the clouds the hull reposes on its own reflected image and the taper mast is repeated in a wavy but distinct line below  it is the longship the war vessel the sea horse of solve klofe the son of king hunthiof of more whom harald fairhair slew  solve had as we have before said spent the winter in taking his revenge by herrying the coast in his longship and doing all in his power to damage the kings men as well as those who were friendly to his cause  among other things he had early in spring persuaded haldor the fierce to let him have the use of one of his warships with a few of his best men to accompany him on a viking cruise  erling had resisted his pressing invitation to bear him company because of important business the nature of which he did not think it necessary to disclose his friend glumm the gruff also declined from similar reasons  at all events he was similarly preengaged and taciturn  thorer the thick however and kettle flatnose and young alricthe latter by special and importunate requestwere allowed to accompany him on this expedition  we do not intend to give the details of this foray although it was unusually stirring and prolific of adventure  suffice it to say that they had several hard fights both with swedish and danish vikings in all of which alric distinguished himself for reckless daring and would certainly have been carried home dead upon his own shield had not kettle flatnose watched over him with the solicitude of a father and warded off many a blow that was aimed at his pugnacious head  we fear it must be added that alric was not sufficiently impressed with his friends services in this way  the truth is that he entertained the firm belief that nobody could kill him and that he could kill anybodywhich was all very well as far as it went but would not have carried him scathless through the cruise had not the stout irishman been at his back  immense and valuable booty was gained at this time for one of the vessels which they captured had been cruising in southern lands and was returning with a large quantity of gold and silver ornaments when solve klofe attacked it  a misfortune befell them however  on their way home a storm drove thorers vessel on the rocks in a fog and it became a total wreck  the crew were all saved however and much of the lading by solve who stowed the goods in his own ship and brought home the men  they were within a days sail of horlingdal when they put ashore to take a few hours repose  three hours after midnight solve klofe whose breathing up to that time had resembled that of an infant gave vent to a prolonged bass snore and opened his eyes  this was followed by the shutting of his mouth and with one of those satisfactory stretchings of the body with which a sound sleeper is wont in the morning to dismiss repose and recall his energies  having lain still a few moments to enjoy the result solve sat up and stretching forth his hand drew aside the curtain of the tent under which he slept and looked out  the sight that gladdened his eyes was beautiful beyond description for the sun was up in all his northern glory and shone on the silver sea with dazzling light while he scattered away the mists of morning  but the best sight of all to the bold viking was the splendid warship which with painted sides and shields and gilded masts and prow glowed and glittered like a beautiful gem in a setting of the brightest azure blue  turning his eyes inside his tent again solve gazed with the expressionless aspect of a still drowsy man upon the countenance of kettle whose flat nose and open mouth gave vent to tones resembling those of a bassoon  beside him and nestling close to him lay the youthful alric with his curly head resting on kettles broad bosom for the lad albeit manly enough when awake had sufficient of the child still about him to induce a tendency on his part when asleep to make use of any willing friend as a pillow  thorer the thick was also there with his head on his arm his body sprawling indescribably his shield above him like a literal coverlet and his right hand on his swordhilt  ho exclaimed solve in a tone that marvellously resembled the tones of modern men in similar circumstances  kettle and thorer however sprang up to a sitting posture with very primitive alacrity for in those days a mans life often depended on his being and keeping very wideawake  poor alric was tumbled somewhat unceremoniously to one side but that failed to awaken him for he was not yet sufficiently trained to sleep in the midst of alarms and felt very naturally inclined to growl and bite when shaken or told to get up  in a few minutes however his lethargy was overcome the men were aroused the tents were struck the longship was pushed off and under the influence of thirty pair of oars it crept like a monstrous insect away over the sea  those who had not to work at the oars sat at first quietly on the thwarts or leaned over the gunwale gazing into the deep or up at the sky enjoying the warm air and their own fancies  but after a time talkative spirits began to loose their tongues and ere long a murmur of quiet conversation pervaded the ship  i wonder what news we shall hear at the stede when we arrive said thorer to kettle who with several others sat on the poop beside solve  i hope it wont be bad news answered kettle  harald is not the man to sleep through the summer when there is work to be done  if it wasnt that i expect to give him the toothache before i go surely i should have been in ireland long ago  whom didst thou serve under kettle before we brought thee to norway asked alric  under the king of dublin replied kettle  was he a great king  a great king  aye never was there a greater and a great king he is yet if hes alive though i have my own fears on that point for he was taking badly to ale when i left  there was something pathetic yet humorous in the tone and expression with which kettle said this which caused alric to laugh  the irishman started and for an instant his huge countenance blazed with a look of wrath which was quite majestic and overawed the boy bold though he was  but it passed away in a moment and was replaced by a sorrowful look as kettle shook his head and said  ah boy your laugh reminded me of the laugh of the villain haabrok who took the old kings throne at the time i was carried off bound hand and foot  lucky was it for him that my hands were not free thenwell well this sounds like bragging he added with a smile which is only fit for boys and cowards  alric winced a little at this for he was quite aware of his own tendency to boast and for a moment he felt a strong inclination to stand up for boys and assert that although boasting was common enough with cowardly boys it was not so with all boys but on consideration he thought it best to hold his tongue on that point at least until he should have freed himself of the evil of boasting  to change the subject he said  was the old king fond of thee kettle  aye as fond of me as of his own son  was he like my father pursued the boy  no there are not many men like thy father lad but he was a stout and brave old man and a great warrior in his day  now i think of it he was very like guttorm stoutheart  then he was a handsome man said solve klofe with emphasis  he was continued kettle but not quite so desperate  old guttorm is the most reckless man i ever did see  did i ever tell ye of the adventure i had with him when we went on viking cruise south to valland  no said solve let us hear about it but stay till i change the oarsmen  he went forward and gave the order to relieve the men who had rowed from the land and when the fresh men were on the benches he returned and bade kettle go on  tis a fine country said the irishman glancing round him with a glowing eye and speaking in a low tone as if to himselfone to be proud of  and in truth there was ground for his remark for the mists had by that time entirely cleared away leaving unveiled a sea so calm and bright that the innumerable islets off the coast appeared as if floating in air  that is true said thorer  i sometimes wonder kettle at thy longing to return to ireland  i am in the same case with thyselfwas taken from my home in jemteland laboured as a thrall wrought out my freedom and remained in haldors service but have never wished to return home  didst thou leave a wife and children behind thee asked kettle  nay i was carried away while very young  is thy father alive or thy mother  no they are both dead  then i wonder not that ye have no desire to return home  my father and mother are both aliveat least i have good reason to believe somy wife and children are waiting for me  canst wonder man that i long to behold once more the green hills of ireland  nay if that be so i wonder not replied thorer  come kettle thou forgettest that we wait for the story about old guttorm stoutheart said solve klofe arranging the corner of a sail so as to protect his back from the sun  tis an old story now in horlingdal said kettle but as thou hast not been in this quarter for a long time no doubt it is new to thee thorer there knows it well but i find that it bears telling more than once  well it was as i have said two years past that guttorm went south to valland on viking cruise  he called at horlingdal in passing and got some of the dalesmen  among others i was allowed to go  he and i got on very well together and we were fortunate in getting much booty  one day we came to a part of the coast where we saw a strong castle of stone on the top of a hill a short way inland  we also saw plenty of cattle on a plain near the sea so guttorm ordered his longship to be steered for the shore and we began to drive some of the cattle down to the beach intending to slaughter them there as our provisions were getting low  on seeing this a party of men came out from the castle and bade us begone  we told them to be easy in their minds for we only wanted a little food  we even went so far as to ask it of them civilly but the men were such surly fellows that they refused to listen to reason and attacked us at once  of course we drove them back into their castle but in doing so we lost one or two of our best men  this angered old guttorm who is not a quarrelsome man as ye know  he would have gone away peaceably enough if he had been let alone to help himself to a few beasts but his blood was set up by that time so he ordered all the men on shore and we pitched our tents and besieged the castle  being made of stone there was no chance of setting it on fire and as the walls were uncommonly high it was not possible to take it by assault  well we sat down before it and for two days tried everything we could think of to take it but failed for there were plenty of men in it and they defended the walls stoutly besides this to say the truth we had already lost a number of good men on the cruise and could ill afford to lose more  on the third day some of our chief men advised guttorm to give it up but that made him so furious that no one dared speak to him about it for another two days  at the end of that time his nephew plucked up heart and going to him said  uncle do you see the little birds that fly back and forward over the castle walls so freely and build their nests in the thatch of the housetops  i do nephew says guttorm  what then  my advice is says the nephew that you should order the men to make each a pair of wings like those the birds have and then we shall all fly over the walls for it seems to me that there is no other way of getting into the castle  thou art a droll knave replies guttorm for he was ever fond of a joke but thou art wise also therefore i advise thee to make a pattern pair of wings for the men and when they are ready  here guttorm stopped short and fell to thinking and he thought so long that his nephew asked him at last if he had any further commands for him  yes boy i have  there is more in this matter of the wings than thou dreamest of  go quickly and order the men to make snares and catch as many of these little birds as they can before sunset  let them be careful not to hurt the birds and send kettle flatnose and my housecarle hither without delay  when i came to the old man i found him walking to and fro briskly with an expression of eagerness in his eye  kettle he said smartly go and prepare two hundred pieces of cord each about one foot long and to the end of each piece tie a small chip of wood as long as the first joint of thy thumb and about the size of a goose quill  smear these pieces of wood over with pitch and have the whole in my tent within three hours  as i walked away to obey this order wondering what it could all be about i heard him tell his chief housecarle to have all the men armed and ready for action a little after sunset as quietly as possible  before the three hours were out i returned to the tent with the two hundred pieces of cord prepared according to orders and found old guttorm sitting with a great sack before him and a look of perplexity on his face that almost made me laugh  he was halfinclined to laugh too for the sack moved about in a strange way as if it were alive  kettle said he when i came forward i need thy help here  i have got some three hundred little birds in that sack and i dont know how to keep them in order for they are fluttering about and killing themselves right and left so that i shall soon have none left alive for my purpose  my thought is to tie one of these cords to a leg of each bird set the bit of stick on fire and let it go so that when it flies to its nest in the thatch it will set the houses in the castle on fire now what is thy advice  call as many of the men into the tent as it will hold and let each catch a bird and keep it till the cords are made fast says i  this was done at once but we had more trouble than we expected for when the mouth of the sack was opened out flew a dozen of the birds before we could close it  the curtain of the tent was down however so after a good deal of hunting we caught them again  when the cords were tied to these the men were sent out of the tent each with a little bird in his hand and with orders to go to his particular post and remain there till further orders  then another batch of men came in and they were supplied with birds and cords like the others but ye have no notion what trouble we had  i have seen a hundred viking prisoners caught and held fast with half the difficulty and less noise  moreover while some of the men squeezed the birds to death in their fear lest they should escape others let theirs go in their anxiety not to hurt them and the little things flew back to their nests with the cords and bits of chip trailing after them  at last however all was ready  the men were kept in hiding till after dark then the little chips were set on fire all at the same time and the birds were let go  it was like a shower of stars descending on the castle for each bird made straight for its own nest but just as we were expecting to behold the success of our plan up jumped a line of men on the castle walls and by shouting and swinging their arms scared the birds away  we guessed at once that the little birds which had escaped too soon with the strings tied to their legs had been noticed and the trick suspected for the men in the castle were well prepared  a few of the birds flew over their heads and managed to reach the roofs which caught fire at once but wherever this happened a dozen men ran at the place and beat the fire out  the thing was wisely contrived but it was cleverly met and repelled so we had only our trouble and the disappointment for our pains  after this continued kettle old guttorm became like a wolf  he snarled at everyone who came near him for some time but his passion never lasted long  he soon fell upon another plan  there was a small river which ran at the foot of the mound on which the castle stood and there were mudbanks on the side next to it one night we were all ordered to go to the mudbanks as quiet as mice with shovels and picks in our hands and dig a tunnel under the castle  we did so and the first night advanced a long way but we had to stop a good while before day to let the dirt wash away and the water get clear again so that they might not suspect what we were about  the next night we got under the castle wall and on the fifth night had got well under the great hall for we could hear the men singing and shouting as they sat at meat above us  we had then to work very carefully for fear of making a noise and when we thought it ready for the assault we took our swords and shields with us and guttorm led the way  his chief housecarle was appointed to drive through the floor while guttorm and i stood ready to egg him on and back him up  we heard the men above singing and feasting as usual when suddenly there was a great silence for one of the big stones over our heads was loosened and they had evidently felt or seen it  now was the time come so while the housecarle shovelled off the earth some of us got our fingers in about the edge of the stone and pulled with all our force  suddenly down it came and a man along with it  we knocked him on the head at once and gave a loud huzza as the housecarle sprang up through the hole caught a shower of blows on his shield and began to lay about him fiercely  guttorm was very mad at the carle for going up before him but the carle was light and the old man was heavy so he could not help it  i was about to follow when a man cut at my head with a great axe as i looked up through the hole  i caught the blow on my shield and thrust my sword up into his leg which made him give back but just at that moment the earth gave way under our feet and a great mass of stones and rubbish fell down on us driving us all back into the passage through which we had come except the housecarle who had been caught by the enemy and dragged up into the hall  as soon as we could get on our feet we tried to make for the hole again but it was so filled with earth and stones that we could not get forward a step knowing therefore that it was useless to stay longer there we ran back to the entrance of the tunnel but here we found a body of men who had been sent out of the castle to cut off our retreat  we made short work of these  disappointment and anger had made every man of us equal to two so we hewed our way right through them and got back to the camp with the loss of only two men besides the housecarle  next morning when it was daylight the enemy brought the poor prisoner to the top of the castle wall where they lopped off his head and having cut his body into four pieces they cast them down to us with shouts of contempt  after this guttorm stoutheart appeared to lose all his fire and spirit he sent for his chief men and said that he was going to die and that it was his wish to be left to do so undisturbed  then he went into his tent and no one was allowed after that to go near him except his nephew  a week later we were told that guttorm was dying and that he wanted to be buried inside the castle for we had discovered that the people were what they called christians and that they had consecrated ground there  when this was made known to the priests in the castle they were much pleased and agreed to bury our chief in their ground if we would bring his body to a spot near the front gateway and there leave it and retire to a safe distance from the walls  there was some objection to this at first hit it was finally agreed toonly a request was made that two of the next of kin to guttorm might be allowed to accompany the body to the burialplace as it would be considered a lasting disgrace to the family if it were buried by strange hands when friends were near  this request was granted on the understanding that the two relations were to go into the castle unarmed  on the day of the funeral i was summoned to guttorms tent to help to put him into his coffin which had been made for him after the pattern of the coffins used in that part of the country  when i entered i found the nephew standing by the side of the coffin and the old seaking himself sitting on the foot of it  thou art not quite dead yet says i looking hard in his face  not yet says he and i dont expect to be for some time  are we to put you into the coffin  i asked  yes says he and see that my good axe lies ready to my hand  put thy sword on my left side nephew that thou mayst catch it readily they bury me in consecrated ground today kettle and thou being one of my nearest of kin must attend me to the grave  thou must go unarmed too but that matters little for thy sword can be placed on the top of my coffin along with thy shield to do duty as the weapons of the dead when to use them i leave to thy wellknown discretion  dost understand  your speech is not difficult for the understanding to take in says i  ha especially the understanding of an irishman says he with a smile  well help me to get into this box and see that thou dost not run it carelessly against gateposts for it is not made to be roughly handled  with that old guttorm lay back in the coffin and we packed in the nephews sword and shield with him and his own axe and shield at his right side  then we fastened down the lid and two men were called to assist us in carrying it to the appointed place  as we walked slowly forward i saw that our men were drawn up in a line at some distance from the castle wall with their heads hanging down as if they were in deep griefand so they were for only a few were aware of what was going to be done yet all were armed and ready for instant action  the appointed spot being reached we put the coffin on the ground and ordered the two men who were armed to retire  but dont go far away lads says i for we have work for ye to do  they went back only fifty ells or so and then turned to look on  at the same time the gate of the castle opened and twelve priests came out dressed in long black robes and carrying a cross before them  one of them who understood the norse language said as they came forward  what meaneth the sword and shield  i told him that it was our custom to bury a warriors arms along with him  he seemed inclined to object to this at first but thinking better of it he ordered four of his men to take up the coffin which they did shoulder high and marched back to the castle closely followed by the two chief mourners  no sooner had we entered the gateway which was crowded with warriors than i stumbled against the coffin and drove it heavily against one of the posts and pretending to stretch out my hands to support it i seized my sword and shield  at the same moment the lid of the coffin flew into the air the sides burst out and old guttorm dropped to the ground embracing two of the priests so fervently in his descent that they fell on the top of him  i had only time to observe that the nephew caught up his sword and shield as they fell among the wreck when a shower of blows from all directions called for the most rapid action of eye and limb  before guttorm could regain his feet and utter his warcry i had lopped off two heads and the nephews sword was whirling round him like lightning flashes but of course i could not see what he did  the defenders fought bravely and in the first rush we were almost borne back but in another moment the two men who had helped us to carry the coffin were alongside of us and now having a front of five stout men we began to feel confident of success  this was turned into certainty when we heard a minute later a great rushing sound behind us and knew that our men were coming on  old guttorm swung his battleaxe as if it had been a toy and uttering a tremendous roar cut his way right into the middle of the castle  we all closed in behind him the foe waveredthey gave wayat last they turned and fled for remembering no doubt how they had treated the poor housecarle they knew they had no right to expect mercy  in a quarter of an hour the place was cleared and the castle was ours  and what didst thou do with it asked alric in much excitement  do with it  of course we feasted in it till we were tired then we put as much of its valuables into our ships as they could carry after which we set the place on fire and returned to norway  twas well done and a lucky venture observed solve klofe  alric appeared to meditate for a few minutes and then said with a smile  if christian the hermit were here he would say it was ill done and an unlucky venture for the men of the castle  the hermit is a fool said solve  that he is not cried the boy reddening  a braver and better man never drew bow  but he has queer thoughts in his head  that may be so  it matters naught to me retorted solve rising and going forward to the high prow of the ship whence he looked out upon the islandstudded seacome lads change hands again and pull with a will  methinks a breeze will fill our sails after we pass yonder point and if so we shall sleep tonight in horlingdal    chapter twenty  in which the sky again becomes overcastthe wartoken is sent out alric gets a surprise and a berserk catches a tartar  erling the bold was very fond of salmonfishing and it was his wont when the weather suited and nothing of greater importance claimed his attention to sally forth with a threepronged spear to fish in the horlingdal river which swarmed with salmon in the summer season of the year  one evening he left haldorstede with his fishingspear on his shoulder and went up to the river accompanied by one of the housecarles  they both wore shirts of mail and carried shield and sword for these were not times in which men could venture to go about unarmed  on reaching a place where the stream ran shallow among rocks our hero waded in and at the first dart of his spear struck a fish of about fifteen pounds weight which he cast like a bar of burnished silver on the grassy bank  that will be our supper tonight observed the carle as he disengaged the spear  erling made no reply but in a few minutes he pulled out another fish and said as he threw it down  that will do for a friend should one chance to turn in to us tonight  after that he tried again but struck no more although he changed his ground frequently so he cast his eyes upwards as if to judge of the time of evening and appeared to doubt whether or not he should persevere any longer  try the foss suggested the housecarle you seldom fail to get one there  well i will try it  do thou leave the fish under that bush and follow me  it needs three big fish to make a good feast for my fathers household  besides said the carle there is luck in an odd number as kettle flatnose is fond of telling us  they were about to ascend the bank to the track which led to the waterfall about half a mile farther up the river when their attention was arrested by a shout looking down the stream in the direction whence it came they saw a figure approaching them at full speed  that must be my brother alric said erling on hearing the shout repeated  it looks like him said the carle  all doubt on the point was quickly set at rest by the lad who ran at a pace which soon brought him near  waving his cap above his head he shouted  news news good news  out with thy news then said erling as alric stood before him panting violently though i dare say the best news thou hast to give is that thou hast come back to us safe and well  hah let me get wind nay i have better news than that exclaimed alric harald is comingking harald haarfagerwith a monstrous fleet of longships cutters dragons and little boats and a mighty host of men to lay waste horlingdal with fire and sword and burn us all alive perhaps eat us too who knows  truly if this be good news said erling with a laugh i hope i may never hear bad news  but where got ye such news alric  from the widow gunhild to be sure who is true to us as steel and comes all the way from drontheim out of love to thee erling to tell it  but i say dont you think this good news  i always thought you would give your best battleaxe to have a chance of fighting harald  aye truly for a chance of fighting harald but not for that chance coupled with the other chance of seeing horlingdal laid waste with fire and sword to say nothing of being eaten alive which i suppose is thine own addition to the news boy  but come if this be so we do not well to waste time chattering here  fetch the two fish carle tonight we must be content with what luck lies in an even number in spite of the opinion of kettle flatnosecome alric thou canst tell me more of this as we hasten home  but i have more good news than that to tell said the lad as they hurried towards haldorstede  solve klofe with his men have come back with usindeed i may rather say that we have come back with solve for our own ship has been wrecked and lost but kettle and i and thorer and all the men were saved by solve with nearly everything belonging to us and all the booty  it is not more than an hour since we sailed into the fiord loaded to the shieldcircle with oh such splendid things gold silver cups tankards gems shawlsandand i know not what all besides captives  it was just after we landed that a small boat came round the ness from the north with the widow gunhild in it and she jumped ashore and told what she had seen and heard at drontheim and that we may expect adas father king hakon in his longship to our aid perhaps he may be coming into the fiord even now while we are talking  andand she said also that rolf ganger had left the king in a huff and perhaps we might look for help from him too  so methinks i bring good news dont i  good aye and stirring news my boy cried erling striding onward at such a pace that the carle with the fish was left behind and alric was compelled to adopt an undignified trot in order to keep up with his huge brother  from this i see continued erling in a tone of deep seriousness that the longlookedfor time is at last approaching this battle that must surely come will decide the fate of freemen  king harald haarfager must now be crushed or norway shall be enslaved alric my boy thou hast been styled lightfoot  if ever thou didst strive to merit that title strive this night as ye have never striven before for there is urgent need that every friendly blade in the land should assemble in the dale without delay  i will send thee forth with the split arrow as soon as i have seen and spoken with my fatherha i see him coming  go into the house lad and sup well and quickly for no sleep shall visit thine eyelids this night  alrics breast swelled with gratification at being spoken to thus earnestly and made of such importance by his brother whom he admired and loved with an intensity of feeling that no words can convey looking up in his face with sparkling eyes he gave him a little nod erling replied with another little nod and a sedate smile and the boy turning away dashed into the house at which they had now arrived  hast heard the news erling asked haldor as his son drew near  aye alric has told it me  what thinkest thou  that the game is about to be played out  haldor looked full in erlings face and his own noble countenance glowed with an expression of majesty which cannot be described and which arose from the deep conviction that one of the most momentous eras in his life had arriveda period in which his own fate and that of all he held most dear would in all probability be sealed  death or victory he felt assured were now the alternatives and when he reflected on the great power of the king and the stern necessity there was for the exertion of not only the utmost bravery but the most consummate skill his whole being glowed with suppressed emotion while his bearing betokened the presence and bore the dignified stamp of a settled purpose to do his best and meet his fate for weal or woe manfully  come said he putting his arm within that of his stout son let us turn into the wood awhile  i would converse with thee on this matter  alric is ready to start with the token said erling  i know it my son  let him sup first the women will care well for him for they will guess the work that lies before him  the people of ulfstede are with us tonight and glumm is here but glumm is not of much use as a counsellor just now poor fellow  it were kind to let him be until it is time to rouse him up to fight  a quiet smile played on haldors lips as he thus alluded to the impossibility of getting glumm to think of anything but love or fighting at that time  while the father and son strolled in the wood conversing earnestly a noisy animated scene was presented in the great hall of haldorstede for in it were assembled besides the ordinary household the family from ulfstede a sprinkling of the neighbours gunhild and her men guttorm stoutheart and solve klofe with kettle flatnose thorer the thick and the chief men who had arrived from the recent viking cruise all of whom were talking together in the utmost excitement while the fair herfrida and her daughters and maids prepared a sumptuous meal  in those days and at such an establishment as that of haldor the fierce it was not possible for friends to appear inopportunely  a dozen might have dropped in to breakfast dinner or supper without costing dame herfrida an anxious thought as to whether the cold joint of yesterday would do or something more must be procured for she knew that the larder was always well stocked  when therefore a miniature army of hungry warriors made a sudden descent upon her she was quite prepared for themreceived them with the matronly dignity and captivating smile for which she was celebrated and at once gave directions to her commissariat department to produce and prepare meat and drink suitable to the occasion  the evening which had thus grown so unexpectedly big with present facts and future portents had begun in a very small wayin a way somewhat equivalent to the modern small tea party  ulf of romsdal feeling a disposition to make a night of it had propounded to dame astrid the idea of going up to haldorstede for the evening  his wife being amiably disposed agreed  hilda and ada were equally willing and glumm who by a mere chance happened to be there at the time could not choose but accompany them  the family at haldorstede were delighted to see their friends  dame herfrida carried off dame astrid to her apartment to divest her of her hat and mantle  ingeborg bore off ada and the younger girls of the household made away with hilda leaving ulf to talk the politics of the day with haldor while glumm pretended to listen to them but listened in reality for adas returning footsteps  in a short time the fair ones reentered the hall and there they had supper or more properly an interlude suppera sort of supperlet so to speak composed of cold salmon scones milk and ale which was intended no doubt to give them an appetite for the true supper that should follow ere long  over this supperlet they were all very talkative and merry with the exception poor fellow of glumm who sat sometimes glancing at and always thinking of ada and pendulating as usual between the condition of being miserably happy or happily miserable  no mortal save glumm himself could have told or conceived what a life ada led him  she took him up by the neck figuratively speaking and shook him again and again as a terrier shakes a rat and dropped him but here the simile ceases for whereas the rat usually crawls away if it can and evidently does not want more glumm always wanted more and never crawled away  on the contrary he crawled humbly back to the feet of his tormentor and by looks if not words craved to be shaken again  it was while glumm was drinking this cup of mingled bliss and torment and the others were enjoying their supperlet that solve klofe and his men and kettle flatnose thorer the thick and the housecarles burst clamorously into the hall with old guttorm stoutheart who had met them on the beach  scarcely had they got over the excitement of this first invasion when the widow gunhild and her niece arrived to set the household ablaze with her alarming news  the moment that haldor heard it he dispatched alric in search of erling who as we have seen immediately returned home  shortly afterwards he and haldor entered the hall  ho my men cried the latter to arms to arms  busk ye for the fight and briskly too for when harald haarfager lifts his hand he is not slow to strike  where is alric  here i am father  hast fed well boy  aye famously answered alric wiping his mouth and tightening his belt  take the wartoken my son and see that thou speed it well  let it not fail for want of a messenger  if need be go all the round thyself and rest not as long as wind and limb hold out  thy fighting days have begun early he added in a softer tone as he passed his large hand gently over the fair head of the boy perchance they will end early but whatever betide alric quit thee like a manas thou art truly in heart if not in limb  such words from one who was not at any time lavish of praise might a short time before have caused the boy to hold up his head proudly but the last year of his life had been fraught with many lessons  he listened with a heaving breast and beating heart indeed but with his head bent modestly down while on his flushed countenance there was a bright expression and on his lips a glad smile which spoke volumes his father felt assured as he looked at him that he would never bring discredit on his name  ye know the course said haldor away  in another minute alric was running at full speed up the glen with the wartoken in his hand  his path was rugged his race was wild and its results were striking  he merely shouted as he passed the windows of the cottages low down in the dale knowing that the men there would be roused by others near at hand but farther on where the cottages were more scattered he opened the door of each and showed the token uttering a word or two of explanation during the brief moment he stayed to swallow a mouthful of water or to tighten his belt  at first his course lay along the banks of the river every rock and shrub of which he knew  farther on he left the stream on the right and struck into the mountains just as the sun went down  high up on the fells a little cottage stood perched on a cliff  it was one of the saeters or mountain dairies where the cattle were pastured in summer long agojust as they are at the present day  alric ran up the steep face of the hill doubled swiftly round the corner of the enclosure burst open the door and springing in held up the token while he wiped the streaming perspiration from his face  a man and his wife with three stout sons and a comely daughter were seated on a low bench eating their supper of thickened milk  the wartoken exclaimed the men springing up and without a moments delay taking down and girding on the armour which hung round the walls  king harald is on his way to the dale said alric we assemble at ulfstede  shall i bear on the token asked the youngest of the men  aye but go thou with it up the wolfs den valley  i myself will bear it round by the eagle crag and the coast  that is a long way said the man taking his shield down from a peg in the wall  alric replied not for he had already darted away and was again speeding along the mountain side  night had begun to close in for the season had not yet advanced to the period of endless daylight  far away in an offshoot vale a bright ruddy light gleamed through the surrounding darkness  alrics eye was fixed on it  his untiring foot sped towards it  the roar of a mighty cataract grew louder on his ear every moment  he had to slacken his pace a little and pick his steps as he went on for the path was rugged and dangerous  i wonder if old hans of the foss is at home was the thought that passed through his mind as he approached the door  old hans himself answered the thought by opening the door at that moment  he was a short thickset and very powerful man of apparently sixty years of age but his eye was as bright and his step as light as that of many a man of twenty  the wartoken he said almost gaily stepping back into the cottage as alric leaped in  what is doing son of haldor  king harald will be upon us sooner than we wish  ulfstede is the meetingplace  can thy son speed on the token in the next valley  the old warrior shook his head sadly and pointed to a low bed where a young man lay with the wasted features and bright eyes that told of a deadly disease in its advanced stage  an exclamation of regret and sympathy escaped from alric  i cannot go he said my course lies to the left by the stor foss  hast no one to send  i will go father said a smart girl of fifteen who had been seated behind her mother near the couch of the sick man  thou bairn  yes why not  it is only a league to hawksdal where young eric will gladly relieve me  true said the old warrior with a smile as he began to don his armour  go i need not tell thee to make haste  alric waited to hear no more but darted away as the little maid tripped off in another direction  thus hour by hour the night passed by and alric ran steadily on his course rousing up all the fighting men in his passage through the district  as he advanced messengers with wartokens were multiplied and ere the mornings sun had glinted on the mountain peaks or lighted up the white fields of the justedal glacier the whole country was in arms and men were crowding to the rendezvous  daylight had just commenced to illumine the eastern sky when alric having completed his round found himself once more on the cliffs above the sea  but he was still six or eight miles from ulfstede and the path to it along the top of the cliffs was an extremely rugged one earnestly then did the poor boy wish that he had remembered to put a piece of bread in his wallet before leaving home but in his haste he had forgotten to do so and now he found himself weary footsore and faint from exertion excitement and hunger far from any human habitation  as there was no remedy for this he made up his mind to take a short rest on the grass and then set off for home as fast as possible  with this end in view he selected a soft spot on a cliff overlooking the sea and lay down with a sigh of satisfaction  almost instantly he fell into a deep slumber in which he lay perfectly motionless for some hours  how long that slumber would have lasted it is impossible to say for it was prematurely and unpleasantly interrupted  in his catlike creepings about the coast hauskuld the berserk having obtained all the information that he thought would be of use to his royal master landed for the last time to reconnoitre the position of ulfstede and see as much as he could of the doings of the people before turning his prow again to the north  the spot where he ran his boat ashore was at the foot of a steep cliff up which he and a comrade ascended with some difficulty  at the top to his surprise he found a lad lying on the grass sound asleep  after contemplating him for a few minutes and whispering a few words to his comrade who indulged in a broad grin hauskuld drew his sword and pricked alric on the shoulder with it  an electric shock could not have been more effective  the poor boy sprang up with a loud cry and for a few seconds gazed at the berserks in bewilderment  then it flashed upon his awakening faculties that he was standing before enemies so he suddenly turned round and fled but hauskuld sprang after him and before he had got three yards away had caught him by the nape of the neck with a grip that made him gasp  ho ho my young fox so ye thought to leave the hounds in the lurch come cease thy kicking else will i give thee an inch of steel to quiet thee  tell me thy name and what thou art about here and i will consider whether to make use of thee or hurl thee over the cliffs  by this time alric had fully recovered his senses and his selfpossession  he stood boldly up before the berserk and replied  my name is alricson of haldor the fierce out of whose way i advise thee to keep carefully if thou art not tired of life  i have just been round with the wartoken rousing the country  a most proper occupation for an eaglet such as thou said hauskuld that is to say if the cause be a good one  the cause is one of the best said alric  prithee what may it be  selfdefence against a tyrant  hauskuld glanced at his comrade and smiled sarcastically as he asked  and who may this tyrant be  harald haarfager tyrant king of norway replied the lad stoutly  i thought so said hauskuld with a grim twist of his features well young eaglet thou art worthy to be made mincemeat of to feed the crows but it may be that the tyrant would like to dispose of thee himself  say now whether will ye walk down that cliff quietly in front of me or be dragged down  i would rather walk if i must go  well thou must go thereforewalk and see thou do it as briskly as may be else will i apply the spur which thou hast felt once already this morning  lead the way comrade i will bring up the rear to prevent the colt from bolting  as he knew that resistance would be useless the boy promptly and silently descended the cliff with his captors and entered the boat which was immediately pushed off and rowed alongshore  now listen to me alric son of haldor said hauskuld seating himself beside his captive king harald is not the tyrant you take him for he is a good king and anxious to do the best he can for norway  some mistaken men like your father compel him to take strong measures when he would fain take mild  if you will take me to a spot where i may safely view the valley of horlingdal and tell me all you know about their preparations for resistance i will take you back to drontheim and speak well of you to the king who will not only reward you with his favour but make good terms i doubt not with your father  the wily berserk had changed his tone to that of one who addresses a superior in rank while he thus tempted the boy but he little guessed the spirit of his captive  what he exclaimed scornfully wouldst thou have me turn traitor to my own father  nay i would have you turn wise for the sake of your father and yourself  think well of what i say and all i ask of you is to guide me to a good point of observation  there is a cave they say near ulfstede with its mouth to the sea and a secret entrance from the land  no doubt i could find it myself with a little trouble but it would save time if you were to point it out  never exclaimed alric sternly  truly thou art a chip of the old tree said hauskuld taking alrics ear between his finger and thumb but there are means to take which have been known to bend stouter hearts than thine  say wilt thou show me the cave  he pinched the ear with gradually increasing force as he spoke but alric neither spoke nor winced although the blood which rushed to his face showed that he felt the pain keenly  well well said the berserk relaxing his grip this is a torture only fit for very small boys after all  hand me the pincers arne  one of the men drew in his oar and from a locker pulled out a pair of large pincers which he handed to his chief who at once applied them to the fleshy part at the back of alrics arm between the elbow and the shoulder  when thou art willing to do as i bid thee i will cease to pinch said hauskuld  poor alric had turned pale at the sight of the pincers for he knew well the use they would be put to but he set his teeth tightly together and determined to endure it  as the pain increased the blood rushed again to his face but an extra squeeze of the instrument of torture sent it rushing back with a deadly chill to his heart  in spite of himself a sharp cry burst from his lips  turning suddenly round he clenched his right hand and hit his tormentor on the mouth with such force that his head was knocked violently against the steering oar and two or three of his front teeth were driven out  thou dogs whelp shouted hauskuld as soon as he could speak ill  he could say no more but grasping the boy by the hair of the head he seized his sword and would certainly have slain him on the spot had not the man named arne interposed  the king will not thank thee for his slaying said he laying his hand on hauskulds arm  the latter made no reply except to utter a curse then dropping his sword he struck alric a blow on the forehead with his fist which knocked him insensible into the bottom of the boat  yonder is the mouth of the cave exclaimed one of the men  it may be the one we look for muttered hauskuld  pull into it  so saying he steered the boat into the cavern and its keel soon grated on the gravelly beach inside  the sound aroused alric who at first could not see owing to the gloom of the place and the effects of the blow but he was brought suddenly to a state of mental activity and anxiety when he recognised the sides of the wellknown cave  rising quickly but cautiously he listened and knew by the sounds that the boatmen of whom there were eight were searching for an outlet towards the land  he therefore slipped over the side of the boat and hastened towards the darkest side of the cave but hauskuld caught sight of him  ha is the little dog trying to get away he shouted running after him  the lad formed his plan instantly  come on hauskuld he shouted with a wild laugh i will show thee the outlet and get out before thee too  he then ran to the inner part of the cave that was farthest from the secret opening shouting as he ran and making as much noise as possible  the berserk and his men followed  the instant he reached the extremity of the place alric became as silent as a mouse kicked off his shoes and ran nimbly round by the intricate turnings of the inner wall until he came to the foot of the dark natural staircase which has been referred to at the beginning of our tale  up this he bounded and reached the open air above while his pursuers were still knocking their shins and heads on the rocks at the wrong end of the cave below  without a moments pause the exulting boy dashed away towards ulfstede he had not run two hundred yards however when he observed three men standing on the top of the little mound to which the people of ulfstede were wont to mount when they wished to obtain an uninterrupted view of the valley and the fiord  they hailed him at that moment so he turned aside and found on drawing near that they were his brother erling glumm the gruff and kettle flatnose  why alric exclaimed erling in surprise on seeing the boys swelled and bloody face what ails thee  quick come with me all of ye  there is work for your swords at hand lend me thy sword erling  it is the short one and the axe will be enough for thee  the excited lad did not wait for permission but snatched the sword from his brothers side and without further explanation ran back towards the cliffs followed closely by the astonished men  he made straight for the hole that led to the cave and was about to leap into it when hauskuld stepped out and almost received him in his arms  before the berserk could plant his feet firmly on the turf alric heaved up his brothers sword and brought it down on hauskulds head with right good will  his arm however had not yet received power to cleave through a steel helmet but the blow was sufficient to give it such a dint that its wearer tumbled back into the hole and went rattling down the steep descent heels over head into the cave  the boy leaped down after him but hauskuld although taken by surprise and partially stunned had vigour enough left to jump up and run down to the boat  his men on hearing the noise of his fall had also rushed to the boat and pushed off  the berserk sprang into the water and swam after them just as his pursuers reached the cave  seeing this his men being safe beyond pursuit lay on their oars and waited for him  but hauskulds career had been run out  either the fall had stunned him or he was seized with a fit for he suddenly raised himself in the water and uttering a cry that echoed fearfully in the roof of the cavern he sank to the bottom  still his men waited a minute or two but seeing that he did not rise again they pulled away  it is unlucky that they should have escaped thus said alric for they go to tell king harald what they have seen  friends said erling i have a plan in my head to cheat the king  i shall send thorer round with my swan to this cave and here let it lie well armed and provisioned during the battle that we shall have to fight with harald ere long  if ill luck should be ours those of us who survive will thus have a chance of escaping with the women  what need is there of that said glumm we are sure to give him the toothache  we are sure of nothing in this world replied erling save that the sun will rise and set and the seasons will come and go  i shall do as i have said chiefly for the sake of the women whom i should not like to see fall into the hands of king harald and i counsel thee to do the same with thy small ship the crane  it can well be spared for we are like to have a goodly force of men and ships if i mistake not the spirit that is abroad  well i will do it said glumm  and alric will not object i dare say to stand sentinel over the ships in the cave with two or three men till they are wanted said erling  that will not i cried alric who was delighted to be employed in any service rather than be left at home for his father deeming him still too young had strictly forbidden him to embark in the fleet  well then the sooner this is set about the better said erling for there is no counting on the movements of the king  humph ejaculated glumm  ill luck to the tyrant said kettle flatnose as they turned and left the cave    chapter twenty one  glumm gains a great private victorythe dalesmen assemble to fight for freedomthe foe appears and the signal of battle is sounded  again we return to the mound near ulfstede the top of which was now bathed in the rays of the morning sunfor the day had only begun the events narrated at the end of the last chapter having occurred within a period of less than three hours  here stood the fair hilda and the volatile ada the former leaning on the arm of the latter and both gazing intently and in silence on the heartstirring scene before them  once again horlingdal with its fiord was the scene of an assembly of armed men but this time the concourse was grander because much greater than on a previous occasion  men had learned by recent events that momentous changes were taking place in the land  the news of the kings acts had been carried far and wide everyone felt that a decisive blow was about to be struck somewhere and although many hundreds had little or no opinion of their own as to what was best for the interests of the kingdom they knew that a side must be taken and were quite willing to take that which appeared to be the right or which seemed most likely to win while a large proportion of them were intelligently and resolutely opposed to the kings designs thus when the wartoken was sent round it was answered promptly those who dwelt nearest to the place of rendezvous were soon assembled in great numbers and from the elevated point on which the girls stood their glittering masses could be seen on the shore while they launched their longships and loaded them with stonesthe ammunition of those daysor passed briskly to and fro with arms and provisions while all up the valley as far as the eye could see even to the faint blue distance in the haze of which the glaciers and clouds and mountain tops seemed to commingle troops of armed men could be seen pouring down from gorge and glen through wood and furze and fen  on the fiord too the same activity and concentration prevailed though not quite to the same extent  constantly there swept round the promontories to the north and south boat after boat and ship after ship until the bay close below ulfstede was crowded with warcraft of every sizetheir gay sails and in some cases gilded masts and figureheads glancing in the sunshine and their shieldcircled gunwales reflected clearly in the sea  what a grand sight exclaimed ada with enthusiasm as she listened to the deeptoned hum of the busy multitude below  would god i had never seen it said her companion  out upon thee hilda  i scarce deem thee fit to be a free norse maiden  such a scene would stir the heart of stone  it does stir my heart strangely sister replied hilda i scarcely can explain how  i feel exultation when i see the might of our district and the bold bearing of our brave and brisk men but my heart sinks again when i think of what is to comethe blood of men flowing like water death sweeping them down like grain before the sickle and for what  ada these go not forth to defend us from our enemies they go to war with brothers and kindredwith norsemen  ada beat her foot impatiently on the sod and frowned a little as she said  i know it well enough but it is a grand sight for all that and it does no good to peep into the future as thou art doing continually  i do not peep replied hilda the future stares me full in the face  well let it stare sister mine said ada with a laugh as she cleared her brow and stare past its face at what lies before thee at present which is beautiful enough thou must allow  at that moment there seemed to be increasing bustle and energy on the part of the warriors on the shore and the murmur of their voices grew louder  what can that mean i wonder said ada  fresh news arrived perhaps replied her friend  the christians god grant that this war may be averted  amen if it be his will said a deep voice behind the girls who turned and found the hermit standing at their side  but hilda he continued god does not always answer our prayers in the way we expectsometimes because we pray for the wrong thing and sometimes because we pray that the right thing may come to us in the wrong way  i like best to end my petitions with the words of my dear saviour jesus christthy will be done  just now it would seem as if war were ordained to go on for a scout has just come in to say that king harald with his fleet is on the other side of yonder point and i am sent to fetch thee down to a place of safety without delay  who sent thee demanded ada  thy fosterfather  methinks we are safe enough here she said with a gesture of impatience  aye if we win the day but not if we lose it said the old man  come said hilda we must obey our father  i have no intention of disobeying him retorted the other tossing her head  just then alric ran up with a look of anxiety on his swelled and bloodstained face  come girls ye are in the way here  hasteah here comes erlingand glumm too  the two young men ran up the hill as he spoke  come with us quickly cried erling we do not wish the kings people to see anyone on this mound  let me lead thee down hilda  he took her by the hand and led her away  glumm went forward to ada whose old spirit was evidently still alive for she glanced at the hermit and appeared as if inclined to put herself under his protection but there was something in glumms expression that arrested her  his gruffness had forsaken him and he came forward with an unembarrassed and dignified bearing  ada he said in a gentle but deliberate voice while he gazed into her face so earnestly that she was fain to drop her eyes thou must decide my fate now  today it is likely i shall fight my last battle in my fatherland  death will be abroad on the fiord more than willing to be courted by all who choose to woo him say dear maid am i to be thy protector or not  ada hesitated and clasped her hands tightly together while the telltale blood rushed to her cheeks  glumm ever stupid on these matters said no other word but turned on his heel and strode quickly away  stay she said  she did not say this loudly but glumm heard it turned round and strode back again  ada silently placed her hand in hisit trembled as she did soand glumm led her down the hill  the girls were escorted by their lovers only as far as ulfstede  with all the other women of the place and the old people they were put under the care of the hermit who conveyed them safely to haldorstede there to await the issue of the day  meanwhile haldor erling glumm hakon of drontheim ulf guttorm stoutheart and all the other seakings not only of horlingdal but of the surrounding valleys with a host of smaller bonders unfreemen and thralls went down to the shores of the bay and prepared for battle  it is needless to say that all were armed to the teethwith coats of mail and shirts of wolfskin swords and battleaxes bows and arrows halberds and spears morning stars and bills scythes javelins ironshod polesand many other weapons  the principal ships of the fleet were of course those belonging to haldor ulf and the wealthier men of the district  some of these were very largehaving thirty benches of rowers and being capable of carrying above a hundred and fifty men  all of them were more or less decorated and a stately brilliant spectacle they presented with their quaint towering figureheads their high poops shieldhung sides and numerous oars  many proud thoughts doubtless filled the hearts of these seakings as they looked at their ships and men and silently wended their way down to the strand  in the case of haldor and erling however if not of others such thoughts were tempered with the feeling that momentous issues hung on the fate of the day  well was it for all concerned that the men who led them that day were so full of forethought and energy for scarcely had they completed their preparations and embarked their forces when the ships of harald fairhair swept round the northern promontory  if the fleet of the small kings of horlingdal and the south was imposing that of the king of norway was still more so  besides being stronger in numbers and many of the warships being largerhis own huge vessel the dragon led the van appearing like a gorgeous and gigantic seamonster  the king was very proud of this longship  it had recently been built by him and was one of the largest that had ever been seen in norway  the exact dimensions of it are not now known but we know that it had thirtytwo banks for rowers from which we may infer that it must have been of nearly the same size with the long serpent a war vessel of thirtyfour banks which was built about the end of the tenth century and some of the dimensions of which are given in the saga of olaf tryggvesson  the length of her keel that rested on the grass we are told was about 111 feet which is not far short of the length of the keel of one of our fortytwo gun frigates  as these warships were long in proportion to their breadth like our modern steamers this speaks to a size approaching 400 tons burden  as we have said the dragon was a gorgeous vessel  it had a high poop and forecastle a low waist or middle part and a splendidly gilt and painted stern figurehead and tail  the sides which were as usual hung round with the red and white painted shields of the crew were pierced for sixtyfour oars that is thirtytwo on each side being two oars to each bank or bench and as there were three men to each oar this gave a total crew of 192 men but in truth the vessel contained including steersmen and supernumeraries above 200 men  under the feet of the rowers in the waist were chests of arms piles of stones to be used as missiles provisions clothing goods and stores all of which were protected by a deck of movable hatches  on this deck the crew slept at nights sheltered by an awning or sail when it was not convenient for them to land and sleep on the beach in their tents with which all the vessels of the norsemen were usually supplied  there was but one great mast forty feet high and one enormous square sail to this ship  the mast was tipped with gilding and the sail was of alternate strips of red white and blue cloth  each space between the banks served as the berth of six or eight men and was divided into half berthsstarboard and larboardfor the men who worked the corresponding oars  on the richly ornamented poop stood the king himself surrounded by his bodyguard and chief men of the court including jarl rongvold and thiodolph the scald from the stem to the midhold was the forecastle on which were stationed the kings berserkers under hake of hadeland  all the men of hakes band were splendid fellows for king harald having a choice of men from the best of every district took into his house troop only such as were remarkable for strength courage and dexterity in the use of their weapons  it must not be supposed that the rest of haralds fleet was composed of small vessels  on the contrary some of them were not far short of his own in point of size  many of his jarls were wealthy men and had joined him some with ten or twenty and others with thirty or even forty ships of various sizes  many of them had from twenty to thirty banks for rowers with crews of 100 or 150 men  there were also great numbers of cutters with ten or fifteen banks and from thirty to fifty men in each besides a swarm of lesser craft about the size of our ordinary herring boats  there were many men of note in this fleet such as king sigurd of royer and simuns sons onund and andreas nicolas skialdvarsson eindrid a son of mornef who was the most gallant and popular man in the drontheim country and many others the whole composing a formidable force of seven or eight thousand warriors  with haldor the fierce on the other hand there was a goodly force of men and ships for the whole south country had been aroused and they came pouring into the fiord continuously  nevertheless they did not number nearly so large a force as that under king harald  besides those who have been already named there were eric king of hordaland sulke king of rogaland and his brother jarl sote kiotve the rich king of agder and his son thor haklang also the brothers roald ryg and hadd the hard of thelemark besides many others  but their whole number did not exceed four thousand men and the worst of it all was that among these there were a great many of the smaller men and a few of the chiefs whose hearts were not very enthusiastic in the cause and who had no very strong objection to take service under harald fairhair  these however held their peace because the greater men among them and the chief leaders such as haldor and ulf were very stern and decided in their determination to resist the king  now when the report was brought that haralds fleet had doubled the distant cape beyond hafurdsfiord the people crowded to the top of the cliffs behind ulfstede to watch it and when it was clearly seen that it was so much larger than their own there were a few who began to say that it would be wiser to refrain from resistance but haldor called a thing together on the spot by sound of horn and a great many short pithy speeches were made on both sides of the question  those who were for war were by far the most able men and so full of fire that they infused much of their own spirit into those who heard them  erling in particular was very energetic in his denunciation of the illegality of haralds proceedings and even glumm plucked up heart to leap to his feet and declare with a face blazing with wrath that he would rather be drowned in the fiord like a dog or quit his native land for ever than remain at home to be the slave of any man  glumm was not as the reader is aware famed for eloquence nevertheless the abruptness of his fiery spirit the quick rush of his few sputtered words and the clatter of his arms as he struck his fist violently against his shield drew from the multitude a loud burst of applause he had in him a good deal of that element which we moderns call go whatever he did was effectively done  the last who spoke was solve klofe  that redoubtable warrior ascended the hill just as glumm had finished his remarks  he immediately stood forward and raised his hand with an impassioned gesture  glumm is right he cried  it is now clear that we have but one course to take and that is to rise all as one man against king harald for although outnumbered we still have strength enough to fight for our ancient rights  fate must decide the victory  if we cannot conquer at all events we can die  as to becoming his servants that is no condition for us  my father thought it better to fall in battle than to go willingly into king haralds service or refuse to abide the chance of weapons like the numedal kings  that is well spoken cried haldor after the shout with which this was received had subsided  the thing is at an end and now we shall make ready for it can be but a short time until we meet  let the people take their weapons and every man be at his post so that all may be ready when the warhorn sounds the signal to cast off from the land see note 1 then let us throw off at once and together so that none go on before the rest of the ships and none lag behind when we row out of the fiord  when we meet and the battle begins let people be on the alert to bring all our ships in close order and ready to bind them together  let us spare ourselves in the beginning and take care of our weapons that we do not cast them into the sea or shoot them away in the air to no purpose  but when the fight becomes hot and the ships are bound together then let each man show what spirit is in him and how well he can fight for country law and freedom  a loud ringing cheer was the answer to this speech and then the whole concourse hurried down the hill and embarked the vessels were quickly arranged in order according to their size the warhorn sounded thousands of oars dipped at the same moment the blue waters of the fiord were torn into milky foam and slowly steadily and in good order the fleet of the seakings left the strand doubled the cape to the north of horlingfiord and advanced in battle array to meet the foe    note 1  signals by call of trumpet were well understood in those times we read in the ancient sagas of the trumpetcall to arm to advance to attack to retreat to land and also to attend a court thing a house thing a general thing  these instruments were made of metal and there were regular trumpeters    chapter twenty two  describes a great sea fight and its consequences  harald fairhair stood on the poop of the great dragon and held the steering oar  when he saw the fleet of the seakings approaching he called jarl rongvold to him and said  methinks jarl that i now see the end of this war with the small kings  it is easy to perceive that the utmost force they are able to raise is here  now i intend to beat them today and break their strength for ever  but when the battle is over many of them will seek to escape  i would prevent that as much as may be  the king paused as if engaged in deep thought  how do you propose to do it sire  by means of a boom said the king  go thou summon hither the trustiest man in the fleet for such a purpose let him detach as many men and ships as he deems needful and go into yonder small fiord where there is a pine wood on the hillside  there let him make a long and strong boom of timber while we are engaged in the fight  i will drive as many of the ships as i can into horlingfiord and when that is done let him come out and stretch the boom right across so that none of them shall escape  and harkee see that the man thou choosest for this duty is an able man and does it well else shall his head be lopped off  after issuing this command the king resigned the helm and ordered his banner to be set up which was done immediately  at the same time his opponents shook out their banners and both fleets were put in order of battle  as both were arrayed much in the same way it will be sufficient to describe the arrangements made by haldor the fierce who had been elected commanderinchief of the small kings fleet  when haldor saw the kings banner displayed he unfurled his own in the centre of the fleet and arranged his force for attack right against it alongside of him on the right was ulf of romsdal with thirty ships and on his left was old guttorm stoutheart with twentyfive ships  these composed the centre of the line  kettle flatnose commanded the men on the forecastle in ulfs longship and thorer the thick was over those in haldors vessel  the right wing was commanded by solve klofe under whom were eric of hordaland with fifteen ships sulke of rogaland and his brother sote with thirty ships as well as kiotve of agder and some others with many shipsall of large size  the left wing was led by king hakon of drontheim under whom were roald ryg and hadd the hard and thor haklang with a good many ships  solve klofe laid his ships against king haralds left wing which was under eindrid son of mornef and hakon laid his against king sigurd of royer who led haralds right wing  all the chiefs on either side laid their ships according as they were bold or well equipped  when all was ready they bound the ships together by the stems and advanced towards each other at the sound of the wartrumpet  but as the fleets were so large many of the smaller vessels remained loose and as it were went about skirmishing independently  these were laid forward in the fight according to the courage of their commanders which was very unequal  among these roving warriors were our heroes erling and glumm each in one of his own small cutters with about forty men  as soon as the warblast sounded the men rode forward to the attack and soon narrowed the small space that lay between the hostile fleets  then haldor and the other commanders went down to the sides of their ships where the men stood so thick that their shields touched all round and encouraged them to fight well for the freedom of old norwayto which they replied with loud huzzas  immediately after the air was darkened with a cloud of arrows and the fight began  there were scalds in both fleets at that fight these afterwards wrote a poem descriptive of it part of which we now quote    with falcon eye and courage bright   haldor the fierce prepared for fight   hand up the arms to one and all   he cries  my men well win or fall   sooner than fly heaped on each other   each man will fall across his brother   thus spake and through his vessels throng   his mighty warship moved along   he ran her gaily to the front   to meet the coming battles brunt   then gave the word the ships to bind   and shake his banner to the wind   our oars were stowed our lances high   swung to and fro athwart the sky   haldor the fierce went through the ranks   drawn up beside the rowers banks   where rows of shields seemed to enclose   the ships deck from the boarding foes   encouraging his chosen crew   he tells his brave lads to stand true   and rows againstwhile arrows sing   the dragon of the tyrant king   with glowing hearts and loud huzzas   his men lay on in freedoms cause   the seasteeds foam they plunge and rock   the warriors meet in battle shock   the ringlinked coats of strongest mail   could not withstand the iron hail   the fire of battle raged around   odins steel shirts flew all unbound   the pelting shower of stone and steel   caused many a norseman stout to reel   the red blood poured like summer rain   the foam was scarlet on the main   but all unmoved like oak in wood   silent and grim fierce haldor stood   until his axe could reach the foe   thenswift he thundered blow on blow   and ever as his axe came down   it cleft or crushed another crown   elsewhere the chiefs on either side   fought gallantly above the tide   king hakon pressed king sigurd sore   and ulf made hake the berserk roar   and kettle flatnose dared to spring   on board the ship of norways king   old guttorm stouthearts mighty shout   above the din was heard throughout   and solve klofe gainst mornefs son   slew right and left till day was done   while all around the loose ships rowed   whereer they went the red stream flowed   chief among these was erling bold   and glumm the gruff of whom tis told   they rushed in thickest of the fray   whatever part the line gave way   and twice and thrice retrieved the day   but heart and strength and courage true   could not avail where one fought two   king harald foremost in the fight   with flashing sword resistless might   pushed on and slew and dyed with red   the bright steel cap on many a head   against the heros shield in vain   the arrowstorm sends forth its rain   the javelins and spearthrusts fail   to pierce his coat of ringed mail   the king stands on the bloodstained deck   trampling on many a foemans neck   and high above the dinning stound   of helm and axe and ringing sound   of blade and shield and ravens cry   is heard the shout ofvictory  in this poem the scald gives only an outline of the great fight  let us follow more closely the action of those in whom we are peculiarly interested  for more than two hours the battle raged with unabated furyvictory inclining to neither side but as the day advanced the energy with which solve klofe pushed the right wing began to tell and the kings men gave way a little at that part  harald however was on the alert he sent some of his loose ships to reinforce them and so regained his position  a short time after that some of solves ships were boarded but at that moment erling and glumm chanced to pass in their cutters for they kept always close togetherand they gave such a shout while they turned and pulled to the rescue that the men who were wavering took heart again and drove the foe overboard  just then the ship on the right of solve klofes vessel was also boarded by the enemy  seeing this erling called to glumm that there was need of succour there and they rowed swiftly to the spot  art thou hard pressed solve asked erling as he ranged up to the stern of his friends ship  solve was so furious that he could not answer but pointed to the ship next his and sprang on the edge of his own intending to leap into that of the enemy and get to the forefront  at the same time eindrid son of mornef stood up on the high foredeck of his ship with a large stone in his hand  he was a very powerful man and hurled the stone with such force against solves shield that it battered him down and he fell back into his own ship much stunned  seeing this erling bade two of his men follow him leaped into solves ship and thence into the one where the fight was sharpest  glumm followed him closely with his long twohanded sword and these two fought so dreadfully that eindrids men were driven back into their own ship again  then erling ran to the place where the high stern was wedged between two of the enemys ships and sprang on the forecastle of eindrids ship  thou art a bold man said eindrid turning on him  that may be as thou sayest replied erling at the same time catching a thrust on his shield which he returned with such interest with his axe that eindrids head was nearly severed from his body  at the same moment glumm cut down a famous berserk who ran at him and in a few minutes they had cleared the deck of the ship and taken possession of it  but this was scarcely accomplished when a cry arose that the left wing under king hakon was giving way  at once erling and glumm ran back to their cutters and made towards that part of the line followed by several of the loose ships  here they found that king hakon was very hard pressed by sigurd of royer so they pushed in among the ships and soon erlings wellknown warcry was heard and his tall form was seen sweeping men down before him with his great axe like a mower cutting grass  glumm however did not keep close to him this time but made direct for hakons ship for he remembered that he was adas father and thought he might do him some service  as he was coming near he saw swankie a famous berserk fighting furiously on board hakons ship and roaring as was the wont of berserkers sometimes like a wild bull  hakons men had formed a shieldcircle round their chief and were defending him bravely but the berserk was an uncommonly stout man very brisk and active and exceedingly furious as well as dexterous with his weapons  he slew so many men that the shieldcircle was broken and he made at hakon just as glumm leaped into the ship at the stern  king hakon was a stout man and brave but he was getting old and not so active as he used to be nevertheless he met swankie like a man and dealt him a blow on his helmet which made him stagger  the berserk uttered a fearful roar and struck at hakon so fiercely that he split the upper part of his shield and cut open his helmet  hakon fell but before he could repeat the blow glumm was upon him  what is it thou swankie he cried  dog methought i had killed thee long ago  that is yet to be done cried the berserk leaping upon glumm with a sweeping blow of his sword  glumm stooped quickly and the blow passed over his head then he fetched a sudden cut at swankie and split him down from the neck to the waist saying it is done now methinks as he drew out his sword  glumm did not go forward but let his men drive back the foe while he turned and kneeled beside hakon  has the dog hurt thee badly he asked raising the old warriors head on his knee and speaking in a voice of almost womanly tenderness  hakon made an effort to speak but for some time was unable to do so and glumm held his shield over him to keep off the stones and arrows which fell thickly around them  after a few moments hakon wiped away the blood which flowed from a deep wound in his forehead and looked up wildly in glumms face  he tried again to speak and glumm misunderstanding the few words he muttered said thou art already avenged king hakon swankie the berserk is dead  the dying man made another effort to speak and was successful  that concerns me little glumm  thou lovest ada i know  this ring take it to her say her fathers last thoughts were of her  be a good husband glumm  the broochsee  which asked glumm looking at several silver brooches with which the old warriors armour was fastenedthis one on thy breast  aye take itit washer mothers  the warriors spirit seemed to be relieved when he had said this  he sank down into a state resembling sleep  once or twice afterwards he opened his eyes and gazed up into the bright sky with a doubtful yet earnest and enquiring gaze  gradually the breathing became fainter until it ceased altogether and glumm saw that the old man was dead  fastening the brooch on his own broad chest and putting the ring on his finger glumm rose seized his sword and rushed again into the thick of the fight with tenfold more fury than he had yet displayed and ere long the danger that threatened the left wing was for the time averted  meanwhile in the centre there was an equally uncertain and obstinate conflictfor the chiefs on either side were mighty men of valour wherever old guttorms voice was heard there victory inclined  haldor on the other hand did not shout but he laid about him with such wild ferocity that many men quailed at the very sight of him and wherever he went he was victorious  it was some time before he managed to get alongside of king harald fairhairs ship but when he did so the fight became sharp in the extreme  all the men in king haralds ship except the berserks were clad in coats of ring mail and wore foreign helmets and most of them had white shields  besides as has been said each man was celebrated for personal strength and daring so that none of those who were opposed to them could make head against them  the arrows and spears fell harmless from their shields casques and coats of mail and it was only now and thenas when a shaft happened to enter a mans eyethat any fell when haldors forecastle men attacked the berserkers on the high fore deck of the dragon the fighting was terrible for the berserkers all roared aloud and fought with the wild fury of madmen and so fierce was their onslaught that haldors men were forced at first to give back but thorer the thick guarded himself warily and being well armed escaped injury for a time  when he saw the berserkers beginning to flag he leaped forward like a lion and hewed them down right and left so that his men drove the enemy back into the dragon  some of them slipped on the gunwales and so did some of haldors men all of whom fell into the sea and a few of them were drowned while others were killed but one or two escaped by swimming  ulfs ship was also pretty close to the dragon and he wished greatly to board it but was so hard beset by the ship of nicolas skialdvarsson that he could not do so for a long time  here kettle flatnose did prodigies of valour  he stood on the high foredeck with his favourite weapon the hook and therewith pulled a great number of men off the enemys deck into the sea  at last he got a footing on their gunwale dropped his hook drew his sword and soon cleared his way aft  ulf leaped after him drove the men into the waist and then the most of them were slain and lay in heaps one upon another  after that it was not difficult to clear the poop  skialdvarsson defended it well but he could not stand before ulf who finally cut off his head and so the ship was won  this vessel lay alongside that of king harald and although the king was fully engaged with haldor at the time he observed the conquest of skialdvarsson by ulf and also perceived that ulfs men were crowding the side of the vessel and throwing grapplingirons into his own ship with a view to board it for there was a space between the ships a little too wide for men to leap  springing to the side the king cut the grapplingirons with a sweep of his sword  that was well tried he said  it shall be tried again cried ulf heaving another iron which nearly struck the king but haralds sword flashed through the air and again the iron was cut  at that moment kettle flatnose stepped back a few paces and with a mighty rush leaped right over the space in all his war gear and alighted on the dragons deck within a yard of the king  it was a tremendous leap and so nearly beyond the compass of kettles powers that he was scarcely able to retain his foothold but stood for a moment on the edge of the vessel with shield and sword upheaved as he staggered to regain his balance  thus exposed he might have easily been slain but the king instead of using his sword stepped forward and with his left hand pushed the irishman overboard  the cheer which greeted his daring leap had scarcely ceased to ring when he fell heavily into the sea  a goodly man and a bold attempt said the king with a smile as he turned to jarl rongvold  twould have been a pity to slay him outright  if he can swim he may yet live to fight another battle  true sire replied the jarl who was looking over the side at the place where kettle fell but methinks he has struck his head on an oar and will never succeed in swimming towards a friendly hand  this indeed seemed to be true for kettle lay with his arm over an oar and his head hanging down in the water like a dead man  yet there was life in him for his fingers moved  ulf had witnessed all this and was on the point of attempting to leap across to haralds ship when kettle fell  he paused and seeing that his comrade was apparently being drowned at once dropped sword and shield and sprang into the sea after him  at that moment a number of the kings boldest and best armed men observed that the two ships had drawn a little nearer to each other  in a moment they leaped across the intervening space took their opponents by surprise and quickly regained the ship  while this had been going on at the poop the fight on the forecastle had raged with extreme fury for haldor the fierce had gained a footing on the dragons deck and was engaged in mortal combat with hake the berserk whom he was slowly but surely driving back  his son erling the bold who observed what was going on had run his cutter along the stern of his fathers ship and was hastening to his aid when king harald became aware that his men were giving way and rushed to their support he went forward raging with anger and as he ran he picked up a huge stone which he hurled before him  haldor was at the moment in the act of fetching a deadly cut at hake whom he had disarmed  the stone struck him full in the chest and he fell backward just as erling reached his side  a great cheer arose at this time on the right for there the wing of the southland men was broken and everywhere king haralds men were victorious  hold thou them in check glumm cried erling to his friend as he quickly raised his father in his arms and bore him away to his cutter  glumm who had followed his friend like his shadow sprang forward and engaged hake who had recovered his sword and who found this new enemy little if at all less formidable than the other  erling placed his father carefully in the cutter  here thorer he said do thou guard my father and hold thyself and the carles in readiness to push off  the day is lost i see  i go to slay the king and will return presently  he leaped away as he spoke and regained the foredeck of the dragon where glumm and his men were still engaged with the berserkers just as the king came to the front  the instant he saw erling he leaped upon him with a fierce shout and shook back his shaggy flaxen locks as a lion might shake his mane  erling was not a whit behind him in anxiety to meet  he sprang upon him with a crashing blow of his great poleaxe which rang loudly on the kings shield but did him no hurt  they were a wellmatched pair  harald was fully as stout though not quite so tall as his opponent whose fine silky hair was almost as bushy as that of the king though neither so long nor so tangled  men drew back and stood aside when they heard the shock and shout of their onset and suspended the fight around them while they gazed on in silent awe  for a time it seemed doubtful which was the better man for the kings blade whirled incessantly around his head like flashing light and rang on erlings shield which was ever upraised to meet it at the same time the axe of our hero if not so swift in its gyrations was more tremendous in its action more than once the king was seen to stagger beneath its thundering blows and once he was beaten down on one knee  how long this might have lasted it is impossible to tell but seeing that the king was likely to get the worst of it one of his men crept round by the outside of the ship and coming suddenly up behind erling put out his hand and caught him by the leg causing him to stagger backwards so that he fell overboard  in falling our hero caught the man by the throat and both fell into the sea together  it was seen that erling dived with his foe and dragged him down as if to force him to perish along with him and everyone looked for a few moments at the water expecting to see them rise  glumm gazed among the rest and he had leaped down into haldors ship to be ready to lend a hand  but erling did not rise again  seeing this glumm sprang up with sudden fury and dashed at the enemy but by this time they had recovered from their surprise and now poured into the ship in such overwhelming numbers that the men were driven back and slain or they leaped overboard and trusted to escape by swimming  meanwhile erling the bold having choked off his antagonist dived under his fathers ship and came up at the stern of his own cutter into which he speedily clambered by means of a rope which hung over the side  he found that his father was seated on the poop with his head resting on the gunwale recovering consciousness slowly and thorer was engaged in the difficult task of preventing the men from leaving the vessel to succour their comrades  keep back men cried erling in a voice which none dared to disobey stay where ye are and get out the oarscome thorer follow me with a stout man and keep them back while i rescue glumm  he jumped into haldors ship and ran to the fore part of the poop where glumm was fighting against overwhelming odds with the blind desperation of a man who has resolved to sell his life as dearly as he can  thorer and a tall stout man followed him and instantly assailed king haralds men with such fury that they gave back a little  at the same moment erling seized glumm by the neck almost strangled him dragged him violently to the stern and half sprang half tumbled with him into the cutter where despite his frantic struggles to rise he held him down  now my brisk lads shouted erling who was gasping by this time come back and jump in  push off an ell or so  steady  thorer and the other man heard the shout and turning at once ran to the stern and leaped into the cutter which was instantly thrust off so that one or two of their opponents who ventured to jump after them were left floundering in the sea  by this time king haralds victory was complete  both wings had been beaten for some time and now the centre had given wayonly one or two of the more desperate leaders were still keeping up the fight  as erling rowed towards the shore he could see that all the loose vessels of the fleet were flying up the fiord pursued by a few of the loose vessels of the enemy  but the greater part of both fleets being tied together could take no part in the chase until they were cut asunder  the day is lost father said erling as he stood by the steering oar  i know it my son replied haldor who was now able to sit up and look about him norway is henceforth enthralled  he said this in a tone of such deep sadness that erling forbore to continue the subject  they are cutting asunder the fleet observed glumm who had recovered selfpossession and stood looking back at the scene of the recent conflict surely some of them are trying to escape  as he spoke one of the large vessels shot out from among the others and rowed rapidly away  there was desperate fighting on board of it for a few minutes and then a number of men were pushed or thrown overboard and a loud cheer of victory arose  well done solve klofe cried erling with enthusiasm  that is his shout  i should know it among a thousand  he at least is bent on being free  several of haralds ships which had been also cut loose immediately gave chase but solves men pulled so well that they soon left them behind and hoisting their sail to a light breeze which was blowing just off the mouth of the fiord soon doubled the point and bore away to the south  is that someone swimming in the water asked erling pointing as he spoke to an object which moved forward among the debris of oars portions of clothing and wreck which was floating about everywhere  one of the men at the bow oar stood up and after a short glance said that he thought it was a man  look out on the starboard bow  mind your oars and be ready someone to lean over the waist and catch hold of him  as he spoke the cutter ranged up to the object which appeared to be the dishevelled and bloodbespattered head of a man  he suddenly gave vent to a wild shoutcome on thou tyrant  down with ye doghuzza at the last shout a pair of arms were swung wildly in the air and the next moment the mans voice was stifled in the water as he sank while another head appeared beside him  that is the voice of kettle flatnose or his wraith exclaimed erling pull gently lads hold water  why ulf is it thou  truly exclaimed ulf grasping the extended hand of glumm i dont feel quite sure  haul gently glumm  ive got kettle here  another hand or two  now then heave together  several stout men leaned over the side and acting in accordance with these instructions hauled ulf and kettle out of the sea the former in a state of great exhaustion the latter almost dead for his last dip had wellnigh choked him  it has been a long swim said ulf sitting down and leaning languidly against the bulwarks while glumm and haldor proceeded to chafe the irishman into a state of consciousness  once or twice i sank under him for he was very wild when he came to himself after i got hold of him and struggled to be up and fight the king but i held him fast yet methought once or twice added ulf with a smile that i had at last got into valhalla  a horn of ale refreshed ulf and another of the same was shortly after given to kettle by which his wandering faculties were soon restored  by this time they were drawing near the bay at ulfstede and erling urged on the rowers for they could see that haralds ships were now cast loose and giving chase to those that endeavoured to escape while several of the largest including the dragon made direct for the land  our whole effort now said haldor must be to rescue the women  that will not be easy observed ulf gloomily  but it is not impossible said erling with decision  we shall have time to get into the woods and so round to the cave  by the way does anyone know aught of hakon of drontheim  he is dead said glumm  dead  at that moment haldor started up with a wild exclamation and pointed towards the spot on which his own dwelling stood where above the trees there arose a cloud of dense black smoke  the truth was soon all too plain for on rounding the point which had hitherto concealed the bay from their view several of the enemys largest ships were seen with their bows on the shore  it was evident that part of the left wing of the enemy which was first victorious had unobserved by them made for the shore and landed a large force of men who had hastened to ulfstede and finding it deserted had pushed on to haldorstede which they had set on fire  now indeed would death be welcome cried haldor stamping fiercely on the deck while every feature of his face blazed with wrath  we need scarcely say that the hearts of all had sunk within them but erling saiddeath would be unwelcome yet father  the men no doubt are killed but be sure they will not hurt the women while king harald is on his way to the stede  we may yet die in defending them if we cannot save them  true my son said haldor clasping his hands and looking upwards with a solemnity of expression that was in strong contrast with his recent burst of passion we may perchance save them as thou sayest but woe is me for poor alric  alric is safe i am certain said erling energetically as he turned a meaning glance on glumm  how knowest thou that asked haldor  erling hesitated to reply not wishing to raise hopes that after all might prove to be fallacious  before the question could be repeated the cutters keel grated on the sand of a small bay which was close to the large one and concealed from it by a small rocky islet  here they all jumped ashoreall except kettle flatnose who on attempting to rise found himself so weak that he fell down again and nearly fainted  this is bad said erling  but come we have no time to waste  give me the chief command of our men father i have a plan in my head  do as thou wilt said haldor with a strange mixture of despair resignation and ferocity in his tone  come then form up men and follow me  so saying erling lifted kettle in his arms and hurried away with him as if he had been no heavier than a little boy  he led the way to the secret entrance to the cave where true as steel to his trust little alric was found with a few men guarding the two warships of erling and glumm    chapter twenty three  the end of an old seaking  haldor the fierce said nothing when he heard alrics blithe voice in the cavern but he caught him up in his arms and gave him a hug that almost made him cry out  why father what ails thee asked the boy in surprise when haldor set him free  never mind lad interposed erling but lend a hand to keep kettle in order  he is a little wild just now and as i intend to leave him in thy charge we must restrain him a bit  hand me that rope  the boy obeyed in silence but with much wonder depicted on his face while erling lashed kettles hands together and lifting him in a halfunconscious state into his ship bound him in as comfortable a position as he could to one of the rowers banks  now alric come aside with me quick  i have only time for a few words  it is enough to tell thee that the day is lost  i go with our father and the men to save our mother and the other women or to die thou wilt stay here with a few men to guard the ships and be ready to cast off at a moments notice  if we return not before night do thou creep out and try to ascertain what has become of us and if ye have reason to think we are killed cut kettles bonds and let him do what he will poor fellow  at present his head has got a knock that renders him a dangerous comrade so he must remain tied  of course if the cave is attacked thou wilt set him free at once  there is a little boat at the stern of my swan  escape if thou canst  but be watchful  we may return in a few hours  if so all shall yet be well  dost understand me boy  i do but methinks ill luck awaits us  erling made no reply but kissing alrics forehead he returned to his men of whom there were about sixty and led them out of the cave leaving six with his little brother to guard the ships  while our hero is thus hastening to the rescue let us turn aside for a little to follow the course of guttorm stoutheart  that brave old seaking had escaped scathless throughout the whole of the disastrous day until near the end when he received his deathwound from a javelin which pierced his thigh and cut some important blood vessel to stanch which defied the skill of his attendants  he immediately ordered his ship to be cut loose and his was among the first to escape round the southern point of the fiord just before the battle ended  at first the men pulled as if their lives depended on it  so great was their haste that they did not take time to throw their dead comrades overboard but left them lying in a ghastly heap on the lower deck when however they got round the next point and found that no pursuit was made they slackened speed and began to heave out the dead when guttorm who reclined near the helm steering the vessel ordered them to desist  my men said he in a voice which had already lost much of its deep richness of tone we will land on the next point  my days are run out i go to odins halls and i am glad for it becomes not an old warrior to die in his bed which i had begun to fear was going to be my fate besides now that norway is to be no longer a free land it is time that the small kings should be going home  ye will carry me to the top of yonder headland cliff and leave me where i can see the setting sun and the fords and fells of my native land  would that my bones might have been burned as those of my fathers were but this may not be  ye can lay beside me the comrades who have gone before and then push off and leave me with the dead  there was a low murmur among the men as they again dipped their oars but not a word was spoken in reply  just as they reached the point a vessel came in sight behind them under sail  too late muttered guttorm bitterly as he looked back we are pursued and must hold on  not so answered one of his chief men that is solve klofes ship  is that so cried guttorm while the colour mounted to his pale cheek and the fire shone in his old eyes then have i better luck than i had looked for  quick get to land  the breeze that brings solve down will reach us soon  get out your arms and go hail solve as he passes  ye shall sail with him tonight  i will hie me out upon the sea  he spoke somewhat like his former self for a moment but soon his voice sank for the lifeblood was draining fast away  ere many minutes had passed the breeze freshened into a squall of considerable force  it came off the land and swept down the fiord lashing its waters into seething waves  solve answered the hail of guttorms men and landed  what news he asked there is but short space for converse  the men told him that old guttorm was dying in his ship  he walked up the plank that lay from the shore to the gunwale and found the old warrior lying on the poop beside the helm wrapped in his mantle and giving directions to his men who were piling brushwood on the deck  this is an ill sight said solve with much feeling as he knelt beside the dying chief who received him with a smile and held out his hand  ha  solve i am glad thou art here  my last battle has been fought and it has been a good one though we did get the toothache  if it had only been a victory i had recked little of this wound  can nothing be done for thee asked solve  perchance i may be able to stop the bleeding  guttorm shook his head and pointed to the blood which had already flowed from him and lay in a deep pool in the sides of the ship  no no solve my fighting days are over and as i have said the last fight has been a good one  ye see what i am about and understand how to carry out my will  go relieve me of the trouble and see that it is done well  i would rest now  solve pressed the hand of his friend in silence and then went forward to assist actively in the preparations already referred to  the men heaped up the funeral pile round the mast fastened the stern ropes to the shore plied the dead upon the deck and when all was ready hoisted sail  the squall had increased so that the mast bent and the ship strained at her stern ropes like an impatient charger  then the men went on shore and solve turning to guttorm bent over him and spoke a few words in a low earnest tone but the old mans strength was almost gone  he could only utter the single word farewell and wave his hand as if he wished to be left alone  solve rose at once and applying a light to the pile leaped ashore  next moment the cables were cut the brushwood crackled with a fierce noise as the fire leaped up and the ocean steed bounded away over the dark blue sea  guttorm was still seated by the helm his face pale as death but with a placid smile on his mouth and a strange almost unearthly fire in his eyes  the longship rushed over the waves with the foam dashing on her bows a long white track in her wake and a dense black cloud curling overhead suddenly the cloud was rent by a fork of flame which was as suddenly quenched but again it burst upwards and at last triumphed shooting up into the sky with a mighty roar while below there glowed a fierce fiery furnace against which was strongly depicted the form of the grand old seaking still sitting motionless at the helm  swiftly the blazing craft dashed over the waves getting more and more enveloped in smoke and flame  ere long it could be seen in the far distance a rushing ball of fire  gradually it receded becoming less and less until at last it vanished like a setting star into the unknown waste of the great western sea    chapter twenty four  hopes and fearsthe burning of haldorstede and escape of the family  meanwhile the family at haldorstede had made a narrow escape and some members of it were still in great peril  when hilda and ada were sent thither with the females of ulfstede under the charge of christian the hermit as already related they found dame herfrida and her maidens busily engaged in making preparations for a great feast  i prithee said dame astrid in some surprise who are to be thy guests tonight  who should be replied herfrida with a smile but the stout fellows who back my husband in the fight today  among them thine own goodman dame astrid and his housecarles for if no one is left at ulfstede there can be no supper there for them and as the poor lads are likely to be well worn out we must have something wherewith to cheer them  but what if ill luck betide us suggested astrid  ill luck never betides us replied herfrida with an expression of bland assurance on her handsome face  besides if it does we shall be none the worse for having done our part  some people are always forecasting evil muttered ingeborg with a sour look as she kneaded viciously a lump of dough which was destined to form cakes  and some other people are always forecasting good retorted ada with a smile so that things are pretty well balanced after all  come now ingeborg dont be cross but leave the dough and let us go to thy room for i want to have a little gossip with thee alone  ingeborg was fond of ada and particularly fond of a little gossip either public or private  she condescended therefore to smile as it were under protest and rubbing the dough from her fingers accompanied her friend to her chamber while the others broke into several groups and chatted more or less energetically as they worked or idled about the house  is there any fear of our men losing the day asked hilda of the hermit who stood looking out of a window which commanded a view of the fiord where the ships of the opposing fleets could be seen engaged in the battle that had just begun  poor hilda asked the question with a look of perplexity in her face for hitherto she had been so much accustomed to success attending the expeditions of her warlike father and friends that she had never given much thought to the idea of defeat and its consequences  it is not easy to answer that question replied the hermit for the success or failure of thy fathers host depends on many things with which i am not acquainted  if the forces on both sides are about equal in numbers the chances are in his favour for he is a mighty man of valour as well as his son and also thy father  besides there are many of his men who are not far behind them in strength and courage but they may be greatly outnumbered  if so defeat is possible  i would say it is probable did i not know that the ruler of events can if he will give victory to the weak and disaster to the strong  thy father deems his cause a righteous oneperhaps it is so  well then said hilda will not god who you say is just and good give victory to the righteous cause  he may be pleased to do so but he does not always do so  for his own good and wise ends he sometimes permits the righteous to suffer defeat and wrongdoers to gain the victory  this only do i know for certain that good shall come out of all things to his people whether these things be grievous or joyful for it is written all things work together for good to them that love god to them that are the called according to his purpose  this is my consolation when i am surrounded by darkness which i cannot understand and which seems all against me that things often pass my understanding does not surprise me for it is written his ways are wonderfulpast finding out  past finding out indeed said hilda thoughtfully  would that i had faith like thine christian for it seems to enable thee to trust and rejoice in darkness as well as in sunshine  thou mayst have it daughter answered the hermit earnestly if thou wilt condescend to ask it in the name of jesus for it is written faith is the gift of god and again it is written whatsoever ye shall ask the father in my name he will give it you  one of our chief sins consists in our desire to produce by means of our own will that faith which god tells us we cannot attain to by striving after but which he is willing to bestow as a free gift on those who ask  the conversation was interrupted here by the old housecarle finn the oneeyed who said in passing that he was going down to the cliffs to see and hear what was doing and would return ere long to report progress  for an hour after that the people at haldorstede continued to watch the fight with intense interest but although they could see the motion of the ships on the fiord and could hear the shout of war as it came floating down on the breeze like a faint murmur the distance was too great to permit of their distinguishing the individual combatants or observing the progress of the fight  that it was likely to go ill with their friends however was soon made known by finn who returned in hot haste to warn them to prepare for flight  be sure said dame herfrida that there is no need to flee until haldor or erling come to tell us to get ready  that may be so said finn but if haldor and erling should chance to be slain ill will it be for you if ye are not ready to fly  now it seems to me said dame astrid who was of an anxious temperament that thou art too confident herfrida  it would be wise at all events to get ready  does anyone know where alric is asked ingeborg  as everyone professed ignorance on this point his mother said that she had no doubt he was safe enough for he was a bold little man and quite able to take care of himself  if he has had his own way observed ivor the old who came in at that moment he is in the fleet for he is a true chip of the old tree but we are not like to see him again methinks for i have seen the fleet giving back on the right wing and hasted hither to tell ye  this report had the effect of shaking herfridas confidence to the extent of inducing her to give up her preparations for the feast and assist the others in making arrangements for a hasty flight with such household valuables as could be easily carried about the person  some time after they had begun this work a young man who was a cripple and therefore a noncombatant hobbled into the hall and announced the fact that haldors fleet was routed everywhere and fleeing  he had seen it from the cliff behind the stede and indeed it could partly be seen from the hall window  now cried finn the oneeyed bitterly all is lost and i must carry out erlings last instructions  he told me if the fight went against us and the kings men gained the day i was to lead ye down by the forest path to the cave behind ulfstede where there is a ship big enough to carry the whole household  if alive he and his friends are to meet us there  come we must make haste some of the ships are already on the beach and if they be the kings men we shall soon see them here  everyone was now so thoroughly convinced of their desperate case that without reply each went to complete arrangements as fast as possible  wilt thou go with us said finn to the hermit when all were assembled in front of the house at the edge of the forest  i will since god seems to order it so said the hermit but first i go to my hut for the rolls of the book  as ye have to pass the bottom of the cliff on which my dwelling is perched i will easily overtake you  let us go with him said hilda to ada  there is a roll in the hut which erling and i have been trying to copy christian may not be able to find it as i hid it carefully awayand she continued blushing slightly i should not like to lose it  you had better go with us said finn gravely  we will do what seems best to ourselves replied ada go on christian we follow  the hermit advised the girls to go with finn but as they were selfwilled he was fain to conduct them up the steep and narrow path that led to his hut upon the cliff while finn put himself at the head of a sad band of women children and aged retainers who could advance but slowly along the rugged and intricate path which he thought it necessary to take through the forest  not twenty minutes after they had left haldorstede the first band of king haralds men came rushing up the banks of the river enraged at having found ulfstede deserted and thirsting for plunder  they ran tumultuously into the house sword in hand and a yell of disappointment followed when they discovered that the inmates had fled  there is no doubt that they would have rushed out again and searched the woods had not the feast which herfrida had been preparing proved too attractive the cold salmon and huge tankards of ale proved irresistible to the tired and thirsty warriors who forthwith put the goblets to their bearded lips and quaffed the generous fluid so deeply that in a short time many of them were reeling and one who seemed to be more full of mischief than his fellows set the house on fire by way of a joke  it was the smoke which arose after the perpetration of this wanton act that had attracted the attention of haldor and his friends when they were making for the shore after the battle  of course the hermit and the two girls heard the shouts of the marauders and knew that it was now too late to escape along with the baud under finn for the only practicable path by which they could join them passed in full view of haldorstede and it was so hemmed in by a precipice that there was no other way of getting into the woodat least without the certainty of being seen  their retreat up the river was also cut off for the hermit in selecting the spot for his dwelling had chosen a path which ascended along the rugged face of a precipice so that with a precipice above and another below it was not possible to get to the bank of the river without returning on their track  there was no alternative therefore but to ascend to the hut and there wait patiently until the shades of night should favour their escape  finn pushed on as fast as was possible with a band in which there were so many almost helpless ones  he carried one of the youngest children in his arms and ivor the old brought up the rear with a very old woman leaning on his arm  they were a long time in descending the valley for the route finn had chosen was circuitous and the first part of it was extremely trying to the cripples running as it did over a somewhat high spur of the mountain which extended down from the main ridge to the river  gradually however they drew near to the coast and finn was in the act of encouraging them with the assurance that they had now only a short way to go when the hearts of all sank within them at the sight of a band of armed men who suddenly made their appearance in their path  the wail of despair which burst from some of them at sight of these was however changed into an exclamation of joy when four of the band ran hastily towards them and were recognised to be haldor erling ulf and glumm  now thanks be to the gods said haldor stooping to print a kiss on his wifes lips  butbutwhere are hilda and ada  erling and glumm glancing quickly round the group with looks of intense disappointment and alarm had already put this question to finn who explained the cause of their absence  now this is the worst luck of all cried glumm grinding his teeth together in passion and looking at finn with a dark scowl  erling did not speak for a few minutes but his heaving chest and dilated nostrils told of the storm that raged within him  art thou sure they went to the hermits hut asked ulf in a stern voice  quite sure replied finn  i cautioned them not to go but  enough cried erling  father wilt thou go back to the cave with the women and a few of the men to guard them  i will my son and then will i rejoin thee  that do an it please thee  it matters little  death must come sooner or later to allcome men we will now teach this tyrant that though he may conquer our bodies he cannot subdue our spirits  up and if we fail to rescue the girls everlasting disgrace be to him who leaves this vale alive  haldor had already selected a small detachment of men and turned back with the women and others while erling and his men went on as fast as they could run  a short time sufficed to bring them to the edge of the wood near haldorstede  the old place was now a smoking ruin with swarms of men around it most of whom were busily engaged in trying to put out the fire and save as much as possible from its fury  the man who had kindled it had already paid dearly for his jest with his life his body was seen swinging to the limb of a neighbouring tree  harald fairhair himself having just arrived was directing operations  there were by that time one or two thousand of the kings men on the ground while others were arriving every moment in troopsall bloodstained and covered with marks of the recent conflictand erling saw at once he had no chance whatever of accomplishing his aim by an open attack with only fifty men  he therefore led his force silently by a path that he well knew to an adjacent cliff over the edge of which they could see all that went on below while they were themselves well concealed  here the three leaders held a consultation  what dost thou advise ulf asked erling  my advice interposed glumm fiercely is that we should make a sudden assault without delay kill the king and then sell our lives dearly  and thus observed ulf with something like a sneer leave the girls without protectors and without a chance of deliverance  no he continued turning to our hero my advice is to wait here as patiently as we can until we ascertain where the girls are  few perhaps none of our men are known to haralds men one of them we can send down to mingle with the enemy as a spy  whatever we do must be done cautiously for the sake of the girls  that is good advice said a voice behind them which was that of the hermit who had crept towards them on his hands and knees  why christian whence comest thou said ulf  from my own hut replied the hermit raising himself where i have just left hilda and ada safe and well  we had deemed ourselves prisoners there till night should set us free but necessity sharpens the wit even of an old man and i have discovered a path through the woods which although difficult may be traversed without much chance of our being seen if done carefully  i have just passed along it in safety and was on the point of returning to the hut when i came upon you here  lead us to them at once cried glumm starting up  nay said the hermit laying his hand on the youths arm restrain thine ardour  it would be easier to bring the girls hither than to lead a band of armed men by that path without their being discovered if ye will take the advice of one who was a warrior in his youth there is some hope that god permitting we may all escape  ye know the crow cliff  well the small boat is lying there  it is well known that men dare not swim down the rapid unless they are acquainted with the run of the water and the formation of the rock  thy men know it well the kings men know it not  with a boat the maidens may descend in safety the men can leap into the river and escape before the enemy could come at them by the hill road  excellently planned exclaimed erling in an eager tone but hermit how dost thou propose to fetch the maidens hither  by going and conducting them  there is much risk no doubt but their case is desperate for their retreat is certain to be discovered  away then said ulf minutes are precious  we will await thee here and at the worst if they should be captured we can but die in attempting their rescue  without uttering another word the hermit rose reentered the underwood sank down on his hands and knees and disappeared with a catlike quietness that had been worthy of one of the red warriors of america    chapter twenty five  in which is described a desperate attempt at rescue a bold leap for freedom and a triumphant escape  the crow cliff to which christian had referred was a high precipitous rock that jutted out into the river just below haldorstede  it was the termination of the high ridge on the face of which erling had posted his men and could be easily reached from the spot where they lay concealed as well as from the stede itself but there was no possibility of passing down the river in that direction by land owing to the precipitous nature of the ground  the ordinary path down the valley which elsewhere followed the curvatures of the river made at this point a wide detour into the woods went in a zigzag form up the steep ascent of the ridge descended similarly on the other side and did not rejoin the river for nearly half a mile below  the waters were so pent up by the crow cliff that they rushed along its base in a furious rapid which a hundred yards down descended in a perpendicular fall of about fifteen feet in depth  the descent of this rapid by a boat was quite possible for there was a little bay at the lower end of crow cliff just above the foss into which it could be steered by a dexterous rower but this mode of descent was attended with the imminent risk of being swept over the fall and dashed to pieces so that none except the daring young spirits of the glen ever attempted it while all the rest were content to cross the ridge by the longer and more laborious but safe path which we have just described  to descend this rapid by swimming was one of the feats which the youths of the place delighted to venture and often had erling and glumm dared it together while not a few of their companions had lost their lives in the attempt  a few words from erling gave the men to understand what was expected of them  it was arranged that while he ulf glumm and the hermit should put the girls into the little boat and guide them down the rapid the men were to leap into the water and swim down  all were to land in the little bay and then make for the cave on the coast in a body and fight their way thither if need be but it was believed there would be no occasion for that because before the plan was carried out most of the kings men would probably be assembled above the crow cliff at the stede  a few who could not swim were sent off at once by the track to warn haldor  all these welllaid plans however were suddenly frustrated for while erling was still consulting with ulf and glumm as to details and peeping through the underwood they beheld a sight which caused their hearts almost to stand still  from the elevated spot where they lay they could see the hermit advancing rapidly towards them in a crouching attitude closely followed by the maidens while at the same time there advanced from the stede a large band of men under a chief who was evidently commissioned to execute some order of the king  erling and his friends could clearly see these two parties unwittingly approaching each other at right angles each making for a point where the two paths crossed and where they were certain to meet  they could see their friends quietly but swiftly gliding towards the very fate they sought to avoid and experienced all the agony of being unable to give a shout of warning or to prevent the foe from capturing them for even if there had been time to rush upon them before the meeting which there was not erling by so doing would have been obliged to place the whole of haralds host between him and the boat at crow cliff  this consideration however would not have deterred him but another idea had flashed upon his mind what that was shall be seen presently  before the two parties met the ears of the hermit albeit somewhat dulled by age became aware of the tramp of armed men and at once he drew the girls hastily aside into the bushes but the bushes at that part happened to be not very thick and part of adas dress which was a gay one with a good deal of scarlet about it caught the attention of a sharpeyed warrior  the man uttered a shout and sprang towards them several others joined in the pursuit a loud scream from one of the girls was heard and next moment the fugitives were captured  up and at them cried glumm endeavouring to rise but he found himself pinned to the earth by erlings powerful arms  stay glumm be quiet i beseech thee entreated erling as his comrade struggled violently but fruitlessly to escape from his powerful embracedo listen ulf ye will spoil all by inconsiderate haste  i have a plan listenthese men are not devils but norsemen and will not hurt the girls they will take them before the king  hear me and they shall yet be rescued  while the power of erlings muscles restrained glumm the deeptoned impassioned earnestness of his voice held back ulf who had leaped up and drawn his sword but it was with evident reluctance that he paused and listened  now hear me cried erling i and glumm will go down and mingle with haralds men  our faces are doubtless not known to any of them besides we are so bespattered with the blood and dust of battle that even friends might fail to recognise us  we will go boldly about among the men and keep near to the girls until a fitting opportunity offers when we will seize them and bear them off  this will not be so difficult as ye may think  difficult cried glumm grinding his teeth i think nothing difficult except sitting still  because continued erling the kings men will be taken by surprise and we shall be through the most of them before they are aware that there is need to draw their blades  but and on this everything will depend thou must be ready ulf with all the men to rush in the twinkling of an eye to our aid the moment my shout is heard for if this be not done we cannot fail to be overpowered by numbers  if thou dost but keep them well in play while we make for the boat and then follow and leap into the river we shall all escape  come along then cried glumm in desperate impatience  does the plan like thee ulf asked erling  not much he replied shaking his head but it is the only chance left so get thee gone  i will not fail thee in the moment of need away  see the girls are already being led before the king  erling and glumm instantly pulled their helmets well down on their brows wrapped their mantles round them so as to conceal their figures as much as possible then entered the wood and disappeared  meanwhile on the open space in front of haldors ruined dwelling king harald haarfager stood surrounded by his court men  he was still bespattered with the blood and dust of battle and furiously angry at the escape of haldor and the burning of the stede  his gilt helmet restrained the exuberance of his shaggy locks and he stood on the top of a slight elevation or mound from the base of which his men extended in a dense ring in front of him eager to ascertain who it was that had been so unexpectedly captured  erling and glumm mingled with the crowd unnoticed for so many of the men assembled there had been collected from various districts that to each strange faces were the rule instead of the exception  when the girls were led into the ring there was a murmur of admiration and many complimentary remarks were made about them  the old hermit was dragged in after them and excited a little attention for a few moments he had experienced rough handling from his captors  his grey hair was dishevelled and his face bloodstained for although he had offered no resistance some of the men who seized him were so much out of humour in consequence of the burning of the stede and the escape of its inmates that they were glad to vent their anger on anyone  goodlooking girls both of them remarked the king to jarl rongvold as they were being led forwardwho are ye he added addressing them  ada looked round on the circle of men with a frightened glance and cast down her eyes but did not reply while hilda raised her eyes timidly to the kings face but lacked courage to speak  come said the king sternly let us have no false modesty  ye are before norways king therefore speak and to the point  who art thou  he addressed himself to hilda who replied  i am hilda daughter of ulf of romsdal  and thou he added turning to her companion  my name is ada  my father is hakon of drontheim  ha exclaimed the king with a bitter smile  is it so  thy father has met his desert then for he now lies at the bottom of the fiord  ada turned deadly pale but made no reply  know ye where haldor the fierce is and his insolent son erling asked the king  hilda flushed at this and answered with some spirit that she did not know and that if she did she would not tell  of course not said the king i might have guessed as much and do but waste my time with yestand asidebring forward yonder fellow  the hermit was immediately led forward  who art thou asked the king  an old wanderer on the face of the earth replied christian  that is easily seen answered the king but not too old it would seem to do a little mischief when the chance falls in thy way  methinks sire whispered jarl rongvold that this fellow is one of those strange madmen who have taken up with that new religion which i do not profess to understand  sayest thou so exclaimed harald then will i test himho fetch me a piece of horse flesh  a piece of horse flesh was brought without delay for some that had been sacrificed in the drontheim temple had been packed up and carried off among other provisions when the expedition set forth  here old man eat thou a portion of that said harald holding the flesh towards him  i may not eat what has been sacrificed to idols said the hermit  ho ho then thou art not a worshipper of odin  say dog what art thou  i am a follower of the lord jesus christ  he is my saviour  to him i live and for him i can die  can he save you from me demanded harald  he can answered the hermit earnestly and will save you too king harald from your sins and all who now hear me if they will but turn to him  now will i test him said the king  stand forth hake of hadeland and hew me the old mans head from his body  spare him  o spare him cried hilda throwing herself suddenly between hake and his victim who stood with the resigned air of a man who had made up his mind to die  he has twice saved my life and has never done you evil in thought or deed  stand aside my pretty maid  nay then if thou wilt not i must grant thy request but it is upon one condition that this saviour shall either come himself or send a champion to deliver the old mancome he added turning fiercely to the hermit pray that thy god shall send thee a champion now for if he does not as i live thou shalt die  i may not pray at thy bidding said the hermit calmly besides it needs not that i should because i have already prayedbefore dawn this morningthat he would grant me his blessing in the form that seemed best to himself  and hast thou got it  i havein that i possess a quiet spirit and do not fear to die now that his time has come  tis something this i admit returned the king yet methinks tis but a poor blessing after all with death as the end of it  death is not the end of it said the hermit with a kindling eye for after death is everlasting joy and glory with the lord  besides king harald which were better think you to die with a willing spirit and bright hope or to live full of restless ambition disappointment and rage even although victorious and king of norway  the kings countenance grew livid with anger as he turned to the berserk and said in a voice of suppressed passiongo forward hake and slay him  nowthe time has come whispered erling to glumm  get as near to ada as thou canst for the rest may christians god be with us  as he spoke he sprang into the circle sword in hand and stood suddenly between the astonished hake and the hermit  there was a loud murmur of amazement at this unexpected apparition and not a few of the spectators were awestricken supposing that this was actually a champion sent from the spirit world  harald cried erling for the berserk had shrunk back dismayed i do now accept the challenge and come here to champion the old man  at the sound of his voice the kings face lighted up with intelligence  ha he exclaimed suddenly has the old mans god sent erling the bold  truly i think he has replied erling at all events it was not for this purpose that i came hither today  but now that i have come and of mine own free will put myself in thy power i claim the right to do battle for my old friend with thy stoutest manso set him forth king harald  what sayest thou hake said the king turning to his berserk with a smile art willing to join issue with the bold onebold enough truly and insolent as well  hake who had recovered his selfpossession the instant he recognised erlings voice and who was by no means wanting in courage suddenly uttered one of his terrible roars and rushed upon erling like a thunderbolt  our hero was too well accustomed to the ways of his class to be caught off his guard  although hake rained blows upon him so fast that it was almost impossible for the spectators to follow the motions of his flashing sword erling received them all on his shield or parried them with his short swordwhich as being more manageable in a melee he had selected for his present enterprise  the instant however that the berserks furious onset began to slacken erling fetched him such a tremendous cut on the sword that the weapon was broken close off at the hilt  disdaining to slay an unarmed foe he leaped upon the berserk and struck him a blow with the hilt of his sword which drove the casque down upon his head and stretched him flat upon the sward  without waiting an instant erling flung down his shield and walked to the place where hilda stood took her by the hand and whispered courage come with me and thou shalt be saved  at the same moment glumm stepped to adas side and took her right hand in his left  no sword was drawn for glumm had not drawn his and no one present had the faintest idea of what the young men intended to attempt  indeed they were all so amazed at the sudden termination of the fight that the men of the inner part of the ring actually stood aside to let them pass before the king had time to shout  seize them  in other circumstances at haralds word a thousand swords would have been drawn and the doom of erling and his friends at once been sealed but the natural ferocity of the tyrants followers had been spellbound and for the time paralysed by the calm bearing of old christian and the prowess of his champion whose opportune appearance had all the effect of a supernatural interposition as it might well be deemed and it will be readily believed that our hero and glumm did not fail to use the advantage thus offered  leading those whom they had come to rescue and closely followed by the hermit they passed completely through the circle of men  but at the repetition in a voice of thunder of the royal mandate some hundreds of the kings men surrounded them and notwithstanding their wondrous strength and skill they were being gradually overpowered by numbers when suddenly a tremendous shout was heard and next moment ulf with his fifty men in battle array rushed out of the forest  king harald endeavoured hastily to draw up his men in something like order  hearing the cry in rear the men in front of erling and glumm fell aside so that they quickly cut down those who still stood in their way and ran towards their friends who opened their ranks to let them passthen reclosed and fell upon the kings men with incredible fury although outnumbered by at least twenty to one the disparity did not at first tell against them owing to the confusion in the enemys ranks and the confined space of ground on which they fought  they were thus enabled to act with great vigour and being animated by the spirit of desperate men they actually for some time kept driving back the kings forces  but the continual assault of fresh foes began to tell and several of ulfs men had already fallen when erlings voice was heard ringing high above the din of battle  instantly every man turned on his heel and fled towards the river madly pursued by the whole of the kings host  by this time erling and glumm had got the girls into the boat and steered them safely down the rapid into the little bay where they waited for their companions as patiently as they could  meanwhile ulfs men reached the foot of the crow cliff and one by one sprang into the boiling rapid  ulf was among the first there but he stayed to see them all pass  before the last could do so their enemies were upon them but ulf kept them at bay for a few moments and when the last of his men took the water he retreated fighting and leaped backwards into the flood  one or two of the kings men followed but they failed to catch him were carried down stream and being ignorant of the dangers of the place were swept over the foss and killed  most of the host however turned suddenly and set off at full speed to cross the ridge and pursue their enemies by the path to which we have already referred  before they had crossed it erling and his men were far on their way down the valley and when the pursuers reached the coast there was no sign of the fugitives anywhere  on reaching the cave erling found that his father had got everything in readiness to start so assembling the people together without delay he divided them into two bands one of which he sent into the swan the other into glumms vessel the crane  haldor also went in the swan along with ulf of romsdal thorer the thick kettle flatnose alric and the hermit besides dames herfrida and astrid and the widow gunhild ingeborg and all haldors younger children  with glumm there were also several women besides ada  ivor the old and finn the oneeyed also went with him but most of the old and crippled hangerson of both families as well as glumms mother were taken by erling into the swan as the accommodation there was better than on board the crane  now glumm said erling when all were on board we must say farewell to norway  keep close in my wake  if they give chase we will do our best to escape but if that may not be we will fight and fall together  the friends shook hands then each getting into his ship the stern ropes were cast off the oars were dipped and they shot out upon the blue fiord which the sinking sun had left in a solemn subdued light although his beams still glowed brightly on the snowclad mountain peaks  they had proceeded some distance down the fiord before their pursuers observed them  then a mighty shout told that they were discovered and the grinding of the heavy ships keels was distinctly heard upon the shore as they were pushed off into deep water  immediately after the splash of hundreds of oars warned them to make haste  pull my ladspull with heart cried erling and let these slaves see how freemen can make their ocean steeds leap across the sea  pull i see a breeze just off the mouth of the fiord  if we reach that we may laugh at the tyrant king  what may yonder line on the water be said haldor with an anxious look as he pointed towards the mouth of the fiord  erling caught his breath and the blood rushed to his temples as he gazed for a moment in silence  tis a boom cried kettle who had recovered by this time and who now leaped towards the fore deck with terrible energy  all is lost exclaimed ulf in a tone of bitterness which words cannot express  are ye sure it is a boom cried erling quickly  everyone looked with intense earnestness at the black line that stretched completely across the mouth of the fiord and each gave it as his opinion that it was a boom  there could not indeed be any doubt on the point  king haralds berserk although somewhat tardy had fulfilled his orders but too well and now a succession of huge logs or tree trunks joined together by thick iron chains completely barred their progress seaward  surely we can burst through suggested kettle returning to the poop his huge frame quivering with contending emotions  impossible said haldor i have tried it before and failed  of course we must make the attempt but i have no hope except in this he added touching his sword and not much in that either now  but i have tried it before and did not fail and ill try it again cried erling heartily  come aft men quick all of ye every man except the rowers  women children and cripples get ye into the waist  the stoutest men to the oarsjump  these orders were obeyed at once  all the best men in the ship seized the oars erling himself kettle and haldor setting the example while thorer took the helm and hailing glumm bade him do as they did  the effect of this was that the stern of the swan was so weighed down with the weight of people on the poop that her bows and a third of her keel were raised high out of the water while the men straining with every fibre of their muscles at the oars sent her careering forward with trebled speed and the foam rolled in milky billows in her wake  when i give the word forward cried erling leap like lightning all of ye to the fore deck  the pursuers elated by this time with the certainty of success pulled also with unwonted energy  when the swan came within about twenty yards of the boom which floated almost on a level with the water thorer gave the word  one stroke for freedom  ho ho shouted erling and haldor straining until their oars cracked again  the foam hissed from the blades and the swan rushed as if she had been suddenly endued with true vitality  next moment she stuck fastwith the boom amidships beneath her  forward shouted erling  all the unengaged men sprang instantly to the forecastle and their weight sank it slowly down but it seemed inclined for a moment to remain balanced on the boom  hereupon the men at the oars jumped up and also ran forward  the bow dipped at once the good ship slid over with a plunge and glided out upon the sea  a great shout or yell told that this had been noticed by their foes who still rowed madly after them but heedless of this erling backed water and waited for glumm who had made similar preparations and was now close on the boom  his vessel went fairly on and stuck halfway as the other had done but when she was balanced and about to turn over there was a terrible rending sound in the hull then a crash and the crane broke in two throwing half of her crew into the sea on the inner side of the boom and the other half outside  well was it for them all then that the swan had waited  she was at once backed towards the scene of disaster and as many as possible were picked up  among the rescued was glumm with ada in his arms  but many were drowned and a few stuck to the boom refusing to let go or to make any attempt to reach the swan  erling knew however that these were sure to be picked up by the kings ships so he once more ordered the rowers to give way and the vessel sprang forth on her voyage some time before the pursuers reached the boom  when these did so most of them attempted to leap it as the fugitives had donefor none of the norsemen there lacked spirit  some however failed to get on to it at all others got on a short way and stuck fast while two or three ships broke their backs as glumms had done and threw their crews into the waterbut not one got over  the men then leaped on the boom and the sound of axes was heard as they laboured to cut it through or to dash away its iron fastenings  it was however a thoroughly wellexecuted piece of work and for a long time resisted their utmost efforts  when at length it did give way and the kings ships passed through the swan was beyond pursuitfar away on the horizon with all sail set and running before a stiff breeze while the shades of evening were closing in around her  that night there was silence in the norsemens little ship as she ploughed her adventurous course over the northern sea for the thoughts of all were very sad at being thus rudely driven from their native land to seek a home where best they might in the wide world  yet in the hearts of some of them there was also much happiness  hildas sanguine mind pictured many sweet and peaceful abodes far from the haunts of warlike men  alric was happy because he was beginning as he fondly hoped a life of wild adventure  so was kettle flatnose for he was now sailing westward and he knew that ireland was somewhere in that direction  but glumm the gruff was perhaps the happiest of all on board for besides the delight of having at last got possession of his bride he enjoyed for the first time in his life the pleasure of comforting a woman in distress  adas wild spirit waswe dare not say eradicated butthoroughly subdued at last  when she thought of her father she laid her head on glumms broad chest and wept bitterly  thus did those seakings sail away from and forsake the land of norway on their voyage westward they fell in with many ships from other quarters containing countrymen seakings and vikings like themselves who had also left their native land to seek new homes in shetland orkney and the other isles north of scotland rather than submit to the yoke of harald haarfager  they joined company with these and all sailed westward together  among them was a man named frode who was celebrated for daring and wisdom especially for his knowledge of the stars and his power of navigating the unknown ocean of the west  to this man was assigned the direction of the fleet and all submitted to his guidance but the seakings invariably assembled together in council when it was intended to decide what they should do or to what part of the world they should steer  my advice is said kettle flatnose the first time they assembled thus in council that we steer first to ireland where i can promise ye all a hearty welcome for it is well known that the irish are a hospitable people and my father is a great man there  i fall in with that said glumm glancing at ada whose eyes had now become his guiding stars  the advice is good said erling for wherever we may finally come to an anchor we will be none the worse of getting some provisions on the way  as haldor ulf frode and all the rest were of one mind on this point the ships were steered to ireland and when they reached that country they put ashore in a small bay not far from dublin where was a log hut to this kettle went up with erling and glumm and asked the man of the house how things were going on in ireland  as ill as can be in this district said the man there is nothing but vengeance in the hearts of the people  that is a bad state said kettle with a look of anxiety what may be the cause of discontent  is the old king hard on ye  thou must have been long away to ask that  the old king is dead said the man  at this kettle uttered a great and bitter cry but restraining himself asked eagerly if the old queen were alive  the man replied that she was  then kettle asked how the king met his death  with a dark frown the man replied that haabrok the black had murdered him and seized the throne  on hearing this kettle became pale but was very calm and listened attentively while the man went on to say that haabrok was such a tyrant that the whole district was ready to start up as one man and dethrone him if they had only someone who was fit to lead them  that they shall not long want for said kettle  after some more earnest conversation he turned away and went down to the shore  now erling and glumm said he we must do a little fighting before i can offer ye the hospitality i spoke of  will ye aid me in a venture i have in my mind  that will we they replied heartily  kettle thereupon explained his views and said that he had learned from the man that his wife was still alive and well but in the hands of the king of the district who was a regicide and a tyrant  it was then arranged that the swan should be rowed quietly up towards the town and the men landed in the night at a spot where they could be ready to answer the summons of kettle erling glumm and ulf who were to go up unattended to the kings house in dublin with no other arms than their short swords  on drawing near these four found the hall of the kings house brilliantly lighted for great festivities were going on there  no one interfered with them because none guessed that so small a party would dare to go up halfarmed for any other than peaceful purposes  they therefore went through the streets unmolested and easily passed the guards because kettle plied them with a good deal of that which has since come to be known by the name of blarney  when they got into the hall kettle went straight up to the high seat or throne on which haabrok the black was seated  ye are presumptuous knaves said the tyrant eyeing the strangers sternly is it thus that ye have been taught to approach the king what is your errand  for the matter of that thou wellnamed villain said kettle our errand will but add to our presumption for we have come to slay thee  with that kettle whipped out his sword and cut off haabroks head so that it went rolling over the floor while the body fell back and spouted blood all over the horrified court men  instantly every man drew his sword but erling ulf and glumm leaped on the low platform of the throne and presented such a bold front that the bravest men there hesitated to attack them  at the same moment kettle raised his sword and shouted if there be yet a true man in this hall who loves his country and reveres the memory of the good old king whom this dead dog slew let him come hither  it is the voice of the kings son that calls  sure tis kettle id know his red head anywhere exclaimed a shrivelled old woman near the throne  aye nurse it is kettle himselfcome back again he said glancing towards the old woman with a kindly smile  a ringing cheer burst from the crowd and filled the hall again and again it rose as nearly all the men present rushed round the throne and waved their swords frantically over their heads or strove to shake hands with the son of their old king  in the midst of the tumult a wild shriek was heard and the crowd opening up allowed a beautiful darkeyed woman to rush towards kettle with a stalwart boy of about five years of age clinging to her skirts  we need scarcely pause to say who these were nor who the handsome matron was who afterwards went and clung round kettles neck and heaped fervent blessings on the head of her longlost son  it is sufficient to say that the feast of that night was not interrupted that on the contrary it was prolonged into the morning and extended into every loyal home in the city and that kettle flatnose entertained his norse friends right royally for several days after which he sent them away laden with gifts and benedictions  they did not quit ireland however until they had seen him happily and securely seated on the throne of dublin    sailing northward the fleet touched at the orkney and shetland islands where they found that a number of the expatriated seakings had comfortably settled themselves  here some of haldors people would fain have remained but frode who was a man of enterprise resolved to penetrate farther into the great unknown sea to lands which rumour said did certainly exist there  accordingly they left shetland and went on until they came to the faroe islands  here they thought of settling but on landing they found that a few of the seakings had taken up their abode there before them  now said frode it is my great desire to break new ground  shall we go and search farther to the west for that new island which has been lately discovered by ingoll  to this haldor and ulf said they were agreed  hilda plucked erling by the sleeve and whispered in his ear after which he said that he too was agreed  glumm glanced at ada who with a little blush and smile nodded  a nod was as good as a word to glumm so he also said he was agreed and as no one else made objection the ships prows were again turned towards the setting sun  northwestward they sailed over the world of waters until they came one fine morning in sight of land  as they drew near they saw that it was very beautiful consisting partly of snowcapped mountains with green fertile valleys here and there and streams flowing through them  they ran the vessels into a bay and landed and the country looked so peaceful and withal so desirable that it was at once resolved they should make this place their abode  accordingly while most of the men set themselves to work to land the goods put up the tents and make the women and children comfortable a select band well armed prepared to go on an expedition into the country to ascertain whether or not it was inhabited  before these set out however christian the hermit stood up on a rising ground and raising his eyes and hands to heaven prayed for gods blessing on their enterprise  thereafter plots of land were marked out houses were built things were held a regular government was established and the islandfor such it proved to bewas regularly taken possession of  the exploring party found that this was indeed the island which they were in search of  it had been discovered about the middle of the ninth century and a settlement had been made on it by ingoll in the year 874 but the band of immigrants under frode and haldor was by far the most important that had landed on it up to that time  in this manner and under these circumstances was iceland colonised by expatriated norsemen about the beginning of the tenth century    good reader our tale is told  gladly would we follow step by step the subsequent career of erling and glumm for the lives of such men from first to last are always fraught with interest and instruction but this may not be  we have brought them with the other chief actors in this little tale to a happy point in their adventurous career and there we feel that we ought to leave them in peace  yet we would fain touch on one or two prominent points in their subsequent history before bidding them a final farewell  let it be recorded then that many years after the date of the closing scene of our tale there might have been seen in iceland at the head of a small bay two pretty cottages from the doors of which there was a magnificent view of as sweet a valley as ever filled the eye or gladdened the heart of man with a distant glimpse of the great ocean beyond  on the sward before these cottages was assembled a large party of young men and maidens the latter of whom were conspicuous for the sparkle of their blue eyes and the silky gloss of their fair hair while the former were notable because of the great size and handsome proportions of their figures some however of the men and maidens were dark and ruddy  the youths were engaged in putting the stone and throwing the hammer the maidens looked on with interestas maidens were wont to do on manly pastimes in days of old and as they are not unwilling to do occasionally even in modern times  around these romped a host of children of all ages sizes and shades  these were the descendants of erling the bold and glumm the gruff  the two families had as it were fused into one grand compound which was quite natural for their natures were diverse yet sympathetic besides glumm was dark erling fair and it is well known that black and white always go hand in hand producing that sweettoned grey which nature would seem to cherish with a love quite as powerful as the abhorrence with which she is supposed to regard a vacuum  beside each other leaning against a tree and admiring the prowess of the young men stood erling and glumm old it is true and past the time when men delight to exercise their muscles but straight and stalwart and still noble specimens of manhood  the most interesting group however was to be seen seated on a rustic bench near the door there sometimes conversing gravely with a silverhaired old man at his side or stooping with a quiet smile to caress the head of a child that had rushed from its playmates for a little to be fondled by the old onesat haldor the fierce with christian the hermit on one side and ulf of romsdal on the other  their heads were pure white and their frames somewhat bent but health still mantled on the sunburnt cheeks and sparkled in the eyes of the old norse seakings  within the house might have been seen two exceedingly handsome matrons such as one may see in norway at the present timewho called each other hilda and ada and who vied with a younger hilda and ada in their attentions upon two frail but cheery old women whom they called granny heff and granny ast  how very unlikeand yet how likewere these to the herfrida and astrid of former days  between the old dames there sat on a low stool a man of gigantic proportions who had scarcely reached middle age and who was still overflowing with the fun and fire of youth  he employed himself in alternately fondling and chaffing the two old women and he was such an exact counterpart of what erling the bold was at the age of thirty that his own mother was constantly getting confused and had to be reminded that he was alric and not erling  alrics wife a daughter of glumm was with the young people on the lawn and his six riotous children were among the chief tormentors of old haldor  ingeborg was there too sharp as ever but not quite so sour  she was not a spinster  there were few spinsters in those days  she had married a man of the neighbouring valley whom she loved to distraction and whom she led the life of a dog  but it was her nature to be crossgrained  she could not help it and the poor man appeared to grow fonder of her the more she worried him  as for ivor the old and finn the oneeyed they with most of their contemporaries had long been gathered to their fathers and their bones reposed on the grassy slopes of laxriverdale  as for the other personages of our tale we have only space to remark that king harald haarfager succeeded in his wish to obtain the undivided sovereignty of norway but he failed to perpetuate the change for the kingdom was after his death redivided amongst his sons  the last heard of hake the berserk was that he had been seen in the midst of a great battle to have both his legs cut off at one sweep and that he died fighting on his stumps  jarl rongvold was burnt by king haralds sons but his stout son rolf ganger left his native land and conquered normandy whence his celebrated descendant william the conqueror came across the channel and conquered england  yes there is perhaps more of norse blood in your veins than you wot of reader whether you be english or scotch for those sturdy sea rovers invaded our lands from north south east and west many a time in days gone by and held it in possession for centuries at a time leaving a lasting and beneficial impress on our customs and characters  we have good reason to regard their memory with respect and gratitude despite their faults and sins for much of what is good and true in our laws and social customs much manly and vigorous in the british constitution of our intense love of freedom and fairplay are pith pluck enterprise and sense of justice that dwelt in the breasts of the rugged old seakings of norway
