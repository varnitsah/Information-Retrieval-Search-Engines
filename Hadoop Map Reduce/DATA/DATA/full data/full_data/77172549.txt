the third volume in a line issued under the general title of soldiers of fortune series  the story relates primarily the adventures of larry russell and his oldtime sea chum luke striker already well known to the readers of my old glory series larry and luke are aboard of their old ship the columbia bound from manila to nagasaki with a cargo designed for the japanese government this is during the war between russia and japan and when close to the japanese coast the schooner is sighted by a russian warship and made a prize of war  as prisoners both larry and luke see something of life in the russian navy when close to vladivostok the russian warship falls in with several ships of the japanese fleet and after a thrilling seafight surrenders with her prize this brings larry and luke before admiral togo and as larrys brother ben with their mutual friend gilbert pennington is already in the japanese army larry enters the japanese navy and luke follows suit the siege and bombardment of port arthur are at their height and the particulars are given of many battles both on the sea and on land leading up to the ultimate surrender of that brave russian commander general stoessel and the fall of the city by this surrender the japanese obtained many thousands of prisoners of war hundreds of cannon with large quantities of ammunition and several scores of vessels useful for either fighting purposes or as transports moreover this victory placed the entire southern portion of manchuria under japanese control giving the army untrammeled use of the railroad running from port arthur to liaoyang a city on the road to mukden captured some time before as already related in another volume of this series entitled under the mikados flag  as i have mentioned in a previous work it is as yet impossible to state what the outcome of this terrific conflict will be so far victory has perched largely upon the standard of japan the russian navy has been practically shattered and its army fought to a standstill the cost of the war has been tremendous to both countries countless thousands of lives have already been sacrificed would that peace were soon at hand  again i thank my young friends for their appreciation of my former stories may the present tale fulfill every reasonable expectation            edward stratemeyer     contents       chapter

was thinking larry and when it comes i allow as how it will be putty heavy replied luke striker casting an eye to the westward where a small dark cloud was beginning to show above the horizon  well we cant expect fine weather all the time went on larry russell inspecting the cloud with equal interest we want some wind anyway he added we are not making this return trip to nagasaki nearly as fast as we made the trip to manila  luke striker a bronzed and weatherbeaten yankee sailor rubbed his chin reflectively i was jest thinking o the day i spied the old columbia in manila harbor he said meditatively tell ye larry the sight most struck me dumb the columbia sez i to myself an then i thought i must be adreamin i wanted to find this ship agin in the worst way  the ship certainly seems like a home to me lukeand i reckon she always will seem that way ive traveled a good many miles in her since i first struck her at honolulu in the hawaiian islands responded larry russell  yesboth of us have but we never took no trip like this aforecarryin a cargo for the japanese government with that government at war with russia luke striker lowered his voice whats the outlook does the old man reckon to fall in with a russian warship afore we can reach nagasaki  hush luke you mustnt mention our cargo came from larry russell hastily  i aint mentionin it to anybody but you  captain ponsberry is in hopes that we shall not meet any russian warships  but what if we do  then we shall have to show our heels as best we can  a sailing vessel cant show much o a pair o heels to a manowar  that is true  i suppose if the columbia was overhauled by a russian warship theyd consider us a prize of war wouldnt they continued the old yankee sailor  they would unless captain ponsberry could get out of it in some way  how do you think he might get out of it  well you must remember that our cargo doesnt belong to the japanese government yet we are carrying it from manila to nagasaki for the richmond importing company the russians would have to prove their case against us before they could claim the schooner as a legitimate prize of war  i see well i reckon as how them russians would do most anything to square accounts with the japs so far accordin to my notions they have been losin ground right along in this war  yes and theyll lose more before the japs are through with em luke but that storm is coming up fast went on larry russell with another examination of the black cloud ill have to tell the captain if we dont shorten sail it may do us some damage  with the lastmentioned remark larry russell walked aft toward the companionway of the columbia a staunch threemasted schooner that hailed from gloucester he was second mate of the craft and as such it was now his duty to inform captain nat ponsberry that a storm was approaching  to those of my young friends who have read under dewey at manila and other volumes of the old glory series larry russell needs no introduction he was one of three brothers who left in the charge of a miserly stepuncle had thought it best to go away from home and seek fortune in various parts of the globe larry had drifted to san francisco and then to honolulu where he had fallen in with captain nat ponsberry and the columbia as already mentioned he with his sailor friend luke striker had been cast away and while adrift on the pacific had been picked up by the asiatic squadron under commodore afterward admiral dewey to serve with honor during the memorable battle of manila bay  since those days a great many things had occurred to the russell boys ben the oldest of the three had served as a young volunteer in cuba during the advance on santiago and as an officer with the army in the philippines and walter the third brother had served in the navy in cuban waters and elsewhere in the meantime the miserly stepuncle had reformed and now thought his three boys as he called them the best young fellers in all america barrin none  larry russell was a natural sailor and when his term in the navy came to an end he could not bear to think of giving up the sea he heard that his old ship was bound for a trip to japan and other ports and at once communicated with captain ponsberry with the result that he became second mate of the schooner the first mate being as of old tom grandon a personal friend of captain ponsberry  at this time walter russell had gone into business and was doing remarkably well but ben was doing nothing and larry persuaded his oldest brother to come aboard the ship at manila for the trip to nagasaki and port arthur this was just at the outbreak of the war between russia and japan but the brothers at that time knew nothing about the tremendous conflict so close at hand  the columbia was carrying a cargo for the richmond importing company represented in japan and china by gilbert pennington who had served with ben russell in our army in cuba and the philippines from manila gilbert had gone to china to fight the boxers as already described in on to pekin the first volume of this soldiers of fortune series with the end of the boxer conflict lieutenant pennington as he had then become turned from war to business and soon made a number of business transactions which were highly gratifying to the company that he represented  when the columbia arrived at nagasaki captain ponsberry learned that the war had begun and that to get to port arthura russian stronghold in manchuriawas out of the question while he was awaiting orders gilbert pennington appeared on the scene gilbert had had great difficulties in getting away from port arthur having been suspected by the russian officials of being a spy he wished to know at once if the ships cargo was safe  as safe as when we left home had been captain ponsberrys reply  good answered the young agent and then he wished to know if anything had been done about selling the goods captain ponsberry replied that he had been ordered to do nothing until he received word from gilbert this suited the young representative and the upshot of the matter was that the cargo instead of going to a russian port was sold to the japanese government at a price considerably above the ordinary market value  gilbert pennington was enthusiastic about joining the japanese army for a campaign in manchuria and he imparted a large share of this enthusiasm to ben russell as a result both enlisted and became captains in a special command under a major okopa who could speak very good english the part of the army to which they were assigned landed at chinampo in korea and in the second volume of this series called under the mikados flag i related the particulars of the crossing of the yalu river and of the many skirmishes and battles leading up to the terrific tendays contest before liao yang during these fights ben and gilbert did their full duty as officers and when the russians retreated to the north both were well content to take a muchneeded rest but additional struggles were still in store for them as will be learned in the pages which follow  at first larry russell had been inclined to follow his brother and his friend gilbert into the japanese army but captain ponsberry did not wish to lose his services as a second mate and when it was decided that the columbia should make a quick run to manila and back for another cargo for the japanese government he made up his mind to stick to the ship  the run to manila from nagasaki was made without special incident and once at the main seaport of the philippines captain ponsberry lost no time in getting on board the cargo the richmond importing company had ready for him the cargo was a valuable one and it was calculated that if rightly sold it would yield the company a profit of five or six thousand dollars  you have got to take care and not run into any russian warship said the agent of the company at manila if you do you may have a whole lot of trouble in explaining matters to the russian commanders satisfaction i see by the reports that the russians have already held up several english and south american ships  i shall keep a sharp lookout for em was captain ponsberrys reply  and another thing captain went on the agent in a lower tone you want to watch your crew  what do you mean  i dont like the looks of two or three of them for all you know they may be more than willing to expose youif you fall in with the russians can you trust your first and second mates  i can they are as honest as myself  then caution them to keep an eye on the hands one of those fellows looks like a russian to methe chap with the heavy black beard  you mean semmel he says he is a pole and that he hates the russians  humph well i saw him talking to a lot of russians night before last and when they passed a jap the whole crowd jeered at the little brown man  semmel too  yes  then i shall watch him answered captain ponsberry decidedly  do but dont let him know it some of these foreign sailors are ugly when they find out they are being suspected  trust me to manage him returned the commander of the columbia and there the talk on the subject came to an end     chapter ii  a storm on the pacific   larry found captain ponsberry working over a chart on the cabin table laying out the course of the ship the commander of the columbia was a bluff hearty individual and he and the young second mate thought a great deal of each other  well what is it asked the captain looking up quickly  i came to report that a storm is coming up from the west answered larry  humph i was afraid wed catch it sooner or later is it close up yet  its coming up pretty fast  captain ponsberry said no more but threw down his parallel rulers and his pencil catching up his cap he mounted to the deck and the young second mate followed at his heels the captain gave a long look to the westward and then a gaze around the remainder of the horizon  tell cal vincent to call all hands to shorten sail he called out to larry tell em to tumble up quick toothet storm aint none too far off for comfort  larry passed the word to cal vincent who was the boatswain of the columbia and soon the whistle piped up shrilly and those who were below or in the forecastle came on deck in a hurry already the wind was freshening ruffling up the whitecaps in all directions the sky that had been so blue a short while before became leaden and the depths of the ocean took on a somber hue the barometer indicated a great and immediate change  lay aloft there men cried captain ponsberry our sails are mostly new and we dont want them ripped up if we can help it skip along there peterson the latter words to a big sailor who was moving across the deck at a snails pace  the sailor addressed scowled it was not his watch on deck and he hated to have his midday nap disturbed  got a nail in ma boot he said  well haul it outafter the sails are trimmed returned the captain and then turned to another hand semmel whats the matter with you this to the suspiciouslooking sailor with the heavy black beard  nodding grumbled semmel and turned away sulkily  then get a move on or we may lose a stick as well as a sail and there followed a perfect volley of orders in a tone that none of the sailors misunderstood up to the yards they crawled like so many monkeys and soon the creaking of halyard blocks was heard as the topsails came down the jib and flying jib were also taken in and a little later the maincourse and the mizzencourse  reckon we can stand the forecourse for a little while longer said captain ponsberry to tom grandon what do you think  we can unless it comes quicker nor it is coming now returned the first mate  well keep an eye on the wind and reef her as soon as it begins to look nasty said captain ponsberry and returned to the cabin to finish his nautical calculations  the columbia had left the last of the philippines behind and was headed north through the china sea toward the lower extremity of formosa she was not as new a ship as when larry had first boarded her at honolulu for since that time she had seen half a dozen years of hard service but captain ponsberry was a careful man and believed in making repairs as soon as they were needed so there was small danger of her opening her seams or going to pieces even in the stiffest of blows she leaked a littlethe best of ships do thatbut a short pumping every morning kept the water at the bottom of the well  as second mate it was larrys duty to see that everything on the deck was shipshape and this was especially necessary when a storm was coming up he made a tour of the ship his keen eyes taking in every detail  as it happened an hour before he had set the sailor semmel to work stowing away some odds and ends of rope he had supposed that this task was long since finished but now he found the ropes scattered about as before  see here semmel he called out why didnt you stow away those ropes as i told you  stow dem avay in a leetle vile answered the sailor with the heavy beard  youll stow them away now returned larry sharply he did not at all fancy the manner of the hand he was addressing i told you to do it an hour ago we dont want anything loose on deck when this storm hits us  vincent kicked de ropes out dare growled semmel i had nodding to do mit em  that isnt here or there i told you to stow them away and i want you to do it if you dont ill have to report you to the captain  oh i do him grumbled semmel but he glared at larry as if he wished to chew the young second mate up you put all dare vork on me hey he added after a pause  youve got to do your share of it  humph semmel seemed on the point of saying more but shut his teeth and began to arrange the ropes in proper order larry watched him for a moment and then walked away as soon as his back was turned the sailor shook his fist at the young second mate  you vait he muttered chust vait you jankee rat  the sky kept growing darker and soon came a puff of wind much heavier than any that had gone before the columbia had been moving over the waves on an even keel but now she gave a sudden lurch to starboard  reckon its time to take them reefs in the forecourse said grandon to larry and soon the sailors were at work on the sheets leaving just sufficient canvas up to make the schooner mind her helm it was hard work for the sudden gusts made the sail snap and crack like a whip  so far it had not rained a drop but now came a sudden downpour the drops as big as hens eggs to use luke strikers manner of describing them then came a flash of lightning out of the western sky followed by a rumble of thunder  this is going to be an oldtime storm was larrys comment as he met luke striker near the forecastle ill have to get my oilskin out  luke already had his raincoat on and soon the young mate was similarly provided wind and rain were increasing and presently there came a flash of lightning and a clap of thunder that made everybody jump the thunder brought captain ponsberry to the deck in a hurry  did that hit us he questioned looking around anxiously  no sir but it was pretty close replied grandon  is everything secure went on the commander to larry  yes sir  it was difficult to converse further for the wind was now whistling through the rigging driving the rain in sheets across the deck all had to hold fast for fear of being swept overboard on every side the sea was lashing itself into a foam and the waves were growing higher and higher at one instant the columbia would seem to be riding on top of a mountain the next she would sink down and down into the trough of the sea  well larry how do you like this questioned captain ponsberry as he took a position beside the second mate  oh i dont mind it at all was the cheery answer i used to mind the storms but ive got used to them  this isnt a plaything we are getting  oh i know thatyou can see it by the way the wind is driving us but we are not near any land are we  no  then well be sure to outride it i feel i can bank on the old columbia for almost anything  at this captain ponsberry laid an affectionate hand on his second mates shoulder  reckon you love the old craft about as well as i do he said  i dont know about thatyouve been on board so many more years than myself but to me she is a second home  i see well let us hope we get through with this trip in safety  dont you imagine well do it questioned larry quickly  certainly but you must remember that we may have trouble if we fall in with any russian warship captain ponsberry lowered his voice did you have trouble with semmel  a little i ordered him to coil up some ropes and he didnt obey me right away but he stowed them away afterwards  captain ponsberry drew a long breath the more i see of that chap the less i like him  i never liked him from the start answered larry frankly but youll have to give him credit for being a good allround sailor  there is no doubt but what he is that larry but he has a bad eye  what do you think he could do to harm us  nothingunless we fell in with a russian warship in that case if he was a russian sympathizer he might expose the fact that while we are carrying a cargo for the richmond importing company the goods are really meant for the japanese government  does he know that  im not sure one way or the other what i am afraid of is that he may know a good bit more nor we suspect  i see the young second mate mused for a moment ill tell you what id do if i thought he was going to play me fouland we fell in with a russian warship id clap him below decks out of sight until the warship went on her way again  thats easily said but i cant make him a prisoner unless i can prove something against him  you can lock him up if he is sulky and wont obey orders  yes that is true stillphew  the captain broke off short for a vivid streak of lightning flared all over the upper masts of the ship the thunderclap was as sharp as it was deafening and for the moment all on board thought the columbia had surely been struck then came a downpour which made even the boldest of the sailors seek shelter  that was closer than i like was larrys comment after it was ascertained that the ship was unharmed  most knocked me overboard came from luke striker gosh reckon my hairs singed and he put up his hand and ran his fingers through his grayish locks dont want another like thet nohow  a few minutes later came another flash of lightning but this was to the eastward showing that the center of the storm had passed them the wind was apparently going down but the sea was as angry as ever and would be for hours to come  luke had retired to the forecastle with several other sailors larrys watch on deck was also at an end and he was just on the point of going below when from the west came a curious humming sound which made the young second mate pause the humming increased and then of a sudden the columbia was caught in a hurricane blast that threw her far over on her side  help larry heard in the voice of captain ponsberry somebody help me quick or ill go overboard     chapter iii  larry learns something   the accident which had happened to captain nat ponsberry was certainly a curious one although similar to that which once cost the life of a young officer in our navy  when the hurricane blast reached the columbia the captain was in the act of slipping on a lined raincoata big affair with long sleeves and an extra high collar one arm was in the coat and the other was going down the sleeve when it caught in the lining at that instant the shock threw the captain across the deck and almost over the railing he caught at the railing with his free hand but his other hand remained a prisoner in the coat sleeve while the garment itself stuck in a bunch across his shoulders  help he roared again he tried to pull himself up and to free the hand in the sleeve but found both impossible  larry did not wait for a second cry for assistance he knew the captain so well that he felt the officer would only call when in dire peril he ran out on the slippery deck in doublequick order  hullo where are you he yelled  here help  the young second mate caught sight of the captain not a moment too soon another lurch of the columbia had thrown him completely over the rail and there he clung with one hand while the spray was flying all over him  not waiting to count the possible cost larry slid rather than ran to the rail years before he had learned a trick which now stood him in good stead he wound his legs around the under rail catching the upper one with his left hand then he clutched captain ponsberry by the tangledup arm  on deck there he yelled throw a rope this way and hurry up about it  whats the trouble came from tom grandon who had been in another part of the ship and had not heard the captains cry  the captain is almost overboard throw us a rope  tom grandon was quick to act the rope came whizzing toward larry and in a twinkling he had it around his body and also around the captain  haul in he called and grandon and two sailors did so over the rail came captain ponsberry still fighting to release the tangledup arm in a moment more all danger was past  well how in the world did this happen questioned grandon  tell yesoon as i can git free o this consarned coat spluttered captain ponsberry and he gave the garment a jerk that ripped one of the sleeves completely in half did ye ever see sech foolishness he added and then he told how the lurch of the ship had carried him over the rail just when he could use but one hand after this i reckon ill put on my coat afore i go on deck he concluded  it was a lucky thing that larry heard you cry out said the first mate i was at the wheel helping groot  thats right tom the captain turned to the youth larry youre a brave one and always was i aint going to forget this  oh dont say anything about it came from the young second mate modestly i know youd do as much for me if i needed it  well i would an theres my hand on it cried captain ponsberry heartily and gave larry a grip that made him wince  the storm kept up for the remainder of the day but its worst fury was spent and during the night the wind went down to nothing more than a stiff breeze which was just what was wanted all of the sails were again set and the schooner resumed her course as before  before leaving manila larry had purchased a number of newspapers printed in that city in english so far he had had no chance to look the sheets over but now came two days in which there was little to do and he spent several hours in devouring the news while he also let his friend luke do some reading  tell ye what this ere war between russia and japan is goin to be a big thing said luke after reading an account of the first fights on land and on sea it aint goin to be no such short affair as our little rumpus in cuby  you are right luke this war is going to be a long and bitter one  who is goin to win do you think  im sure i dont know russia is a vast country with millions of people and with an immense army and navy i suppose she can put five times as many men in the field as japan can  but them japs know how to fight  indeed they dothey have proved that already and what is to their advantage they are closer to korea and manchuria than russia is they can get on the fighting ground quickerwhich counts for a good deal  how those russians must have been astonished when the japanese warships sailed into em at port arthur last february i dont believe they were expecting an attack  hardly for war had just been declared but you wouldnt have caught uncle sam napping like that luke  right ye are lad it aint his style an then to see how them japs have been ablowin up the russian warships ever since they must have a fine navy  yes and good gunners too i was told in nagasaki that quite a few american gunners were on their shipsfellows who served under dewey at manila and under sampson and schley off cuba  i believe you lad when a feller gits it in his bones to fight on a warship there aint no life on a merchantman goin to satisfy him some jackies would rather fight nor eatyou know thet as well as i do  well i shouldnt mind doing some fighting myself you know i was on a stand about going with ben and gilbert pennington  where do you reckon they are now  in manchuria i suppose fighting as hard as they can i thought i would get a letter from them before we left manila but nothing came  i suppose the mails are all upset on account of the war put in cal vincent who sat nearby sewing a button on his shirt if youll remember nagasaki was in a big state of excitement while we were there last  did they say anything about any russian warships bein in these parts questioned luke  no  it would be strange if we did fall in with them  which puts me in mind came from the boatswain and then he gazed around to see if any other persons were near semmel says he aint no russian but its dollars to doughnuts he is he continued in a lowered tone  have you discovered anything new demanded larry  yes and no last night i overheard him and peterson talking in a suspicious kind of a way i didnt catch much for they talked partly in english and partly in a foreign language but i am sure they are favoring russia and semmel said something about doing something to harm japan  i dont see how they could do anything on board of this ship came from luke  you didnt hear anything definite  cant say that i did answered the boatswain  we had better watch them closer than ever  all right ill do my share responded vincent and luke striker said the same  that very afternoon larry had another quarrel with the sailor with the long beard semmel had a bucket of dirty water which he was carrying to the ships side as larry passed he pretended to stub his toe and allowed some of the dirty water to flow over the young second mates foot  semmel what did you do that for cried larry indignantly  canno help dat said the sailor i slip  you did it on purpose  oh no and the sailor grinned wickedly  i say you did if you try anything like that again ill make it warm for you get a swab and clean the deck up at once  as semmel sauntered off and while larry was stamping the water from his shoe captain ponsberry came up he had seen the trick played from a distance  what did you tell semmel he questioned sharply  told him to swab the deck up i think he slopped the dirty water over me on purpose  just my idea of it ill tell him what i think of it and striding after the bearded sailor captain ponsberry gave him a lecture not to be readily forgotten  i wont have any of your dirty underhanded work aboard of my ship he concluded either youll behave yourself or ill put you in irons  in irons ejaculated semmel scowling viciously  that is what i said and that is what i mean ever since you came on board you have been acting in this same dirty fashion and i want it stopped now swab up that deck and see that you make a firstclass job of it for two pins id make you black russells shoes  no black nobodys shoes growled semmel but in such a low tone that captain ponsberry could not hear him he cleaned the deck in his own ugly independent manner muttering imprecations against both larry and the captain in the meantime  as a matter of fact even though he had denied it to captain ponsberry and others ostag semmel was really a russian by birth having been born and raised in the seaport of kolaska he had been drafted into the army but not wishing to serve under a military rule which is unusually severe he had run away to sea and become a sailor  life on the ocean suited semmel very well and he would have remained away from russia had it not been for the fact that a rich uncle had died leaving him a property valued at two thousand dollarsa small fortune in the eyes of a man of this russians standing he wished to go back to claim his inheritance but feared to do so for he knew that once on russian soil he would be arrested for desertion and might be sent to a military prison for a great number of years  from a friend in manila he had heard of something which interested him greatly this was the news that another deserter from the russian army had been pardoned for his offense because he had taken home with him important news concerning the movements of a certain japanese warship  if i could only do as well he told himself over and over again and then when he signed articles for the columbias trip he listened eagerly to some talk he overheard about the ships cargo when he began to suspect the truththat the cargo was meant for the japanese governmenthis eyes glistened cunningly  if i can only let russia know of this he reasoned all will go well with me if i can only let russia know     chapter iv  the russian sailors plot   captain ponsberrys stern manner made ostag semmel wild with hatred and when he went back to the forecastle after swabbing up the deck he was in a fit mental condition for almost any dark deed  for a good halfhour he lay in his bunk in a corner brooding over his illluck and wondering what he could do to revenge himself upon both the master of the schooner and larry larry he especially dislikedthe very openheartedness of the young second mate made him long to do the lad harm  at the end of the halfhour another sailor came in it was carl peterson his close friend peterson was a burly tar who had visited nearly every quarter of the globe he loved to drink and carouse and was ever ready to lend a hand in any excitement that offered there was a rumor that he had once led a mutiny on a danish merchant vessel but this he denied laying the blame entirely on others  is that you peterson demanded semmel in his native tongue for he knew that the other could speak russian fluently  yes came in a rough voice from peterson he gave a coarse laugh a fine job you made of it to pour dirty water over russell and then have to swab up the deck for it  who told you of that  didnt i see it with my own eyesand heard what the captain said too  bah it makes me sick growled semmel i am sick of the shipthe creweverything  peterson gave a short toss of his head which was covered with a shock of fiery red hair what are you going to do about it even if the captain treats you like a dog what shall you do ostag semmel he thinks we are all cursdoor mats to wipe feet on  he shall find out that i am neither a dog nor a door mat muttered the bearded russian by my right hand i promise you that  talk is cheapit takes wind to make the mill go answered peterson to an outsider it would have been plain to see that he was leading semmel on in an endeavor to find out what was in his companions mind  it will not end in talk  bah i have heard that before  i have been thinking went on ostag semmel slowly can i trust you  you know you can  you do not love the captaindo not love that russell  do i act as if i did  good now how many on board of this ship  fourteen men counting in ourselves  you count fairly fourteen how many are our friends  postnak and conroy at least  then we are four so far now what of groot and shamhaven and jack wilbur  groot is a good fellow and a man who wishes to make money  and shamhaven will do almost anything for moneyhe once told me so he took a sailor suit from a store in manila without paying for it  i know that too the tailor was rich and didnt need the money and peterson gave another coarse laugh  then we are sixto stand up for our rights and jack wilbur will make sevenjust half the number on the ship  how can we count that wilbur in he is a yankee  he is a weakling and we can manage himand i think we can manage some others toowhen we get that far  how far do you mean demanded peterson although he knew about what was coming  is anybody else near here  no and peterson took a careful look around  supposing we seize the shipin the name of the russian government they have a japanese cargo on board the captain cannot deny it we can take the ship sail her to some russian port and win both prize money and glory is it not a grand scheme  ha that is fine carl petersons eyes glowed voraciously ostag you are a man after my own heart we might become rich  then you like the plan  yesproviding we can make it work but it is a big undertaking if we were caught we might swing from a yardarm for it  we can make it worki have another plan for that i have thought it out completely we canbut more later and ostag semmel broke off abruptly as several sailors entered the forecastle a little later he began to complain in broken english to a sailor named jack wilbur that he was suffering from a severe stomach ache  sorry to hear on it said wilbur who was a very mild foremast hand anything i can do for you  i dink not answered semmel i dink de poor grub ve git mak me feel pad  didnt notice that the grub was poor answered wilbur  very poornot so goot as py my las ship answered semmel some grub here not fit to eat  it was soon noised around that semmel was not feeling well and that he had complained that the food dealt out at noontime had made him sick as soon as captain ponsberry heard of this he went to interview jeff the colored cook who as of old was singing gayly to himself among the pots and pans of the ships galley  wasnt nuffin de mattah wid dat grub capn ponsberry exclaimed jeff after hearing what the commander of the ship had to say it was jess as good as we always has  was it thoroughly cooked  yes sahi dont low nuffin to go from dis yere galley less it am well cooked  are your pots and kettles clean  yes sahyo can see fo yourself sah  the captain did see and moreover he knew that jeff was usually a careful and conscientious culinary artist who always gave the men the best his stock afforded  well be careful of what you cook and how you cook it after this said captain ponsberry  would yo mind tellin me sah who is kicking sah asked jeff respectfully  semmel says he was made sick by what he ate  huh dat scab grunted jeff he aint no count at all he aint and the cook turned away in disgust  it looks to me as if semmel was trying to make trouble all around said tom grandon when he and the captain and larry talked the matter over  i never liked that man from the first time i clapped eyes on him came from larry hes a sneakand worse  i shall watch him pretty closely after this said captain ponsberry one discontented fellow like him can upset the whole ship if he sets out to do it  they cant complain of the grub went on the first mate its as good as on any merchantman and better than the law requires  i guess it was the deckswabbing that gave him the stomach ache said larry and this made the captain and grandon smile  the next day when the sailors sat down to their dinner two or three of them sniffed suspiciously at the food they were eating  this dont taste just right to me said shamhaven the meat tastes decayed  and the vegetables aint much better put in conroya sturdy irishamerican who was one of the best seamen on the schooner  dat dinner am fustclass cried jeff i aint gwine to stand yere an see you growlin at it  it certainly tastes a bit off jeff put in jack wilbur taste it yourself  the cook did so and his face looked doubtful for a moment  guess dat needs a little salt an pepper he said slowly it did not taste nearly as good as he had anticipated  as there was nothing else to do and they were hungry the men ate the meal grumbling to themselves as they did so luke said but little and ate sparingly and his example was followed by cal vincent  the captain grandon and larry ate in the cabin and the dinner served to them was firstclass in every particular  guess jeff is spreading himself just to show what he can do remarked larry to the first mate after he had finished his repast  its very good larry answered tom grandon  by the middle of the afternoon three of the men were complaining of feeling sick and all attributed their ailments to what they had eaten for dinner  ha vat i tole you cried semmel didnt i say de grub vos pad not maybe you belief me hey  i shant stand for any more poor grub came from shamhaven if i cant get good stuff im going to the captain about it  the sickness of the hands worried captain ponsberry greatly and he opened up his medicine chest and gave them such remedies as he thought were best  at supper time jeff was extra cautious in selecting and preparing the food nevertheless the men who ate of it were suspicious and more than half the meal went to waste the captain was very thoughtful but said little or nothing  on the following day the wind died down utterly and it was exceedingly warm with nothing to do the majority of the hands gathered at the bow to talk of matters in general and the food in particular semmel and peterson were of the number and both did all in their power to magnify the outrage as they termed it  der captain dont haf any right to gif us such grub said semmel it vos against der law  on some ships there would be a mutiny over this added peterson  larry overheard a part of the conversation and it set him thinking luke striker also grew suspicious  unless i am mistaken this is some of semmels work said larry to the old tar he is doing his level best to make trouble on the ship  well he better mind his business grumbled luke i dont reckon the captain will stand fer any underhanded work  without appearing to do so larry continued to keep his eyes on semmel and about an hour before dinner he saw the bearded sailor approach the cooks galley and look inside jeff was below getting a case of canned goods with a swift movement semmel stepped into the galley raised the lid of a big pot full of stew that was on the stove and sprinkled something over the food then he hurried out and sneaked forward once more  the rascal murmured larry so this is his game i wonder what he put into that pot  for the moment the young second mate thought to confront semmel and demand an explanation then he changed his mind and hurried for the cabin to tell the news to captain ponsberry     chapter v  signs of a mutiny   ive found out something important captain ponsberry said larry as he entered the cabin i now know whats the matter with the grub to all saltwater sailors food is grub and nothing else  well what is the matter with it questioned the master of the columbia quickly  its being doctored thats whats the matter  doctored  yes sirdoctored by semmel too  will you explain what you mean larry demanded the captain intensely interested  i just saw that rascal go into the cooks galley jeff wasnt there and semmel took the lid off of a big pot on the stove and sprinkled something inside  what captain ponsberry leaped to his feet are you certain of this he demanded  i amfor i saw it with my own eyes  what was that stuff he put into the pot  i dont know  did he touch anything else  no he was in a tremendous hurry and wasnt in the galley more than a minute at the most  the scoundrel captain ponsberry clenched his fists larry you are positive you are making no mistake  i saw the thing done just as i told you the stuff was in a bit of white paper when he went forward he threw the paper overboard  did anybody else see this  i dont think so but  at that moment came a knock on the cabin door and luke striker appeared  excuse me sir he said touching his cap but ive got something important to report  what is it striker  i jess see that air semmel go in and out o the cooks galley  that is just what i am reporting cried larry did you see what he did luke  no he wasnt in there only a minit it looked suspicious to me thoughwith all hands gittin sick from the grub  this is all the evidence i want said captain ponsberry well soon make an end of this larry send semmel to me  the young second mate left the cabin with luke and both hurried toward the bow where semmel and peterson were conversing in low tones  the captain wants to see you at once said larry to the bearded sailor  his tone was so sharp it made semmel start  vat he vants he queried  go and find out for yourself  maybe you git me in droubles hey and the bearded sailor scowled  i reckon as how youre gittin yourself into trouble drawled luke dryly  you keep your mouf shut cried semmel i no talk to you no  the captain wants you to report are you going to do so or not demanded larry  sure i go answered semmel with a toss of his head and he slouched toward the stern his manner was so aggressive that larry picked up a belaying pin before following him  captain ponsberry had just appeared on deck he had armed himself with a short cluba sure sign to those who knew him that something unusual was in the wind his face was stern and forbidding and all hands gathered around to see what was the trouble  semmel i want to have a talk with you he said in a loud voice as the bearded sailor came up  to this the sailor nodded but did not answer  i want to know what you were doing in the cooks galley a short while ago  de cooks galley the sailor acted as if he was puzzled i no go by de galley captain  you were in the galley and you put something into the stewpot what was it thundered captain ponsberry tell me the truth or i may take it into my head to break every bone in your body and he shook his club in the sailors face  i put noddings in de pot cried semmel i no go in de galleyi no been in de galley two tree days it is a lie  i saw you go in came from luke  and so did i added larry and i saw you sprinkle something into the pot  what did dat goodfonuffin furiner put someting in ma eatin shrieked jeff who had come up ohyoyo  never mind jeff ill attend to this interrupted the captain  yes sah but dat monkeyfaced  never mind nowfall back there added the captain and the cook fell back but shook his fist at semmel  i not in de galley reiterated the bearded sailor russell an striker no tell de truth  it is true cried larry  thets so an you cant squirm out o it broke in luke i saw ye as plain as day  i want to know what you put into that stewpot continued captain ponsberry  i no go near de galley i  i know you went into the galley and i know you put something into the stew for the last time i ask you what was it  for reply ostag semmel simply shrugged his shoulders  are you going to tell me the truth  i reckon the truth aint in him grumbled luke under his breath  i say noddings more came sourly from the bearded sailor  put that man in irons commanded captain ponsberry turning quickly to larry and grandon if he wont talk now perhaps hell talk after he has spent a day in the brig  vat you put me in irons shrieked semmel you no got right to do dat no  havent i answered captain ponsberry in a voice that cut like a whip id like to see anybody dispute over it larry tom do as i command  yes sir answered larry and ran off to get a pair of handcuffs while tom grandon stationed himself beside ostag semmel belaying pin in hand  you no mak me a prisoner fumed the bearded sailor you got no right  he continued to rave saying that it was a plot against him because he had been the first to complain about the vile food served to the hands that he had not been near the galley and that the captain grandon and larry knew it he even appealed to the other sailors to stand by him and several came forward to argue with captain ponsberry but the master of the schooner was obstinate and would not listen  i know what i am doing men he said quickly but firmly he is a scoundrel and a spell in the brig will do him good after this i reckon youll find the grub all right  i no like began peterson once more  you shut up peterson or ill put you in the brig with semmel cut in the captain and peterson fell back with the rest but with a brow that was dark and distrustful  by this time larry had returned with the handcuffs and despite the resistance he offered ostag semmel was made a prisoner then the first and the second mates led him to the schooners briga narrow vshaped room in the bow of the boat usually used for storing lanterns and oil the smell in the closetfor it was nothing elsewas far from pleasant and a day in the brig usually made a prisoner repent and promise to do better  i mak trouble for dis growled semmel as the door was closed and bolted on him i mak trouble yes you got no right to do dis no  and you havent any right to doctor the grub answered larry and then he and grandon walked away  that fellow is a firstclass villain to my way of reasoning was the first mates comment i believe hed do almost anything to get square for this  after ostag semmel had been placed in the brig captain ponsberry called all hands to him once more and related what luke and larry had seen the stew was inspected but nothing suspicious could be seen about it  if any of you want to try that stew you may do so said the captain of course if semmel didnt touch it there can be nothing in it that can hurt you but all even to peterson declined to even taste the food it was one thing to think semmel innocent but quite another to run the risk of being made sick or poisoned in the end the stew was dumped overboard and jeff prepared an entirely new dinner for all hands  you must keep close watch on all of the men said the captain to larry and grandon when quietness had been restored semmel was the worst of the lot but i do not like the way peterson and one or two others are acting  i dont see what they can do answered larry  they might start a mutiny came from the first mate  would they dare go as far as that  sometimes sailors get strange notions and the old harry himself cant stop them said captain ponsberry a thing that in itself doesnt amount to much will start them off and theyll imagine that everything is going wrong when i was a lad on board the mary eliza captain snapper we had a mutiny just because the coffee wasnt right  yes and i can remember that they had a mutiny on the old brig chesterfield because captain roes wife brought a crosseyed yellow cat on board added grandon not a man would hoist a sail until that feline was put ashore and when two months later the brig lost her foremast in a gale the sailors said it was on account of that same cat she having scratched the mast before she was taken away  well i hope we dont have a mutiny said larry id like to suggest something captain ponsberry he went on to the master of the columbia  fire ahead larry  you know we can trust luke striker why not have him report just what the other hands are doing  thats an idea and i will act on it yes id trust striker as quick as id trust you if there is to be trouble we certainly want to know of it as soon as possible concluded the captain     chapter vi  the fight for the ship   the day to follow was sunday and contrary to expectations it passed quietly as there was hardly any wind the old columbia made slow progress and the sailors had little or nothing to do as was his usual habit larry read his bible and captain ponsberry held a short church service which less than half the crew attended  its plain to see that the men are sulky said tom grandon towards evening we are certain to hear something from them shortly  luke had been told to report anything unusual but it was not until after dark that he sought out captain ponsberry  i aint got much to say said the old tar but to my mind peterson groot and shamhaven are doin a powerful lot of confabbin moren that i saw peterson cleaning up a pistol hes got  are any of the other hands armed  i aint seen no other shootinirons answered luke  the captain had expected to interview semmel once more but found the fellow so surly he gave up the attempt as the brig was so hot and uncomfortable the master of the schooner had the door fixed so it could be left open several inches with a chain at the bolt to keep it from going further  at four oclock monday morning peterson came on duty followed by shamhaven and some others all made their way to the bow and began to talk in a low but earnest fashion then peterson went below to where semmel was still confined in the brig  we are ready to move now said he in russian what do you think  let me out and i will show you what i think growled ostag semmel the captain is a dogand grandon and russell are dogs too  peterson was prepared to unlock the chain which held the brig door and did so then he handed a pistol to the russian  the captain and russell are in their staterooms said peterson only grandon is on deck with vincent and with the men we can trust to help us  we cant trust vincent  i know that  where is striker  asleep in his berth  but on this score carl peterson was mistaken luke had pretended to go to sleep but he was now in a corner on deck watching with keen eyes all that was occurring presently he saw semmel in company with peterson hurry towards the bow and he felt that the time for action had arrived  hi mr grandon he called out running up to the first mate  what is it striker  theyve released semmel and they are arming themselves  you dont say tom grandon was stunned for the instant tell the captain and russell of this at once  aye aye sir  rushing down the companionway luke entered the cabin and knocked on the door of captain ponsberrys stateroom  wake up captain he called loudly wake up there is going to be trouble putty quick to my way o thinkin  what has gone wrong now demanded the master of the columbia as he hurried into his clothes and armed himself where is grandon  on deck he sent me to tell you they have set semmel free and some of em are arming themselves  a mutiny roared captain ponsberry striker youll stand by me of course  that i will sirto the end  good i know vincent will do the same do you know anything about the others  i think you can count on jeff the cook  what of wilbur  hes so weakkneed i dont know what hell do answered striker  by this time larry was out of his stateroom with his door ajar he had heard all that had been said  oh luke do you think theyll try to seize the ship he gasped  dont know what theyll do theyre a plumb crazy lot growled the old tar it was a mistake to take such fellers as semmel and peterson and shamhaven aboard  that is true but when devine and larson got sick and went to the hospital at manila i had to get somebody answered captain ponsberry he brought out several pistols here larry take one of these and a cutlass too and you striker can arm yourself likewise  there was no time to answer for the master of the schooner was already striding through the cabin in the direction of the companionway an instant later came a yell from the deck followed by heavy footsteps and then the report of a pistol  drive dem to de cabin came in the voice of semmel drive dem along kvick and then followed another yell and the sounds of half a dozen blows  below there came in tom grandons voice help help  im coming called up captain ponsberry  dont you dare to step on deck captain yelled down the voice of shamhaven dont you dare to do it and the sailor appeared pistol in hand at the top of the companionway  shamhaven what does this mean demanded the master of the columbia  it means that we have taken possession of the ship thats what it means came from groot  of you come up here you maybe git killed put in ostag semmel you stay down dare you hear and then as the captain started to mount the stairs he threw down a belaying pin in the semidarkness the captain did not see the object and it struck him on the top of the head rendering him partly unconscious  larry and luke were close behind their leader and both were alarmed to see him go down uttering a deep groan as he did so  is he killed questioned the young second mate  i dont know was the old tars response shall we go up  keep back there was the call from above put a step on those stairs and it will be the worse for you  at that moment came a cry from cal vincent the boatswain had been attacked from behind and was given no chance to defend himself then came a roar from jeff who came rushing toward the companionway as if all the demons of the deep were behind him  sabe me sabe me he screamed da is gwine to pirate de ship sabe me and then he came plunging down headlong directly on top of larry luke and the prostrate captain  this unexpected coming of jeff sent the young second mate and the old tar flat on captain ponsberry and for the moment there was a struggle all around in the meantime some sailors on the deck began to drag a heavy hatch toward the stairs soon this was placed in position and then those below were virtually prisoners  oh my sabe me groaned jeff once more as he managed to get on his feet in the cabin followed by larry and luke dont you let dem swing me from de yardarm  jeff where are grandon and vincent demanded larry  i dunno sahdead i guess answered the cook oh dis am de awfulest ting wot i eber heard tell ob he added woefully and wrung his hands  the lantern in the cabin was turned up and larry gave his attention once more to captain ponsberry who was now opening his eyes  oh my head came with a shiver my head  im glad they didnt kill you said larry kindly luke help me carry him into the cabin well put him on the couch  this was done and they did what they could to make the master of the schooner comfortable but it was a good halfhour before captain ponsberry could sit up and do any rational thinking  on deck all had become suddenly quiet occasionally those below could hear a footstep near the companionway showing that one or more of the mutineers were on guard the hatch shut off the view on deck and the windows in the ceiling of the cabin were also boarded over from the outside  they have us like rats in a trap said larry bitterly  and for all we know vincent and grandon are both dead returned luke striker soberly i must say lad we seem to be in a bad way and no mistake  deyll throw us overboard i know dey will groaned jeff who was almost white with terror i neber see sech goinson in all ma life  to fight the mutineers further was just then out of the question and larry turned his attention again to captain ponsberry at last the captain seemed fully to comprehend what had occurred he once more moved toward the companionway pistol in hand  you cant get out that way sir said larry they have placed the fore hatch over the stairs  and they are armed too put in luke be careful sir or theyll shoot you down  and this on my own ship came bitterly from the master of the columbia that is what i get for treating the dogs better than they deserve where are grandon and vincent  either shot down or taken prisoners they called for help and that was the last we heard of them  and are all the others in this dastardly plot  i reckon they are answered luke them foreigners semmel an peterson must have stirred em up powerfully  still weak from the blow received captain ponsberry sank down once more on the cabin couch there was a lump as big as a walnut on the top of his head and he had jeff bathe it with water and then with witchhazel which made it a trifle more comfortable  a short while later came a sudden wild song from the deck of the schooner followed by a clinking of glasses  they are treating themselves to grog said luke i suppose now they have the run of things theyll drink all they want of the stuff  more than likely returned the captain well it is their turn just nowperhaps before long it will be my turn and he smiled significantly     chapter vii  the mutineers in possession   as my old readers know both captain ponsberry and luke striker were yankees to the backbone and it galled them exceedingly to see the schooner in the hands of a number of mutineers and especially foreigners  weve got to git the ship back no two ways on it growled the old tar captain im willin to fight to the end if ye give the word  and ill fight too said larry promptly  dont you go fo to fight dem rascallions whined jeff yo will all be killed suah  i would like to know what has become of grandon and vincent came from captain ponsberry as we stand now we are but four to seven or eight if we could get grandon and vincent to aid us we would be six against them  perhaps all the hands are not in the mutiny suggested larry why not try to sound them  i was thinking of doing that  a little later captain ponsberry called up the companionway at first nobody paid any attention to him but presently the hatch was shoved aside a few inches and ostag semmel looked down behind him was shamhaven  semmel what does this mean asked the captain as calmly as he could  it means dat ve haf de ship replied the russian with a grin  you are carrying matters with a very high hand where are grandon and vincent  i not tell you dat  we had a right to mutiny said shamhaven the grub wasnt fit to eat and was getting worse every day  thats a tale gotten up for the occasion shamhaven and you know it semmel doctored the food to make you dissatisfied  well we dont think so grumbled the sailor i dont think so and groot and the others dont either  has jack wilbur joined you  certainly he has was shamhavens ready reply but his look belied his words  ve are all pount to stick togedder said semmel you might as vell gif upder sooner der petter for you  i dont propose to give up you rascal  tont you call me a rascals no shouted ostag semmel i vos now der captains yes do you hear captain semmel  bosh put in luke striker in disgust why ye aint fit to be the skipper f a canalboat  if you try to navigate the ship youll sink her on the rocks put in larry  you had better consider what you are doing shamhaven went on the master of the columbia remember if i regain possession of the schooner i can make it go hard with you  you no get dare schooner again not much came from peterson who had just come up followed by jack wilbur  wilbur are you in this demanded the captain if you are i must confess i didnt think it of you  i aint goin to eat poor grub answered wilbur lamely  the grub is all right and you know it it was doctored up by semmel and i  you stop dat talk roared semmel and then he added maybe you gif in after you are goot an hungry hey  what do you want to starve us out cried larry  you seechust vait answered the russian and with this the hatch was again put in place and the conference came to an end  captain ponsberry was fairly boiling with wrath but even so he realized that prudence is often the better part of valor  there is no use of trying a rush to the deck he said those rascals would surely shoot us down just now some of them are in the humor for anything  perhaps we can do something tonight suggested larry  they talk about starving us out said luke aint there nothin to eat here  an inspection was made of the cabin pantry which brought to light some preserves some pickles a pot of cheese and a tin of fancy crackers  about enough for one meal said captain ponsberry grimly  and a pretty slim one at that added larry but i say captain he added suddenly isnt there a door leading from the back of the pantry down into the hold  there was oncebut i had it nailed up years ago for we never used it  if we can open that we might get something from the hold  going to eat machinery demanded luke  nocanned goods luke i know jeff had some placed there for he didnt have room in his storeroom  dat am a fac put in the cook ise got lots ob tings in dat dar hold  then that settles the starving question said captain ponsberry ive got a small saw and a hammer down here somewhere we can use them on the door  and that gives me another idea went on larry the hatch covering over the companionway belongs to the fore hatch if we can reach that opening from here why cant we steal on deck when we get the chance and try to make the mutineers prisoners  eureka shouted luke thats the talk larry fer your years youve got a wonderfully long head on ye well make em prisoners or chuck em overboard  the idea is worth considering said the captain but we must be careful  a search was made and the hammer small saw and also a chisel were found then they cleaned out the pantry took down several shelves and thus uncovered the small door which had been nailed up  dont make any noise or theyll suspect that we are up to something said captain ponsberry  let jeff rattle some dishes said larry and while he and luke worked on the door the cook began to handle the dishes in such a rough manner that several were broken he also tried to sing a couple of verses of his favorite song my gal susannah but his voice was so shaky that the effort was artistically a failure although it added to the noise which was all that was desired  theyre pretty happy down there said wilbur to shamhaven as he listened to the sounds  oh theyre putting on a front growled shamhaven theyll sing a different tune when their stomachs are empty  i dont know about this mutiny went on the weakkneed sailor nervously  oh its all right and you neednt to worry wilbur if we stick together well make a couple of thousand apiece out of this game  but what shall we do if we fall in with a russian warship  semmel has that all fixed hell expose the captain and state that the columbia is carrying a cargo for the japanese government and that he took possession in the name of the czar with this war on they wont ask too many questions so long as they can give the japs a black eye  i see but supposing we fall in with a japanese warship  then semmel is going to turn the command over to me and ill tell them that the cargo was really meant for the japanese government but that captain ponsberry just before we left manila sold out to the russian agents and was going to vladivostok ill add that we refused to go to the russian port after signing for nagasaki and all of the men can back me up that will put the captain and his friends in limbo and give us some prize money oh well come out ahead dont you worry concluded shamhaven confidently  the day passed slowly and the mutineers held several meetings to settle upon just what they were going to do but all had been drinking more than was good for them and the conferences ended in nothing but talk semmel was the accepted leader but it was plain to see that shamhaven objected strongly to playing a secondary part and peterson also wanted a large finger in the pie  as they worked with care it was a good hour and a half before larry and luke managed to take down the door leading into the hold even when this was done they found on the other side several heavy cases of machinery almost impossible to budge  we can pry those out of the way said the captain  a foot or so will do it returned larry then i think i can crawl over the top  they continued the work and a little later the young second mate was able to squeeze his way to the top of the cargo in that vicinity  be careful larry warned the captain if a case should shift with the ship you might get a crushed leg you had better take a candle along  i will sir  luke was as anxious to get into the hold as the young second mate and he too squeezed his tall lank form through the opening guided by the faint light of the candle they crawled over a number of cases of machinery and war goods until they drew close to the middle of the ship  here we are cried larry in a low voice and pointed to some cases of canned goods beans corn tomatoes salt pork condensed milkwe wont starve just yet luke  an here are some barrels o flour added the old tar no they cant starve us nohow now  they had brought the chisel and hammer along and with extra caution opened some of the cases taking with them all the goods they could carry they returned to the cabin  this is splendid cried captain ponsberry with this stuff on hand we can hold the cabin indefinitely  how is i gwine to cook questioned jeff  over the two lanterns jeff it will be slow work but our time is our own luckily there are pots and tins in the pantry  all right sah  of course i am hoping that we shall not have to stay here long went on the captain but it is best to be prepared  that those on deck might not see the cooking going on one of the staterooms was cleaned out and jeff went to work in this in the meantime semmel called down the companionway once more  are you gettin hungry he asked  tell him yes whispered larry  why questioned the captain in an equally low tone  then hell think we are getting ready to come to terms and he wont watch us so closely  i see captain ponsberry raised his voice yes we are hungry he called up what are you going to send us something good  ve send noddings maybe you talk business soon hey continued the rascally russian  perhaps  how soon  well perhaps tomorrow morning  not before dot hey  no  all right den you can go on an starve so long growled ostag semmel and went away a moment later he met shamhaven  what did he say asked the latter anxiously  he comes to terms tomorrow answered the russian triumphantly     chapter viii  turning the tables   the meal which jeff prepared put all in the cabin in better humor and as soon as it was over a council of war was held  it was decided to wait until darkness had set in and then try to gain the deck of the ship by way of the fore hatch in the meantime the door to the companionway was to be locked and barred so that the mutineers could not attack them very well from that direction should a running fight ensue  as jeff would be of no use in a struggle he was delegated to remain in the cabin to make as much noise as possible singing and talking to himself so that the mutineers might not suspect what was taking place  each member of the party armed himself both with a pistol and a cutlass and larry led the way as before candle in hand it was easy for luke to follow him but rather difficult for the captain who was more portly  reckon as how ye shouldnt have eaten so much captain chuckled the old tar as he helped captain ponsberry through a particularly narrow place  true striker was the answer but you be careful that you dont slip into some slit between the cases and go out of sight  they soon gained the spot where the canned goods had been found they had now to climb over some machinery that reached nearly to the top of the hold and then over a varied collection of boxes and barrels and bags on the bags lay some of the old sails of the ship and several coils of discarded rope  they were just approaching the open fore hatch when they saw a rope ladder let down instantly larry uttered a warning and put out the light  somebody is coming down he whispered  it was the sailor wilbur who had been sent to get some canned goods for cooking purposes he came down the rope ladder with a lantern slung over one arm  well make him a prisoner cried captain ponsberry and let us do it as quietly as we can so as not to disturb those on deck  the others understood and crouched back in the darkness then as wilbur passed them the captain caught him from the back and larry clapped a hand over the fellows mouth  oh spluttered wilbur but that was as far as he got  not a word not a sound wilbur said captain ponsberry earnestly  the sailor understood and being a craven at heart he almost collapsed it was an easy matter to take one of the old ropes and tie his hands behind him then captain ponsberry confronted the mutineer making a liberal exhibition of his pistol as he did so  wilbur answer me truthfully said the master of the columbia are you all in this mutiny or not dont speak above a whisper  i aint in it whined wilbur they dragged me in they did i aint kicking about grub or nothing  are all the others in it  kind of yes groot didnt care much to go in guess he wish he was out of it now  what has become of grandon and vincent  both of em are prisoners in the brig  are they wounded  not much grandon had his thumb cut and vincent got a kick in the back that lamed him  is anybody guarding them  i guess not all of em have got to drinking again say captain let me out of this fix and ill never go against you again never continued wilbur earnestly  well see about that later was the grim reply  captain ponsberry i have a scheme put in larry and he drew the master of the ship to one side wilbur is about the same build as myself let me take his coat and cap and go on deck and down to the brig if i can release grandon and vincent well be sure to knock out the mutiny in no time  its a dangerous game larry  oh please let me do it pleaded the young second mate the hazard was one which appealed to him strongly  the matter was talked over for a few minutes and it was decided to let larry have his way wilbur was soon stripped of his coat and the young second mate donned the garment then he took the mutineers cap and pulled it as far over his brow as possible and turned up the coat collar  ill leave the lantern here he said and a second later was mounting the rope ladder slowly and cautiously  with his head on a level with the deck larry paused to reconnoiter the situation he knew exactly how dangerous his mission was and that he was running the risk of being shot but his life in our navy had made him bold and seeing nobody in sight he leaped out on deck and hurried with all speed to the ladder leading to the brig soon he was in front of the barred door  grandon vincent he called softly  hullo whos that came in the voice of the first mate  it is i larry is vincent there  yes where did you come from  the cabin larry unbarred the door are you hurt  not much how are you  i am all right and so are the captain and luke striker they are in the hold ready to come on deck we have made wilbur a prisoner  good enough came from the boatswain the rascals they ought all to walk the plank he added vehemently  the two men had their hands tied behind them but it was an easy matter for larry to liberate them then each provided himself with a belaying pin and all three of the party stole to the deck  from the forecastle and the cooks galley came loud talking showing that the mutineers were making themselves at home one man was trying to do some cooking  whats keeping wilbur so long he demanded of the others  nobody knew and one of the crowd the sailor named groot volunteered to look the missing one up  let us follow him to the hatch whispered larry perhaps we can make him a prisoner  right you are answered tom grandon  with caution they came up behind the man and just as groot leaned over the open hatchway they caught him tightly  keep silent groot said grandon keep silent or well throw you overboard  stop roared the mutineer help hel  he got no further for raising his belaying pin vincent brought it down on the mutineers head groot had been the one to lame the boatswains back and the latter had not forgotten it over went the fellow and sank down as if dead  drop him into the hold ordered grandon and this was done just as captain ponsberry and luke striker appeared at the foot of the rope ladder  another eh said the master of the columbia good enough how are you tom how are you vincent  were ready to fight em answered the first mate come on theyve got so much liquor aboard they cant do much to us  be careful i dont want anybody shot if it can be avoided responded captain ponsberry  i think it would be a good plan to dump them all into the hold said larry then we could nail up that pantry door put the hatch into place and keep them at our mercy  if the plan will work its a good one answered the captain  one after another they came out on deck leaving wilbur and groot in the hold they found the mutineers equally divided between the galley and the forecastle the only man in charge of the schooner was conroy who was at the wheel  as they advanced upon the forecastle they saw semmel come out accompanied by peterson  there are the ringleaders cried captain ponsberry and rushing up to them he exclaimed surrender you rascals and he aimed his pistol while the others also raised their weapons  the russian and his companion were taken completely by surprise and before they could draw any weapons of their own it was too late grandon tripped one up and fell upon him and then vincent and larry tripped up the other there was a brief scuffle the exchange of several blows which did little damage and in a trice semmel and peterson were thrown down into the hold bodily and the ladder was hauled up out of their reach  put that hatch over the opening cried captain ponsberry to larry and then go into the cabin pantry and nail up that door be quick about it or they may get out  aye aye sir cried the young second mate and ran off with all speed the hatch was large and heavy but the excitement lent him strength and he dragged it forward and threw it over the hatchway  stop dat roared semmel in a drunken voice but larry paid no attention his next movement was toward the cabin  dont yo tech me roared jeff in alarm oh it am yo he added as he recognized larry how am de battle gwine  weve got em on the runfour are prisoners in the hold was larrys reply get me that box of nails jeffi must put that door back as it was  yes sah yes sah answered the cook eagerly and brought forth the nails in question then he helped to put the door into place and held it while larry nailed the barrier the job was just completed when the young second mate heard voices from the hold  hi dare you let us out came from peterson ve vill mak it right yes  you keep quiet ordered larry and would say no more against the door he and jeff placed several trunks and boxes taken from the staterooms opening off of the cabin  during this time the party led by captain ponsberry had attacked the balance of the mutineers there was a brief fight and shamhaven got a cutlass cut on the knee but then the men surrendered and one after another was made to drop down into the hold and the hatch was shut and battened down  the only man who was not thus made a prisoner was conroy who begged at once to be forgiven  they got me to drink captain he pleaded i didnt know what i was doing forgive it and ill be the best man you ever had on board  can i depend upon you conroy asked captain ponsberry sternly  you can siri give you my word on it  you wont try to help the mutineers  no sir no sir  very well then ill try you but remember if you try any dirty work it will go hard with you now tell me was wilbur in favor of this mutiny  no sir he was not semmel forced him into it  what of the others who were the ringleaders  semmel and peterson and shamhaven the others didnt want to do anything but complain about the grub answered conroy and then told the particulars of the mutiny from beginning to end     chapter ix  close to a waterspout   it was decided to leave the mutineers in the hold undisturbed until morning this done those who had been hurt in the scrimmage had their wounds attended to and then jeff was set to work to prepare a good meal for all the loyal party the galley was in a state of disorder but this counted for nothing and jeff soon had matters straightened out  after so much excitement nobody thought of retiring luke was stationed over the fore hatch to give warning of any attempt on the part of the mutineers to regain their liberty he was armed and he threatened to blow the hull head off of anybody who dared to show himself or make a noise as a consequence the mutineers did nothing two made their way to the nailedup door but finding they could not open it gave up the attempt as a bad job  as a punishment for his misdeeds conroy was kept at the wheel during the whole of the night he was willing enough to do the extra work if only the captain would forgive him for his actions the master of the ship questioned him closely and in the end reached the conclusion that only semmel peterson and shamhaven were the leaders in the attempt to seize the ship and that the others had followed after them like so many sheep  i am glad to hear this he said to grandon and larry i think after i read them a strong lecture theyll behave themselves  but we shall have to watch em closely said the first mate  what will you do with semmel peterson and shamhaven asked larry  put them in irons and keep them there until the end of the trip when we reach nagasaki they can take their choice of leaving or of being kicked off the ship if they raise a row ill hand them over to the authorities  you ought to have them locked up  true lad but with this war on hand the courts wont want to bother with such a case  it was not until nine oclock in the morning that captain ponsberry had the forward hatch raised once more those below were almost dying for fresh air and water  i want wilbur to come up he said  cant we have some water demanded shamhaven  yes if youll behave yourselves was the short answer  there was a babble of voices but the master of the ship paid no attention each man who had been thrown below was unarmed so there was no danger of any shooting presently wilbur came up the rope ladder thrown to him looking sheepish enough  what have you to say for yourself demanded the captain when wilbur threw himself on his knees  dont count it against me cap he groaned i didnt want to go into it i tell you i didnt want to go in  if i forgive you will you give me your word to behave yourself  yes sir  you wont do any more underhanded work  you can shoot me if i do captain  very well ill remember that now go forward and help put the ship in good order larry set him to work and see that he does just what you tell him and wilbur went off with the young second mate following thanking his stars that he had not been swung to the yardarm for mutiny on the high seas is a capital offense  one by one the mutineers were allowed to come on deck until only semmel peterson and shamhaven remained below those to come up pleaded to be forgiven and promised to obey orders in the future and let the captain run the ship to suit himself  during the night groot had had a bitter quarrel with semmel and the russian appeared presently with a black eye and two of his front teeth loose he was promptly put in irons and the handcuffing of peterson and shamhaven followed  i have allowed the other men their liberty because you three led them into this affair said captain ponsberry to the trio of rascals i intend to keep you in irons until the end of the trip  at this there was a loud complaint and the three made all manner of protestations but the master of the columbia was obdurate and at last threatened to throw them into the hold again this quieted them for the time being and after being given a square meal and a drink of water they were marched off to the brig which was cleaned of everything else for their accommodation  fortunately for the columbia the weather remained fair so that the loss of the prisoners was not felt when it came to handling the schooner those who had mutinied were only too glad to get back into captain ponsberrys good graces and they did whatever was required with an alacrity which was as astonishing as it was gratifying they ate whatever was set before them and soon reached the conclusion that the food was really better than they deserved  we were fools to follow semmel said wilbur and conroy and some others fully agreed with him  but though it now looked as if the men could be trusted captain ponsberry determined to keep his eyes on them vincent was placed at the head of one watch and luke at the head of the other so that with one or the other of the mates the deck was always guarded by at least two persons that could be depended upon  the captain had hoped for favorable breezes following the heavy storm but these did not come and day after day passed with the old columbia making slow progress toward nagasaki formosa was passed during a bit of thick weather so that nothing was seen of that island then the sun came out again hotter than ever so that larry was glad to keep in the shade as much as possible  its not so exciting as it was a few days ago remarked luke to larry one day when both were seated in the shade of the forecastle  i am glad that mutiny is at an end answered larry its a great wonder that somebody wasnt killed or seriously wounded  the men didnt have their hearts in the rumpus thets why larry if they had really meant businesswell i reckon some of us wouldnt be here now to tell the tale  i think semmel meant business  yes hes a heap sight worse nor any o the others  it was a mistake to take him on board i tell you a captain cant be too careful who he puts in his forecastle  well you know the reasonthose other hands gettin sick at manila but i can tell you id rather have a crew of americans any day  they are hard to get  true fer you the old yankee tar heaved a sigh the old days are gone sure enough my my what times we used to have when wed go out every man aknowin every other man on the ship an all about him too then it was like a big family settin sail now if you go on a new ship ye dont know nobody an nobody knows nobody else  i guess you expect to live and die a sailor dont you luke  dont know but what i do unless somebody leaves me money enough to live like a millionaire and the old tar grinned  day after day passed and the columbia kept on her course making as straight a passage for nagasaki as possible one day there would be a fair breeze and the next a dead calm  this is unusual weather for this quarter of the globe said captain ponsberry to larry like as not it will end in another hurricane  in that case what will you do release semmel and the others  i may release peterson and shamhaven but not semmel for he was the real ringleader  there were strong signs of a storm in the air that night but they brought forth nothing and on the following morning the sun came up as full and bright as before the breeze came by fits and starts from first one direction and then another and the man at the wheel had all he could do to keep the schooner to her course sails were shifted half a dozen times but without making any improvement  the weather is certainly queer said grandon puts me in mind of the time i was caught in a tidal wave in the south seas before the wave struck us we had just such cuttingsup  i trust we dont strike a tidal wave answered larry if it was high enough it might swamp us  true but when youre on the deep blue sea lad youve got to take whatever comes replied the first mate solemnly  dinner was a quiet affair for all on board and shortly after the repast larry went to the forward deck to have another chat with luke while the two were talking they were joined by captain ponsberry and soon the three were conversing about old times once more  do you remember the swim we once took in the pacific said larry to luke the time the sawfish smashed the boat and came after us  reckon i do was the yankee tars response we had a lively swim fer it didnt we  and the time we visited the island and you turned the turtles went on larry and do you remember that snake that chased us into the water  i do larry tell you what weve had our share of adventures when admiral deweywhat is it captain  luke broke off short and looked at captain ponsberry inquiringly the master of the columbia was gazing over the port bow in an earnest puzzled fashion  do you see that little black cloud striker  i do sir and now luke became all attention and so did larry kind o funny lookin aint it  it is odd answered the captain do you see how it seems to be dancing around in the sky  is it a cloud questioned larry if so i never saw its like before  ill take a look at it through my glass went on the captain and sent a sailor for the article  the cloud came swiftly closer and they heard a most unusual roaring and hissing then of a sudden the cloud seemed to dip down into the sea when it came up the waters of the ocean followed and there loomed up before those on the ship a waterspout ten or fifteen feet thick  a waterspout cried half a dozen in concert  and a mighty powerful one too said the captain i trust it dont come this way  it is coming this way yelled larry look look  the young second mate was right the waterspout appeared to be headed directly for the schooner but then it shot off to the westward churning the water into a foam behind it  its going away murmured luke when once more the waterspout made a curve and then shot directly toward them it was off the port bow and less than a hundred feet away it looked as if the old columbia was surely doomed     chapter x  something about war and fighting ships   its going to strike the ship  it will cut us to pieces  throw the schooner over on the other tack  these and several other cries rang out on the deck of the columbia all felt their hearts come up into their throats as the roaring swirling mass of water came closer and closer until the spray drenched them completely the ocean was churned into a white foam and the wind seemed to suck and blow in all directions at once  but just as it looked as if the schooner would be buried beneath a veritable mountain of water the waterspout took another curve and slid away along the side of the ship and off the stern the man at the wheel came close to being carried overboard by the deluge he received and the columbia bobbed up and down like a cork but in another moment the waterspout was an eighth of a mile distant  what aa narrow escape faltered larry when he felt able to speak i thought we were bound for the bottom sure  thets the closest i ever was to any waterspout came from luke as he wiped his wet brow reckon we can thank providence we aint in davy jones locker this minit  captain ponsberry did not say much but kept his eyes fixed on the waterspout which was making fantastic curves across the bosom of the pacific at times it was close by and then it would go half a mile or more away it was a fascinating scene full of dread and gave more than one onlooker a chill down his backbone  i wish it would go away completely went on larry  but this was not to be the waterspout kept within sight for a good halfhour although it did not come near them again at last it grew less and less off to the southwestward and finally vanished altogether the glass was used in that direction but nothing save a clear horizon could be located  we are clear of it at last said captain ponsberry and breathed a long sigh of relief  waterspouts are mighty dangerous things said grandon after the scare was over when i was on board of the brig ben franklin we ran into a spout off the coast of brazil and it knocked off the bow and the forward rail and nearly sank us  i met one once off the coast of cuba said the captain that went ashore and tore up the trees like so many weeds for a hundred feet around a waterspout is nothing to be fooled with i can tell you  on the day following the appearance of the waterspout the weather changed there was a slight storm and then a stiff breeze sprang up which was cheering to all on board every stitch of canvas on the columbia was spread and the schooner bowled along right merrily  id like to know how this war is going on and how ben and gilbert are faring said larry to captain ponsberry a whole lot may have happened since we left manila  well youll probably get word from your brother when you reach nagasaki lad and well get word from captain pennington too  i hope neither of them has been wounded  so do i but when one goes to the front he has got to put up with the fortunes of war being a soldier of fortune as it is called is no baby business  do you suppose the japs are continuing to bombard port arthur  more than likelyif the place hasnt fallen into their hands they want to make sure of their footing in lower manchuria and they can never do that so long as the russians hold a single seaport down there  i suppose russia has a pretty goodsized navy as well as an army  yes larry one of the largest navies in the world but their fighting ships are no better than the ships of japan you see the japanese navy is not near as old as the navy of russia almost all of the ships are of the uptodate types most of them have been built since the war between japan and china in 1894 and 1895  that would make them only about ten years old  exactly and ive been told that some of the ships in the russian navy are twenty and thirty years old more than this all of the japanese guns are of the latest patternjust as they are on our new warships  id like to go aboard of a japanese warship cried the young second mate enthusiastically  want to see if its as good as it was aboard of the olympia eh  yes sir of course the olympia was old especially alongside of the brooklyn on which my brother walter served in cuban waters but even so she was a bangup fighting machine if she hadnt been she wouldnt have done her share in sinking that spanish fleet in manila bay  well you may have a chance to go aboard of a japanese ship while we stop at nagasaki there must be a number of them at that port coaling up and taking war supplies aboard  how long do you think it will be before we reach that port  that will depend entirely upon the wind as you know if we get just what we need we may reach there inside of four or five days answered captain ponsberry  as peterson and shamhaven were now behaving themselves they were allowed to come out of the brig and do some work on the deck every morning and afternoon both begged the captain to forgive them but the master of the columbia would promise nothing  you went into this with your eyes wide open he said now you can line up and take your medicine  semmel was exceedingly bitter at not being allowed his liberty for at least a few hours a day and said he would denounce the captain at the first opportunity but captain ponsberry soon cut him short  you keep a civil tongue in your head he said sternly unless you do ill put you down on hardtack and water and thereupon semmel became sullenly silent  towards evening of the day upon which larry had the conversation about warships with captain ponsberry a chinese junk heavily laden with grasscovered boxes was passed nobody on board could speak english so the hail that was sent over the water brought no results  we are getting closer to the coast shipping said the master of the columbia i suppose well meet quite a few vessels from now on  during the night an unexpected gale came up and the schooner was blown far out of her course the gale came from the westward so the vessel was blown to the east  this will make the trip a day or two longer grumbled grandon after the gale had spent itself  yes but as we didnt lose a spar or a rag of canvas we can be thankful that it is no worse responded larry who was always ready to look on the bright side  the gale subsided after a blow of twentyfour hours and then the bow of the columbia was once more set towards her destination only a few knots had been covered when the lookout reported a vessel in sight  its a steamer cried larry for the smoke from the crafts funnels was plainly to be seen  maybe shes a warship returned tom grandon who was beside him if so i hope shes a japanese  the steamer was coming along at a good rate of speed and soon they made her out to be a british vessel she was a tramp that is a vessel going from port to port picking up whatever cargo can be found  ahoy there cried captain ponsberry as the tramp slowed up what ship is that  the lord duffield was the answer what ship is that  the columbia  where are you bound  for nagasaki and you  for hongkong  a little more talk followed and the captain of the lord duffield vouchsafed the information that he had sighted a russian warship the day before  a warship murmured larry  which way was she bound asked captain ponsberry anxiously  i cant tell you she stopped us and asked a few questions and then slipped away in the darkness  what warship was she  the pocastra from vladivostok i think she used to be in the merchant service and was built over for the navy  the captain of the british steamer could give no further information and so resumed his course and the master of the columbia did likewise  aint very nice news is it said tom grandon  its very unpleasant news returned captain ponsberry with a shrug of his shoulders  what are you going to do about it  what can we do tom trust to luck that we get into nagasaki harbor or some other port in safety  well have to keep a sharp lookout for anything that looks like a warship unless of course she flies a japanese flag  word was passed around to those who could be trusted and all day long one of the mates and a foremast hand were kept on the lookout taking turns at looking through the best glass the schooner possessed  this is almost as exciting as being in a war said larry when he was on duty with luke dont you know how we looked for the spanish ships  yes lad but if we sight a russian warship it will be small fighting well do to my way of thinking  oh we wont be able to fight at all well simply have to rely on our wits to keep us out of being gobbled up as a prize of war responded the young second mate     chapter xi  an order to layto   when taking on his cargo at manila captain ponsberry had considered the possibility of being captured by a russian warship and had talked the matter over with the agents of the richmond importing company and with a japanese official who was doing business on the sly in the philippines  the japanese government was willing to pay for the cargo whether it was delivered or notpresuming it was gobbled up by the russians but was not willing to pay for the ship if the vessel was taken as a prize of war  that is a risk you must take yourself said the japanese official we are willing to pay a high price for the cargowe cannot do more and so the riskso far as the schooner wentwas divided equally between the richmond importing company and captain ponsberry and the other owners of the columbia  as nearly the captains whole wealth was tied up in his share of the schooner he was naturally anxious to make a safe trip and he often came on deck to aid the lookouts in watching for the possible appearance of an enemy  if you see the least thing that looks suspicious tell me at once was his order and it was strictly obeyed as a consequence they ran away from two steamers that afternoon and another steamer the next morningall too far off to show exactly what they were  this isnt bringing us much nearer to port said larry to cal vincent who was using the glass at the time i dont believe we have made a dozen knots since yesterday  well the old man is a bit nervous responded the boatswain in a low voice and i dont blame him its no small matter to lose your craft and be thrown into prison in the bargain  would they dare to throw us into prison  to be sureif they could prove that we were aiding the japs  well theyll have hard work proving that  an hour went by and it began to grow misty then came a call from the bow  sail in sight  what is it demanded the captain instantly  a big steamer o some sort  captain ponsberry ran forward and took the glass for fully two minutes he did not speak and then he drew a long breath and put down the glass  im afraid shes a warship he exclaimed and his voice sounded unnatural  a warship echoed larry will you let me look  he did so and it was not long before he could make out the approaching craft quite clearly  well demanded grandon who knew that larrys eyes were unusually strong  i reckon the captain is right  a warship  yes not a very large affair but still a warship i shouldnt be surprised if she was the converted vessel the lord duffield sighted  just what i think put in captain ponsberry weve got to do our best to show her a clean pair of heels  the mist may help us to run away suggested grandon  let us hope so  necessary orders were given and soon the columbia swung around on another tack so that she had the large vessel on her starboard quarter but this movement was evidently noted by the stranger and the latter headed directly for the schooner once more  she is after us that is positive said captain ponsberry  there is a bank of mist over to the northward returned larry why not run into that  well spoken lad well do it and as soon as the mist hides us we can go over on the other tack and throw her off the scent  the mist the young second mate had mentioned was nearly a quarter of a mile away and it was a question whether they could reach it before the stranger came up but fortune favored those on the schooner the mist rolled toward them and in less than two minutes they were hidden as completely as could be desired  now to get entirely out of the way exclaimed captain ponsberry and lost not a moment in having the sails shifted and a new course set through the mist they heard the other vessel steaming around noisily and did their best to keep as far away as possible from the sound  all during that evening and the night to follow the columbia kept to her new course this was taking her away from nagasaki but this could not be helped the captain said if it became absolutely necessary he would run into some other japanese port  when daybreak came the mist was as thick as ever but there were signs that it would not last much longer and by nine oclock the sun was struggling to come through the clouds nearly everybody was on deck for they realized that a fatal moment might be at hand  there she is  the cry came from half a dozen throats simultaneously there on the port bow loomed up the stranger not an eighth of a mile away that she was a warship there was no longer any doubt for her forward guns were plainly to be seen  were caught now muttered tom grandon  not yet cried the captain and gave orders to throw the columbia over on a new course but scarcely had this movement been made when there was a puff of smoke from the warship a report and a shot flew in front of the schooners bow  theres our order to layto ejaculated larry whoever she is she means business  as the columbia did not stop another shot was fired this time just grazing the bow seeing there was no help for it captain ponsberry gave the necessary orders and down came one sail after another  as this was done the warship swung around and then those on the schooner saw that she flew the flag of russia  a russian warship ejaculated half a dozen  this looks to me as if the jig was up murmured tom grandon  as quickly as it could be done captain ponsberry assembled his men on deck  men he said briefly the officers on board of that warship wish to find out what they can about us if you are asked questions say nothing more than that you shipped for the voyage to nagasaki and san francisco and that you know nothing about the cargo do you understand  aye aye sir came from those who were listening  i must depend upon you to help save the ship if the columbia is suspected of being in the employ of the japanese government or of carrying a cargo for that nation she will be taken as a prize of war and well go to a russian prison most likely  i dont want to go to no russian prison cried out wilbur his face turning pale i aint done nothing wrong  then keep your tongue from wagging too much wilbur answered the master of the schooner grimly  there aint no use o fighting is there asked groot  fighting came from tom grandon what could the old columbia do against a manowar why theyd blow us sky high in no time  no there is absolutely no use of attempting to fight answered captain ponsberry our only hope lays in convincing them that they have no right to stop us  the hands were dismissed and sent forward and captain ponsberry hurried below to burn certain papers and secrete others this was in accordance with the orders received from the agents of the richmond importing company at manila  in the meantime the russian warship had come to a stop in midocean and now a small boat was lowered containing a small crew a coxswain and a russian naval officer at the same time a signal was hoisted which meant that the officer was coming on board of the schooner  unless i miss my guess this looks rather black for us said larry to tom grandon  i agree with you larry responded the first mate but weve got to take our medicine no matter how bitter it is  if only that mist had held on today we might have slipped by that warship nicely  i only hope the old man fixes up his papers so that he can show a clean bill of health went on grandon you see if they cant actually prove something against us they wont dare to touch us they know what old glory means and russia has no desire just now to get into trouble with uncle sam  the worst of it is our cargo may look too suspicious to them under ordinary circumstances they know that the columbia wouldnt be carrying such a line of goods in these waters  thats true too  besides that they may have had an agent at nagasaki and at manila spying on us they may know just what is being done the czars followers are mighty slick i can tell you  captain ponsberry now came on deck and gave quick orders that the sailors should be lined up to receive the visitor in a befitting manner  a little goose grease may help he drawled with a knowing glance at grandon and larry  the foremast hands did not know much about lining up but took the places assigned to them on the forward deck over the side a rope ladder was thrown and then captain ponsberry tom grandon and larry awaited the arrival of the russian naval officer with keen interest     chapter xii  taken as a prize of war   slowly but surely the small boat came closer to the schooner she rode the long swells of the pacific with full grace and larry could not help but admire the long sturdy strokes of the jackies as they bent to their task  i dont know but that they can handle a small boat as well as our own jackies said larry  why shouldnt they russian naval training ought to be firstclass answered tom grandon they have been at it longer than uncle sam  true but that doesnt always count spain had been at it longer than we had too but when it came to war we beat her in doublequick order  as the small boat came closer they saw that the jackies were mostly men of middle age but the coxswain was younger and so was the naval officer who was gazing rather anxiously toward the schooner as if wondering what the result of his mission would be  wonder if that chap can talk english queried the first mate if he cant the old man will be up a tree for none of us can talk russian  i reckon peterson and semmel can talk it answered larry but we dont want either of those rascals to open his mouth  at last the small boat came up alongside of the columbia it was no easy matter to catch the rope ladder without getting bumped but it was successfully accomplished and then the russian officer lost no time in coming on board he at once saluted and captain ponsberry and his mates did the same and the sailors in the background did likewise  what ship is this asked the russian naval officer after a few necessary formalities were at an end  the american schooner columbia answered captain ponsberry  would you mind telling me for what port you are bound went on the naval officer who could speak fairly good english  we are bound for san francisco with a stopover at nagasaki  ah what sort of a cargo are you carrying to nagasaki  one belonging to the firm for which the columbia is in commission  the name of the firm please  the richmond importing company  ah said the naval officer again and looked slightly displeased as it happened he had a brother in the army at port arthur and had heard of the doings of gilbert pennington at that place and of how the young american had accused certain russians of trying to cheat the company he represented  what warship do you come from demanded captain ponsberry feeling that he had an equal right to ask questions  the auxiliary cruiser pocastra of the russian navy answered the naval officer politely  and where are you bound went on captain ponsberry bluntly  that sir is a question only our commander captain titorsky can answer  its queer you are steaming around in japanese waters  perhaps so the russian naval officer smiled in a knowing way captain ponsberry i am sorry but i think i shall have to inspect your papers  captain ponsberry drew himself up resolved to put on as bold a front as possible  this is an american ship sir  granted but i have my orders returned the naval officer coldly  if i refuse to let you inspect the papers  the young russian officer shrugged his shoulders  we shall be under the painful necessity of compelling you to show them  you threaten mean american captain  there is no help for iti am simply obeying orders we inspect all ships that we find in this vicinity  do you know i can make you pay dearly for this outrage  you cannot call it an outrage you are in japanese waters japan and russia are at war you knew that before you came into these waters am i to see the papers or not  the commander of the columbia knew that the russian naval officer spoke the truth yet he made one more effort  very well i will show my papers but i shall insist upon you signing a paper that your ship held us up  you can send the paper to my ship for such a signature from my captain said the russian evasively  by this time four of the jackies of the small boat had come on board all were armed and they lined up at the rail close to the rope ladder they were goodnatured sailors and grinned broadly at the hands on the columbia not one could speak a word of english so conversation with them was impossible  captain ponsberry led the way to the cabin of the columbia and the young russian officer followed getting out such papers as had been prepared for the occasion the master of the schooner passed them over  these are correct so far as they go said the russian after an examination lasting ten minutes had been made but he paused you have no further papers  those are my papers sir answered captain ponsberry briefly  then i will look at a specified list of your cargo  i havent such a list was the answer which was true as the list had been burnt up just a short while before  at this statement the young russian frowned every ship carries such a list  still i havent any  in that case i shall have to order an inspection of the cargo  sir you are going too far said captain ponsberry sternly yet he knew he had no right to expect anything else  if i am going too far i am able to take the consequences returned the russian who was acting strictly under orders  very well sir you can look the cargo over answered captain ponsberry but i shall hold russia accountable for the outrage  the russian naval officer bowed and hastened up to the deck he spoke in his native tongue to one of the jackies who carried several small flags under his arm at once the jackie began to wigwag to the warship for further instructions  search the ship came back the order and in a few minutes more another small boat left the side of the pocastra containing an officer and a crew of eight  we are in for it now that is certain observed larry they are not going to let us go until they are sure we are o k  the second boat was soon alongside of the schooner and the officer in charge and four men came up on the deck and joined the other russians already there an earnest conversation was held between the two officers  well take a general look at the cargo said the one who had just arrived it will not do to go too farin case we find everything as it should be we want no trouble with the yankee government  captain ponsberry was asked to have the mizzen hatch opened and this work was done by luke striker and several others then two of the russian sailors were sent below and one of the officers went along  in the meantime peterson unknown to anybody on board had slipped off to the brig here he found ostag semmel in solitary confinement  semmel a russian warship is close at hand he said hurriedly an officer and some men have just boarded us  release me peterson returned the russian sailor release me and i will show captain ponsberry what i can do  you will not get me into trouble questioned peterson anxiously  no quicki am sure we can make money out of this  with an iron bar peterson pried off the lock which had been put on the door of the brig and drew back the bolt then semmel came out of his prison with his hands linked together  as he was making his way to the stern deck larry caught sight of him  stop he called out in alarm realizing what semmel might do stop semmel and he ran to capture the rascal  get out da vay roared the russian and aimed a blow at larrys head but the young second mate dodged and then caught the russian by the legs hurling him flat on his breast but now peterson came behind and gave larry a vicious kick in the side which made the youth let go his hold  whats the row there called out captain ponsberry and looked much disturbed to see the escaped prisoner put him back where he came from  help yelled semmel in russian help in the name of the czar i am a russian subject this ship is in the employ of the japanese government  he speaks the truth called out peterson also in russian help us and protect us and we will prove it and he ran forward to where the russian officer on deck was standing  you are russians asked the officer quickly  we are  then i shall certainly assist you he raised his voice let that man go and he pointed at semmel now surrounded by larry luke and cal vincent  the latter words were uttered in english so all of our friends understood them the two sailors looked inquiringly at the young second mate  he is nothing but a mutineer said larry we locked him up for it he ought to have been strung up on the yardarm he added bitterly  by this time captain ponsberry was on the scene and those who had gone below were summoned on deck once more the captain glared at semmel who lost no time in shrinking behind the russian officers for protection  i can prove the cargo on this ship belongs to the japanese government said ostag semmel my friend can prove it too he added pointing to peterson it is true we tried to seize the shipto take her to vladivostok or some other russian port as a prize  this is assuredly interesting said the leading russian officer tell me your tale in full  despite captain ponsberrys protests semmel told his story in his own way and peterson corroborated it in every detail then shamhaven thinking to curry favor came forward  they tell the strict truth he said i worked with them we did what we could for the benefit of the russian government every bit of cargo on this ship belongs to the japanese government and was to be taken ashore at nagasaki the last cargo of the columbia was also sold at nagasaki to the japanese government  when was this  about two months ago  more questions were put to semmel peterson and shamhaven and at last the russian naval officer turned grimly to captain ponsberry  i have heard their story and it will be unnecessary to make an inspection of your cargo since they have told me of what it consists in the name of russia i claim this ship as a prize of war and you and your crew must consider yourselves prisoners     chapter xiii  prisoners on the pocastra   captain ponsberry had feared the result ever since the unexpected appearance of ostag semmel so he was not very much surprised when the russian naval officer stated that he should consider the columbia as a war prize and place those on board under arrest as prisoners of war  this is a highhanded proceeding said he as calmly as possible although his mind was in a whirl  i do not think so answered the russian officer do you submit or not  since it would be useless to fight we shall have to submit answered the master of the schooner but remember i shall hold you and the russian government responsible for all you do  as you have said that before there is no use of repeating it captain ponsberry we will take command of the vessel at once  what are we going to do whispered larry to tom grandon  i dont knowfollow the old man i reckon answered the first mate  we shall place a prize crew on this ship went on the russian officer these menpointing to semmel peterson and shamhavencan remain on board the remainder of the crew and the officers will be transferred to the pocastra i will give you a quarter of an hour in which to attend to your luggage please take no more along than is necessary  this is certainly highhanded cried larry  so weve got to go over to that old coal box eh grumbled luke when he heard the news its hard luck larry  youre right luke but it cant be helped  what will they do with us  i havent the least idea  will they take us to russia  i suppose soor stow us away in one of those cold and dirty siberian prisons until we can get uncle sam to make them release us  when it came time to depart from the columbia larry was allowed to take only a bundle of clothing along and grandon and the common sailors were treated no better the captain was allowed a trunk and a suit case in the meantime semmel was questioned once more and what he had to tell made the russians look darkly at our friends  he is pumping all sorts of falsehoods into them i suppose said larry to luke and he was right semmel made it appear that captain ponsberry was really an agent of the japanese government and that he semmel had done his best to gain possession of the ship wholly for the benefit of his own country  if you really did this it is very worthy of you said one of the officers but we shall have to investigate before we accept your story in full this was not so encouraging but with it ostag semmel had to be content  fearing that a japanese warship might put in an appearance at any moment the russians lost no time in transferring the officers and men of the columbia to the pocastra and at the same time a prize crew of two officers and ten men were taken from the warship to the schooner then the sails of the columbia were hoisted and off she set to the eastward and the warship moved in the same direction  when placed aboard the pocastra captain ponsberry was treated politely and given a small room of his own but the mates and the ordinary seamen were not so fortunate grandon larry and luke striker were hustled off to a prison pen on one deck of the auxiliary cruiser and the others to another pen below which was even worse  this is certainly hard luck said larry as he threw his bundle into a corner and sat down on an iron bench while grandon and luke did the same and after we had almost reached nagasaki too  well there aint no use to cry over spilt milk came from luke were prisoners o war an i reckon as how we have got to make the best o it aint the first time weve been in sech a fix  that is true luke but it doesnt help the matter any i guess we have seen the last of the old columbia  i was afraid of this sort of thing happening ever since we left manila came from grandon i told the old man to be careful that  hush whispered larry they may be listeningto make sure that they have caught the right parties  true for you larry i wont say another word about that but it looks dismal no two ways ont and the first mate drew a mountainous sigh  the prison pen into which they had been placed was an iron structure reaching from floor to ceiling and was not over ten feet square it had a solid back and the remaining three sides were built up of stout iron bars only a couple of inches apart there was a door which was doubly locked the key being held by a petty officer who could speak broken english and who rejoiced in the simple name of rosenvischpoff for short luke nicknamed him rosey and this name stuck to him  doesnt look as if a fellow could break out of here very easily said larry after an inspection of their prison this is a regular bank vault  wouldnt do you any good to break out returned grandon as we are on the ocean where would you go to  we might hide until the vessel made a landing  humph and that would be in some russian port so youd be just as bad off  well im not trying to escape just now i want to get the lay of the land first and try to find out what they are going to do with us  from rosenvischpoff they learned that the pocastra was one of a large number of steamers of various russian lines which had been lately pressed into the service of the national navy she had been rushed through at one of the russian navy yards and provided with a battery of four small and four large guns none however over eight inches she carried a crew of one hundred and eighty men drafted principally from other warships she had an advertised speed of twenty knots an hour but rarely made over seventeen or eighteen she was old and her engines were constantly in need of repair much to the disgust of captain titorsky her commander  well rosey how goes this war asked luke pleasantly as the petty officer came around to give them something to eat  big fight all der dime answered rosenvischpoff russians kill all der japssink all der jap ships yes  youre winning right along eh  yes russians winjaps no do noddings no and the petty officer left the food on the bench and hurried away again  do you believe that asked larry  no i dont came from grandon he told us that simply to scare us or else he doesnt know the real truth  exactly what i think  these russians are a lot of blowers growled luke just look at semmel he was forever tooting his horn and yet he couldnt do much of anything  he got us into trouble said larry quickly  thats true but he had to have this warship with all on board to help him  the food which had been brought to them consisted of a big bowl of stew with three spoons and three chunks of black bread  they are going to treat us to the best said grandon sarcastically he lifted one of the spoons and tasted the stew phew its hot enough pepper garlic and hot water  does beat all how these fureigners do love their garlic grumbled luke twas the same way with them spaniards in the philippines  garlic and grease added larry and this bread is hard enough to build a wall with he continued however we have got to eat or go hungry and he partook of just enough to stay his stomach luke and grandon were not so particular and despite their grumbling managed to make away with all that remained  they saw nothing of the captain or of the sailors who had been taken below and the time hung heavily on their hands at night they were given three hammocks and these they slung from one side of the prison to the other and rested as well as could be expected the russian sailors often came to the pen to gaze at them but they had been warned not to attempt to converse with the prisoners so nothing was said  on the afternoon of the third day aboard of the pocastra those in the pen heard a loud shouting on deck followed by a rush of feet larry who was resting in the corner for the want of something better to do leaped up  something is doing he cried to his companions  here comes captain ponsberry ejaculated tom grandon  he was right the captain was coming up in company with rosenvischpoff and two sailors the russian petty officer opened the door of the pen and captain ponsberry was thrust inside then the door was locked as before  how are you boys cried the captain cordially all well i hope  we are answered grandon and you  im well enough but still angry to think that we lost the columbia  so are we angry said larry but weve got to stand it whats that noise  they have sighted a chinese junk and i reckon they are going to treat her as they did our vessel answered the captain  the noise on deck continued followed by quarter of an hour of silence then came a shot followed by a second and a third  another order to layto said larry wonder if the chinamen will give in as we did  they will if they are wise said grandon  but the chinamen did not believe in surrendering thus easily they were carrying rice for the japanese army and thought that this was known to the enemy consequently they did their best to sail away  hardly had the craft started on a new course when the pocastra opened a direct fire upon her the noise below decks was deafening and fairly shook the iron pen in which our friends were confined  hullo that sounds like real war cried larry they mean business now  one broadside was followed by another and the chinese junk was raked from end to end with such a deadly fire that more than a sixth of the sailors and officers were killed then the captain flung a white flag to the breeze in token of surrender  we have won cried those on the pocastra and it was not long before our friends understood small boats were put out and presently half a dozen chinese officers from the junk were brought on board as prisoners a fire that had started on the prize ship was put out after some hard work and then a temporary crew was put on board and the junk followed in the wake of the old columbia with the warship keeping guard over both     chapter xiv  progress of the war   an hour after the capture of the chinese junk one of the officers of the illfated craft was thrust into the prison pen with our friends  he was a small salloweyed celestial rejoicing in the name of won lung and it was soon learned that he could speak a little english he having once paid a visit to san francisco  all go up spout said he referring to his own ship tink we safe when russian gunboat come den all up spout  did they sink your ship asked captain ponsberry  no sinkshoot holes back front sideall up spout no fightee no more denall up spout the latter was his pet phrase and he used it over and over again  you were in the japanese trade  yescarry rice now russians got rice got junkall won lungs money gone up spout and the celestial made an odd little grimace  well they took my ship too  big schooner your shipee  yes  won lung weep for youall ship gone up spout samee like won lungs ship gone up spout  well we havent gone up the spout yet put in larry with a laugh let us thank fortune that we are alive and well  dat sowon lung lose fliends on junksix seven tendont know how many yet and the chinese officer shook his head sadly bad war bad  can you tell us how the war is going asked tom grandon these russians say everything is a russian victory  russians sayee dat  yesthey pretend to say they have the japs about beaten  at this won lung screwed up his eyes into mere slits  big lie dat japanese win everyting allee timee russian warships gone up spoutrussian army run likelikeup spout  after that won lung told them all he knew it was hard to understand him yet they gathered that there had been another sea fight in the vicinity of port arthur in which the russian navy had come off second best and that the japanese army that had landed in korea had driven the enemy to the northwestward over the yalu river and was now forcing them back upon liaoyang  if this news about the army is true ben and gilbert must be having a hot time of it was larrys comment i must say i am mighty glad they are on the winning side  didnt i tell ye them russians are a lot o blowers came from luke the truth aint in em half the time  perhaps they do not get the correct news from the front came from captain ponsberry the censors may keep the bad news back for fear of disheartening the rest of the men in the army and navy  they tell me the russians are very strict about sending out news rejoined larry  it is true larry no country on the globe is stricter no telegram can be sent without it is inspected and the newspapers cannot print a single scrap of news or a single editorial until after the press censor has passed upon it  if thats the case i dont wonder that some of the people want to be free  russia is more free today than she ever was before and freedom is bound to come sooner or laterthat is i mean not such freedom as we have in the united states but such freedom as they have in england and germanywhere at least a man can call his soul his own  its a wonder the russians will fight for their country if they are so ground down  they know nothing better and besides they are really patriotic if the czar would only treat them a little better and give them a little more liberty they would be the most faithful of subjects but when a man cant do at all as he wants to do and cant open his mouth about it either he is apt to grow sullen and ugly  as day after day went by life on the russian warship became almost unendurable for larry and the others they suffered greatly for the want of fresh air and at last made a vigorous protest to the captain of the ship when he happened to be passing the pen as a result orders were given that they should be allowed three hours on deck each day one in the morning and two after dinner  this is a little like said larry when coming on deck for the first time oh how good it feels to breathe fresh air once more and he filled his lungs to their fullest capacity  for their daily exercise larry and luke were chained together and the pair inspected with great curiosity as much of the warship as was allowed  its not so very different from some of our own auxiliary cruisers said larry but after all i like ours better  thats right lad stick up fer your own country every trip  well what do you say luke  i say id rather be on one of uncle sams ships than on any other in the world  while allowed to roam around on deck larry often looked eagerly for the columbia but the schooner and the chinese junk were too far off to be distinguished with the naked eye  wed give a good deal to be back on her deck wouldnt we luke said he  dont mention it lad it makes me sick grumbled the yankee tar  i wish i knew just what was being done on land dont you perhaps this war will end soon and then well be set free  it wont end yet awhile larry mark my words on that answered luke  the old yankee sailor was rightthe war was far from ended and here it may be well to note briefly what was taking place on the sea between russia and japan while the army of the mikado was pushing through manchuria in the direction of liaoyang  the loss of the great battleship petropavlovsk has already been recorded in under the mikados flag this vessel was sunk by a mine in port arthur harbor april 13 1904 and carried down with her admiral makaroff and about five hundred officers and men at the same time the battleship pobieda was also injured by a mine  the loss of the admirals flagship was a great blow to russia and while she was trying to recover port arthur was vigorously shelled by the japanese fleet and many buildings were more or less damaged some warehouses were set on fire but the local fire department aided by the russian garrison succeeded in putting out the conflagration  while the japanese fleet was hammering at the city and the ships from beyond the harbor the japanese army encircled port arthur on land taking possession of every available hill beyond the russian line of defenses as a consequence by the middle of may the city was in a complete state of siege nearly all communication with the outside world being cut off  but now came a turn in affairs which for a short while made matters look favorable for russia while the fleet of admiral togo was patrolling the whole of the southeastern coast of manchuria and protecting the japanese transports which were pouring troops into the country occurred a catastrophe as appalling as it was unexpected  on the same day may 15 the magnificent battleship hatsuse of the japanese navy was blown up by mines and sunk and the protected cruiser yoshino also of admiral togos fleet collided in the fog with a sister ship and was a total loss it is estimated that by these two disasters seven hundred men were lost among the officers who met their fate were men of marked ability which japan at this crisis could ill afford to lose  the loss of the hatsuse is worth relating in detail she had been along the coast during a heavy fog but this had cleared off and the sun was shining brightly not an enemy was in sight and all was quiet on the great battleship when without warning a terrific explosion was felt near the stern and a portion of the steering gear was damaged  we have struck a mine cried some one on board and without delay signals were hoisted for the other vessels in sight to stand by the battleship was drifting and the locality was full of mines it was a moment of terrible suspense then came another explosion greater than the first which ripped large holes through her heavy plates at once the battleship began to fill and presently she sank like a stone to the bottom of the sea the other warships put out their small boats with all speed and succeeded in rescuing about three hundred officers and men out of a total of nearly eight hundred among those lost were rearadmiral nashiba and captain nakao the commander of the warship  the yoshino was lost while steaming slowly southward after a nights vigil near the entrance to port arthur harbor other vessels of the blockading fleet were close by so each ship had to advance with extreme caution but the fog instead of lifting became thicker and at a little before two oclock in the afternoon the cruiser was rammed by the kasuga another vessel of the fleet a large hole was torn in the hull of the yoshino  out with the collision mats cried the commander of the cruiser and the mats were brought out without delay and placed over the side but the hole was too great to be stopped in that manner then the captain called the entire crew on deck and ordered the small boats to be lowered five on the starboard side and one on the port before the boats could be gotten away the yoshino listed heavily to starboard and went down smashing the five small boats under her the other boat managed to get away with only a handful of jackies and a couple of officers the captain remained on the bridge and went down with his ship as soon as possible the kasuga put out her boats and succeeded in rescuing about ninety men out of a total of over two hundred and fifty  it was a great blow to japan and the russians were correspondingly elated feeling that admiral togos grip on the sea was now weakened the russian squadron at vladivostok sailed forth and did much damage to the shipping on the northern coast of japan sinking several merchantmen and taking a number of others as prizes the russian squadron also met the japanese transport kinshiu maru having on board the 37th regiment of japanese infantry  surrender or we will sink you signaled the russian commander the japanese refused and were given exactly an hour in which to think it over as they still refused a torpedo was discharged against the doomed ship as she began to sink the japanese soldiers opened fire with their rifles and then the russians answered with their machine guns mowing down the mikados men by the score but the japanese were brave to the last and sank beneath the waves with the cry of banzai hurrah on their lips  it was an auxiliary cruiser of the vladivostok squadron which had taken the columbia and the chinese junk as prizes of war the captain of the cruiser was now looking for the rest of the squadron but so far none of the warships had been sighted  they must have returned to vladivostok he reasoned and then turned in that direction with the pocastra never dreaming of what the near future held in store for himself his ship and his crew     chapter xv  a sharp naval battle   so far the weather had been good but following the conversation recorded in the last chapter there came up a dense fog and for twentyfour hours the russian warship did nothing but creep along in the gloom  during that time for some unknown reason larry and the others were allowed greater freedom than before each had his hands chained behind him but all were separate which allowed each to roam around as he pleased  this is better than being linked to somebody else said the youth to his old sailor friend not but that we got along well enough together he added hastily  youre rightthere wasnt no sense in joinin us together answered luke we cant git away if we want to  we might if we didnt have our hands chained luke  how  if we all got together some nightproviding we could keep out of the penand stole one of the small boats  easier said nor done the guard would ketch ye an shoot ye down like a dog  oh i know there would be a great risk but i hate to think of going to a siberian prison or aboard a russian prison ship  so do i larry but even if we stole the boat and got away where would we go toespecially if we didnt have much provisions an water  larry could not answer that question since he did not know the location of the pocastra it might be that they were hundreds of miles from land if so to take to a small boat with a scarcity of water and provisions would certainly be foolhardy  the fog continued during the night but swept away as if by magic about nine oclock in the morning at that time the prisoners had had their breakfast and larry and luke were between decks looking at some gunners assistants cleaning out one of the large guns  suddenly came a call from the lookout followed by half a dozen commands as everything said was in russian our friends did not understand a word but they soon realized that something unusual was in the air a shrill whistle sounded out and drums began to beat to quarters  ill wager a new hat they have sighted a japanese ship cried larry and scarcely had he spoken when there came a dull booming over the water  let us go to the deck an see whats doing returned luke and both started for the stairs but scarcely had they appeared on the deck when they were ordered below again  larry was right a japanese warship had been sighted and this vessel had lost no time in discharging a signal gun to a sister ship only a few miles away  hardly had the youth and his friend reached the lower deck once more than the japanese cruiser opened fire on the russian vessel the latter retaliated and the booming of cannon shook the pocastra from stem to stern  this is a fight for fair ejaculated luke with a broad smile on his face  i hope the japs win luke  so do i lad but where do we come in thats what i want to know  if we could only drop overboard and swim to that other ship  no use of tryingsome of the fellows in the tops would pick us off in no time no weve got to stay right where we are an take what comes  where are the others  they looked around but could see nothing of captain ponsberry or tom grandon they saw cal vincent run past but he was out of sight before they could stop him  suddenly a crash above them told that a solid shot had struck the upper works of the russian cruiser then came another crash at the bow  those japs know how to fire came from the yankee sailor reckon as how theyre going to do their best to blow this ship skyhigh id give most a dollar to be somewhere else just about now and he shook his head anxiously  the russian gunners were working with a will and so were their numerous assistants the pocastra was swung around and now both ships were broadside to each other the thunder of the guns was terrific and the smoke rolled around in all directions  puts me in mind o the battle o manila bay eh remarked luke as he and larry stood at a distance watching the russians work one of the guns  you are right luke only  larry got no further for at that moment came another crash on deck the pocastra shivered and heaved and to those below it was as if she would surely sink  theyre pumping it into us sure as youre born sang out the old yankee tar hullo whats this  there was a rush of several gunners across the deck beware of that gun yelled one in russian and then a stampede followed  in the midst of the confusion came a fearful explosion from below a portion of the flooring was ripped apart and one of the gunners was instantly killed and several wounded a great volume of smoke rolled up and splinters and bits of iron and steel flew in all directions  both larry and luke were almost stunned by the explosion and for the moment could do nothing but clutch each other in terror both were struck by the flying splinters but neither was seriously wounded they staggered back and began to cough for the dense smoke was strangling  must have been a torpedo gasped luke  or else a magazine spluttered larry letlet us getget out of here imchokingtotodeath  it was really a magazine which had exploded this tore a goodsized hole in the pocastras side in a spot impossible to get at in the confusion in the meantime a solid eightinch shell struck the russian ship squarely in the stern doing additional damage and killing and wounding two officers and nine men  almost choked to death larry and luke crawled to where the ladder ran to the deck the russian jackies and gunners were swarming up along with all the prisoners  larry are you safe came in the voice of captain ponsberry and he loomed up with tom grandon cal vincent and the chinese petty officer beside him  so far i am answered larry but iimust have air and he began to cough  the jam on the ladder was terrific and in the midst of the mêlée a russian gunner and the chinese petty officer got into a quarrel the gunner threw the celestial down but he bounced up like a ball and in a twinkling the russian received a blow in the stomach which sent him staggering back into the crowd and the deadly smoke  no knock me up the spout sang out the celestial ship go down i go uppee and soon he was out on the upper deck  fighting surging pushing and yelling the russians and our friends got to the deck at last captain ponsberry had his coat literally ripped from his back and cal vincent had an arm almost torn from its socket for this he gave a russian gunner a rap in the mouth which knocked loose several teeth it was a case of each man for himself and many fought like wild beasts  at last larry found himself free of the crowd with luke still beside him captain ponsberry and cal vincent were not far away but between surged a great number of russians the pocastra was listing heavily to port and had evidently taken a large quantity of water into her hull  two japanese warships were now at hand and both were firing upon the doomed russian cruiser with deadly accuracy from the fighting tops of the mikados ships came a perfect hail of small bullets which sent the russians to the deck by the score by this fire one of the columbias sailors was killed and cal vincent was seriously wounded a bullet likewise grazed luke strikers thigh drawing some blood but the yankee tar did not know of this until the conflict was at an end and he saw the crimson stain on his shoe top  at last the russian captain saw that to fight further would be useless the pocastra was in danger of going down at any moment the guns could no longer be used and he ordered the colors lowered and put up a signal of surrender  a wild cheer came from the two japanese warships when it was realized that the battle was won banzai banzai rent the air over and over again hurrah for the mikado down with the russians  a little while after the fighting came to an end several small boats put off from the two japanese warships and half a dozen of the mikados naval officers presented themselves at the pocastras side the russian ship still listed heavily but after the smoke below had cleared away it was ascertained that the damage done was not as great as had been imagined one of the magazines which had been in danger of blowing up had been flooded and the rush of sea water had likewise put out a fire that had started in the stern  as soon as order could be restored on board of the pocastra a complete surrender was made to the japanese the russian captain giving up his sword then a general conference was had lasting over an hour at the end of that time much to their surprise the americans were asked to go over to one of the japanese warships  well go and glad of the chance said captain ponsberry and soon the transfer was made     chapter xvi  aboard a japanese warship   what a beauty of a ship  such was larrys exclamation as he stepped aboard of the japanese warship the vessel was like the russian prize an auxiliary cruiser and named the mimora juri she was but three years old and had been used for passenger service between japan and china for such a small cruiser she carried an unusually heavy battery and everything was shined up to the last degreethe work having been undertaken directly after the battle was over the mimora juri had suffered but little damage during the contest and only a handful of men had been killed and wounded  this looks more like uncle sams navy than anything i have seen yet said luke  well i dont know that the decorations aboard our ships are quite so fine returned the youth but then this isnt an ordinary fighting ship some of the auxiliary cruisers we used during the war with spainthose that used to be transatlantic steamerswere just as fine as this and finer  as soon as those from the columbia reached the japanese warship the wounded were taken in charge by the surgeons and placed in the sick bay as the hospital on a naval vessel is called this was also in the best of order with nice swinging cots and appliances of the latest designs  as there were many things to be arranged between the two japanese vessels and the russian prize our friends were not interviewed until late in the evening in the meantime some of the russians were made prisoners and a prize crew was placed aboard of the pocastra then the two japanese warships moved away with the captured cruiser between them  those russians must feel sick was larrys comment its worse for them in a way than if their ship had gone down  well we all thought she was sinking returned captain ponsberry if she had sunk i reckon some of us wouldnt be here to tell the tale  when evening came a guard who could speak a little english conducted captain ponsberry larry and tom grandon to the commanders cabin here they were met by captain tonkaka who being a graduate of the japanese naval school could speak not only english but also several other foreign languages it may be mentioned here that the japanese naval academy of today is one of the foremost institutions of its kind in the world  i will hear your story captain ponsberry said the japanese captain politely as he motioned his visitors to be seated  in a plain direct manner the master of the columbia told his tale starting from the time the schooner left manila with a cargo intended for the japanese government he told of the trouble with semmel and of the mutiny and then of the capture by the pocastra  you have assuredly been unfortunate said captain tonkaka have you any idea where your schooner is now  i have not but i thought she must be close to the russian shipshe and that chinese junk too the pocastra was taking them to vladivostok as prizes  ah the japanese captain mused for a moment i dare say you would like to gain back your ship he continued  indeed i would cried captain ponsberry id give a pretty dollar to do so  i shall interview the captain of the russian warship again tomorrow it may be that he will tell us where she isalthough i doubt it  after this a few questions were put to larry and tom grandon and both corroborated what captain ponsberry had said they were also questioned concerning the treatment they had received while on the pocastra  you may be thankful that the treatment was no worse said captain tonkaka of late some of the russians have treated their prisoners in a most brutal fashion  we are thankful replied the master of the columbia  the majority of the staterooms aboard of the mimora juri were occupied by the officers of the cruiser but one small room was turned over to captain ponsberry and a larger apartment was turned over to tom grandon and larry at larrys solicitation luke striker was allowed to bunk in with the first and second mates  this ere ship is jest about next to a palace was lukes comment aint seen nothing so fancy in a long time  the japanese warships were bound for the nearest naval station with their prize they could readily have made eighteen knots an hour but the crippled russian cruiser could not make over ten and so this was the rate of speed set for all three  the americans were allowed the freedom of the ship and larry and luke spent many hours in inspecting the guns and other equipments and in watching the japanese jackies in the gun and cutlass drills their physical exercises and in their drills to fight fire and to lower the small boats everything on board ran as smoothly as clockwork much to their delight  i can tell you what luke cried larry enthusiastically this beats the russians all hollow i never saw anything so well done  almost beats our own navy doesnt it  well i dont know about that but it is certainly just as good that drill to fight fire is immense and their physical exercises ought to make each mans muscles like iron  they are a sturdy lot lad no two ways about thatand they understand just how to keep themselves in the pink of condition luke rubbed his chin reflectively do ye know what i have in mind to do  i think i can make a pretty good guess came quickly from larry  well  youre thinking that youd like to join the japanese navy just to have a mixup or two with the russians  youve struck the nail on the head lad and why not seeing as how we are out here in fighting waters and with no ship of our own to go aboard  well i feel a good bit that way myself ben is in the army and so is gilbert pennington if they can make a record for themselves why shouldnt i do the same as it was i came close to joining the army with ben  so you told me before but youre a born sailor larry not a soldier  i dont deny it id rather be on board of a ship than on land any day  yes to a fellow as gets used to the sea the land seems a strange place  from the japanese on the warship who could speak english our friends learned much concerning the war they were told that admiral togos fleet was keeping a strict guard over the harbor approach to port arthur and that a portion of the japanese army was hemming in the city on the land side and had lately captured several hills of importance  from captain tonkaka the americans obtained permission to station themselves in one of the fighting tops and here they spent hour after hour on the lookout for the columbia captain ponsberry was particularly anxious to find his vessel and kept scanning the japan sea through a fine spyglass the japanese captain loaned him  if i can gain possession of that ship i am going to fix semmel and peterson said the master of the columbia  both of them declared that they took possession of the ship for the sake of the russian government said larry that being the case they should be treated as prisoners of war  exactly my idea larry  semmel is a thoroughly bad egg came from tom grandon he will lie out of his troubles if he can possibly do so  it will be a shame if we dont find the columbia again went on larry think of those rascals taking her to vladivostok and getting their share of the prize money it makes me sick  captain tonkaka tells me that other japanese warships are in this vicinity said captain ponsberry they may fall in with the schooner even if we dont but what they will do with her in that case there is no telling they might claim her as a prize also and if they did id have some trouble in getting my property back  what the japanese captain had said was true in order to counteract the doings of the russian squadron which was raiding the northern and eastern coasts of japan the mikado had sent out a flying squadron of six or seven vessels all of which though not large had good sailing powers  owing to the heavy mists the flying squadron became separated and two of the vessels fell in with the pocastra as already described of the other ships some proceeded up the coast to korea and caught two russian colliers loaded with coal and another ship carrying steel rails for the manchuria railroad the remainder of the squadron put further to sea and on the fourth day out caught sight of two russian steamers loaded with munitions of war a chase ensued lasting three days and several shots were exchanged at long range but a mist coming up one night put an end to the chase and chagrined to think that the enemy had given them the slip after all the japanese turned back once more to look for the other vessels of the flying squadron     chapter xvii  the retaking of the columbia   we are in for another storm  it was larry who made the remark he was in one of the tops with luke gazing anxiously to the westward where the black clouds were beginning to pile up  right you are ladand its going to be a heavy one unless i miss my guess  the storm broke half an hour later and the wind and rain were so furious that our friends were glad to leave the top and go below but some of the japanese sailors did not appear to mind the lashing of the elements and remained on deck as if nothing out of the ordinary was occurring  these chaps beat me said larry they are certainly as tough as pine knots i never saw their equal  im beginning to think that the japanese are a wonderful nation put in tom grandon seriously i used to look at them as something like the chinese but there is a wide difference between them and the chinks  a chinaman isnt in it alongside of a japanese came from captain ponsberry the japanese are uptodate and very progressive the chinese are about a hundred years behind the times  the storm continued for the best part of half a day there was but little thunder and lightning but the wind blew a perfect gale yet even the pocastra did not seem to mind the wind and all three of the warships proceeded on their way at only a slightly reduced rate of speed  such a gale as this will play havoc with the sailing vessels said larry i wonder how the old columbia is making out  i was thinking that same rejoined captain ponsberry to tell the truth id rather have her go to the bottom than see her taken to a russian port as a prize  when the storm cleared away larry was one of the first to go on deck to get a whiff of washed air as he called it the others followed  i see a sail cried the youth a moment later and at that instant came a cry from the lookout far to the eastward was a sailing vessel flying a signal of distress  she looks familiar to me ejaculated captain ponsberry and ran to get captain tonkakas glass one glance through the instrument was enough  the columbia  are you sure cried larry  she certainly is the columbia said tom grandon after a look through the glass she has lost her fore topmast and part of her bowsprit  and a part of the stern rail is gone added larry after he too had used the glass let us tell captain tonkaka he added starting to go below  the news that the columbia was in sight was soon circulated throughout the ship and captain tonkaka at once signaled to the other warships that he was going to her assistance then the mimora juri steamed away on her new course  as they drew closer to the schooner they could see that the storm had treated the gallant old ship roughly enough many of the sails were in ribbons and not only the fore topmast but also half a dozen of the spars were gone one end of the forecastle was stove in and a part of the stern was a wreck  this is the worst yet cried larry they must have caught more of the gale than we did  they didnt know how to handle her thats the reason of it came from captain ponsberry we have taken her through a worse blow than that eh tom  i think so answered the second mate  as soon as the japanese warship was close enough a boat was lowered and an officer went aboard of the schooner followed by several of his crew and captain ponsberry grandon and larry  the russians having the schooner in charge were meek enough as a matter of fact the gale had terrorized them and all had imagined they were surely going to the bottom of the sea they did not like it to find themselves in the hands of the enemy and were astonished when they learned that the pocastra had been captured  it was a fearful storm said the russian officer who was in charge several times i fancied the masts would all go by the board i shall never want another such experience one man was washed overboard and several were badly hurt by the wrecking of the forecastle  were any of my former men injured asked captain ponsberry  it was my fellow countryman ostag semmel who was swept overboard and drowned answered the russian officer  semmel ejaculated larry he drew a long breath and his hatred of the man died all in an instant poor chap that was rough on him  it certainly was rough answered captain ponsberry and what of the others  both peterson and shamhaven were hurt but not seriously they are below resting was the answer  it was found that some of the seams of the schooner had opened but that no alarming quantity of water was running into the well the russians were asked to surrender as prisoners of war and this they did willingly and were transferred to the japanese warship then captain ponsberry was asked if he wished to take charge of the columbia again  will a duck swim he cried of course i want to take charge hasnt she always been my ship and my crew will want to go with me i know  but the wreckage began captain tonkaka  ill attend to that sirdont you worry only give me back my ship thats all i ask  it shall be as you say captain ponsberry but when you get to nagasaki you will have to settle matters with the japanese government it is all told a rather peculiar case in one way she is now a japanese prize of war and in another way she is not  i understand and the courts will have to settle the tangle sir ill do what is fair and i know the richmond importing company will do the same  then you can go aboard of the ship as soon as you please  thank you very much  captain ponsberry had returned to the warship for just this talk and now he lost no time in getting back to the columbia taking with him all his crew including cal vincent who was just about able to get around once more  hurrah cried larry this seems like home once more doesnt it  thats what it does answered luke but there is plenty of work ahead i can tell you that lad  i dont carework will help to pass the time  when peterson and shamhaven saw captain ponsberry they did not know what to say the loss of their leader semmel had humbled them greatly  im not going to say much to you seeing as how both of you are hurt said the master of the columbia briefly but understand i want no nonsense from either of you  ill do all i can to assist you captain said shamhaven humbly all i want is another chance  which youll not get from me was the quick rejoinder i know you thoroughly shamhaven and i am done with you you and peterson aided the russians and you can now consider yourselves under arrest when we get into port im going to hand you over to the japanese authorities  both of the culprits wanted to argue but the captain would not listen their hurts were inspected and they were told that they would be allowed three days in which to recuperate after which they would have to do their share of duty  i dont like this growled shamhaven after the interview was over peterson we are in it deeper than ever  dat is so was the answer with a scowl vell ve not put up mit him hey maybe ven we git near shore we run avay shamhaven  yes if we can get the chance but i dont know where you are going to run toespecially if you havent any money  ve git money  from where  i tont know dot yet no but ve git him yes captain ponsberry must haf some and dot larry russell too vonce i see russell mit a money pelt vot haf some gold in him yes  a money belt with gold you must be dreaming  no i see him mit mine two eyes he count der gold he haf more as dirty pieces  that is worth remembering answered shamhaven and he began to speculate upon what he could do in japan if he was free and had a money belt full of gold  that larry had a money belt was true he had purchased it several years before while on shore duty in the philippines he was a saving fellow and found the belt useful in which to place his wages and the money which he occasionally received from home strange as it may seem the belt had not been taken away from him by the russians and it now contained nearly three hundred dollars the money was mostly in goldfor he had found that gold could be used no matter where he went     chapter xviii  a clever ruse   as soon as captain ponsberry was in charge of the columbia once more he set about without delay to put the schooner in proper condition for the run to nagasaki the brokenoff foremast was allowed to remain as it was but a temporary bowsprit was set into place and the damage to the forecastle and to the stern repaired a temporary rail was also nailed up so that there might be no danger of anybody slipping overboard  in all this work the sailors and the ships carpenter did their best and the captain and his mates helped sails were also sewed up or replaced and inside of fortyeight hours the old columbia was once more on her way the water taken aboard was pumped out and the pumps were kept going two hours each morning and two hours each afternoon  she will do now said the captain after the heaviest of the work was over but when we reach nagasaki ill have to put her in the dock for regular repairs i shouldnt dare to take her to manila or to san francisco in such a condition  it will take a long time to have the repairs made in japan said larry all the shipyards are busy on government work  true lad but that cannot be helped the law would not allow me to sign a crew with a ship that was not seaworthy  then well have a long layoff when we reach nagasaki  exactly larry but i shant keep you if you want to go elsewhere  not on another sailing vessel captain ponsberry but you know how it is with luke striker and myself ever since we were in our own navy we have had a hankering after warships and  and you think of joining the japanese navy put in the master of the schooner quickly  thats it you know how i spoke of joining the army with ben and gilbert  to be sureand i told you i couldnt spare you  but now if you havent any use for me any longer  why larry if you want to fight for japan go ahead and fight ejaculated captain ponsberry i dont blame you id fight myself if i was a younger man and hadnt any obligations on my shoulders i suppose ben is doing great things in the army and youd like to match him in the navy eh  if i join the navy ill do my best  will striker go with you  oh yes luke and i always go together if we can he was my chum when we fought under dewey and he has been my chum ever since  and a good fellow too larrya man with a heart of gold if it wasnt that you and tom grandon were with me i should have made him a mate long ago  i dont doubt that sirand he is worthy of it larry paused for a moment of course i dont know if they want any of us in the navy  didnt you tell me before that they had several men you had met while under dewey and some your brother walter had met while fighting in cuban waters  yes but that was some time ago  if they took those chaps then its likely they will take you nowunless of course they have all the men they wantwhich i doubt  we shall not go as ordinary jackies ben got a commission as a captain and luke thinks he might go as a gunner and i might go as an assistant gunner we occupied those positions before we left our navy  then i should certainly strike for the positions they may need gunners even if they dont need common seamen responded captain ponsberry  as fortune would have it the run to nagasaki was made without incident worthy of special mention once there was a scare on board as the water in the well hole increased with alarming rapidity but the new leak was discovered in time and the ships carpenter had little difficulty in repairing it they also sighted a vessel they thought might be a russian warship but she proved instead to be a japanese coastwise freighter carrying lumber from one port to another on the northern coast of japan  as the columbia drew closer to nagasaki both peterson and shamhaven grew more anxious over what was to become of them neither desired a term in a japanese prison and both wondered what sort of a charge captain ponsberry and the captain of the japanese warship would prefer against them  so far captain ponsberry had allowed them their liberty but through the talk of a couple of sailors they presently learned that they were to be cast into the ships brig and placed under guard as soon as the schooner dropped anchor  this looks black for us said shamhaven moodily i wish we were out of it  i haf a plan got yes answered peterson  to get away  the other nodded  then let me hear the plan by all means peterson  it vosvot you call himrisky yes maype ve get shotyou no like him no  of course i dont want to get shot but what is your plan  so soon like de ship come up by der harbor we vatch our chances an trop oferpoard yes  and swim ashore  maype ve schwim by some udder poat yes of ve got money we go to leetle poatgif jap mans money to take us avay you see now  you mean to watch for some small japanese boata bumboat eh and bribe the boatman to take us to some place of safety  you got him now yes  thats good enough if we can find the bumboat and get the money with which to do the bribing  captain ponsberry got moneyan russell he got money pelt like i told you  oh i havent forgotten about that money belt returned shamhaven and i wouldnt mind taking it if i could get my hands on it but russell must wear it most of the time  i tink he not put him on by der night dime no  what do you know about captain ponsberrys money  he got money in a leetle pagi see him vonce  how much do you think  at this peterson shrugged his shoulders  no can tell datmaype a thousand dollars  there was a pause and shamhaven drew a long breath  one thing is certain he resumed i dont intend to go to a japanese prison or an american prison either if i can help it and if we cut loose here in a strange country we are bound to need more or less money with which to get along without money a fellow cant do a thing in a strange country  we git moneychust you vait said peterson  at last the columbia came into sight of the shipping of nagasaki but it was now dark and a heavy fog was hanging over the harbor so it was impossible to make the proper landing before the next day they came to anchor and the necessary lights were hung out  this is our chance said shamhaven it is now or never  he had heard that peterson and himself were to be made close prisoners directly after supper he watched his chance and when nobody was looking motioned his confederate to leave the forecastle and steal silently toward the stern of the ship each carried a block of wood to which was attached a bit of iron to make it sink from sight  now then whispered shamhaven and threw the block he carried overboard it struck the water with a loud splash and the block carried by peterson immediately followed  hullo whats that came in the voice of tom grandon who threw something overboard  sounded like somebody jumping into the water replied captain ponsberry who was on deck with the first mate  an examination was made but in the fog and darkness nothing could be discovered  it was mighty queer was grandons comment somebody must have done it  where are shamhaven and peterson  in the forecastle i suppose do you think  i dont know what to think see if they are there  at once tom grandon ran off and made a tour not only of the forecastle but also of the forward deck he called the mens names several times and others quickly joined in the hunt  they are gone he ejaculated running back to where captain ponsberry stood  gone then it must have been them jumping overboard that we heard  like as notand they are a good bit away from the schooner by this time  bring a lantern and well take a look around  a lantern was brought and a few minutes later a small boat was lowered manned by luke and three other sailors captain ponsberry went with them and the searchers remained out the best part of an hour  theyve given us the slip clean and clear declared the master of the columbia on returning it was a risky thing to undertake in such weather as this  yes and for all we know they may be at the bottom of the harbor answered tom grandon  which place might be jest what they deserve grumbled luke striker as he helped to stow away the small boat once more     chapter xix  the disappearance of the enemy   as soon as peterson and shamhaven threw the blocks of wood overboard they darted for the companionway of the schooner and crept noiselessly down to the cabin  the apartment was deserted and the swinging lamp over the center table was turned low on the table rested several charts which captain ponsberry had been consulting before joining tom grandon on deck  it was larrys watch below and he was improving the time by taking a muchneeded nap he lay on the berth in his stateroom with the door wide open to admit the fresh air  make no noise whispered shamhaven if we are discovered the jig is up with us  russell is here yes came from peterson  shsh yesover in yonder stateroom  they closed the door leading to the companionway and then tiptoed their way to where larry lay  more than likely he keeps his money belt under his pillow when he sleeps said shamhaven wait till i find out  he shoved his hand under the headrest with caution and presently his fingers came into contact with a strip of leather and chamois he pulled on it gently but it refused to budge  lift his head a little he said and peterson started to do as requested but the movement gentle as it was caused larry to open his eyes  whawhat are you doing here stammered the young second mate when waiting for no more words peterson clapped a dirty hand over his mouth  keep still you if you no keep still i hit you good yes  confound the luck muttered shamhaven i didnt want him to know what we were up to  larry began to struggle and with an effort threw aside the hand over his mouth  lelet up he spluttered i want youhelp  shut up cried shamhaven fiercely and struck him a swinging blow in the temple another blow from peterson followed and then with flashing lights darting through his brain larry lost consciousness  both men bent over him to see if he would move when he lay as still as if dead they looked at each other with satisfaction  he wont bother us any moreat least not for awhile was shamhavens comment  quick de money belt came from peterson and as he raised up larrys head shamhaven secured it and stowed it away in the bosom of his shirt you no keep him he went on in alarm showing that he did not trust his companion in crime  well divide up afterwards said shamhaven briefly now to locate the captains little pile  both tiptoed their way into captain ponsberrys stateroom here there was a small safe with the door closed  a safe eh said shamhaven wonder if we can open it  he knelt down and tried to work the combination lock the safe was old and out of order and the captain had had the combination lock made as simple as possible in consequence soon there came a click followed by another and the bolts shot back  luck is with us cried shamhaven  dare is de leetle pag came from peterson and reaching into the safe he drew the article forth there was a slip string at the top which he pulled apart  gold he cried seedirtyforty bieces of gold and then he shut the bag again and placed it into his own shirt bosom  remember half of that is mine came sharply from shamhaven he fancied there might be more in the bag than in the money belt  yesan haf de moneypelt money ist mine yes returned peterson  right you are peterson now to get away from the ship  let us lock russell in de stateroom first  a good idea  the door was closed and locked larry still lay unconscious and there was no telling how soon he would come to his senses  they heard the tramping on the deck and the departure of the small boat now those in the boat came back and the search for the missing men came to an end  with the slyness of a pair of cats the evildoers crept up the companionway once more nobody was in sight and they crawled rather than walked to the rail of the schooner both were good swimmers and not afraid to trust themselves to reach some other shipping in the harbor yet as an extra precaution each provided himself with a lifepreserver  are you ready peterson  yes  then over we go  a small rope was handy and lowering this each slid along it into the waters of the harbor then they struck out swiftly but silently and in a few minutes the fog and darkness hid them completely from view  it was the best part of an hour before larry returned to his senses his head ached as if ready to split open and for several minutes he could not remember where he was or what had occurred  oh my head he groaned oh and he turned over and tried to sit up with the result that he pitched out on the floor of the stateroom this aroused him and he got up as quickly as he could  those rascals attacked me he muttered they struck me over the head i remember now oh how my head spinsjust as if i was in a merrygoround i wonder  he dropped on the berth and snatched away the pillow one glance was sufficient to show him how he had been robbed  thats why they attacked me he cried wonder where they are now perhaps they ran away from the ship  leaping up again he stepped to the door and finding it locked began to pound away lustily at the same time yelling at the top of his lungs in a few minutes this brought down captain ponsberry followed by luke who had been told to come along the captain fearing that something had gone wrong  whats up here demanded captain ponsberry as he flung open the door  where are they came the counterquestion from larry  they who  peterson and shamhaven  goneslid away in the fog  they have robbed me  you dont say ejaculated the master of the columbia you are sure he went on  yes my money belt is gone they came while i was asleep and when i woke up both hit meand i dont know what happened after that i just came to my senses and found myself locked in  the villains burst in luke those chaps ought to be swung up to a yardarm  the captain listened to larrys story and then was prompted to take a look around the other staterooms as a result he speedily discovered that the safe had been tampered with and that his own money was gone  they are worse rascals than i thought them said captain ponsberry bitterly i am sorry that i did not make an example of them from the start  there was a good deal of speculation concerning what had become of shamhaven and peterson and another search was instituted lasting until the following day but not a single trace of the evildoers could be found  well i am out the whole of my savings said larry to luke  its a shame lad replied the yankee tar but if you need ready cash dont fail to draw on me as long as i have a shot in the locker half on it is yours  thank you luke i know youd say that youre the proper kind of a friend to have  avast larry with your compliments wouldnt you do the same fer me  indeed i would  then it aint worth talkin about jest the same i hope we run into them rascals some day dont you  i do but more than likely theyll give the columbia and us a wide berth after this returned larry     chapter xx  larry before admiral togo   as soon as the columbia could make the proper landing captain ponsberry went ashore and reported his arrival to the authorities and also reported the escape of shamhaven and peterson the authorities had already heard of the capture of the columbia from the russians and said that the schooner would have to remain at nagasaki until the whole case could be adjusted the japanese were inclined to favor both the richmond importing company and the owners of the vessel so it was not likely that our friends would lose much in the end in the meantime the columbia could be put in a drydock and given the overhauling that she needed  we shall do all we can to locate shamhaven and peterson and get back your money said an official of the secret service department but his hands were so full with other matters of greater importance that little attention was paid to the disappearance of the two rascals  well this will tie me up at nagasaki for some time to come said captain ponsberry to larry on the third day after arriving at the japanese port  which means i suppose that i can join the japanese navy if i wish returned the young second mate quickly  i dont want to force you to leave the ship lad but you said  i know captain ponsberry and i am glad of the chance to get away luke and i have talked it over once more and yesterday we met a gunner named steve coltonhe served on the brooklyn at the time walter did he is now a gun captain on board of admiral togos flagship and he is almost certain he can get us good positions he says gunners and gunners assistants are just now badly needed  then go by all means larry and make even a bigger record for yourself than your brother ben is making in the army perhaps when this war is over youll come back to the old columbia eh  more than likely and i guess luke striker will come too  what larry had said about meeting steve colton was true as readers of a story of mine entitled fighting in cuban waters know colton had been a gun captain under commodore schley and as such had become fairly well acquainted with walter russell and had also heard of larry who was at that time serving under admiral dewey at manila  a detail from admiral togos flagship had been sent ashore at nagasaki and larry and luke as they walked through the streets had met several of these men hearing two of them speaking english they had halted the pair and introductions had followed  so you are larry russell said steve colton any relation to walter russell that once served on the u s cruiser brooklyn  walter is my brother replied larry quickly  oh so you are the chap that was cast away in the pacific and picked up by admiral deweys flagship eh  the same and this is the friend who was with me luke striker  glad to know ye both steve colton shook hands this is my friend bob stanfordhe hails from san francisco and is a gunners mate with me what are you doing in this corner of the earth  a long talk followed in which larry and luke told their story and steve colton and his friend related how they had come to join the japanese navy  its this way said colton ive got the fighting blood in my veins and it wont come out as soon as this war broke out i cut sticks from frisco with bob and we comes to tokio there i met another american who was in the navy here and it wasnt two days before we were booked for admiral togos flagship weve been down to port arthur twice and i reckon well go again before long  perhaps well go up to vladivostok next time came from bob stanford ive heard something of bombarding that russian port  colton and stanford had a couple of hours to themselves and larry and luke invited them over to the columbia in return they were asked to come over to admiral togos flagship the gunners having the privilege of bringing their friends aboard during the brief stay in nagasaki harbor  you can come aboard tomorrow said steve colton they have an inspection and drill and you can see how they do it in the japanese navynot but what its a good bit like its done on uncle sams warships  larry and luke were very willing to go aboard of the japanese warship and were taken out by colton the next day and introduced to several gunners and others who could speak a little english they were also taken before the head gunner who took them to the commander of the warship  they both served under admiral dewey at manila said the head gunner and this made the commander smile quietly as he shook hands and told them to make themselves at home  everything is as clean as a whistle was larrys comment as they walked around the forward part of the warship and through the gun decks the japs certainly know how to take care of things luke just look at how the brasswork shines  thats the way it ought to be was the yankee tars reply no slackness an im glad on it i love a clean ship above all things  steve colton and bob stanford were enthusiastic over the gun they commanded and explained how it worked it was certainly an effective weapon and larry and luke were thoroughly interested  i could handle sech a gun myself said luke an do some damage too eh larry  anyway id like to try it returned the youth  orders were now being issued for the inspection and drill and presently nearly all on board of the flagship hurried to the main deck here the marines were drawn up in long lines with the officers in their proper places the sailors and gunners were also at hand each togged out in his best for inspection by an admiral on any warship means a great deal  presently admiral togo appeared followed by several other naval officers of lesser rank he was in full dress with many decorations on his breast and carried his sword he proved to be a man well along in years with a round face and small mustache and goatee  he looks like a fighter whispered larry  true for you lad returned luke an i reckon he knows how to handle men  what our friends said about admiral togo was true he was a fighter and a born leader of men when the naval academy of japan was inaugurated he was one of the first graduates and he was sent by the government to complete his nautical education in england where during 1873 and 1874 he served on the training ship worcester making a record for himself as a firstclass pupil in every respect  on returning home togo heihachiroto use his full namefound a great task confronting his people they were becoming civilized as we term civilization and needed a modern navy he set to work with vim and vigor and then and there laid the foundation of that navy which is today known as one of the most effective in the world  the navy had scarcely come into existence when there came rumors of war with china the rumors grew and china became more and more hateful toward the japanese to the outside world it looked as if china with her vast territory and her immense number of people would swallow up the sons of nippon bodily  at last it was discovered that china was transporting troops with which to begin the war togo waited for no instructions from his home government he went at the chinese with vigor the war followed and after a number of thrilling contests the japanese were victorious and admiral togo emerged from the struggle covered with glory  he is the man to lead us to victory against the russians was the cry throughout the navy when war was declared between russia and japan and how he sent his ships to port arthur and other places and what effective work was done by them has already been related in the whole of the japanese navy to serve on the admirals flagship the mikasa was considered a great honor  the inspection and drill were exceedingly interesting to larry and luke and they watched both with close attention after it was over admiral togo addressed the men briefly and then turned to the commander of the ship  see he is pointing to us whispered luke hang me if i dont think he is talking about us to the captain  an officer is coming replied larry and a moment later one of the admirals staff came hurrying to them  are you the two americans who served under admiral dewey at manila questioned the staff officer  we are answered larry  admiral togo wishes you to come to him  oh luke we are going to be presented to the admiral cried larry  great pewter groaned the yankee tar i didnt expect this nohow but i dont care he added bracing up he aint no bigger nor dewey come along  he followed the staff officer and larry did the same they felt that the eyes of many of the sailors and marines were on them and stepped out as firmly as possible coming up to the admiral they took off their caps and saluted  admiral togo surveyed the two americans with interest he had heard how they had come to serve under dewey at manila and he smiled pleasantly as he held out his hand first to larry and then to luke  let me give you a welcome my men said he i have been told your story i hope this visit to my ship has interested you  very much sir answered luke  i liked the drill sir answered larry with a smile it was fine and everything is so clean really i dont think it could be cleaner  at this admiral togo smiled again that is a complimentsince it comes from one who has served in the american navy  he then asked them to remain where they were while some of the men went through an exercise with their cutlasses there was also a gun drill and they were asked to show how they had handled a gun during the battle of manila bay  you are well drilled i can see that said the admiral on dismissing them they tell me you think of entering our navy if you wish to do so i think likely we can find suitable openings for you     chapter xxi  letters of interest   the enlistment of larry and luke striker into the japanese navy came sooner than anticipated a new warship was being fitted out at a harbor some forty miles from nagasaki and steve colton and bob stanford were transferred to this two new gun crews were badly needed on the new ship and inside of fortyeight hours our friends had signed the muster roll and were put into training under colton the positions occupied were those of gunner and gunners mate  hurrah for nippon cried larry enthusiastically luke after this we have got to learn to yell banzai in true japanese style  this gun is a beauty replied the yankee tar as he looked the piece over i reckon as i can make her do considerable damage if i get the chance  and ill help all i can said larry wont ben and gilbert be surprised when they hear of this he added  they might know youd do something of the sort  thats so too by the way im going up to the postoffice today and see if there are any letters  much to the satisfaction of our friends they found over a score of men on the warship who could speak english some of course could speak but little yet they could make themselves understood on the other hand both larry and luke began to pick up the japanese language remarkably fast  if we keep at this for six months well be regular japanese said the youth its not so hard as i thought it would be  they found the discipline on the warship very strict and were called on to toe the mark continually yet all the officers were as considerate as they were firm so there was little of hardship  when larry called at the postoffice for letters he found two goodsized epistles awaiting him one was from his brother walter and ran in part as follows      there is nothing particularly new in this part of the     globe i am doing very well in my new business and it looks     now as if i should make a big thing of it i rather think i     am more cut out for work on land than for life on shipboard     although i dont regret the time i spent in the navy      uncle job is feeling very well these days and is building a     new wing to the old housegoing to put in a library of good     books he tells me he is as dear an old chap now as anybody     would want for an uncle      i suppose you will hear from ben and gilbert i am     expecting a letter every day its queer you didnt go with     them but i suppose the old columbia with her crew suits     you better  i am glad everything is all right at home thought larry as he finished reading the communication a new wing to the house eh uncle job must be spreading himself reckon he has found out there is something more to live for in this world than mere money  the second letter was from ben as he could tell by the handwriting it had been on the way a long time and had been sent to half a dozen places including manila there was a great deal about life in the japanese army and also a full description of the capture of liaoyang ben then continued      we are now on guard a few miles outside of the city our     camp stretches for many miles and we are doing all in our     power to strengthen our position what the next move will be     there is no telling one report is that our particular     command will help to chase the russians to mukden while     another report has it that we are to march southward to aid     in the attempt to take port arthur      i have already told you what trouble gilbert had with that     rascally russian merchant ivan snokoff and with snokoffs     confederate captain barusky of the russian army well at     liaoyang we found snokoff disguised as a chinaman and     gilbert made the fellow pay over all that was coming to him     for the richmond importing company in the attempt to     capture snokoff gilbert shot him in the leg it was only a     slight wound but the russian was as mad as a hornet and he     vowed he would get square some time he is now in the     hospital here but they expect to let him leave in a few     days he really ought to be put under arrest but as he has     paid up the money he owed there doesnt seem to be any way     of holding him its out of the question to go to court with     the case i helped gilbert to put snokoff under guard and     he is as angry at me as he is at gilbert i dont know if he     will dare to do anything or not but both of us are keeping     our eyes open  larry read this letter twice before he stowed it away he was always interested in war news and he thought the description of the great battle of liaoyang very realistic he shook his curly head when he thought of ivan snokoff  he must be an underhanded rascal if ever there was one he mused and to think he disguised himself as a chinaman ill wager gilbert thought it a fine thing to expose him and make him pay up but he and ben had better look out or snokoff and that captain barusky may cause them a lot of trouble  larry had an hour to himself and he spent the time in answering both letters telling briefly what had happened to him since the trip to manila and how he and luke were now in service on board of the japanese warship shohirika he added that he liked the position of gunners mate very much and that he meant to make a record for himself if given the opportunity to do so he also told about the doings of shamhaven and peterson and said he hoped to bring them to justice although he realized that looking for them was as bad as looking for a pearl on the ocean bottom  the letters finished he addressed and posted them and then he and luke took a short stroll through nagasaki past the many curious shops and the fine residences some of the shop windows displayed flaring war pictures done in glaring colorsall telling of tremendous japanese victories on land and sea  they certainly believe in tooting their own horn said larry with a laugh over one of the pictures just see this one lukeone japanese officer mowing down three russians with his sword  they aint no worse nor we had at home during the spanish war lad i know one picture i see o a rough rider riding down half a dozen spanish soldiers an the truth o the matter is them rough riders didnt have no horses at all but fought on foot  youre right luke well have to put all such pictures down as freaks of the artists imagination but i guess i know why some of them are put outto draw the young fellows into the army and navy  right ye are some fellers seeing a picture like that want to march to glory right offan so they go an enlist when it comes to hardtack an black coffee  hold on luke remember you are in japan here it is rice and tea  so it is larry say but i had to laugh yesterday when i see some of them jackies on board o our ship gettin out their teapots with tea  it did look funny but they do the same thing in the army so i have been told they can make the japanese soldier and sailor do everything as we do it but give up his tea  well i reckon tea is better nor rum  certainly it isand if i were an officer id let them have all the tea they wantedif they would fight any better for it  those russian sailors and soldiers drink an awful lot of vodka i should think they would try to stop that a halfdrunken sailor or soldier isnt of any account  they are so used to having it ive been told that to stop it would bring on a regular mutiny its hard to break off using a thing when you are used to it  right ye are lad a habit if it aint proper is something awful  all was bustle throughout nagasaki for several regiments of soldiers had come in bound for some transports which were to take them to manchuria banners were flying everywhere and from a distance came the music of a band  wonder how soon we will leave said larry when he and his old friend were returning to the warship now that we have enlisted id like to see some fighting  maybe well get more fighting than we want lad but id like to get into it myself continued the yankee gunner with a grin  two days more were spent at nagasaki and then on a clear morning the shohirika left the harbor and steamed off in company with two sister ships they were to join a squadron bound for the western coast of korea but where they were to go after that there was no telling  captain ponsberry came to see larry and luke off take good care of yourselves said the master of the columbia an teach them russians the lesson they deserve  we expect to do our duty answered larry  life on the japanese warship proved to be very much like life in the american navy there were hours set apart for various drills and exercises each day they had to go through the movements of handling the gun fighting with cutlasses putting out a fire and manning the small boats they also had to keep their ditty bags and grass hammocks in good order also their eating utensils and each had to do his share of cleaning up twice a week the ships surgeon examined each man to see that he was perfectly healthy  i like this keeping things clean said larry it is bound to make for good health  they tell me that japanese sailors and soldiers are among the healthiest in the world answered luke  in a few days the southern point of korea was passed and the bow of the warship was pointed toward the eastern coast of manchuria they were now getting close to the battleground and the lookout was constantly watching for the appearance of the ships of the enemy  well have a fight before very longi can feel it in my bones declared larry and he was right but before telling of that contest and what surprising results it led to we shall have to tell of something else which occurred to delight larry exceedingly     chapter xxii  a meeting and a plot   some japanese transports are coming up said larry two days later six of them and they are crowded to the rails with soldiers  i reckon we are to act as an escort to them replied luke they would need an escort if they fell in with a russian cruiser or two  the japanese transports were bound for the coast of manchuria to land near the village of petaka soon they fell in behind the shohirika and then those on the warship knew that they were going to go close to shore if not to make an actual landing  a fog came up that night which made the transports hold off but the next day was as bright and clear as before and about noon land was sighted to the westward a patrol boat was sent ahead and came back stating that all was clear for a landing then the warships went closer and the transports followed  on the following day larry found himself on shorehaving been taken along by one of the officers of the ship to interview an english merchant who wished to sell some goods to the japanese the officer could speak some english but wanted somebody along who could help him out in case he could not make himself clearly understood  the landing was at a small chinese town which was partly in ashesthe russians having tried to burn it down before leaving there were a dozen shops but all were closed and with the windows boarded up many of the chinese had fled to the country beyond and a japanese regiment was on guard to preserve order and to keep the chunchuses chinese brigands from looting the place  this shows what war will do thought larry as he walked along beside the japanese naval officer i suppose some of the chinese have lost all they possessedand through no fault of their own either  the business with the english merchant was transacted quicker than anticipated and not caring to go back to his ship at once the naval officer visited the camp of the japanese regiment taking larry with him  we expect another detachment here this afternoon said one of the regimental commanders to the naval officer they are to escort a powder train through the mountains  a little while later the detachment came in on foot looking somewhat tired and dusty from a long tramp through an exceedingly rough country as the soldiers came to a halt in the public square of the seaport village larry uttered a cry of amazement  ben  why larry can it be you came in a tone of astonishment and on the instant ben russell rushed forward and caught his brother by the hands i must be dreaming  i guess im dreaming myself said larry and gave his brother a warm hug this beats the dutch i thought you were at liaoyang how are you and how did you get here  one question at a time please returned ben with a happy smile im pretty well although i had a little dose of fever a couple of weeks ago our japanese doctor fixed me up in doublequick time our command was ordered down here to look after a powder train there was a report that either the russians or the chunchuses were going to try to capture it or blow it up now how have you been and what are you doing here i thought the old columbia was at nagasaki  you want to know as much as i do ben there was a pause and both laughed merrily they felt so happy im as sound as a fiddle the columbia is at nagasaki and likely to stay there for some time allow me to introduce myself lawrence russell gunners mate aboard of the mikados cruiser shohirika my head gunner is luke striker esquire  never burst from ben well this certainly is news so you and luke enlisted have you had any fighting  not exactly but we have seen some rough times answered larry and then as soon as ben could get away for a quiet halfhour he related his story in detail just as i have set it down in these pages  you are assuredly a lucky chap larry not to be in a russian prison this minute said his brother after the young sailor had finished  perhaps i am lucky ben but it wasnt much of luck to have that shamhaven and peterson walk off with my money belt  that is so but as the amount taken wasnt a fortune i shouldnt worry about it i can let you have any money you need  i dont need any and besides luke is acting as my banker but now tell me about yourself  there isnt very much to tell outside of what i put down in that letter you received as you know gilbert and i are both attached to this command of major okopa  where is gilbert now  his company was to bring up the rear theyll be here very shortly since the battle of liaoyang we have been on special duty looking after the pack and powder trains and have seen very little of fighting we are reinforcing our lines daily and i think the russians must be doing the same i expect some more heavy fighting soon unless winter steps in and puts a stop to everything the nights are already rather cool added ben  it was half an hour later that the company under gilbert came in having in their custody two chinese bandits that had tried to steal four horses belonging to two japanese army carts  so its really you larry cried the young southerner as he shook hands im mightily glad to see you and see you looking so well i suppose ben has told you all the news  yes and larry has been telling some too put in ben he has seen almost as much of the russians as we have and then larrys story had to be told again  i dont know where we shall go after we leave here said the young sailor are you going back to liaoyang  we dont know that either our orders are to escort the powder train wherever it may be sent said ben  for two days the japanese warship remained in the harbor of the seaport village and during that time larry managed to see quite a good deal of ben and gilbert he wished he could take them on board of the cruiser but this was not permitted  on the third day the shohirika received orders from a dispatch boat which steamed into the harbor and an hour later the anchors were hove apeak and she steamed away carrying larry and his old yankee friend along ben and gilbert stood on a dock watching her departure they waved their handkerchiefs at larry and he waved his own in return  i wonder when ill see larry again mused ben he felt rather sober at the parting from his younger brother  oh youll see him again before long answered gilbert trying to be cheerful  maybe not it all depends upon where that cruiser sails to she may go half around the world  more than likely she has been sent to take part in the bombardment of port arthur  do you really think well be sent to port arthur gilbert  it is not unlikely ben  the pair watched the cruiser fade away in the distance and then returned to that part of the village in which major okopas command had been located  by the way said gilbert as they hurried along there is one thing i forgot to tell you meeting larry drove it completely out of my mind on the way to this village we stopped at a place called wikelipe and there i met whom do you suppose  i dont know im sure  that rascal ivan snokoff he was at his same old tricksselling things to the inhabitants at exorbitant prices when he saw me he shook his fist at me and my men and then ran away and hid  why didnt you root him out gilbert  what good would it have done besides i didnt have time the fight with the brigands made us lose three hours but do you know i think snokoff has it in for me  yes and in for me too added ben he hasnt forgotten how i brought along the guard that placed him under temporary arrest  there was no time to say more for the command was to move in half an hour and both of the young captains had to round up their men for that purpose the powder train was at rest outside of the village and the men were scattered here there and everywhere  evening found the command to which ben and gilbert belonged ten miles on their way through the mountains only the officer in charge of the powder train knew the destination of the precious stores the train consisted of eighteen carts each pulled by four horses  although none in major okopas command knew it the train was followed by a chinaman named kee lung who lived in wikelipe the place where gilbert had seen ivan snokoff kee lung was well known to ivan snokoff and had been asked by the rascally russian to keep his eyes on gilbert and on ben and to report their movements he had watched gilberts meeting with ben and larry and heard something of what was said and had thus managed to make out that two of the party were brothers  as the powder train approached wikelipe kee lung went ahead to find ivan snokoff this was not difficult as he knew exactly where the latter was hiding a conference lasting an hour ensued  do as you have promised and you shall have fifty yen said ivan snokoff  you will not fail to pay queried kee lung  by the heads of my ancestors i promise it was the rascally russians answer  tis enough i shall do as i have promised returned the chinaman and he bowed himself from ivan snokoffs presence left to himself the rascally russian rubbed his hands gleefully  ha i trust he is successful he muttered to himself once pennington and russell are in the power of us russians i shall show them what it means to insult and degrade a snokoff     chapter xxiii  the attack in the dark   two days later gilbert and ben were seated in their tent talking about the meeting with larry when one of the guards came in and saluted  a messenger to see captain russell and captain pennington said the guard  show him in returned ben briefly thinking it was a simple message about camp duties he was rather surprised when a chinaman entered bowing low as he did so  dis clabtain lussell asked the newcomer  that is my name  dis clabtain plennington  yes answered gilbert  sailor man send chung wow went on the chinaman sailor man want see bloth he pointed to the two young captains sailor man say he blother you and now he pointed at ben alone  said he was my brother cried the young captain  the messenger nodded name allee same larry lussell  gracious me ejaculated ben gilbert what can this mean i thought larry sailed away on that warship  so did i but she may be back in port  sailor man hurt the chinaman pointed to his side sickhe shotsay you clome tonight  sick shot repeated ben and a cold chill went down his backbone that is the worst yet where is he  big walk down by the sea chung wow show but must paychung wow poor people  oh ill pay you answered ben hurriedly gilbert do you think i can get away  sailor man say bloth clome put in the messenger  something is wrong that is certain came from gilbert he eyed the chinaman closely there is no mistake about this  at this chung wow shrugged his lean shoulders and looked blank  no see mistakee see sailor mans  i guess he is all right put in ben something has happened to poor larry i wonder if i can get away at once  let us see the major about this  ben hurried off and caught major okopa in his own tent as the command was not to move until noon of the next day both readily obtained permission to absent themselves until that time  but be careful said the major this may be some chinese trick  well be on our guard answered ben  the chinese messenger had come in on foot he said he was hungry and was given something to eat then the three set off the messenger carrying a knapsack filled with rations and each of the young captains carrying his sword and his pistol they tried to learn from chung wow how far they would have to travel but the chinaman either could not or would not inform them  perhaps it might have been as well to have taken a detachment of one company along suggested gilbert i must say i dont like the looks of this they were now a good mile away from camp and in a location that appeared lonely enough  well we are moving down to the seacoast returned ben he was taking careful note of the direction they were pursuing  after that they journeyed along for a good two hours without saying much they stepped along briskly for ben wanted to learn just what had happened to his brother for all he knew to the contrary larry might be mortally wounded  presently they came to a spot in the road where there were a number of dense trees chung wow began to cough loudly  whats the matter demanded gilbert for some reason he did not trust the chinaman  slomthing fly in float was the answer and chung wow coughed again then he walked on and they came behind him but gilbert drew his pistol and motioned for ben to do the same  i may be mistaken but we may be walking into a trap he whispered  why gilbert i dont began ben when without warning a heavy object dropped upon his head from the limb of one of the trees and bore him to the ground another object dropped on gilbert but he squirmed from underto find himself confronted by several chunchuses a cry went up and a crashing was heard in the bushes back of the trees  a trick ben just as i suspected ejaculated the young southerner and he discharged his pistol pointblank at the chinese bandit in front of him this done he made a leap to one side hurling over chung wow as he did so and darted forward into some bushes a shot was aimed at him but did no injury and he kept on running as hard as he could  in the meantime ben did his best to get up but one man was on his shoulders and another had him by the legs so to move was next to impossible then as he continued to struggle he received a heavy kick from a wooden shoe which stretched him out like a log  he is out of the fight now said one of the chunchuses as he bent over ben go after the other do not let him escape if you can help it americans are worth a good deal to us in these days  three of the brigands remained to guard ben and the others made after gilbert but they could not catch the young southerner and after a long chase they came back  he has gone back to his camp said one of the chunchuses to his chief he will have his friends about our ears very shortly  as soon as this news was received bens hands and feet were bound and four of the chinamen caught him up as if he were a dead animal and hoisted him on their shoulders off they set at a dogtrot with the remaining brigands around them  it was the jogging over the rough mountainous road which finally brought the young captain to his senses at first he did not realize that he was on the move  gilbert he called faintly gilbert  nobody answered him and now he essayed to sit up he could not budge and consequently began to struggle  be still cried one of the chunchuses in chinese  where am i what are you doing to me queried ben  for answer he received a good shaking and was then dumped on the ground his feet were liberated and the chief of the chinese brigands ordered him to move along pointing the end of his sword at the prisoner as he did so  where is my friend asked ben  he is dead said the chief laconically  dead burst out the young captain his heart seemed to become like a lump of lead gilbert his own true chum dead it was too horrible to believe  yes and you will be unless you walk on added the chief of the chunchuses  there was no help for it and bruised and bleeding the young captain took up the march with his enemies on all sides of him the gait was a rapid one and before they came to a halt once more he was all but exhausted  where are you taking me he asked  wait and see the chief of the chunchuses grinned wickedly i shall have to trouble you for your valuables he went on in his native tongue and without further ado stripped ben of his possessions including his watch money ring and sword  there was no use protesting and therefore the young captain did not attempt it he was marched along a marshy path and presently came in sight of the ocean and a small bay where two sailing ships and a small steamer lay at anchor  a shrill whistle sounded out and this was answered by somebody on the steamer then a small boat put in to shore carrying four sailors and an officer as soon as the officer landed he was called aside by the chief of the chunchuses and a conference lasting several minutes followed  it shall be as you say ching fee said the officer in russian it is too bad you did not get the other too i know ivan snokoff and captain barusky too and there will be money in this yes ill take him on board at once you had better watch out that the soldiers do not get after you  trust ching fee to take care of himself said the chief of the chunchuses  with scant ceremony ben was conducted to the small boat and told to get in he asked where they were going to take him but could get no satisfaction as soon as the steamer was reached he was conducted to an empty stateroom and locked in  this is the worst yet he muttered as he sat down i suppose they intend to carry me miles and miles away poor gilbert i never thought he would be killed in such a fashion as this what cutthroats these chinese brigands are its a wonder they didnt kill me too can that story about larry be true  there was a little water in the stateroom and as his hands had been released ben bathed his wounds and bound them up as best he could he heard the steamer move away from the shore and soon the steady pounding of the engines proved that she was forging ahead at her best rate of speed  he was a prisoner of the enemy and what they were going to do with him was a question still to be answered     chapter xxiv  the defense of the powder train   after firing on the chinese brigands as already described gilbert plunged into the brushwood which was not over half a dozen yards distant he heard the shots discharged at him in return but fortunately every one went wide of its mark  once in the brushwood he did not stop but continued on his way for several rods then he paused wondering if ben was anywhere in the vicinity  i hope they didnt kill him he murmured what a trap that was and how easily we walked into it  he waited and listened but nobody came near him then with caution he pushed ahead until he gained once more the road leading back to the temporary camp occupied by the powder train and the detachment guarding it following this he ran on at full speed until the welcome campfires greeted him  major okopa we have been attacked by chunchuses he exclaimed as he rushed up to the officers quarters and in a brief manner he explained the situation so far as he knew it  the japanese major had taken a strong liking to gilbert and ben and he lost no time in ordering out a company to round up the chinese brigands if they could be located it was gilberts own command and he was given permission to remain out the whole night and the next day if necessary  the young southerner went at the task with vigor for he realized that every moment was precious he explained the situation to his men and they set off at doublequick to where the attack had been made  as was to be expected the spot was deserted by torchlight they saw the evidences of the struggle which had taken place in one spot was a pool of blood left by the brigand whom gilbert had shot in the shoulder  they went off in this direction said one of the soldiers who was good at tracing footsteps he pointed to a side road and along this they ran keeping eyes and ears on the alert so as to avoid anything in the nature of a surprise  two hours later the company found itself on the seashore but chunchuses and vessels were gone and to where it was impossible to find out but on the beach gilbert picked up an empty pocketbook which he knew was bens property  they brought him here most likely he said see here are the marks of a rowboat and of many feet they have gone off on the water  then the hunt is at a standstill returned his second in command  the young captain was unwilling to believe this and the remainder of the night and the next forenoon were spent in an eager search after the enemy but it was useless and at last gilbert sick at heart ordered his men to return to the camp  on the following day the powder train moved onward once more the first lieutenant of bens company took command of the body and ben was marked missing on the roll  it is certainly too bad and i sympathize with you captain pennington said major okopa captain russell is a fine fellow  it takes all the vigor out of me replied gilbert ben and i were like two brothers  but gilbert was given no time in which to grieve over bens disappearance two days later the powder train was attacked by a detachment of the russians who seemed to spring out of the very ground one of the wagons loaded with powder was blown to atoms killing two horses and three soldiers  banzai cried the japanese and when the order was given they attacked the enemy with vigor it was a hot fight lasting half an hour and the russians were driven among some high hills backed up by several mountains  as the powder train had to go through one of the mountain passes so close at hand the soldiers were sent ahead to clear the way of all russians that might appear this was dangerous work for the enemy had the advantage of the higher position but the japanese were undaunted and rushed up one slope after another with a vigor and animation that was surprising  cant hold them back when once they get started said gilbert to the major they are like our southern bloodhounds when once they strike the scent  and that is the way to win victory answered major okopa  not long after this gilbert found himself at the foot of a steep hill with his company at the top of the hill were a number of great bowlders and behind these some of the russians were in hiding sending down a spiteful fire whenever the opportunity presented itself  we must dislodge those fellows said major okopa it is very dangerous work do you think you can accomplish it captain pennington  i can try answered gilbert modestly and ordered his company forward he turned them slightly to the left for here a fringe of thin brushwood offered a shelter that was not great but much better than none  major okopa expects us to take this hill he said in the best japanese he could muster let us do our best  banzai came the rallying cry from the men and up the slope they rushed with gilbert at their side crack crack went the rifles of the russians and then without warning several shells were sent up one man of gilberts company was killed and two wounded but they did not waver passing the brushwood they ran out boldly on the slope above them  many of the rocks at the top of the hill were loose and as the japanese came closer the enemy began to send them down in a shower which was highly dangerous to those below  beware of the stones cried gilbert  he had hardly spoken when he saw that he would have to look after his own safety the russians were working over a rock that weighed several hundreds of pounds  all at once the mass broke loose there was a yell of delight from above and then the big bowlder came rolling straight for gilbert had it touched him he must surely have been crushed to death  but the young southerner was as cool as he was quick pausing to make certain which way the big stone was coming down he made a quick leap in the opposite direction then the bowlder went bounding past him to crash into some small trees at the bottom of the hill  are you hurt captain asked his lieutenant  no answered gilbert then he leaped to the front once more come he cried banzai forward for the mikado and on the whole company went as before firing rapidly as they did so the russians clung to the hilltop a few minutes longer and then as the first of the japanese gained a footing there they broke and fled in wild disorder down the other side of the hill and into the woods to the northward the japanese pursued them for two hours but could not catch them and at last the chase was abandoned in this skirmish called the battle of poyangling the japanese lost in killed and wounded four men and the russians seven three of the czars soldiers were also taken prisoners  after that the powder train had no more difficulty and four days later reached its destination which was the village of fanshen where the japanese had established something of a base of supplies for that portion of the army which was moving southward to join in the siege of port arthur at fanshen major okopas command received orders to go into camp instead of returning to the vicinity of liaoyang  this looks to me as if we were to be transferred to the army in the south said the major after communicating the news to gilbert  well i shouldnt mind helping to take port arthur returned the young southerner if you will remember it was my treatment by the russians at that place which caused me to take up arms against them  so you said before captain pennington but do not imagine that the taking of port arthur will be easy the russians have fortified it in every possible manner  yesthey were doing that before i came away from there  for months they have been strengthening their fortifications and getting in ammunition and supplies in secret their chain of forts extend so i have been told for twenty miles and more outside of the city and being in a mountainous country they will be hard to reduce  dont you think we can capture the place demanded gilbert  capture it most assuredly captain but it will mean a great destruction of life returned major okopa gravely  what the major said about the russians fortifying port arthur was true lieutenantgeneral stoessel the russian commander at that place had under him sixty thousand men the very flower of the russian army on the side of the sea the town was fortified at a dozen points only three of which had been thus far captured under the japanese army led by general nogi to the northward and the westward were some twenty defenses set among the mountains where they were next to impossible to reach  in a work of this kind it is impossible to relate in detail all of the many battles fought over the possession of port arthur the first assault was made in february by admiral togos fleet and the naval conflict was kept up for almost three months after that in the meantime a japanese army under general oku landed at pitsewo and after several battles at kinchow and nanshan hill drove the russians back to their mountain defenses and took possession of the railroad running to liaoyang and mukden thus port arthur was cut off from almost all communication with the outside world     chapter xxv  bombarding a port arthur fort   larry felt very happy after having met ben and gilbert he had been afraid he should find that his brother or his friend was wounded even though no mention of such an occurrence had been made in the letter he had received he knew from experience that ben was in the habit of making light of things that went wrong  i suppose it did your heart good to meet em both said luke after the warship was on the way  youre right luke it was a regular touch of old times  wish i had seen em myself  both wanted to be remembered to you larry paused for a moment by the way i wonder where we are bound now  cant say as to that ladsecret orders i reckon answered the old tar  the order to sail was evidently an important one for scarcely was the shohirika out of sight of land than all steam was crowded on the lookouts were also doubled and when night came the strictest watch possible was maintained  yet with it all several days passed without anything out of the ordinary happening drills and exercises went on as before and both larry and luke made themselves familiar with all parts of the warship both spent much time in familiarizing themselves with such orders as were given to them in japanese so that they might not be too green as larry termed it if put to the test  during those days spent on shipboard matters concerning the great war were moving forward steadily in the vicinity of liaoyang both the japanese and the russians made several movements to better their positions this brought on a few skirmishes and one heavy battle in which the losses were several hundreds on each side there was also an advance on the outer forts of port arthur and a fairsized hill was captured by the mikados men who however held the place only at an enormous loss of life in moving on the port the japanese found they would have to do a great amount of tunneling and entrenching all of which consumed time  on the ocean the two nations were equally active both took several prizes of war and in an encounter with the vladivostok squadron a russian warship was hopelessly disabled and a japanese cruiser was all but sunk another ship belonging to admiral togos fleet struck a mine outside of port arthur and had to be sent back to japan for repairs  so far the weather had been warm but autumn was now at hand and before long the nights became cold and raw  this war wont be finished this winter said more than one we are in for another year of it sure  the shohirika had been summoned to join the fleet patrolling before port arthur two days before that station was reached they fell in with a sister ship which brought the news of an encounter with a russian battleship carrying some troops from siberia both warships had suffered and become separated in the darkness  this war is certainly warming up said larry i hope we see some fighting before it is over  maybe well see more of it than you wish said luke grimly  dont you worrywell see a whole lot put in steve colton who was sitting on a ditty chest playing checkers with bob stanford just wait till we get under admiral togos eyehell make us be up and doing  the chance to see some of the war came the next day when they were ordered to bombard one of the forts to the north of port arthur proper as soon as they came within four miles of the fort they received a reception which was as warm as it was exciting  now here is where we show what we can do cried luke as the orders came to begin firing and the whole gun company jumped in to assist him the magazines were opened up the windlasses set to work and soon the first real shellnot a mere blank for practicingcame up and was run into the gun then the breechblock was swung to and locked the electric connection set and luke sighted the piece with care after having first received the proper distance from the rangefinders in the tops as soon as the sight was covered the button was pressed and bang went the gun with a concussion that shook the whole ship other guns followed in rapid succession until larry had to stuff cotton in his ears to keep himself from becoming deaf as soon as the gun was discharged it was opened to let the gases out and then cleaned with wet swabs and flushed with running water to cool the barrel  the bombardment lasted for an hour and during that time the fort was hit in a dozen places sand dirt and rocks flew in all directions and once there came a flash which told of an explosion of a quantity of powder  if we could only hit the magazine it would be goodby to that fort said larry but this was not to be  after the first few shots the fort had remained silent but now when the shohirika was about to retire the gunners opened up once more and a rain of shot and shell flew all around the warship one struck the bow of the vessel tearing off a few feet of the forward deck and another entered the forward turret killing one of the gunners assistants  we can be thankful we werent in that turret said luke when he received the latter news  yes indeed murmured larry and could not repress a shiver i can tell you its mighty risky work after all he added soberly  well weve got one advantage over those fellows put in colton after the firing had come to an end and the warship was fast getting out of range we can run away while they have got to stay right where they are  oh they can run away too said larry  not unless they abandon their fortand that would be just as if we should abandon our ship  the work at the gun had been severe and after the bombardment was over larry was glad to clean up and take a rest the perspiration grime and smoke had made him look like a negro and he used up several buckets of water before he got himself into as cleanly a condition as was habitual with him luke also took a scrubbing down as he called it and so did the others  what amazed larry more than anything was the quietness of the japanese sailors now that the bombardment was ended they said scarcely a word about it but went on exactly as before  they are the most matteroffact chaps i ever saw he declared i believe if the ship blew up they would say very sorry and swim away now on one of uncle sams ships the men would be all woke up and out for a jollification ben says its the same way in the army if they get excited at all they always seem to be sorry for it afterwards  thats what ye call a characteristic o the race i reckon returned luke theyre taught to act that way from babyhood it aint polite nor hightoned to git excited the only thing they kin yell is banzai an they let thet out loud enough goodness knows  i cant understand why we didnt keep at that fort came from colton i was just getting the range beautifully when orders came to shut down  well there must be a reason for it steve answered luke  there was a reason for it admiral togo had just received word that certain ships of the port arthur squadron were going to make an attempt to break out of the harbor either that night or the next day consequently the shohirika was needed further down the coast and steamed away in that direction as rapidly as her somewhat limited supply of coal permitted  i dont think the navy will ever find its way into port arthur harbor said larry later on after studying a map of that locality there are too many forts on the hills outside of the town they could smash our ships to smithereens if we got too close  trust admiral togo to know what he is doing answered steve colton he wont go too close at the same time he aint going to let the russian ships get away any more than schley and sampson let admiral cervera get away from santiago harbor in cuba  its the army that will make port arthur a hot place to live in came from bob stanford they can entrench and thus gain a little ground day by day and as soon as they win some high point like say 203meter hill it will be all up with general stoessel mark my words  the night to follow proved to be misty and so cold that the majority of the sailors were glad to don their heavy peajackets fearing that the enemy would try to take advantage of the weather admiral togo turned on all the searchlights his fleet possessed and these were flashed in all directions  false alarm said luke after midnight had sounded out on the ships bell reckon the russians dont dare to come out  but the old yankee tar was mistaken the enemy were on the alert and at three oclock when the mist was extra heavy the movement to steal out of port arthur harbor was begun two torpedo destroyers taking the lead and several cruisers following this brought on a heavy seafight lasting far into the next day and one which came close to cost larry his life     chapter xxvi  ben meets captain barusky   for several days poor ben remained a prisoner aboard of the small steamer during that time only two men came near himan under officer and the sailor who supplied him with food and water neither would answer his questions so he could not learn where he was being taken or what was to be done with him  one evening there was a slight commotion on the deck and the course of the steamer was changed then came a blowing of steam whistles lasting several minutes finally the steamer came to a standstill  you are to leave this vessel at once said the under officer as he opened the door of the young captains temporary prison come we have no time to spare  where am i to go questioned ben  you will soon learn hurry  there was no help for it and soon ben was on deck he was made to enter a small boat and was thus transferred to another steamerone which had formerly been in the east indian trade but which was now acting as a russian supply boat  what a dirty craft was his mental comment after having been thrust into a pen which was little better than a horse stall the supply boat was loaded to its fullest capacity so quarters for all on board were limited  two days passed and he received food which was scarcely fit to eat when he protested he was threatened with a flogging the air was foul and he began to fear that he would become sick  i wont be able to stand this much longer he thought dismally if they want to kill me why dont they do it at once and have done with it  on the following morning a surprise awaited him he heard two russian officers pause in front of his pen and one said to the other  here is the prisoner captain barusky  is it the fellow named russell was the question from captain barusky the rascal who had aided ivan snokoff to make so much trouble for gilbert pennington  the same  they did not capture his friend  noin the struggle he slipped away  i am sorry for that we wanted pennington more than we did this fellow but i am glad we got at least one of them as i understand it they work handinglove with each other and then the two russian officers passed on  like a flash ben realized the truth of the situation his taking off had been a trap set by snokoff and this captain barusky who had hired the chunchuses to help work out their plot he was now in the hands of the enemy in more ways than one  they wont treat me as an ordinary prisoner he reasoned this captain barusky will make it as hard as possible for memore especially so as gilbert managed to escape his clutches well i am glad gilbert got away  resolved to take the bull by the horns ben asked the prison guard if he might speak to captain barusky  i will see about it answered the sailor and went off to find out on his return he stated that the captain would visit the pen some time during the day  the russian officer came late in the afternoon when nobody else was near the pen there was a sarcastic look on his face when he gazed at the young captain  so you want to talk to me he said abruptly  i do captain barusky i want to know why this plot was laid against me  i know of no plot you are an american in the employ of the japanese government as a spy russia captures all the japanese spies she can  i am no spy  the russian shrugged his shoulders that is what your friend captain pennington once told me too yet as soon as he got out of port arthur he was made a captain in the mikados army  he applied for the position because the russians had mistreated him and because he loves active service  have it as you please russell both of you are spies and you will have to suffer as one  where are you taking me  since you seem so anxious to know i will tell you for i do not think you will be able to take the news to the japanese this boat is carrying supplies to port arthur  port arthur  that is what i said when we arrive there you will be placed in one of the strongest of our prisons at the port do you not admire the prospect  well if you take me to port arthur perhaps i shant be a prisoner long replied ben resolved to put on as bold a front as possible  and why not demanded captain barusky curiously  because our army and our navy are bound to capture the place  bah the japanese will never take port arthur it is absurd to think of it  it may not come right awaybut it will come sooner or later  never but if it should you will not be there to enjoy our downfall remember that spies are tried and if found guilty they are taken out and shot  you cannot prove that i am a spy  that remains to be seen  if you bring me before the court ill have something to say about your underhanded work with ivan snokoff i can prove that he is a swindler and that you are his accomplice  ha you threaten me roared captain barusky in a rage have a care i come from a most respectable family and i have great influence  nevertheless i think those who are higher in authority than yourself will listen to my story the russian army officers are as a rule gentlemen and strictly honest  which means to say that i am not a gentleman and not honest bellowed captain barusky that for your opinion and reaching out he gave ben a ringing box on the ear  it was the last straw with no fresh air and no food fit to eat the young captain was desperate and leaping forward he struck at the russian captains nose his fist went true and as barusky staggered back against the pen door the blood spurted from his nasal organ  dont you dare to hit me again panted ben standing before the russian with both hands clenched dont you dareor youll get the worst of it  his manner made captain barusky cower back and he glared at ben with the ferocity of a wild beast then he called to the guard  run for aid petrovitch he said the prisoner has attacked me he is a beast and must be chained up  the man addressed summoned three other sailors and the captain of the ships guard all came into the pen and forced ben into a corner  the yankee dog said the captain of the guard to dare to strike a russian officer bring the chains at once  chains were brought and soon ben was bound hands and feet with links that weighed several pounds then a large staple was driven into one of the uprights of the pen and he was fastened to this with a padlock  now place him on halfrations said captain barusky it is the only way to tame him and then he hurried away to bathe his nose which was swelling rapidly  if ben had been miserable before he was doubly so now the chains were cumbersome and cut into his flesh and being fastened to the upright he could scarcely move a foot either way to add to his misery the front of the pen was boarded over so that what little light had been admitted to his prison was cut off  in this wretched condition he passed a full week in that time captain barusky came to peep in at him three times and on each occasion tried to say something to make him still more dispirited the food was so bad he could not eat and the air often made his head ache as if it would crack open  if this is a sample of russian prison life its a wonder all the prisoners dont go mad he reasoned a few months of this would surely kill me  at the end of the week ben heard firing at a distance the supply boat was now trying to steal into port arthur and had been discovered by a japanese patrol boat the craft was struck twice and the prisoner below heard a wild commotion on the deck as one of the funnels was carried away but darkness favored the russians and inside of two hours the supply boat passed into port arthur harbor without sustaining further damage she was then directed to a proper anchorage by the harbor master and on the following day the transfer of her cargo to the storehouses on shore was begun  for several days longer ben was kept on the boat then one wet and cold morning he was liberated and told to march on deck from the vessel he was taken to a big stone building which was being used as one of the garrison quarters here he was given a scant hearing in the presence of captain barusky who appeared against him  we have no time to investigate your case at present captain russell said the officer who conducted the examination but from reports i should surmise that you are a dangerous young man you must remain a prisoner and then the young captain was taken away later on he was marched a distance of half a mile and blindfolded when the bandage was removed from his eyes he found himself in an old stone building dirty and neglected he was taken to a small room having a grated window and thrust inside six other prisoners were put into the apartment with him one man with a hacking cough dreadful to hear the door was closed and barred and all were left to take care of themselves as best they could     chapter xxvii  a fierce battle at sea   larry was taking a nap when the call came to clear the ship for action it had been discovered that the russian fleet was trying to escape from port arthur harbor and the news was flashed from vessel to vessel of admiral togos fleet and all were ordered to prevent the movement at any cost  now i reckon we are in fer it ejaculated luke as he and the youth rushed over to their gun larry its in my mind we have some tall work cut out fer us this trip  let it comei am in just the humor for fighting cried larry i hope we can smash them just as we smashed the spanish ships in manila bay  sailors and gunners were hurrying in all directions and orders were coming in rapid succession at first the russian ships had turned in one direction now they were turning in another and later still they separated a distant firing could already be heard but where it came from those on the shohirika could not tell  so far no ships of the enemy could be seen with the naked eye the lookouts kept a close watch and the flashlights continued to play all over the bosom of the rolling sea  it was almost daylight when a distant explosion was heard a russian torpedo boat had run into a mine and was so badly damaged that she sank inside of ten minutes carrying a large part of her crew with her  this disaster proved a warning to the other russian ships and they proceeded on their courses with added caution the japanese warships were equally on the alert yet just as the sun came up one brushed against a mine and received such damage that she was practically put out of the contest  there is one of the enemys ships was the cry as the mist swept away as if by magic and the sun came out strongly now is our chance banzai  and there is another ship came a moment later and one of our own pounding her as if she was a witch  guns were now booming over the water constantly and from the forts on shore came shots and shells in rapid succession soon the shohirika was in the midst of the battle and then luke and larry worked over the gun as never before doing their full share towards disabling the ship that was trying to escape up the manchurian coast  for over an hour the running fire kept up neither ship dared to put on full speed for fear of running into a mine solid shot was hurled in all directions and the shohirika received one below the water line which for the moment looked as if it might sink the craft but the ships carpenter and his crew got at the leak immediately driving in a wedge which quickly stopped the flow of water  it was hard exhausting work between decks and at the end of an hour larry felt he must have some fresh air both he and luke applied for permission to go on deck and this permission was readily granted for the guns on their side of the warship were not then in use  on the deck of the shohirika they could see what this battle really meant dirt and debris were to be seen in many places and half a dozen sailors and marines had been killed or wounded everybody was bathed in perspiration and grime and some of those who worked the big guns were panting like dogs after a chase  its work thats what it is said luke running the perspiration from his begrimed forehead with his finger aint no childs play about it  and dangerous work at that added larry he gave a look toward the enemys ships i declare luke i believe they are running back to port arthur harbor  i think the same lad responded the yankee gunner reckon they are findin it is goin to cost too much to get away as soon as they get away from them land batteries we can pound em for keeps and they know it  and get away from the mines thats the worst with fighting around hereyou dont know how soon youll hit a mine and be blown up  oh i reckon our captain is watching out fer them pesky things  larry was interested in watching the sharpshooters and rangefinders in the tops and he walked across the deck to get a better look at them luke followed and as he did so one of the nearest of the russian ships sent out a roaring broadside at the shohirika which raked her fore and aft and sent another hole through her side but this time above the water line where it did scant damage  gee christopher began luke when he chanced to glance upward larry look out he screamed the tops coming down on ye  luke was right one of the shots from the enemy had struck the foremast above the fighting top and it was crashing down carrying a portion of the ships flag with it one end struck the gun turret and then the wreckage hit larry on the shoulder hurling him on his back  the foremast was heavy and had it struck the youth before landing on the turret and the surrounding works it might have killed the young gunners mate on the spot as it was larry lay like a log where he had fallen and when luke raised him up the old tar found him unconscious  if he aint got his shoulder broke then i miss my guess muttered the yankee gunner larry larry cant ye speak to me  that was a nasty one came from one of the officers of the deck better carry him below and then the officer gave orders to remove the wreckage and hoist the flag once more  with the unconscious youth in his arms luke hurried below and to the sick bay of the warship here the surgeon got to work immediately and examined larry thoroughly  no bones broken he announced but the bruise is severe and he is suffering from shock he will soon come to his senses  luke had to return to his gun for duty is duty in the navy regardless of what is happening around one it was true the russian warships were now doing their best to sneak back into port arthur harbor and admiral togo wanted to do all the damage possible before the forts made it impossible to follow them further all of the warships guns were worked to their utmost and when the russian vessels did get back they were so badly crippled that they were of small consequence for future fighting until undergoing repairs  when larry opened his eyes again he found himself lying on a clean white cot in the ships hospital with an attendant standing over him bathing his face  oh he murmured and stared around him oh my shoulder that was a fearful crack i got  the attendant did not understand but smiled blandly and continued to bathe his face and also his head soon the full realization of what had happened came to the young gunners mate then he asked about luke  the fighting was at an end and presently luke came to him to find larry sitting up in a chair  i feel stiff and sore all over luke said the youth it was just as if a house came down on me  thank fortune you wasnt killed or didnt have your bones broken returned the yankee gunner  i am thankful were you hurt  not in the least  what about the fight  the russians have sneaked back into the harbor like a lot of whipped dogs  what is our ship doing  putting up the coast i dont know where we are going answered luke  larry remained in the ships hospital for three days and then resumed his duties as before his shoulder still felt stiff and sore and lifting anything was a good deal of labor but luke favored him so he got along very well  a week passed and the shohirika remained at sea moving in a wide circle on the lookout for russian warships or supply boats but none were encountered and then the cruiser was ordered to escort a transport filled with soldiers bound for the front  the transport landed at a point some miles north of dalny and the troops went ashore without delay they were bound for the railroad and were to participate in the advance upon port arthur from that point  as the warship remained in the harbor several days both luke and larry were allowed a short run on shore they enjoyed this trip very much until much to their surprise they learned that major okopas command was in the vicinity then they hunted this up to learn the sad news from gilbert that ben was missing  missing ejaculated larry in horror taken by chunchuses oh gilbert this is dreadful  well i dont know as you feel any worse than i do larry answered gilbert it makes me wild to think of it  but couldnt you find any trace of him at all  not the slightest although i think he was carried off in a boat  but why should the chinese brigands make him a prisoner  im sure i dont know excepting to hold him for a ransom but if they intended to do that it is likely we should have heard from them before this  the matter was discussed as long as larry and luke could remain on shore but nothing came of it and with a heavy heart the young gunners mate returned to his place on the warship     chapter xxviii  the siege of port arthur   after the fruitless effort to escape from port arthur harbor the russian warships bottled up there remained where they were for a long time to come occasionally one or another attempted to run the blockade but results were usually disastrous and at last the risk became so great nothing more was done in that direction the japanese continued to put down mines and sank several boats loaded with stone in or near the winding channel and this made getting in as hard as getting outthus putting a stop to the arrival of more supply boats such as brought ben to the seaport  in the meantime the campaign on land was pushed forward with increased activity the headquarters of the japanese army investing port arthur was not far from the railroad but the lines stretched many miles to the east and the west troops were hurried both from japan and from the divisions near liaoyang and heavy siege guns were mounted on every available hilltop the japanese were at the start at a great disadvantagethey could not see the enemy at which they were firing hills and mountains cut them off from every view of the port but they kept hammering away day after day week after week and month after month gaining steadily throwing up new intrenchments digging new tunnels and hauling their heavy guns forward to more advantageous positions the labor was body racking and the sacrifice of life enormous but the mikados soldiers did not appear to care they had set out to capture port arthur and they were going to do it  for the footsoldiers and for the cavalry there was at the start but little to do in the way of fighting most of the time was spent in digging trenches and tunnels and in keeping out of the way of shells that whistled and screamed in all directionsshells weighing hundreds of pounds which when they struck tore up the ground for yards around and smashed the rocks as if the latter were passing through a quartz crusher such is war of modern times when carried on at a distance of miles  but as the months went by and japanese and russians came closer to each other handtohand conflicts became numerous the russians contested every foot of the ground fighting with a courage that was truly heroic and sacrificing themselves freely for the czar and the country they loved the handtohand conflicts became bloody in the extreme thousands upon thousands being slaughtered between the rising and the setting of the sun  from the seacoast the command to which gilbert was attached moved to a small place called fugi klan here they went into camp for several weeks and while there were joined by a number of other commands including that containing those old soldiers of fortune dan casey and carl stummer who had served with gilbert and ben in cuba and in the philippines  py chiminy of it tont done mine heart goot to see you cabtain exclaimed carl stummer rushing up and giving gilbert a handshake how you peen annavay  first rate stummer and how are you casey  sure an its meself is as foine as a fiddle answered the irishman with a broad grin on his freckled face its a great war aint it now both soides is fightin like a pair o kilkenny cats so they are an where is me ould friend captain russell  he was captured by chunchuses  no came from both stummer and casey and then they poured in a volley of questions which were bewildering gilbert answered them as best he could  dots der vorst ding vot i hear yet alretty said carl stummer with a sad shake of his head i vish i got dem chunchusersor vot you call demhere i fix em eh tan  dan casey nodded vigorously sure an wed be after puttin a ball through ivery mothers son of em so we would poor ben russell i loiked him loike a brother and the honest irish sharpshooter heaved a long sigh  both casey and stummer had been having easy times of it for several weeks but now they were called upon to go forth with pick and shovel to do their share of work in digging intrenchments this was not so nice but they went at the labor without a murmur  sure an we might as well git into practice observed casey as he started in with vigor whin the wars over an we git back to the states it may be ourselves as will be workin fer the corporation in new york or ilsewhere  yah udder puttin town railroad dracks alretty in der vest answered carl stummer dot is he added of i tont got money enough to puy a farm  tis a stock farm im wantin came from casey wid horses galore theres money for ye carl and he went to work with added vigoras if he expected to turn up the stock farm from the soil beneath him  to gilbert even though he occasionally saw stummer and casey the days were very lonely he missed ben greatly and each day wondered if he would ever see his old war chum again major okopa saw this and did what he could to cheer up the young officer  he may turn up before you realize it said the major i dont think he was killed  if he is alive it is very strange that we do not hear from him  two days later came a batch of letters into camp written or rather painted for the most part on thin japanese paper among the communications were two for gilbert one from captain ponsberry concerning the columbia and her cargo and the other from a stranger in pekin china  who can be writing to me from pekin china mused the young captain and began to read the communication with interest it was from a chinese merchant and ran in part as follows      you will be mystified to receive this from an utter     stranger but i deem it my duty kind sir to send this word     to you      know then that one ken gow a servant of my family was     in port arthur up to sixteen days agofirst a servant in an     american family there and next a prisoner in the vilest     prison man ever saw guarded by dogs of russians unworthy to     be used as door mats ken gow is a faithful man the flower     of all my help      it is needless to explain to you why my servant was thus     illtreated but you must know that when in prison he met     your great friend captain benjamin russell and it was the     captain who saved ken gow from many hard blows from the     other prisoners who wanted not a chinaman amongst them      ken gow was grateful even as i am grateful and he     promised to get word to you of this matter if the russians     granted him his liberty finding no fault in my servant he     was after a time liberated and watching his chance left     port arthur and came home      kind sir he is grateful to captain russell and would do     much for him if he could yet his most is to send this     letter to you telling you that captain russell is alive and     held in a port arthur prison as a spy one russian hates     himhis name captain baruskyand it would appear that     this russian is also your enemy so beware of him      i can tell no more ken gow is sick from his treatment at     the hands of the russian dogs accept this miserable     assurance of my eternal friendship and esteem for one i     know must be high and illustrious            cheng mo  gilbert read the letter several times and showed it to major okopa it was written in true chinese style with a big chinese seal attached and was beyond all doubt genuine  i cant understand one thing said the young captain how did ben get to port arthur  it may be that this captain barusky had him taken there captain pennington  i thought captain barusky was at mukden  the russians have been taking in some troops at port arthur on the sly despite admiral togos efforts some supply boats and transports have passed his ships  if barusky is there he will do what he can to make ben miserable he is down on both of usfor he knows we are down on him and ivan snokoff  do you think snokoff could have anything to do with this  im sure i dont know anything is possible snokoff would be glad to make trouble for bensince he helped me to make him settle up at liaoyang those chunchuses tried to capture both of us  the matter was talked over for half an hour but brought forth no satisfaction to gilberts mind being held by the russians as a spy was as bad as being in the hands of the chinese brigands  i wish we could get into port arthur at once he said finally i shouldnt like anything better than to capture this captain barusky and liberate ben  we are bound to get into the port sooner or later answered major okopa they are bringing up more siege guns every day if the russians wont give up well batter the whole town down over their heads  which will be a bad thing for ben rejoined gilbert i dont want him killed in the attempt to rescue him     chapter xxix  from one difficulty to another   where is this going to end  it was ben who asked himself the question as he walked up and down the narrow cell in which he had been confined in the prison at port arthur  what had been written to gilbert in the letter from pekin had been substantially correct ben had aided ken gow in numerous ways and for this the chinaman had been extremely grateful and had promised to do all he could for the young captain should he manage to escape from the blockaded seaport then ken gow had disappeared one night and that was the last ben saw of him  three days later a guard entered the prison and announced that the prisoners were to be transferred to other quarters with his hands bound behind him ben was marched forth through a side street of port arthur where stood an old building which had formerly been used as a market cells had been built in this structure and into one of these he was thrust the guard sarcastically telling him to make himself as comfortable as possible  the young captain was sick in both body and mind and fast reaching that point where one becomes desperate and fit for any deed of daring more than once he was tempted to throw himself on the guard in an endeavor to overpower the fellow and escape but he realized that if caught at this he would be immediately shot down  day after day passed and from outside the prisoner heard the dull booming of cannon occasionally a shell would explode close to the prison causing a wild yell of alarm and a general rush by those outside there were flags over the prisons and over the hospitals showing what manner of places they were but as said before the japanese were at a loss to see what they were firing at so many shots and shells went where they were not intended these mishaps were what caused the report to circulate that the mikados men were not fighting according to the rules of modern warfare but were doing their best to shatter the hospitals in which lay their own and the russian wounded  it was a cold raw day with a touch of snow in the air and ben felt one of his desperate moods coming over him his hands and feet were free and he peered forth from the one narrow window that the cell contained all he could see beyond was a courtyard surrounded by a stone wall  i wish i was out thereid get over that wall somehow he muttered to himself  the cell window was not over fifteen or sixteen inches wide and twice that in height the bars were of iron but set in wooden frames but a few inches in thickness  a fellow might smash out those bars with the bench end he thought but after that what i reckon the guard in the courtyard would shoot me on sight i might try it at night  still in a desperate mood ben picked up the bench a solid affair several feet long he made an imaginary lunge at the window bars with it  ill wager i could knock them out with one blow they  ben got no further for at the moment a fearful explosion sounded somewhere overhead the explosion was followed by a crash and a wild yell of alarm a japanese shell had struck the top of the building tearing away fully a quarter of the roof and sending the bricks and timbers flying in all directions  now is my chance he muttered and without stopping to think twice he rammed the window bars as hard as he could with the bench a second and third blow followed and down went the irons carrying a portion of the window frame with them then through the opening leaped the young captain as he landed in the courtyard he picked up a small log of wood lying handy  a glance around told him that the guard was nowhere in sight the russian having run to the other side of the building to note the damage done by the shell log in hand ben leaped quickly across the courtyard and placed the bit of wood up against the wall this gave him a footing and in a twinkling he was on top of the wall  but though he acted quickly a guard from the prison building saw him and ran forth gun in hand  halt came the command in russian and then raising his weapon the guard fired at ben  the bullet whistled over the young captains head and without looking back to see who had fired it he dropped on the other side of the wall then he sprinted up the street and around a corner  ben knew not where to go but his one thought was to put distance between himself and the prison and he hurried on and on until he came to a barn which stood open into this he darted to find the building empty of occupants  the japanese had begun a general bombardment of port arthur and shot and shells were flying in all directions this being the case the majority of the troops and the inhabitants were out of sighthid away in cellars and dugouts nobody paid any attention to him and he was thus given ample time in which to think matters over and decide upon his next movement  from the barn ben moved to the building next doorwhich was a sort of dwelling and storehouse combined here from the wide open doorway he gazed at the scene of destruction before him it was full of horror and made him shiver  war is certainly a terrible thing he thought he saw some people running for their lives and beheld one man go down struck in the back by a shell then he turned away to shut out the sight  in one room of the warehouse he found an old overcoat and a slouch hat and lost no time in donning these both as a disguise and to keep himself warm then he hunted around for something to eat but could not find a mouthful  i might have known there would be no food squandered he told himself didnt they say at the prison that they were slaughtering the horses just for the meat and that butter and eggs were worth their weight in gold ill be lucky to get bread and soupespecially as i havent a dollar with which to pay for a meal  ben was about to leave the warehouse when he saw a file of russian soldiers approaching with the soldiers were two officers and as they came closer he recognized one as captain barusky  it was a bad thing to let that american escape said the captain to the other officer if you catch sight of him shoot him on the spot  which we shall do with pleasure was the ready answer and then officers and soldiers passed on  ive got to keep out of sight thats all there is to that reasoned ben grimly if they catch me again its all up with me i wonder if it would be possible to get out of port arthur gilbert got out but things werent half so closely guarded as they are now  ben waited until nightfall before leaving the warehouse then keeping a constant lookout for russian soldiers he sneaked along one street after another where to go he did not know but he realized that he must have something to eat or he would starve  presently he came to a small garden in the center of which was a neatlooking residence on the doorplate was the name nathan chase  nathan chase ben cried half aloud i wonder if that can be the gentleman gilbert knew if it is perhaps he will aid me  at first the young captain thought to ring the doorbell but fearful of meeting the wrong person he resolved to investigate in a more private manner the side windows of the residence were curtained but the curtains were only partly down going to one of the windows he peered inside  in a neatly furnished sitting room sat a young lady and a russian soldier they were arguing about somethingmoney matters as far as ben could make out the young lady did not wish to give the soldier the money and he insisted upon having it while ben gazed at the scene the russian soldier leaped up grasped the young lady by the shoulders and shook her roughly  dont screamed the young lady in english let me go  i want the money answered the soldier in his native tongue he was a cossack and of brutal features  the young lady was pretty and she was helpless and this combination was more than the young captain could resist regardless of consequences he shoved up the window and leaped inside the apartment  keep your hands off of that young lady he cried and catching the cossack by the shoulder he threw him backward dont you know how to treat a lady when you meet her you big brute  the cossack was startled first because he had not expected the interruption and secondly because he had no business to be in the mansion he gave one look at ben and then rushed out into the hallway and left the premises with all possible speed  as soon as the cossack was gone the young lady and ben stared at each other she started to speak but stopped suddenly  excuse me for coming in as i did but i thought it was necessary said the young captain i guess that fellow had no business here  you are right sir papa is away and he wanted me to give him money he must have known i was alone in the house  are you miss chase  i am but you have the advantage of me  i know it i am captain benjamin russell perhaps you know an old friend of mine gilbert pennington he knows your father i believe  oh yes i have met captain pennington they tell me he is now in the japanese army  he is ben paused and looked at the young lady keenly miss chase can i trust you he asked abruptly  what do you mean  i will tell you and in a few brief words he related his story to which grace chase listened with close attention  you were lucky to escape from that prison she cried when he had finished to be sure i will assist you as far as i can papa is away on business but i expect him back in two or three hours we havent much on hand to eat but such as there is you are welcome to  im hungry enough to eat anything said ben with a little smile  then come with me to the dining room captain russell and i will prepare supper  you havent any servants now i suppose  no every one of them has deserted us  they entered the dining room and the young lady asked ben to close the shutters while he was doing this she prepared such a meal as the larder of the house afforded it was not much but he did not complain and he thanked her warmly for giving what he felt she could ill afford to set before him  the meal finished they sat down to await the coming of mr chase while doing this ben related some of his experiences in the army and the young lady told of the horrors of the siege  one cannot understand it unless you are in the midst of it she said papa says business is at a standstill the hospitals are filled with the sick and the wounded and we are in constant dread that the next moment will be our last the suspense is so great that in one or two cases the inhabitants have gone crazy  i can well believe that miss chase during the war in the philippines i saw  ben paused as a heavy footstep sounded on the porch of the residence other footsteps followed and then came a loud knock on the door  open here demanded a voice in russian open in the name of the czar     chapter xxx  a surprise for larry   as the days passed the watch upon port arthur from the sea became closer and closer admiral togo gave strict orders that no ships should be allowed to enter or come from the harbor under any circumstances and each commander of a warship was on his mettle knowing full well that if he was derelict in his duty he would speedily hear from his superior in a manner far from pleasant  blockading became something of a monotony to larry and luke and after several weeks had passed both wished something would happen  id rather put up with a stiff sea fight than this declared the young gunners mate  right ye are lad replied the old yankee tar aint no use o bein ready for a tussle if it aint comin as it now is life in the navy aint no more excitin nor life on the old columbia  during that time larry received a letter from captain ponsberry similar in contents to that sent to gilbert the japanese government had released the cargo of the schooner and then bought the same at a good round price the ship had also been released captain ponsberry having to pay a nominal sum for this action  i think the captain is lucky to get off so easily said larry i suppose the japanese government might have scooped in everything  well the japs think it best to remain friendly to the united states answered luke and it is likely that the old sailor was more than half right  cold weather had come in earnest and work on deck was far from pleasant yet each man on the shohirika had to do his full duty as before and be it said to their credit not a sailor or marine did any shirking gun drills and various exercises were kept up constantly  one day the warship ran close to a big trading brig bound for hongkong as was the custom the brig stopped to allow the commander of the shohirika to make certain that she was not carrying contrabands of war for russia or had no intentions of running the blockade  while this examination was going on larry and luke chanced to come on deck curious to have a look at the stranger  about as big a brig as i ever see in these parts was the yankee tars comment she must carry a whopping cargo  yes and a lot of men to man her answered larry think of hoisting and furling such sails as she carries  the two vessels had come fairly close to each other and our friends continued to survey the brig with interest then larry gave a cry  oh luke i wish i had a glass  why  unless i am mistaken there is shamhaven on the deck of that ship  no  larry pointed with his hand doesnt that look like him he continued  keelhaul me if i dont think youre right lad wait ill get a glass an make certain  the old tar knew where he could borrow a glass and in a minute more he returned and both took a brief look through the instrument  it is shamhaven ejaculated larry and look there is peterson coming from the focastle  thats so what ye goin to do about it  tell the officer of the deck they shant get off with my money if i can help it  rushing away larry soon acquainted the proper officer with what he had discoveredtelling as much about the robbery as seemed necessary the officer was interested and what was even more to the point liked the young american  do you wish to go to yonder ship and confront the men he asked  try me and see answered larry excitedly i mean yes sir he stammered and will you let luke striker go too  the officer agreed and soon another small boat put off from the warship and larry and luke with the officer were speedily landed on the deck of the brig  youre a fine rascal to rob me cried larry rushing up to shamhaven and to rob captain ponsberry too  shamhaven had not expected this encounter and for the moment he was dumbstruck he gazed from larry to luke as if they were ghosts  iiwho are you anyway he stammered i dont know you he added striving to regain his composure  yes you do know me and you know luke striker too answered the young gunners mate  what does this mean asked the captain of the brig while a number of others looked on with interest  ill tell you what it means sir said larry and did so he has got to give up my money belt and my money and give up captain ponsberrys money too  at this moment peterson came up and was promptly collared by luke  stop dont you vos touch me cried peterson i aint noddings done no  you helped shamhaven to rob me came from larry  no he done it all alone i no touch noddings  oh shut up roared shamhaven in disgust i never robbed anybody if you lost your money peterson must have taken it  a quarrel ensued between the evildoers in the midst of which came a cry from the shohirika  an enemy is in sight  at once all attention was turned to the warship scarcely a minute elapsed when a signal was displayed  a battleship and she is trying to escape up the coast  to the boats roared the japanese officer on the deck of the brig to the boats at once this investigation will have to be postponed we shall expect you to remain as you arethe latter words to the captain of the big brig  as you will was the smooth answer  a rush was made for the two small boats larry and luke being hustled along with the crowd soon they put off for the warship which was already preparing to follow the russian battleship that had been seen  i didnt get my money after all grumbled the youth but perhaps ill get it laterif that ship of the enemy doesnt sink us he added  as soon as they were on board of the shohirika again the cruiser started after the battleship but the enemy had a good lead and it was some time before the japanese warship could command a full head of steam which meant everything to her then when steam was to be had in plenty there came a breakdown in the engine room causing a delay of twenty minutes  well never catch herat least not today said luke and he was right darkness found the battleship still three miles away half a dozen shots were fired at her but none took effect then night ended the pursuit  in the morning nothing was to be seen of the enemy and those on the japanese warship were much depressed for they had fancied that an encounter might add greatly to their laurels but shortly before noon the lookout announced the approach of another ship  a russian cruiser was the cry  this was correctthe vessel was the auxiliary cruiser pontomuk formerly a steamer in the siberian trade she was manned by a fierce and swarthylooking body of sailors and marines and carried a first and second battery of no mean proportions  ill wager we have got some work cut out for us now said larry and he was right finding she could not run away from the shohirika the russian auxiliary cruiser came steaming up and let drive at close rangea broadside that raked the japanese warship from end to end with deadly effect the shohirika answered immediately and both the steering wheel and the rudder were smashed on the enemys ship  phew but this is hot work panted larry as all those around the gun worked like trojans  an its going to be hotter ejaculated luke he sighted the piece with care there sally jane let her go and he pressed the electric button bang went the gun with a roar that was deafening then the breech was thrown open and the smoke rolled out filling the air with a smell that made them cough and sneeze but nobody stopped work in a trice the gun was cleaned and cooled and another shell pushed into place and then the firing was repeated  shes coming alongside was the announcement from on deck all hands to repel boarders  a handtohand fight cried larry and scarcely had the words been uttered when there came a bump that hurled half the sailors flat up they sprang and as order after order was delivered the marines and others ran for their guns and cutlasses while the officers saw to it that their pistols were ready for use  a wild maddening yell came from the deck of the russian ship as marines and sailors poured over the side an answering banzai issued from the japanese and they met the first onslaught with vigor then came a fierce tramping over the deck as the two conflicting parties moved first to one side and then the other  we are ordered up cried larry a few minutes later here is where we have got to fight for it luke  right you are lad do your best and trust to heaven for the rest was the yankee tars reply and then cutlasses in hand both mounted to the deck to engage in the fiercest handtohand encounter either of them had ever experienced     chapter xxxi  a call to repel boarders   it was a battle royal from the start and for some time neither side had an advantage pistol shot was met by pistol shot and a rifle gun placed on the upper deck of the russian warship was balanced in execution by a similar gun mounted on the shohirika the slaughter created by both weapons was frightful a dozen or more going down on either side each time a gun was discharged  when larry and luke came out on desk the spectacle was enough to make the blood of the youth run cold and it was only his previous experience in warfare which rendered him capable of doing what he knew was his duty  charge on them came the cry in japanese kill them or drive them back to their ship banzai  banzai banzai nippon was the yell hurrah for japan  the japanese had not expected a handtohand fight and the closing in of the enemy aroused them as they had never been aroused before for the first time larry saw the sailors and marines awakened to their full fighting furya fury in which every japanese scorns death and thinks that to die is glory for himself his family and his emperor they leaped on the russians with a ferocity that was appalling and that first shock sent the czars men back to the deck from which they had come  but the russians were likewise aroused and with cheers and yells they came on once more leaping over the bodies of those who had fallen and meeting shot with shot and cutlass stroke with cutlass stroke officers and men fought side by side and many went down to a common death  by instinct larry and luke kept close together with the others from lukes gun near at hand and steve colton and bob stanford not far away each used his cutlass as best he could warding off the blows of the enemy and dealing cuts whenever a chance appeared larry was glad that he had learned to use a cutlass so well and soon found himself the match of almost any russian who challenged him  the fighting was now spread over the decks of both vessels which were hooked together tightly and pounding broadside at every swell of the ocean to attempt to blow up either ship would have been fatal probably to bothone dragging down the otherso no such attempt was made  while the fighting was at its height larry suddenly found himself face to face with a russian lieutenant of marines the fellow had a pistol in his hand and as larry raised his cutlass to strike he dropped the weapon on a level with the youths head and pulled the trigger  had the bullet sped as intended it is likely larry would have been killed but just as the trigger fell luke who was at larrys side knocked the pistol to one side with his cutlass and the bullet merely grazed larrys hair then larry leaped forward and gave the russian lieutenant a thrust in the side which put the fellow out of the fight instantly  for fully fifteen minutes the battle had now raged and it was growing hotter each instant all of the available men on each ship were in the fray and the cries and yells which resounded were deafening  we certainly cant keep this fight up much longer panted larry he had a cut on his left hand and one in the shoulder but kept on with dogged determination  well we aint goin to surrender grunted luke its fight or die i guess and he leaped forward once more  two tall russians were directly in front of the old yankee gunner and both fell upon him with their cutlasses at the same instant luke was capable of warding off the weapon of one but he was no match for the pair and it speedily looked as if they would surely kill him  back with ye he yelled and swung his cutlass as rapidly as he could but they crowded him still closer and then one made a thrust at his face and another at his body  it was at this critical moment that larry who had been engaged with somebody else saw his old war chums predicament with a leap he gained lukes side and down came his cutlass with a sweeping blow on the wrist of one of the enemy the russian dropped his cutlass to the deck and staggered back his hand almost severed from his arm then luke slashed the other russian across the cheek and both of the enemy hurried back behind the other fighters  good fer you larry panted luke when he could speak they had me about cornered  these fellows certainly know how to put up a stiff fight  youre wounded yourself better go below  no im going to see it out why dont you go down yourself  it aint in me thets why answered the old yankee gunner  again came a fierce onslaught from the russians but the japanese now had another rifle gun in place and sharpshooters were crowding the fighting tops the latter picked off the russian officers and this created a momentary confusion then came a sudden order to unlock the two ships and this was done  the russian ship is going down was the yell and the news proved true an explosion below decks had torn a hole in the russian warships bottom and she began to sink rapidly  the scene was now indescribable both the russians and the japanese on the doomed vessel endeavored to reach the deck of the shohirika in this struggle the majority of the russians received the worst of it and fully fifty of them including not a few wounded remained on board when the doomed warship took her final plunge beneath the waters of the sea eighteen japanese were likewise drowned including two under officers  surrender or we will drive you over the side was the command from the japanese and utterly disheartened by the loss of their ship the russians threw down their arms and the fierce and bloody contest was at an end the common sailors were driven forward and chained together or bound with ropes and the officers were grouped near the stern where a formal surrender was made by the captain of the lost ship giving up his sword this formality over the japanese set to work at once cleaning up the deck and caring for the wounded as well as the hospital accommodations of the shohirika would permit  i never wish to see another fight like that was larrys comment when he had washed up and had his wounds dressed it was simply a slaughter  right you are lad answered luke an i reckon im agoin to carry the scars o it down to my grave the old yankee gunner had received several severe wounds and he was glad enough to have larry swing his hammock for him and lie down to rest  the battle over the captain of the shohirika sailed away to look for the big brig once more and to report to the flagship of the fleet but the brig had taken time by the forelock and left for parts unknown  i suppose that is the last of shamhaven and peterson and my money said larry when this news reached him i wish we had met that brig a week ago  oh its possible we may see her again said luke cheerfully but it gets me that she ran away unless she had something to run for  she must have been carrying some contraband of war luke  it aint unlikely lad well shes gone an it aint no use to cry over spilt milk when you write to captain ponsberry you can tell him ye saw them two rascals an thets all the good it did  do you know what im thinking  well  im thinking that brig was bound for port arthur and shell slip into that port some dark and misty night  its a risky piece o business either our ships or the mines are likely to blow her up  that is true but the russians at the port must be getting desperate and theyll most likely pay any kind of a price for supplies a captain who ran the blockade successfully could make a fortune returned larry  the young gunners mate was right in his surmise the big brig was a russian vessel in disguise and loaded to her fullest capacity with supplies for the blockaded seaport she had been fitted out at vladivostok but had taken a wide sea course so as to pretend to have set sail from nagasaki several russian shipping merchants were interested in the venture which was a private one and among the number was ivan snokoff from captain barusky snokoff had heard that fabulous prices could be obtained for needed commodities at port arthur and he had invested nearly every ruble he possessed in the enterprise if the vessel succeeded in reaching port arthur captain barusky was to undertake the disposal of the goods shipped in snokoffs name and then the two were to divide the profits  the big brig had come close to being wrecked off the coast of japan and during a gale had run down a fishing smack containing shamhaven peterson and two japanese one japanese had been drowned and the three others from the smack had been made to join the crew of the big brig this was agreeable to shamhaven and peterson who did not wish to remain near nagasaki or at any place where captain ponsberry or larry would be likely to discover them     chapter xxxii  fall of port arthurconclusion   open in the name of the czar  such was the command which startled both ben and grace chase and for the moment each gazed at the other in horror not knowing what to say or do  i must get away from here whispered the young captain but scarcely had he spoken when there came a crash and the front door of the residence swung in then half a dozen russians poured into the house  there he is as i suspected said one an officer from the prison well see that you do not escape again he added to ben grimly  in the midst of the excitement nathan chase arrived but he could do nothing for the young captain and was glad that he was left to protect his daughter  we ought also to take her said the prison official she did wrong to harbor this prisoner and then without further ado ben was marched back to the place from which he had escaped such a short while before  after that the time passed dismally enough for the young american for having run away he was put on the most miserable fare the prison afforded the food being often so vile he could not touch it whenever he attempted to protest he was met with kicks and blows  they might as well kill me and be done with it he thought oh how i wish the japs would take the city and give me back my liberty  in those days port arthur became a most uncomfortable place for all living there the japanese army was pressing forward steadily and army and navy did everything possible to destroy the shipping in the harbor and make the various forts untenable shots and shells were hurled into the city at all hours of the day and night until living there became worse than a nightmare among the soldiers scurvy became prevalent until the hospitals could not accommodate the sick and the dying nothing was done to clean up the streets and the rubbish lay many feet deep over the sidewalks practically all of the shops were closed for they had next to nothing to sell the main article of food was rice and to cook this many old buildings had to be razed in order to procure necessary firewood as winter approached the suffering of the poor became so intense that riots broke out and to maintain order not a few were shot down  such was the condition in the city outside to the northward the fighting went on week after week so many soldiers were killed upon both sides that to bury the dead became impossible and thousands were left where they had fallen to become the prey of vultures or to putrefy and fill the locality with a stench that was as nauseating as it was deadly such are the horrors of modern warfare the demands for universal peace cannot come any too quickly  in the advance on port arthur gilbert did his full share of the fighting the japanese were now struggling for the possession of what was known as 203meter hill a rocky elevation which was not fortified but which was in the direct line of russian fire the top of 203meter hill commanded a fine view of port arthur and its harbor and it was this view the japanese needed in order to make their shell fire most effective  the battle for 203meter hill is one which will be long remembered the japanese fought with a desperation impossible to describe and when the hill was captured general stoessel sent out nearly all his available men to retake it but this could not be accomplished and late in december the japanese stormed the inner defenses of the russian chain of forts killing nearly all of the brave defenders who dared to oppose them then tons upon tons of shot and shell were sent into port arthur and over the harbor once again until the locality became little short of an inferno nearly all the shipping was destroyed and so many buildings were set on fire that to stem the conflagration became all but impossible the end came on new years day 1905ten months after the famous siege began to hold out longer seemed impossible and to avoid further carnage general stoessel called a council of war and sent a message to general nogi offering to capitulate  port arthur has surrendered the news flew from one japanese regiment to another and soon the warships were sending the message from vessel to vessel for once the japanese showed their real feelings and banzai banzai rent the air again and again long life to the mikado port arthur is ours once more  it is a wellearned victory cried larry when he heard the news  yes lad and i trust it brings this bloody war to a close came from luke  they say general stoessel blew up the warships remaining in the harbor  he couldnt have had many left returned the old yankee gunner the army and the navy have about battered everything to bits and in this surmise luke was correct  the fall of port arthur caused widespread consternation in russia while the people of japan were correspondingly elated because of the gallant defense of the place the japanese made generous terms with those who had surrendered much to the satisfaction of the world at large many had predicted a universal butchery but nothing of the sort occurred and the russian sick and wounded were given every possible attention  after the fall of the port larry was permitted to go ashore some miles above the town and he managed to locate gilbert and then learned for the first time that ben was a prisoner in the captured place  a prisoner he ejaculated oh gilbert we must find him and have him released  that is just what i have been thinking but i dont know exactly how to go at it larry  there ought to be some way of doing these things we might interview one of the generals andwho is that coming this way  why its ben himself cried gilbert  ben screamed larry and ran forward to meet his brother soon they were in each others arms and then gilbert received an equally warm greeting  we were released this morning said ben i can tell you i was mighty glad of it i havent had a meal fit to eat in weeks  well you shall have the best our larder affords said gilbert my but youre a sight for sore eyes he continued  dont say a word came from larry two tears were glistening in his honest eyes its almost too good to be true                        here let me add a few words more and then bring to a close this tale of the naval and military adventures at the fall of port arthur  after the surrender of the city the army in that vicinity and also the fleet near the harbor had but little to do outside of caring for the sick and wounded and disposing of the thousands of prisoners the russian officers were allowed to go on parole and the prisoners were transported to japan many of the mines in the harbor were taken up so that ships might come and go in safety  larry was anxious to learn what had become of shamhaven and peterson and through the japanese guards stationed in port arthur located the rascally sailors at a cheap boardinghouse both were made prisoners and larry got back a portion of the money stolen from captain ponsberry and himself it was learned that the big brig had been destroyed by the japanese shell fire so that ivan snokoff lost everything he placed in the venture  well it served him right said gilbert when he heard of this he is responsible for the time ben spent in prison  what had become of captain barusky was at first a mystery but at last it was learned that he had sneaked aboard of a transport filled with wounded soldiers and bound for chefoo he pretended to be wounded himself and was given medical attention until the trick was discovered when he was treated as a coward as soon as chefoo was reached he disappeared and that was the last seen or heard of him for some time  we are well rid of that fellow said ben i hope the russians read him out of their army he isnt fit to hold a commission  what do you imagine will be the next move in this war questioned gilbert  it is hard to tell i think they will try to take mukden for one thing  russia is going to send out more warships put in larry if they come this way it may mean more fighting for me  well i reckon youll do your duty if you are put to it answered gilbert with a smile  and so will you do yours came from larry  well all try to do our duty broke in ben we didnt join the army and the navy to hang back just the same id enjoy a bit of a rest just now  the others agreed that the rest would be beneficial all around it was given to them and here for the present at least we will leave them wishing them the best of good luck in the future
