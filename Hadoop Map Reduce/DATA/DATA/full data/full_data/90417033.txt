90417033	the ballad of the white horse  by gk chesterton       prefatory note   this ballad needs no historical notes for the simple reason that it does not profess to be historical  all of it that is not frankly fictitious as in any prose romance about the past is meant to emphasize tradition rather than history king alfred is not a legend in the sense that king arthur may be a legend that is in the sense that he may possibly be a lie but king alfred is a legend in this broader and more human sense that the legends are the most important things about him   the cult of alfred was a popular cult from the darkness of the ninth century to the deepening twilight of the twentieth it is wholly as a popular legend that i deal with him here i write as one ignorant of everything except that i have found the legend of a king of wessex still alive in the land  i will give three curt cases of what i mean a tradition connects the ultimate victory of alfred with the valley in berkshire called the vale of the white horse i have seen doubts of the tradition which may be valid doubts i do not know when or where the story started it is enough that it started somewhere and ended with me for i only seek to write upon a hearsay as the old balladists did  for the second case there is a popular tale that alfred played the harp and sang in the danish camp i select it because it is a popular tale at whatever time it arose for the third case there is a popular tale that alfred came in contact with a woman and cakes i select it because it is a popular tale because it is a vulgar one  it has been disputed by grave historians who were i think a little too grave to be good judges of it the two chief charges against the story are that it was first recorded long after alfreds death and that as mr oman urges alfred never really wandered all alone without any thanes or soldiers both these objections might possibly be met it has taken us nearly as long to learn the whole truth about byron and perhaps longer to learn the whole truth about pepys than elapsed between alfred and the first writing of such tales and as for the other objection do the historians really think that alfred after wilton or napoleon after leipsic never walked about in a wood by himself for the matter of an hour or two ten minutes might be made sufficient for the essence of the story but i am not concerned to prove the truth of these popular traditions it is enough for me to maintain two things  that they are popular traditions and that without these popular traditions we should have bothered about alfred about as much as we bother about eadwig   one other consideration needs a note  alfred has come down to us in the best way that is by national legends solely for the same reason as arthur and roland and the other giants of that darkness because he fought for the christian civilization against the heathen nihilism but since this work was really done by generation after generation by the romans before they withdrew and by the britons while they remained i have summarised this first crusade in a triple symbol and given to a fictitious roman celt and saxon a part in the glory of ethandune i fancy that in fact alfreds wessex was of very mixed bloods but in any case it is the chief value of legend to mix up the centuries while preserving the sentiment to see all ages in a sort of splendid foreshortening  that is the use of tradition it telescopes history   gkc     dedication             of great limbs gone to chaos           a great face turned to night           why bend above a shapeless shroud           seeking in such archaic cloud           sight of strong lords and light            where seven sunken englands           lie buried one by one           why should one idle spade i wonder           shake up the dust of thanes like thunder           to smoke and choke the sun            in cloud of clay so cast to heaven           what shape shall man discern           these lords may light the mystery           of mastery or victory           and these ride high in history           but these shall not return            gored on the norman gonfalon           the golden dragon died           we shall not wake with ballad strings           the good time of the smaller things           we shall not see the holy kings           ride down by severn side            stiff strange and quaintly coloured           as the broidery of bayeux           the england of that dawn remains           and this of alfred and the danes           seems like the tales a whole tribe feigns           too english to be true            of a good king on an island           that ruled once on a time           and as he walked by an apple tree           there came green devils out of the sea           with seaplants trailing heavily           and tracks of opal slime            yet alfred is no fairy tale           his days as our days ran           he also looked forth for an hour           on peopled plains and skies that lower           from those few windows in the tower           that is the head of a man            but who shall look from alfreds hood           or breathe his breath alive           his century like a small dark cloud           drifts far it is an eyeless crowd           where the tortured trumpets scream aloud           and the dense arrows drive            lady by one light only           we look from alfreds eyes           we know he saw athwart the wreck           the sign that hangs about your neck           where one more than melchizedek           is dead and never dies            therefore i bring these rhymes to you           who brought the cross to me           since on you flaming without flaw           i saw the sign that guthrum saw           when he let break his ships of awe           and laid peace on the sea            do you remember when we went           under a dragon moon           and mid volcanic tints of night           walked where they fought the unknown fight           and saw black trees on the battleheight           black thorn on ethandune            and i thought i will go with you           as man with god has gone           and wander with a wandering star           the wandering heart of things that are           the fiery cross of love and war           that like yourself goes on            o go you onward where you are           shall honour and laughter be           past purpled forest and pearled foam           gods winged pavilion free to roam           your face that is a wandering home           a flying home for me            ride through the silent earthquake lands           wide as a waste is wide           across these days like deserts when           pride and a little scratching pen           have dried and split the hearts of men           heart of the heroes ride            up through an empty house of stars           being what heart you are           up

   we strayed a space from home           and saw the smokehued hamlets quaint           with westland king and westland saint           and watched the western glory faint           along the road to frome     book i the vision of the king             before the gods that made the gods           had seen their sunrise pass           the white horse of the white horse vale           was cut out of the grass            before the gods that made the gods           had drunk at dawn their fill           the white horse of the white horse vale           was hoary on the hill            age beyond age on british land           aeons on aeons gone           was peace and war in western hills           and the white horse looked on            for the white horse knew england           when there was none to know           he saw the first oar break or bend           he saw heaven fall and the world end           o god how long ago            for the end of the world was long ago           and all we dwell today           as children of some second birth           like a strange people left on earth           after a judgment day            for the end of the world was long ago           when the ends of the world waxed free           when rome was sunk in a waste of slaves           and the sun drowned in the sea            when caesars sun fell out of the sky           and whoso hearkened right           could only hear the plunging           of the nations in the night            when the ends of the earth came marching in           to torch and cresset gleam           and the roads of the world that lead to rome           were filled with faces that moved like foam           like faces in a dream            and men rode out of the eastern lands           broad river and burning plain           trees that are titan flowers to see           and tiger skies striped horribly           with tints of tropic rain            where inds enamelled peaks arise           around that inmost one           where ancient eagles on its brink           vast as archangels gather and drink           the sacrament of the sun            and men brake out of the northern lands           enormous lands alone           where a spell is laid upon life and lust           and the rain is changed to a silver dust           and the sea to a great green stone            and a shape that moveth murkily           in mirrors of ice and night           hath blanched with fear all beasts and birds           as death and a shock of evil words           blast a mans hair with white            and the cry of the palms and the purple moons           or the cry of the frost and foam           swept ever around an inmost place           and the din of distant race on race           cried and replied round rome            and there was death on the emperor           and night upon the pope           and alfred hiding in deep grass           hardened his heart with hope            a seafolk blinder than the sea           broke all about his land           but alfred up against them bare           and gripped the ground and grasped the air           staggered and strove to stand            he bent them back with spear and spade           with desperate dyke and wall           with foemen leaning on his shield           and roaring on him when he reeled           and no help came at all            he broke them with a broken sword           a little towards the sea           and for one hour of panting peace           ringed with a roar that would not cease           with golden crown and girded fleece           made laws under a tree             the northmen came about our land           a christless chivalry           who knew not of the arch or pen           great beautiful halfwitted men           from the sunrise and the sea            misshapen ships stood on the deep           full of strange gold and fire           and hairy men as huge as sin           with horned heads came wading in           through the long low seamire            our towns were shaken of tall kings           with scarlet beards like blood           the world turned empty where they trod           they took the kindly cross of god           and cut it up for wood            their souls were drifting as the sea           and all good towns and lands           they only saw with heavy eyes           and broke with heavy hands            their gods were sadder than the sea           gods of a wandering will           who cried for blood like beasts at night           sadly from hill to hill            they seemed as trees walking the earth           as witless and as tall           yet they took hold upon the heavens           and no help came at all            they bred like birds in english woods           they rooted like the rose           when alfred came to athelney           to hide him from their bows            there was not english armour left           nor any english thing           when alfred came to athelney           to be an english king            for earthquake swallowing earthquake           uprent the wessex tree           the whirlpool of the pagan sway           had swirled his sires as sticks away           when a flood smites the sea            and the great kings of wessex           wearied and sank in gore           and even their ghosts in that great stress           grew greyer and greyer less and less           with the lords that died in lyonesse           and the king that comes no more            and the god of the golden dragon           was dumb upon his throne           and the lord of the golden dragon           ran in the woods alone            and if ever he climbed the crest of luck           and set the flag before           returning as a wheel returns           came ruin and the rain that burns           and all began once more            and naught was left king alfred           but shameful tears of rage           in the island in the river           in the end of all his age            in the island in the river           he was broken to his knee           and he read writ with an iron pen           that god had wearied of wessex men           and given their country field and fen           to the devils of the sea            and he saw in a little picture           tiny and far away           his mother sitting in egberts hall           and a book she showed him very small           where a sapphire mary sat in stall           with a golden christ at play            it was wrought in the monks slow manner           from silver and sanguine shell           where the scenes are little and terrible           keyholes of heaven and hell            in the river island of athelney           with the river running past           in colours of such simple creed           all things sprang at him sun and weed           till the grass grew to be grass indeed           and the tree was a tree at last            fearfully plain the flowers grew           like the childs book to read           or like a friends face seen in a glass           he looked and there our lady was           she stood and stroked the tall live grass           as a man strokes his steed            her face was like an open word           when brave men speak and choose           the very colours of her coat           were better than good news            she spoke not nor turned not           nor any sign she cast           only she stood up straight and free           between the flowers in athelney           and the river running past            one dim ancestral jewel hung           on his ruined armour grey           he rent and cast it at her feet           where after centuries with slow feet           men came from hall and school and street           and found it where it lay            mother of god the wanderer said           i am but a common king           nor will i ask what saints may ask           to see a secret thing            the gates of heaven are fearful gates           worse than the gates of hell           not i would break the splendours barred           or seek to know the thing they guard           which is too good to tell            but for this earth most pitiful           this little land i know           if that which is for ever is           or if our hearts shall break with bliss           seeing the stranger go            when our last bow is broken queen           and our last javelin cast           under some sad green evening sky           holding a ruined cross on high           under warm westland grass to lie           shall we come home at last            and a voice came human but high up           like a cottage climbed among           the clouds or a serf of hut and croft           that sits by his hovel fire as oft           but hears on his old bare roof aloft           a belfry burst in song

any little maid that walks           in good thoughts apart           may break the guard of the three kings           and see the dear and dreadful things           i hid within my heart

blood of god           go singing to their shame            the wise men know what wicked things           are written on the sky           they trim sad lamps they touch sad strings           hearing

 like a high tide from sea            he only heard the heathen men           whose eyes are blue and bleak           singing about some cruel thing           done by a great and smiling king           in daylight on a deck            he only heard the heathen men           whose eyes are blue and blind           singing what shameful things are done           between the sunlit sea and the sun           when the land is left behind     book ii the gathering of the chiefs             up across windy wastes and up           went alfred over the shaws           shaken of the joy of giants           the joy without a cause            in the slopes away to the western bays           where blows not ever a tree           he washed his soul in the west wind           and his body in the sea            and he set to rhyme his alemeasures           and he sang aloud his laws           because of the joy of the giants           the joy without a cause            the king went gathering wessex men           as grain out of the chaff           the few that were alive to die           laughing as littered skulls that lie           after lost battles turn to the sky           an everlasting laugh            the king went gathering christian men           as wheat out of the husk           eldred the franklin by the sea           and mark the man from italy           and colan of the sacred tree           from the old tribe on usk            the rook croaked homeward heavily           the west was clear and warm           the smoke of evening food and ease           rose like a blue tree in the trees           when he came to eldreds farm            but eldreds farm was fallen awry           like an old cripples bones           and eldreds tools were red with rust           and on his well was a green crust           and purple thistles upward thrust           between the kitchen stones            but smoke of some good feasting           went upwards evermore           and eldreds doors stood wide apart           for loitering foot or labouring cart           and eldreds great and foolish heart           stood open like his door            a mighty man was eldred           a bulk for casks to fill           his face a dreaming furnace           his body a walking hill            in the old wars of wessex           his sword had sunken deep           but all his friends he signed and said           were broken about ethelred           and between the deep drink and the dead           he had fallen upon sleep            come not to me king alfred save always for the ale           why should my harmless hinds be slain           because the chiefs cry once again           as in all fights that we shall gain           and in all fights we fail            your scalds still thunder and prophesy           that crown that never comes           friend i will watch the certain things           swine and slow moons like silver rings           and the ripening of the plums            and alfred answered drinking           and gravely without blame           nor bear i boast of scald or king           the thing i bear is a lesser thing           but comes in a better name            out of the mouth of the mother of god           more than the doors of doom           i call the muster of wessex men           from grassy hamlet or ditch or den           to break and be broken god knows when           but i have seen for whom            out of the mouth of the mother of god           like a little word come i           for i go gathering christian men           from sunken paving and ford and fen           to die in a battle god knows when           by god but i know why            and this is the word of mary           the word of the worlds desire           no more of comfort shall ye get           save that the sky grows darker yet           and the sea rises higher            then silence sank and slowly           arose the sealand lord           like some vast beast for mystery           he filled the room and porch and sky           and from a cobwebbed nail on high           unhooked his heavy sword            up on the shrill seadowns and up           went alfred all alone           turning but once eer the door was shut           shouting to eldred over his butt           that he bring all spears to the woodmans hut           hewn under egberts stone            and he turned his back and broke the fern           and fought the moths of dusk           and went on his way for other friends           friends fallen of all the wide worlds ends           from rome that wrath and pardon sends           and the grey tribes on usk            he saw gigantic tracks of death           and many a shape of doom           good steadings to grey ashes gone           and a monks house white like a skeleton           in the green crypt of the combe            and in many a roman villa           earth and her ivies eat           saw coloured pavements sink and fade           in flowers and the windy colonnade           like the spectre of a street            but the cold stars clustered           among the cold pines           ere he was half on his pilgrimage           over the western lines            and the white dawn widened           ere he came to the last pine           where mark the man from italy           still made the christian sign            the long farm lay on the large hillside           flat like a painted plan           and by the side the low white house           where dwelt the southland man            a bronzed man with a birds bright eye           and a strong birds beak and brow           his skin was brown like buried gold           and of certain of his sires was told           that they came in the shining ship of old           with caesar in the prow            his fruit trees stood like soldiers           drilled in a straight line           his strange stiff olives did not fail           and all the kings of the earth drank ale           but he drank wine            wide over wasted british plains           stood never an arch or dome           only the trees to toss and reel           the tribes to bicker the beasts to squeal           but the eyes in his head were strong like steel           and his soul remembered rome            then alfred of the lonely spear           lifted his lion head           and fronted with the italians eye           asking him of his whence and why           king alfred stood and said            i am that oftdefeated king           whose failure fills the land           who fled before the danes of old           who chaffered with the danes with gold           who now upon the wessex wold           hardly has feet to stand            but out of the mouth of the mother of god           i have seen the truth like fire           thisthat the sky grows darker yet           and the sea rises higher            long looked the roman on the land           the trees as golden crowns           blazed drenched with dawn and dewempearled           while faintlier coloured freshlier curled           the clouds from underneath the world           stood up over the downs            these vines be ropes that drag me hard           he said i go not far           where would you meet for you must hold           half wiltshire and the white horse wold           and the thames bank to owsenfold           if wessex goes to war            guthrum sits strong on either bank           and you must press his lines           inwards and eastward drive him down           i doubt if you shall take the crown           till you have taken london town           for me i have the vines            if each man on the judgment day           meet god on a plain alone           said alfred i will speak for you           as for myself and call it true           that you brought all fighting folk you knew           lined under egberts stone            though i be in the dust ere then           i know where you will be           and shouldering suddenly his spear           he faded like some elfin fear           where the tall pines ran up tier on tier           tree overtoppling tree            he shouldered his spear at morning           and laughed to lay it on           but he leaned on his spear as on a staff           with might and little mood to laugh           or ever he sighted chick or calf           of colan of caerleon            for the man dwelt in a lost land           of boulders and broken men           in a great grey cave far off to the south           where a thick green forest stopped the mouth           giving darkness in his den            and the man was come like a shadow           from the shadow of druid trees           where usk with mighty murmurings           past caerleon of the fallen kings           goes out to ghostly seas            last of a race in ruin           he spoke the speech of the gaels           his kin were in holy ireland           or up in the crags of wales            but his soul stood with his mothers folk           that were of the rainwrapped isle           where patrick and brandan westerly           looked out at last on a landless sea           and the suns last smile            his harp was carved and cunning           as the celtic craftsman makes           graven all over with twisting shapes           like many headless snakes            his harp was carved and cunning           his sword prompt and sharp           and he was gay when he held the sword           sad when he held the harp            for the great gaels of ireland           are the men that god made mad           for all their wars are merry           and all their songs are sad            he kept the roman order           he made the christian sign           but his eyes grew often blind and bright           and the sea that rose in the rocks at night           rose to his head like wine            he made the sign of the cross of god           he knew the roman prayer           but he had unreason in his heart           because of the gods that were            even they that walked on the high cliffs           high as the clouds were then           gods of unbearable beauty           that broke the hearts of men            and whether in seat or saddle           whether with frown or smile           whether at feast or fight was he           he heard the noise of a nameless sea           on an undiscovered isle            lifting the great green ivy           and the great spear lowering           one said i am alfred of wessex           and i am a conquered king            and the man of the cave made answer           and his eyes were stars of scorn           and better kings were conquered           or ever your sires were born            what goddess was your mother           what fay your breed begot           that you should not die with uther           and arthur and lancelot            but when you win you brag and blow           and when you lose you rail           army of eastland yokels           not strong enough to fail            i bring not boast or railing           spake alfred not in ire           i bring of our lady a lesson set           thisthat the sky grows darker yet           and the sea rises higher            then colan of the sacred tree           tossed his black mane on high           and cried as rigidly he rose           and if the sea and sky be foes           we will tame the sea and sky            smiled alfred seek ye a fable           more dizzy and more dread           than all your mad barbarian tales           where the sky stands on its head            a tale where a man looks down on the sky           that has long looked down on him           a tale where a man can swallow a sea           that might swallow the seraphim            bring to the hut by egberts stone           all bills and bows ye have           and alfred strode off rapidly           and colan of the sacred tree           went slowly to his cave     book iii the harp of alfred             in a tree that yawned and twisted           the kings few goods were flung           a massbook mildewed line by line           and weapons and a skin of wine           and an old harp unstrung            by the yawning tree in the twilight           the king unbound his sword           severed the harp of all his goods           and there in the cool and soundless woods           sounded a single chord            then laughed and watched the finches flash           the sullen flies in swarm           and went unarmed over the hills           with the harp upon his arm            until he came to the white horse vale           and saw across the plains           in the twilight high and far and fell           like the fiery terraces of hell           the camp fires of the danes            the fires of the great army           that was made of iron men           whose lights of sacrilege and scorn           ran around england red as morn           fires over glastonbury thorn           fires out on ely fen            and as he went by white horse vale           he saw lie wan and wide           the old horse graven god knows when           by gods or beasts or what things then           walked a new world instead of men           and scrawled on the hillside            and when he came to white horse down           the great white horse was grey           for it was ill scoured of the weed           and lichen and thorn could crawl and feed           since the foes of settled house and creed           had swept old works away            king alfred gazed all sorrowful           at thistle and mosses grey           till a rally of danes with shield and bill           rolled drunk over the dome of the hill           and hearing of his harp and skill           they dragged him to their play            and as they went through the high green grass           they roared like the great green sea           but when they came to the red camp fire           they were silent suddenly            and as they went up the wastes away           they went reeling to and fro           but when they came to the red camp fire           they stood all in a row            for golden in the firelight           with a smile carved on his lips           and a beard curled right cunningly           was guthrum of the northern sea           the emperor of the ships            with three great earls king guthrum           went the rounds from fire to fire           with harold nephew of the king           and ogier of the stone and sling           and elf whose gold lute had a string           that sighed like all desire            the earls of the great army           that no men born could tire           whose flames anear him or aloof           took hold of towers or walls of proof           fire over glastonbury roof           and out on ely fire            and guthrum heard the soldiers tale           and bade the stranger play           not harshly but as one on high           on a marble pillar in the sky           who sees all folk that live and die           pigmy and far away            and alfred king of wessex           looked on his conqueror           and his hands hardened but he played           and leaving all later hates unsaid           he sang of some old british raid           on the wild west march of yore            he sang of war in the warm wet shires           where rain nor fruitage fails           where england of the motley states           deepens like a garden to the gates           in the purple walls of wales            he sang of the seas of savage heads           and the seas and seas of spears           boiling all over offas dyke           what time a wessex club could strike           the kings of the mountaineers            till harold laughed and snatched the harp           the kinsman of the king           a big youth beardless like a child           whom the new wine of war sent wild           smote and began to sing            and he cried of the ships as eagles           that circle fiercely and fly           and sweep the seas and strike the towns           from cyprus round to skye            how swiftly and with peril           they gather all good things           the high horns of the forest beasts           or the secret stones of kings            for rome was given to rule the world           and gat of it little joy           but we but we shall enjoy the world           the whole huge world a toy            great wine like blood from burgundy           cloaks like the clouds from tyre           and marble like solid moonlight           and gold like frozen fire            smells that a man might swill in a cup           stones that a man might eat           and the great smooth women like ivory           that the turks sell in the street            he sang the song of the thief of the world           and the gods that love the thief           and he yelled aloud at the cloisteryards           where men go gathering grief            well have you sung o stranger           of death on the dyke in wales           your chief was a braceletgiver           but the red unbroken river           of a race runs not for ever           but suddenly it fails            doubtless your sires were swordswingers           when they waded fresh from foam           before they were turned to women           by the god of the nails from rome            but since you bent to the shaven men           who neither lust nor smite           thunder of thor we hunt you           a hare on the mountain height            king guthrum smiled a little           and said it is enough           nephew let elf retune the string           a boy must needs like bellowing           but the old ears of a careful king           are glad of songs less rough            blueeyed was elf the minstrel           with womanish hair and ring           yet heavy was his hand on sword           though light upon the string            and as he stirred the strings of the harp           to notes but four or five           the heart of each man moved in him           like a babe buried alive            and they felt the land of the folksongs           spread southward of the dane           and they heard the good rhine flowing           in the heart of all allemagne            they felt the land of the folksongs           where the gifts hang on the tree           where the girls give ale at morning           and the tears come easily            the mighty people womanlike           that have pleasure in their pain           as he sang of balder beautiful           whom the heavens loved in vain            as he sang of balder beautiful           whom the heavens could not save           till the world was like a sea of tears           and every soul a wave            there is always a thing forgotten           when all the world goes well           a thing forgotten as long ago           when the gods forgot the mistletoe           and soundless as an arrow of snow           the arrow of anguish fell            the thing on the blind side of the heart           on the wrong side of the door           the green plant groweth menacing           almighty lovers in the spring           there is always a forgotten thing           and love is not secure            and all that sat by the fire were sad           save ogier who was stern           and his eyes hardened even to stones           as he took the harp in turn            earl ogier of the stone and sling           was odd to ear and sight           old he was but his locks were red           and jests were all the words he said           yet he was sad at board and bed           and savage in the fight            you sing of the young gods easily           in the days when you are young           but i go smelling yew and sods           and i know there are gods behind the gods           gods that are best unsung            and a man grows ugly for women           and a man grows dull with ale           well if he find in his soul at last           fury that does not fail            the wrath of the gods behind the gods           who would rend all gods and men           well if the old mans heart hath still           wheels sped of rage and roaring will           like cataracts to break down and kill           well for the old man then            while there is one tall shrine to shake           or one live man to rend           for the wrath of the gods behind the gods           who are weary to make an end            there lives one moment for a man           when the door at his shoulder shakes           when the taut rope parts under the pull           and the barest branch is beautiful           one moment while it breaks            so rides my soul upon the sea           that drinks the howling ships           though in black jest it bows and nods           under the moons with silver rods           i know it is roaring at the gods           waiting the last eclipse            and in the last eclipse the sea           shall stand up like a tower           above all moons made dark and riven           hold up its foaming head in heaven           and laugh knowing its hour            and the high ones in the happy town           propped of the planets seven           shall know a new light in the mind           a noise about them and behind           shall hear an awful voice and find           foam in the courts of heaven            and you that sit by the fire are young           and true love waits for you           but the king and i grow old grow old           and hate alone is true            and guthrum shook his head but smiled           for he was a mighty clerk           and had read lines in the latin books           when all the north was dark            he said i am older than you ogier           not all things would i rend           for whether life be bad or good           it is best to abide the end            he took the great harp wearily           even guthrum of the danes           with wide eyes bright as the one long day           on the long polar plains            for he sang of a wheel returning           and the mire trod back to mire           and how red hells and golden heavens           are castles in the fire            it is good to sit where the good tales go           to sit as our fathers sat           but the hour shall come after his youth           when a man shall know not tales but truth           and his heart fail thereat            when he shall read what is written           so plain in clouds and clods           when he shall hunger without hope           even for evil gods            for this is a heavy matter           and the truth is cold to tell           do we not know have we not heard           the soul is like a lost bird           the body a broken shell            and a man hopes being ignorant           till in white woods apart           he finds at last the lost bird dead           and a man may still lift up his head           but never more his heart            there comes no noise but weeping           out of the ancient sky           and a tear is in the tiniest flower           because the gods must die            the little brooks are very sweet           like a girls ribbons curled           but the great sea is bitter           that washes all the world            strong are the roman roses           or the free flowers of the heath           but every flower like a flower of the sea           smelleth with the salt of death            and the heart of the locked battle           is the happiest place for men           when shrieking souls as shafts go by           and many have died and all may die           though this word be a mystery           death is most distant then            death blazes bright above the cup           and clear above the crown           but in that dream of battle           we seem to tread it down            wherefore i am a great king           and waste the world in vain           because man hath not other power           save that in dealing death for dower           he may forget it for an hour           to remember it again            and slowly his hands and thoughtfully           fell from the lifted lyre           and the owls moaned from the mighty trees           till alfred caught it to his knees           and smote it as in ire            he heaved the head of the harp on high           and swept the framework barred           and his stroke had all the rattle and spark           of horses flying hard            when god put man in a garden           he girt him with a sword           and sent him forth a free knight           that might betray his lord            he brake him and betrayed him           and fast and far he fell           till you and i may stretch our necks           and burn our beards in hell            but though i lie on the floor of the world           with the seven sins for rods           i would rather fall with adam           than rise with all your gods            what have the strong gods given           where have the glad gods led           when guthrum sits on a heros throne           and asks if he is dead            sirs i am but a nameless man           a rhymester without home           yet since i come of the wessex clay           and carry the cross of rome            i will even answer the mighty earl           that asked of wessex men           why they be meek and monkish folk           and bow to the white lords broken yoke           what sign have we save blood and smoke           here is my answer then            that on you is fallen the shadow           and not upon the name           that though we scatter and though we fly           and you hang over us like the sky           you are more tired of victory           than we are tired of shame            that though you hunt the christian man           like a hare on the hillside           the hare has still more heart to run           than you have heart to ride            that though all lances split on you           all swords be heaved in vain           we have more lust again to lose           than you to win again            your lord sits high in the saddle           a brokenhearted king           but our king alfred lost from fame           fallen among foes or bonds of shame           in i know not what mean trade or name           has still some song to sing            our monks go robed in rain and snow           but the heart of flame therein           but you go clothed in feasts and flames           when all is ice within            nor shall all iron dooms make dumb           men wondering ceaselessly           if it be not better to fast for joy           than feast for misery            nor monkish order only           slides down as field to fen           all things achieved and chosen pass           as the white horse fades in the grass           no work of christian men            ere the sad gods that made your gods           saw their sad sunrise pass           the white horse of the white horse vale           that you have left to darken and fail           was cut out of the grass            therefore your end is on you           is on you and your kings           not for a fire in ely fen           not that your gods are nine or ten           but because it is only christian men           guard even heathen things            for our god hath blessed creation           calling it good i know           what spirit with whom you blindly band           hath blessed destruction with his hand           yet by gods death the stars shall stand           and the small apples grow            and the king with harp on shoulder           stood up and ceased his song           and the owls moaned from the mighty trees           and the danes laughed loud and long     book iv the woman in the forest             thick thunder of the snorting swine           enormous in the gloam           rending among all roots that cling           and the wild horses whinnying           were the nights noises when the king           shouldering his harp went home            with eyes of owl and feet of fox           full of all thoughts he went           he marked the tilt of the pagan camp           the paling of pine the sentries tramp           and the one great stolen altarlamp           over guthrum in his tent            by scrub and thorn in ethandune           that night the foe had lain           whence ran across the heather grey           the old stones of a roman way           and in a wood not far away           the pale road split in twain            he marked the wood and the cloven ways           with an old captains eyes           and he thought how many a time had he           sought to see doom he could not see           how ruin had come and victory           and both were a surprise            even so he had watched and wondered           under ashdown from the plains           with ethelred praying in his tent           till the white hawthorn swung and bent           as alfred rushed his spears and rent           the shieldwall of the danes            even so he had watched and wondered           knowing neither less nor more           till all his lords lay dying           and axes on axes plying           flung him and drove him flying           like a pirate to the shore            wise he had been before defeat           and wise before success           wise in both hours and ignorant           knowing neither more nor less            as he went down to the riverhut           he knew a nightshade scent           owls did as evil cherubs rise           with little wings and lantern eyes           as though he sank through the underskies           but down and down he went            as he went down to the riverhut           he went as one that fell           seeing the high forest domes and spars           dim green or torn with golden scars           as the proud look up at the evil stars           in the red heavens of hell            for he must meet by the riverhut           them he had bidden to arm           mark from the towers of italy           and colan of the sacred tree           and eldred who beside the sea           held heavily his farm            the roof leaned gaping to the grass           as a monstrous mushroom lies           echoing and empty seemed the place           but opened in a little space           a great grey woman with scarred face           and strong and humbled eyes            king alfred was but a meagre man           bright eyed but lean and pale           and swordless with his harp and rags           he seemed a beggar such as lags           looking for crusts and ale            and the woman with a womans eyes           of pity at once and ire           said when that she had glared a span           there is a cake for any man           if he will watch the fire            and alfred bowing heavily           sat down the fire to stir           and even as the woman pitied him           so did he pity her            saying o great heart in the night           o best cast forth for worst           twilight shall melt and morning stir           and no kind thing shall come to her           till god shall turn the world over           and all the last are first            and well may god with the servingfolk           cast in his dreadful lot           is not he too a servant           and is not he forgot            for was not god my gardener           and silent like a slave           that opened oaks on the uplands           or thicket in graveyard gave            and was not god my armourer           all patient and unpaid           that sealed my skull as a helmet           and ribs for hauberk made            did not a great grey servant           of all my sires and me           build this pavilion of the pines           and herd the fowls and fill the vines           and labour and pass and leave no signs           save mercy and mystery            for god is a great servant           and rose before the day           from some primordial slumber torn           but all we living later born           sleep on and rise after the morn           and the lord has gone away            on things half sprung from sleeping           all sleepy suns have shone           they stretch stiff arms the yawning trees           the beasts blink upon hands and knees           man is awake and does and sees           but heaven has done and gone            for who shall guess the good riddle           or speak of the holiest           save in faint figures and failing words           who loves yet laughs among the swords           labours and is at rest            but some see god like guthrum           crowned with a great beard curled           but i see god like a good giant           that labouring lifts the world            wherefore was god in golgotha           slain as a serf is slain           and hate he had of prince and peer           and love he had and made good cheer           of them that like this woman here           go powerfully in pain            but in this grey morn of mans life           cometh sometime to the mind           a little light that leaps and flies           like a star blown on the wind            a star of nowhere a nameless star           a light that spins and swirls           and cries that even in hedge and hill           even on earth it may go ill           at last with the evil earls            a dancing sparkle a doubtful star           on the waste wind whirled and driven           but it seems to sing of a wilder worth           a time discrowned of doom and birth           and the kingdom of the poor on earth           come as it is in heaven            but even though such days endure           how shall it profit her           who shall go groaning to the grave           with many a meek and mighty slave           fieldbreaker and fisher on the wave           and woodman and waggoner            bake ye the big world all again           a cake with kinder leaven           yet these are sorry evermore           unless there be a little door           a little door in heaven            and as he wept for the woman           he let her business be           and like his royal oath and rash           the good food fell upon the ash           and blackened instantly            screaming the woman caught a cake           yet burning from the bar           and struck him suddenly on the face           leaving a scarlet scar            king alfred stood up wordless           a man dead with surprise           and torture stood and the evil things           that are in the childish hearts of kings           an instant in his eyes            and even as he stood and stared           drew round him in the dusk           those friends creeping from faroff farms           marcus with all his slaves in arms           and the strange spears hung with ancient charms           of colan of the usk            with one whole farm marching afoot           the trampled road resounds           farmhands and farmbeasts blundering by           and jars of mead and stores of rye           where eldred strode above his high           and thunderthroated hounds            and grey cattle and silver lowed           against the unlifted morn           and straw clung to the spearshafts tall           and a boy went before them all           blowing a rams horn            as mocking such rude revelry           the dim clan of the gael           came like a bad kings burialend           with dismal robes that drop and rend           and demon pipes that wail            in long outlandish garments           torn though of antique worth           with druid beards and druid spears           as a resurrected race appears           out of an elder earth            and though the king had called them forth           and knew them for his own           so still each eye stood like a gem           so spectral hung each broidered hem           grey carven men he fancied them           hewn in an age of stone            and the two wild peoples of the north           stood fronting in the gloam           and heard and knew each in its mind           the third great thunder on the wind           the living walls that hedge mankind           the walking walls of rome            marks were the mixed tribes of the west           of many a hue and strain           gurth with rank hair like yellow grass           and the cornish fisher gorlias           and halmer come from his first mass           lately baptized a dane            but like one man in armour           those hundreds trod the field           from red arabia to the tyne           the earth had heard that marchingline           since the cry on the hill capitoline           and the fall of the golden shield            and the earth shook and the king stood still           under the greenwood bough           and the smoking cake lay at his feet           and the blow was on his brow            then alfred laughed out suddenly           like thunder in the spring           till shook aloud the lintelbeams           and the squirrels stirred in dusty dreams           and the startled birds went up in streams           for the laughter of the king            and the beasts of the earth and the birds looked down           in a wild solemnity           on a stranger sight than a sylph or elf           on one man laughing at himself           under the greenwood tree            the giant laughter of christian men           that roars through a thousand tales           where greed is an ape and pride is an ass           and jacks away with his masters lass           and the miser is banged with all his brass           the farmer with all his flails            tales that tumble and tales that trick           yet end not all in scorning           of kings and clowns in a merry plight           and the clock gone wrong and the world gone right           that the mummers sing upon christmas night           and christmas day in the morning            now here is a good warrant           cried alfred by my sword           for he that is struck for an ill servant           should be a kind lord            he that has been a servant           knows more than priests and kings           but he that has been an ill servant           he knows all earthly things            pride flings frail palaces at the sky           as a man flings up sand           but the firm feet of humility           take hold of heavy land            pride juggles with her toppling towers           they strike the sun and cease           but the firm feet of humility           they grip the ground like trees            he that hath failed in a little thing           hath a sign upon the brow           and the earls of the great army           have no such seal to show            the red print on my forehead           small flame for a red star           in the van of the violent marching then           when the sky is torn of the trumpets ten           and the hands of the happy howling men           fling wide the gates of war            this blow that i return not           ten times will i return           on kings and earls of all degree           and armies wide as empires be           shall slide like landslips to the sea           if the red star burn            one man shall drive a hundred           as the dead kings drave           before me rocking hosts be riven           and battering cohorts backwards driven           for i am the first king known of heaven           that has been struck like a slave            up on the old white road brothers           up on the roman walls           for this is the night of the drawing of swords           and the tainted tower of the heathen hordes           leans to our hammers fires and cords           leans a little and falls            follow the star that lives and leaps           follow the sword that sings           for we go gathering heathen men           a terrible harvest ten by ten           as the wrath of the last red autumnthen           when christ reaps down the kings            follow a light that leaps and spins           follow the fire unfurled           for riseth up against realm and rod           a thing forgotten a thing downtrod           the last lost giant even god           is risen against the world            roaring they went oer the roman wall           and roaring up the lane           their torches tossed a ladder of fire           higher their hymn was heard and higher           more sweet for hate and for hearts desire           and up in the northern scrub and brier           they fell upon the dane     book v ethandune the first stroke             king guthrum was a dread king           like death out of the north           shrines without name or number           he rent and rolled as lumber           from chester to the humber           he drove his foemen forth            the roman villas heard him           in the valley of the thames           come over the hills roaring           above their roofs and pouring           on spire and stair and flooring           brimstone and pitch and flames            sheer oer the great chalk uplands           and the hill of the horse went he           till high on hampshire beacons           he saw the southern sea            high on the heights of wessex           he saw the southern brine           and turned him to a conquered land           and where the northern thornwoods stand           and the road parts on either hand           there came to him a sign            king guthrum was a warchief           a wise man in the field           and though he prospered well and knew           how alfreds folk were sad and few           not less with weighty care he drew           long lines for pike and shield            king guthrum lay on the upper land           on a single road at gaze           and his foe must come with lean array           up the left arm of the cloven way           to the meeting of the ways            and long ere the noise of armour           an hour ere the break of light           the woods awoke with crash and cry           and the birds sprang clamouring harsh and high           and the rabbits ran like an elves army           ere alfred came in sight            the live wood came at guthrum           on foot and claw and wing           the nests were noisy overhead           for alfred and the star of red           all life went forth and the forest fled           before the face of the king            but halted in the woodways           christs few were grim and grey           and each with a small far birdlike sight           saw the high folly of the fight           and though strange joys had grown in the night           despair grew with the day            and when white dawn crawled through the wood           like cold foam of a flood           then weakened every warriors mood           in hope though not in hardihood           and each man sorrowed as he stood           in the fashion of his blood            for the saxon franklin sorrowed           for the things that had been fair           for the dear dead woman crimsonclad           and the great feasts and the friends he had           but the celtic princes soul was sad           for the things that never were            in the eyes italian all things           but a black laughter died           and alfred flung his shield to earth           and smote his breast and cried            i wronged a man to his slaying           and a woman to her shame           and once i looked on a sworn maid           that was wed to the holy name            and once i took my neighbours wife           that was bound to an eastland man           in the starkness of my evil youth           before my griefs began            people if you have any prayers           say prayers for me           and lay me under a christian stone           in that lost land i thought my own           to wait till the holy horn is blown           and all poor men are free            then eldred of the idle farm           leaned on his ancient sword           as fell his heavy words and few           and his eyes were of such alien blue           as gleams where the northman saileth new           into an unknown fiord            i was a fool and wasted ale           my slaves found it sweet           i was a fool and wasted bread           and the birds had bread to eat            the kings go up and the kings go down           and who knows who shall rule           next night a king may starve or sleep           but men and birds and beasts shall weep           at the burial of a fool            o drunkards in my cellar           boys in my apple tree           the world grows stern and strange and new           and wise men shall govern you           and you shall weep for me            but yoke me my own oxen           down to my own farm           my own dog will whine for me           my own friends will bend the knee           and the foes i slew openly           have never wished me harm            and all were moved a little           but colan stood apart           having first pity and after           hearing like rat in rafter           that little worm of laughter           that eats the irish heart            and his greygreen eyes were cruel           and the smile of his mouth waxed hard           and he said and when did britain           become your buryingyard            before the romans lit the land           when schools and monks were none           we reared such stones to the sungod           as might put out the sun            the tall trees of britain           we worshipped and were wise           but you shall raid the whole land through           and never a tree shall talk to you           though every leaf is a tongue taught true           and the forest is full of eyes            on one round hill to the seaward           the trees grow tall and grey           and the trees talk together           when all men are away            oer a few round hills forgotten           the trees grow tall in rings           and the trees talk together           of many pagan things            yet i could lie and listen           with a cross upon my clay           and hear unhurt for ever           what the trees of britain say            a proud man was the roman           his speech a single one           but his eyes were like an eagles eyes           that is staring at the sun            dig for me where i die he said           if first or last i fall           dead on the fell at the first charge           or dead by wantage wall            lift not my head from bloody ground           bear not my body home           for all the earth is roman earth           and i shall die in rome            then alfred king of england           bade blow the horns of war           and fling the golden dragon out           with crackle and acclaim and shout           scrolled and aflame and far            and under the golden dragon           went wessex all along           past the sharp point of the cloven ways           out from the black wood into the blaze           of sun and steel and song            and when they came to the open land           they wheeled deployed and stood           midmost were marcus and the king           and eldred on the righthand wing           and leftwards colan darkling           in the last shade of the wood            but the earls of the great army           lay like a long half moon           ten poles before their palisades           with widewinged helms and runic blades           red giants of an age of raids           in the thornland of ethandune            midmost the saddles rose and swayed           and a stir of horses manes           where guthrum and a few rode high           on horses seized in victory           but ogier went on foot to die           in the old way of the danes            far to the kings left elf the bard           led on the eastern wing           with songs and spells that change the blood           and on the kings right harold stood           the kinsman of the king            young harold coarse with colours gay           smoking with oil and musk           and the pleasant violence of the young           pushed through his people giving tongue           foewards where grey as cobwebs hung           the banners of the usk            but as he came before his line           a little space along           his beardless face broke into mirth           and he cried what broken bits of earth           are here for what their clothes are worth           i would sell them for a song            for colan was hung with raiment           tattered like autumn leaves           and his men were all as thin as saints           and all as poor as thieves            no bows nor slings nor bolts they bore           but bills and pikes illmade           and none but colan bore a sword           and rusty was its blade            and colans eyes with mystery           and iron laughter stirred           and he spoke aloud but lightly           not labouring to be heard            oh truly we be broken hearts           for that cause it is said           we light our candles to that lord           that broke himself for bread            but though we hold but bitterly           what land the saxon leaves           though ireland be but a land of saints           and wales a land of thieves            i say you yet shall weary           of the working of your word           that stricken spirits never strike           nor lean hands hold a sword            and if ever ye ride in ireland           the jest may yet be said           there is the land of broken hearts           and the land of broken heads            not less barbarian laughter           choked harold like a flood           and shall i fight with scarecrows           that am of guthrums blood            meeting may be of warmen           where the best warman wins           but all this carrion a man shoots           before the fight begins            and stopping in his onward strides           he snatched a bow in scorn           from some mean slave and bent it on           colan whose doom grew dark and shone           stars evil over caerleon           in the place where he was born            for colan had not bow nor sling           on a lonely sword leaned he           like arthur on excalibur           in the battle by the sea            to his great gold earring harold           tugged back the feathered tail           and swift had sprung the arrow           but swifter sprang the gael            whirling the one sword round his head           a great wheel in the sun           he sent it splendid through the sky           flying before the shaft could fly           it smote earl harold over the eye           and blood began to run            colan stood bare and weaponless           earl harold as in pain           strove for a smile put hand to head           stumbled and suddenly fell dead           and the small white daisies all waxed red           with blood out of his brain            and all at that marvel of the sword           cast like a stone to slay           cried out said alfred who would see           signs must give all things verily           man shall not taste of victory           till he throws his sword away            then alfred prince of england           and all the christian earls           unhooked their swords and held them up           each offered to colan like a cup           of chrysolite and pearls            and the king said do thou take my sword           who have done this deed of fire           for this is the manner of christian men           whether of steel or priestly pen           that they cast their hearts out of their ken           to get their hearts desire            and whether ye swear a hive of monks           or one fair wife to friend           this is the manner of christian men           that their oath endures the end            for love our lord at the end of the world           sits a red horse like a throne           with a brazen helm and an iron bow           but one arrow alone            love with the shield of the broken heart           ever his bow doth bend           with a single shaft for a single prize           and the ultimate bolt that parts and flies           comes with a thunder of split skies           and a sound of souls that rend            so shall you earn a kings sword           who cast your sword away           and the king took with a random eye           a rude axe from a hind hard by           and turned him to the fray            for the swords of the earls of daneland           flamed round the fallen lord           the first blood woke the trumpettune           as in monks rhyme or wizards rune           beginneth the battle of ethandune           with the throwing of the sword     book vi ethandune the slaying of the chiefs             as the sea flooding the flat sands           flew on the seaborn horde           the two hosts shocked with dust and din           left of the latian paladin           clanged all prince harolds howling kin           on colan and the sword            crashed in the midst on marcus           ogier with guthrum by           and eastward of such central stir           far to the right and faintlier           the house of elf the harpplayer           struck eldreds with a cry            the centre swat for weariness           stemming the screaming horde           and wearily went colans hands           that swung king alfreds sword            but like a cloud of morning           to eastward easily           tall eldred broke the sea of spears           as a tall ship breaks the sea            his face like a sanguine sunset           his shoulder a wessex down           his hand like a windy hammerstroke           men could not count the crests he broke           so fast the crests went down            as the tall white devil of the plague           moves out of asian skies           with his foot on a waste of cities           and his head in a cloud of flies            or purple and peacock skies grow dark           with a moving locusttower           or tawny sandwinds tall and dry           like hells red banners beat and fly           when death comes out of araby           was eldred in his hour            but while he moved like a massacre           he murmured as in sleep           and his words were all of low hedges           and little fields and sheep            even as he strode like a pestilence           that strides from rhine to rome           he thought how tall his beans might be           if ever he went home            spoke some stiff piece of childish prayer           dull as the distant chimes           that thanked our god for good eating           and corn and quiet times            till on the helm of a high chief           fell shatteringly his brand           and the helm broke and the bone broke           and the sword broke in his hand            then from the yelling northmen           driven splintering on him ran           full seven spears and the seventh           was never made by man            seven spears and the seventh           was wrought as the faerie blades           and given to elf the minstrel           by the monstrous watermaids            by them that dwell where luridly           lost waters of the rhine           move among roots of nations           being sunken for a sign            under all graves they murmur           they murmur and rebel           down to the buried kingdoms creep           and like a lost rain roar and weep           oer the red heavens of hell            thrice drowned was elf the minstrel           and washed as dead on sand           and the third time men found him           the spear was in his hand            seven spears went about eldred           like stays about a mast           but there was sorrow by the sea           for the driving of the last            six spears thrust upon eldred           were splintered while he laughed           one spear thrust into eldred           three feet of blade and shaft            and from the great heart grievously           came forth the shaft and blade           and he stood with the face of a dead man           stood a little and swayed            then fell as falls a battletower           on smashed and struggling spears           cast down from some unconquered town           that rushing earthward carries down           loads of live men of all renown           archers and engineers            and a great clamour of christian men           went up in agony           crying fallen is the tower of wessex           that stood beside the sea            centre and right the wessex guard           grew pale for doubt and fear           and the flank failed at the advance           for the deathlight on the wizard lance           the star of the evil spear            stand like an oak cried

         leaned back and reeled a space to rear           as elf charged with the rhine maids spear           and roaring like the rhine            for the men were borne by the waving walls           of woods and clouds that pass           by dizzy plains and drifting sea           and they mixed god with glamoury           god with the gods of the burning tree           and the wizards tower and glass            but mark was come of the glittering towns           where hot white details show           where men can number and expound           and his faith grew in a hard ground           of doubt and reason and falsehood found           where no faith else could grow            belief that grew of all beliefs           one moment back was blown           and belief that stood on unbelief           stood up iron and alone            the wessex crescent backwards           crushed as with bloody spear           went elf roaring and routing           and mark against elf yet shouting           shocked in his midcareer            right on the roman shield and sword           did spear of the rhine maids run           but the shield shifted never           the sword rang down to sever           the great rhine sang for ever           and the songs of elf were done            and a great thunder of christian men           went up against the sky           saying god hath broken the evil spear           ere the good mans blood was dry            spears at the charge yelled mark amain           death on the gods of death           over the thrones of doom and blood           goeth

broke about him           battlebays and palm           all the seakings swayed among           woods of the wessex arms upflung           the trumpet of the roman tongue           the thunder of the psalm            and midmost of that rolling field           ran ogier ragingly           lashing at mark who turned his blow           and brake the helm about his brow           and broke him to his knee            then ogier heaved over his head           his huge round shield of proof           but mark set one foot on the shield           one on some sundered rock upheeled           and towered above the tossing field           a statue on a roof            dealing far blows about the fight           like thunderbolts aroam           like birds about the battlefield           while ogier writhed under his shield           like a tortoise in his dome            but hate in the buried ogier           was strong as pain in hell           with bare brute hand from the inside           he burst the shield of brass and hide           and a deathstroke to the romans side           sent suddenly and well            then the great statue on the shield           looked his last look around           with level and imperial eye           and mark the man from italy           fell in the sea of agony           and died without a sound            and ogier leaping up alive           hurled his huge shield away           flying as when a juggler flings           a whizzing plate in play            and held two arms up rigidly           and roared to all the danes           fallen is rome yea fallen           the city of the plains            shall no man born remember           that breaketh wood or weald           how long she stood on the roof of the world           as he stood on my shield            the new wild world forgetteth her           as foam fades on the sea           how long she stood with her foot on man           as he with his foot on me            no more shall the brown men of the south           move like the ants in lines           to quiet men with olives           or madden men with vines            no more shall the white towns of the south           where tiber and nilus run           sitting around a secret sea           worship a secret sun            the blind gods roar for rome fallen           and forum and garland gone           for the ice of the north is broken           and the sea of the north comes on            the blind gods roar and rave and dream           of all cities under the sea           for the heart of the north is broken           and the blood of the north is free            down from the dome of the world we come           rivers on rivers down           under us swirl the sects and hordes           and the high dooms we drown            down from the dome of the world and down           struck flying as a skiff           on a river in spate is spun and swirled           until we come to the end of the world           that breaks short like a cliff            and when we come to the end of the world           for me i count it fit           to take the leap like a good river           shot shrieking over it            but whatso hap at the end of the world           where nothing is struck and sounds           it is not by thor these monkish men           these humbled wessex hounds            not this pale line of christian hinds           this one white string of men           shall keep us back from the end of the world           and the things that happen then            it is not alfreds dwarfish sword           nor egberts pigmy crown           shall stay us now that descend in thunder           rending the realms and the realms thereunder           down through the world and down            there was that in the wild men back of him           there was that in his own wild song           a dizzy throbbing a drunkard smoke           that dazed to death all wessex folk           and swept their spears along            vainly the sword of colan           and the axe of alfred plied           the danes poured in like a brainless plague           and knew not when they died            prince colan slew a score of them           and was stricken to his knee           king alfred slew a score and seven           and was borne back on a tree            back to the black gate of the woods           back up the single way           back by the place of the parting ways           christs knights were whirled away            and when they came to the parting ways           dooms heaviest hammer fell           for the king was beaten blind at bay           down the right lane with his array           but colan swept the other way           where he smote great strokes and fell            the thornwoods over ethandune           stand sharp and thick as spears           by night and furze and forestharms           far sundered were the friends in arms           the loud lost blows the last alarms           came not to alfreds ears            the thornwoods over ethandune           stand stiff as spikes in mail           as to the haut king came at morn           dead roland on a doubtful horn           seemed unto alfred lightly borne           the last cry of the gael     book vii ethandune the last charge             away in the waste of white horse down           an idle child alone           played some small game through hours that pass           and patiently would pluck the grass           patiently push the stone            on the lean green edge for ever           where the blank chalk touched the turf           the child played on alone divine           as a child plays on the last line           that sunders sand and surf            for he dwelleth in high divisions           too simple to understand           seeing on what morn of mystery           the uncreated rent the sea           with roarings from the land            through the long infant hours like days           he built one tower in vain           piled up small stones to make a town           and evermore the stones fell down           and he piled them up again            and crimson kings on battletowers           and saints on gothic spires           and hermits on their peaks of snow           and heroes on their pyres            and patriots riding royally           that rush the rocking town           stretch hands and hunger and aspire           seeking to mount where high and higher           the child whom time can never tire           sings over white horse down            and this was the might of alfred           at the ending of the way           that of such smiters wise or wild           he was least distant from the child           piling the stones all day            for eldred fought like a frank hunter           that killeth and goeth home           and mark had fought because all arms           rang like the name of rome            and colan fought with a double mind           moody and madly gay           but alfred fought as gravely           as a good child at play            he saw wheels break and work run back           and all things as they were           and his heart was orbed like victory           and simple like despair            therefore is mark forgotten           that was wise with his tongue and brave           and the cairn over colan crumbled           and the cross on eldreds grave            their great souls went on a wind away           and they have not tale or tomb           and alfred born in wantage           rules england till the doom            because in the forest of all fears           like a strange fresh gust from sea           struck him that ancient innocence           that is more than mastery            and as a child whose bricks fall down           repiles them oer and oer           came ruin and the rain that burns           returning as a wheel returns           and crouching in the furze and ferns           he began his life once more            he took his ivory horn unslung           and smiled but not in scorn           endeth the battle of ethandune           with the blowing of a horn            on a dark horse at the double way           he saw great guthrum ride           heard roar of brass and ring of steel           the laughter and the trumpet peal           the pagan in his pride            and ogiers red and hated head           moved in some talk or task           but the men seemed scattered in the brier           and some of them had lit a fire           and one had broached a cask            and waggons one or two stood up           like tall ships in sight           as if an outpost were encamped           at the cloven ways for night            and joyous of the sudden stay           of alfreds routed few           sat one upon a stone to sigh           and some slipped up the road to fly           till alfred in the fern hard by           set horn to mouth and blew            and they all abode like statues           one sitting on the stone           one halfway through the thorn hedge tall           one with a leg across a wall           and one looked backwards very small           far up the road alone            grey twilight and a yellow star           hung over thorn and hill           two spears and a cloven warshield lay           loose on the road as cast away           the horn died faint in the forest grey           and the fleeing men stood still            brothers at arms said alfred           on this side lies the foe           are slavery and starvation flowers           that you should pluck them so            for whether is it better           to be prodded with danish poles           having hewn a chamber in a ditch           and hounded like a howling witch           or smoked to death in holes            or that before the red cock crow           all we a thousand strong           go down the dark road to gods house           singing a wessex song            to sweat a slave to a race of slaves           to drink up infamy           no brothers by your leave i think           death is a better ale to drink           and by all the stars of christ that sink           the danes shall drink with me            to grow old cowed in a conquered land           with the sun itself discrowned           to see trees crouch and cattle slink           death is a better ale to drink           and by high death on the fell brink           that flagon shall go round            though dead are all the paladins           whom glory had in ken           though all your thundersworded thanes           with proud hearts died among the danes           while a man remains great war remains           now is a war of men            the men that tear the furrows           the men that fell the trees           when all their lords be lost and dead           the bondsmen of the earth shall tread           the tyrants of the seas            the wheel of the roaring stillness           of all labours under the sun           speed the wild work as well at least           as the whole worlds work is done            let hildred hack the shieldwall           clean as he hacks the hedge           let gurth the fowler stand as cool           as he stands on the chasms edge            let gorlias ride the seakings           as gorlias rides the sea           then let all hell and denmark drive           yelling to all its fiends alive           and not a rag care we            when alfreds word was ended           stood firm that feeble line           each in his place with club or spear           and fury deeper than deep fear           and smiles as sour as brine            and the king held up the horn and said           see ye my fathers horn           that egbert blew in his empery           once when he rode out commonly           twice when he rode for venery           and thrice on the battlemorn            but heavier fates have fallen           the horn of the wessex kings           and i blew once the riding sign           to call you to the fighting line           and glory and all good things            and now two blasts the hunting sign           because we turn to bay           but i will not blow the three blasts           till we be lost or they            and now i blow the hunting sign           charge some by rule and rod           but when i blow the battle sign           charge all and go to god            wild stared the danes at the double ways           where they loitered all at large           as that dark line for the last time           doubled the knee to charge            and caught their weapons clumsily           and marvelled how and why           in such degree by rule and rod           the people of the peace of god           went roaring down to die            and when the last arrow           was fitted and was flown           when the broken shield hung on the breast           and the hopeless lance was laid in rest           and the hopeless horn blown            the king looked up and what he saw           was a great light like death           for our lady stood on the standards rent           as lonely and as innocent           as when between white walls she went           and the lilies of nazareth            one instant in a still light           he saw our lady then           her dress was soft as western sky           and she was a queen most womanly           but she was a queen of men            over the iron forest           he saw our lady stand           her eyes were sad withouten art           and seven swords were in her heart           but one was in her hand            then the last charge went blindly           and all too lost for fear           the danes closed round a roaring ring           and twenty clubs rose oer the king           four danes hewed at him halloing           and ogier of the stone and sling           drove at him with a spear            but the danes were wild with laughter           and the great spear swung wide           the point stuck to a straggling tree           and either host cried suddenly           as alfred leapt aside            short time had shaggy ogier           to pull his lance in line           he knew king alfreds axe on high           he heard it rushing through the sky            he cowered beneath it with a cry           it split him to the spine           and alfred sprang over him dead           and blew the battle sign            then bursting all and blasting           came christendom like death           kicked of such catapults of will           the staves shiver the barrels spill           the waggons waver and crash and kill           the waggoners beneath            barriers go backwards banners rend           great shields groan like a gong           horses like horns of nightmare           neigh horribly and long            horses ramp high and rock and boil           and break their golden reins           and slide on carnage clamorously           down where the bitter blood doth lie           where ogier went on foot to die           in the old way of the danes            the high tide king alfred cried           the high tide and the turn           as a tide turns on the tall grey seas           see how they waver in the trees           how stray their spears how knock their knees           how wild their watchfires burn            the mother of god goes over them           walking on wind and flame           and the stormcloud drifts from city and dale           and the white horse stamps in the white horse vale           and we all shall yet drink christian ale           in the village of our name            the mother of god goes over them           on dreadful cherubs borne           and the psalm is roaring above the rune           and the cross goes over the sun and moon           endeth the battle of ethandune           with the blowing of a horn            for back indeed disorderly           the danes went clamouring           too worn to take anew the tale           or dazed with insolence and ale           or stunned of heaven or stricken pale           before the face of the king            for dire was alfred in his hour           the pale scribe witnesseth           more mighty in defeat was he           than all men else in victory           and behind his men came murderously           drythroated drinking death            and edgar of the golden ship           he slew with his own hand           took ludwig from his ladys bower           and smote down harmar in his hour           and vain and lonely stood the tower           the tower in guelderland            and torr out of his tiny boat           whose eyes beheld the nile           wulf with his warcry on his lips           and harco born in the eclipse           who blocked the seine with battleships           round paris on the isle            and hacon of the harvestsong           and dirck from the elbe he slew           and cnut that melted durham bell           and fulk and fiery oscar fell           and goderic and sigael           and uriel of the yew            and highest sang the slaughter           and fastest fell the slain           when from the woodroads blackening throat           a crowning and crashing wonder smote           the rearguard of the dane            for the dregs of colans company           lost down the other road           had gathered and grown and heard the din           and with wild yells came pouring in           naked as their old british kin           and bright with blood for woad            and bare and bloody and aloft           they bore before their band           the body of the mighty lord           colan of caerleon and its horde           that bore king alfreds battlesword           broken in his left hand            and a strange music went with him           loud and yet strangely far           the wild pipes of the western land           too keen for the ear to understand           sang high and deathly on each hand           when the dead man went to war            blocked between ghost and buccaneer           brave men have dropped and died           and the wild sealords well might quail           as the ghastly warpipes of the gael           called to the horns of white horse vale           and all the horns replied            and hildred the poor hedger           cut down four captains dead           and halmar laid three others low           and the great earls wavered to and fro           for the living and the dead            and gorlias grasped the great flag           the raven of odin torn           and the eyes of guthrum altered           for the first time since morn            as a turn of the wheel of tempest           tilts up the whole sky tall           and cliffs of wan cloud luminous           lean out like great walls over us           as if the heavens might fall            as such a tall and tilted sky           sends certain snow or light           so did the eyes of guthrum change           and the turn was more certain and more strange           than a thousand men in flight            for not till the floor of the skies is split           and hellfire shines through the sea           or the stars look up through the rent earths knees           cometh such rending of certainties           as when

there came to him a sign            in wessex in the forest           in the breaking of the spears           we set a sign on guthrum           to blaze a thousand years            where the high saddles jostle           and the horsetails toss           there rose to the birds flying           a roar of dead and dying           in deafness and strong crying           we signed him with the

stood above death at ethandune           and saw his kingdom come            when the pagan people of the sea           fled to their palisades           nailed there with javelins to cling           and wonder smote the pirate king           and brought him to his christening           and the end of all his raids            for not till the nights blue slate is wiped           of its last star

there came to his chrismloosing           lords of all lands afar           and a line was drawn northwesterly           that set king egberts empire free           giving all lands by the northern sea           to the sons of the northern star            in the days of the rest of alfred           when all these things were done           and wessex lay in a patch of peace           like a dog in a patch of sun            the king sat in his orchard           among apples green and red           with the little book in his bosom           and the sunshine on his head            and he gathered the songs of simple men           that swing with helm and hod           and the alms he gave as a christian           like a river alive with fishes ran           and he made gifts to a beggar man           as to a wandering god            and he gat good laws of the ancient kings           like treasure out of the tombs           and many a thief in thorny nook           or noble in

welcoming           and men would go to the ends of the earth           because of the word of the king            for folk came in to alfreds face           whose javelins had been hurled           on monsters that make boil the sea           crakens and coils of mystery           or thrust in ancient snows that be           the white hair of the world            and some had knocked at the northern gates           of the ultimate icy floor           where the fish freeze and the foam turns black           and the wide world narrows to a track           and the other sea at the worlds back           cries through a closed door            and men went forth from alfreds face           even great giftbearing lords           not to rome only but more bold           out to the high hot courts of old           of negroes clad in cloth of gold           silence and crooked swords            scrawled screens and secret gardens           and insectladen skies           where fiery plains stretch on and on           to the purple country of prester john           and the walls of paradise            and he knew the might of the terre majeure           where kings began to reign           where in a nightrout without name           of gloomy goths and gauls there came           white above candles all aflame           like a vision charlemagne            and men seeing such embassies           spake with the king and said           the steel that sang so sweet a tune           on ashdown and on ethandune           why hangs it scabbarded so soon           all heavily like lead            why dwell the danes in north england           and up to the river ride           three more such marches like thine own           would end them and the pict should own           our sway and our feet climb the throne           in the mountains of strathclyde            and alfred in the orchard           among apples green and red           with the little book in his bosom           looked at green leaves and said            when all philosophies shall fail           this word alone shall fit           that a sage feels too small for life           and a fool too large for it            asia and all imperial plains           are too little for a fool           but for one man whose eyes can see           the little island of athelney           is too large a land to rule            haply it had been better           when i built my fortress there           out in the reedy waters wide           i had stood on my mud wall and cried           take england all from tide to tide           be athelney my share            those madmen of the thronescramble           oppressors and oppressed           had lined the banks by athelney           and waved and wailed unceasingly           where the river turned to the broad sea           by an island of the blest            an island like a little book           full of a hundred tales           like the gilt page the good monks pen           that is all smaller than a wren           yet hath high towns meteors and men           and suns and spouting whales            a land having a light on it           in the river dark and fast           an isle with utter clearness lit           because a saint had stood in it           where flowers are flowers indeed and fit           and trees are trees at last            so were the island of a saint           but i am a common king           and i will make my fences tough           from wantage town to plymouth bluff           because i am not wise enough           to rule so small a thing            and it fell in the days of alfred           in the days of his repose           that as old customs in his sight           were a straight road and a steady light           he bade them keep the white horse white           as the first plume of the snows            and right to the red torchlight           from the trouble of morning grey           they stripped the white horse of the grass           as they strip it to this day            and under the red torchlight           he went dreaming as though dull           of his old companions slain like kings           and the rich irrevocable things           of a heart that hath not openings           but is shut fast being full            and the torchlight touched the pale hair           where silver clouded gold           and the frame of his face was made of cords           and a young lord turned among the lords           and said the king is old            and even as he said it           a post ran in amain           crying arm lord king the hamlets arm           in the horror and the shade of harm           they have burnt brand of ayngers farm           the danes are come

stumbled on one knee           the thanes broke out in ire           crying ill the watchmen watch and ill           the sheriffs keep the shire            but the young earl said ill the saints           the saints of england guard           the land wherein we pledge them gold           the dykes decay the king grows old           and surely this is hard            that we be never quit of them           that when his head is hoar           he cannot say to them he smote           and spared with a hand hard at the throat           go and return no more            then alfred smiled and the smile of him           was like the sun for power           but he only pointed bade them heed           those peasants of the berkshire breed           who plucked the old horse of the weed

out to his last war           on a tall grey horse at dawn            and news of his faroff fighting           came slowly and brokenly           from the land of the east saxons           from the

grey horse went by            the gates of the great river           were breached as with a barge           the walls sank crowded say the scribes           and high towers populous with tribes
