70365245	the pilot  a tale of the sea    by  j fenimore cooper     to  william branford shubrick esq  u s navy   my dear shubrick   each year brings some new and melancholy chasm in what is now the brief list of my naval friends and former associates war disease and the casualties of a hazardous profession have made fearful inroads in the limited number while the places of the dead are supplied by names that to me are those of strangers with the consequences of these sad changes before me i cherish the recollection of those with whom i once lived in close familiarity with peculiar interest and feel a triumph in their growing reputations that is but little short of their own honest pride  but neither time nor separation has shaken our intimacy and i know that in dedicating to you this volume i tell you nothing new when i add that it is a tribute paid to an enduring friendship by  your old messmate  the author                                        preface                                       it is probable a true history of human events would show that a far larger proportion of our acts are the results of sudden impulses and accident than of that reason of which we so much boast however true or false this opinion may be in more important matters it is certainly and strictly correct as relates to the conception and execution of this book  the pilot was published in 1823 this was not long after the appearance of the pirate a work which it is hardly necessary to remind the reader has a direct connection with the sea in a conversation with a friend a man of polished taste and extensive reading the authorship of the scottish novels came under discussion the claims of sir walter were a little distrusted on account of the peculiar and minute information that the romances were then very generally thought to display the pirate was cited as a very marked instance of this universal knowledge and it was wondered where a man of scotts habits and associations could have become so familiar with the sea the writer had frequently observed that there was much looseness in this universal knowledge and that the secret of its success was to be traced to the power of creating that resemblance which is so remarkably exhibited in those world renowned fictions rather than to any very accurate information on the part of their author it would have been hypercritical to object to the pirate that it was not strictly nautical or true in its details but when the reverse was urged as a proof of what considering the character of other portions of the work would have been most extraordinary attainments it was a sort of provocation to dispute the seamanship of the pirate a quality to which the book has certainly very little just pretension the result of this conversation was a sudden determination to produce a work which if it had no other merit might present truer pictures of the ocean and ships than any that are to be found in the pirate to this unpremeditated decision purely an impulse is not only the pilot due but a tolerably numerous school of nautical romances that have succeeded it  the author had many misgivings concerning the success of the undertaking after he had made some progress in the work the opinions of his different friends being anything but encouraging one would declare that the sea could not be made interesting that it was tame monotonous and without any other movement than unpleasant storms and that for his part the less he got of it the better the women very generally protested that such a book would have the odor of bilge water and that it would give them the maladie de mer not a single individual among all those who discussed the merits of the project within the range of the authors knowledge either spoke or looked encouragingly it is probable that all these persons anticipated a signal failure  so very discouraging did these ominous opinions get to be that the writer was once or twice tempted to throw his manuscript aside and turn to something new a favorable opinion however coming from a very unexpected quarter put a new face on the matter and raised new hopes among the intimate friends of the writer was an englishman who possessed most of the peculiar qualities of the educated of his country he was learned even had a taste that was so just as always to command respect but was prejudiced and particularly so in all that related to this country and its literature he could never be persuaded to admire bryants waterfowl and this mainly because if it were accepted as good poetry it must be placed at once amongst the finest fugitive pieces of the language of the thanatopsis he thought better though inclined to suspect it of being a plagiarism to the tender mercies of this one sided critic who had never affected to compliment the previous works of the author the sheets of a volume of the pilot were committed with scarce an expectation of his liking them the reverse proved to be the casehe expressed himself highly gratified and predicted a success for the book which it probably never attained  thus encouraged one more experiment was made a seaman being selected for the critic a kinsman a namesake and an old messmate of the author one now in command on a foreign station was chosen and a considerable portion of the first volume was read to him there is no wish to conceal the satisfaction with which the effect on this listener was observed he treated the whole matter as fact and his criticisms were strictly professional and perfectly just but the interest he betrayed could not be mistaken it gave a perfect and most gratifying assurance that the work would be more likely to find favor with nautical men than with any other class of readers  the pilot could scarcely be a favorite with females the story has little interest for them nor was it much heeded by the author of the book in the progress of his labors his aim was to illustrate vessels and the ocean rather than to draw any pictures of sentiment and love in this last respect the book has small claims on the readers attention though it is hoped that the story has sufficient interest to relieve the more strictly nautical features of the work  it would be affectation to deny that the pilot met with a most unlooked for success the novelty of the design probably contributed a large share of this result seatales came into vogue as a consequence and as every practical part of knowledge has its uses something has been gained by letting the landsman into the secrets of the seamans manner of life perhaps in some small degree an interest has been awakened in behalf of a very numerous and what has hitherto been a sort of proscribed class of men that may directly tend to a melioration of their condition  it is not easy to make the public comprehend all the necessities of a service afloat with several hundred rude beings confined within the narrow limits of a vessel men of all nations and of the lowest habits it would be to the last degree indiscreet to commence their reformation by relaxing the bonds of discipline under the mistaken impulses of a false philanthropy it has a lofty sound to be sure to talk about american citizens being too good to be brought under the lash upon the high seas but he must have a very mistaken notion who does not see that tens of thousands of these pretending persons on shore even would be greatly benefited by a little judicious flogging it is the judgment in administering and not the mode of punishment that requires to be looked into and in this respect there has certainly been a great improvement of late years it is seldom indeed that any institution practice or system is improved by the blind interference of those who know nothing about it better would it be to trust to the experience of those who have long governed turbulent men than to the impulsive experiments of those who rarely regard more than one side of a question and that the most showy and glittering having quite half of the time some selfish personal end to answer  there is an uneasy desire among a vast many welldisposed persons to get the fruits of the christian faith without troubling themselves about the faith itself this is done under the sanction of peace societies temperance and moral reform societies in which the end is too often mistaken for the means when the almighty sent his son on earth it was to point out the way in which all this was to be brought about by means of the church but men have so frittered away that body of divine organization through their divisions and subdivisions all arising from human conceit that it is no longer regarded as the agency it was so obviously intended to be and various contrivances are to be employed as substitutes for that which proceeded directly from the son of god  among the efforts of the day however there is one connected with the moral improvement of the sailor that commands our profound respect cut off from most of the charities of life for so large a portion of his time deprived altogether of association with the gentler and better portions of the other sex and living a man in a degree proscribed amid the many signs of advancement that distinguish the age it was time that he should be remembered and singled out and become the subject of combined and christian philanthropy there is much reason to believe that the effort now making in the right direction and under proper auspices will be successful and that it will cause the lash to be laid aside in the best and most rational mannerby rendering its use unnecessary  cooperstown august 20 1829     the pilot     chapter i    sullen waves incessant rolling   rudely dashd against her sides   song   a single glance at the map will make the reader acquainted with the position of the eastern coast of the island of great britain as connected with the shores of the opposite continent together they form the boundaries of the small sea that has for ages been known to the world as the scene of maritime exploits and as the great avenue through which commerce and war have conducted the fleets of the northern nations of europe over this sea the islanders long asserted a jurisdiction exceeding that which reason concedes to any power on the highway of nations and which frequently led to conflicts that caused an expenditure of blood and treasure utterly disproportioned to the advantages that can ever arise from the maintenance of a useless and abstract right it is across the waters of this disputed ocean that we shall attempt to conduct our readers selecting a period for our incidents that has a peculiar interest for every american not only because it was the birthday of his nation but because it was also the era when reason and common sense began to take the place of custom and feudal practices in the management of the affairs of nations  soon after the events of the revolution had involved the kingdoms of france and spain and the republics of holland in our quarrel a group of laborers was collected in a field that lay exposed to the winds of the ocean on the northeastern coast of england these men were lightening their toil and cheering the gloom of a day in december by uttering their crude opinions on the political aspects of the times the fact that england was engaged in a war with some of her dependencies on the other side of the atlantic had long been known to them after the manner that faint rumors of distant and uninteresting events gain on the ear but now that nations with whom she had been used to battle were armed against her in the quarrel the din of war had disturbed the quiet even of these secluded and illiterate rustics the principal speakers on the occasion were a scotch drover who was waiting the leisure of the occupant of the fields and an irish laborer who had found his way across the channel and thus far over the island in quest of employment  the nagurs wouldnt have been a job at all for ould england letting alone ireland said the latter if these french and spanishers hadnt been troubling themselves in the matter im sure its but little reason i have for thanking them if a man is to kape as sober as a praist at mass for fear he should find himself a souldier and he knowing nothing about the same  hoot mon ye ken but little of raising an airmy in ireland if ye mak a drum o a whiskey keg said the drover winking to the listeners noo in the north they ca a gathering of the folk and follow the pipes as graciously as ye wad journey kirkward o a sabbath morn ive seen a the names o a heeland rajment on a sma bit paper that ye might cover wi a leddys hand they war a camerons and mdonalds though they paraded sax hundred men but what ha ye gotten here that chield has an owr liking to the land for a seafaring body an if the bottom o the sea be onything like the top ot hes in grat danger o a shipwreck  this unexpected change in the discourse drew all eyes on the object toward which the staff of the observant drover was pointed to the utter amazement of every individual present a small vessel was seen moving slowly round a point of land that formed one of the sides of the little bay to which the field the laborers were in composed the other there was something very peculiar in the externals of this unusual visitor which added in no small degree to the surprise created by her appearance in that retired place none but the smallest vessels and those rarely or at long intervals a desperate smuggler were ever known to venture so close to the land amid the sandbars and sunken rocks with which that immediate coast abounded the adventurous mariners who now attempted this dangerous navigation in so wanton and apparently so heedless a manner were in a low black schooner whose hull seemed utterly disproportioned to the raking masts it upheld which in their turn supported a lighter set of spars that tapered away until their upper extremities appeared no larger than the lazy pennant that in vain endeavored to display its length in the light breeze  the short day of that high northern latitude was already drawing to a close and the sun was throwing his parting rays obliquely across the waters touching the gloomy waves here and there with streaks of pale light the stormy winds of the german ocean were apparently lulled to rest and though the incessant rolling of the surge on the shore heightened the gloomy character of the hour and the view the light ripple that ruffled the sleeping billows was produced by a gentle air that blew directly from the land notwithstanding this favorable circumstance there was something threatening in the aspect of the ocean which was speaking in hollow but deep murmurs like a volcano on the eve of an eruption that greatly heightened the feelings of amazement and dread with which the peasants beheld this extraordinary interruption to the quiet of their little bay with no other sails spread to the action of the air than her heavy mainsail and one of those light jibs that projected far beyond her bows the vessel glided over the water with a grace and facility that seemed magical to the beholders who turned their wondering looks from the schooner to each other in silent amazement at length the drover spoke in a low solemn voice  hes a bold chield that steers her and if that bit craft has wood in her bottom like the brigantines that ply between lonon and the frith at leith hes in mair danger than a prudent mon could wish ay hes by the big rock that shows his head when the tide runs low but its no mortal man who can steer long in the road hes journeying and not speedily find land wi water atop ot  the little schooner however still held her way among the rocks and sandpits making such slight deviations in her course as proved her to be under the direction of one who knew his danger until she entered as far into the bay as prudence could at all justify when her canvas was gathered into folds seemingly without the agency of hands and the vessel after rolling for a few minutes on the long billows that hove in from the ocean swung round in the currents of the tide and was held by her anchor  the peasants now began to make their conjectures more freely concerning the character and object of their visitor some intimating that she was engaged in contraband trade and others that her views were hostile and her business war a few dark hints were hazarded on the materiality of her construction for nothing of artificial formation it was urged would be ventured by men in such a dangerous place at a time when even the most inexperienced landsman was enabled to foretell the certain gale the scotchman who to all the sagacity of his countrymen added no small portion of their superstition leaned greatly to the latter conclusion and had begun to express this sentiment warily with reverence when the child of erin who appeared not to possess any very definite ideas on the subject interrupted him by exclaiming  faith theres two of them a big and a little sure the bogles of the saa likes good company the same as any other christians  twa echoed the drover twa ill luck bides o some o ye twa craft a sailing without hand to guide them in sic a place as this whar eyesight is na guid enough to show the dangers bodes evil to a that luik thereon hoot shes na yearling the tither luik mon luik shes a gallant boat and a grat he paused raised his pack from the ground and first giving one searching look at the objects of his suspicions he nodded with great sagacity to the listeners and continued as he moved slowly towards the interior of the country i should na wonder if she carried king georges commission aboot her weel weel i wull journey upward to the town and ha a crack wi the good mon for they craft have a suspeecious aspect and the sma bit thing wuld nab a mon quite easy and the big ane wuld hold us a and no feel we war in her  this sagacious warning caused a general movement in the party for the intelligence of a hot press was among the rumors of the times the husbandmen collected their implements of labor and retired homewards though many a curious eye was bent on the movements of the vessels from the distant hills but very few of those not immediately interested in the mysterious visitors ventured to approach the little rocky cliffs that lined the bay  the vessel that occasioned these cautious movements was a gallant ship whose huge hull lofty masts and square yards loomed in the evenings haze above the sea like a distant mountain rising from the deep she carried but little sail and though she warily avoided the near approach to the land that the schooner had attempted the similarity of their movements was sufficiently apparent to warrant the conjecture that they were employed on the same duty the frigate for the ship belonged to this class of vessels floated across the entrance of the little bay majestically in the tide with barely enough motion through the water to govern her movements until she arrived opposite to the place where her consort lay when she hove up heavily into the wind squared the enormous yards on her mainmast and attempted in counteracting the power of her sails by each other to remain stationary but the light air that had at no time swelled her heavy canvas to the utmost began to fail and the long waves that rolled in from the ocean ceased to be ruffled with the breeze from the land the currents and the billows were fast sweeping the frigate towards one of the points of the estuary where the black heads of the rocks could be seen running far into the sea and in their turn the mariners of the ship dropped an anchor to the bottom and drew her sails in festoons to the yards as the vessel swung round to the tide a heavy ensign was raised to her peak and a current of air opening for a moment its folds the white field and red cross that distinguish the flag of england were displayed to view so much even the wary drover had loitered at a distance to behold but when a boat was launched from either vessel he quickened his steps observing to his wondering and amused companions that they craft were athegither mair bonny to luik on than to abide wi  a numerous crew manned the barge that was lowered from the frigate which after receiving an officer with an attendant youth left the ship and moved with a measured stroke of its oars directly towards the head of the bay as it passed at a short distance from the schooner a light whaleboat pulled by four athletic men shot from her side and rather dancing over than cutting through the waves crossed her course with a wonderful velocity as the boats approached each other the men in obedience to signals from their officers suspended their efforts and for a few minutes they floated at rest during which time there was the following dialogue  is the old man mad exclaimed the young officer in the whaleboat when his men had ceased rowing does he think that the bottom of the ariel is made of iron and that a rock cant knock a hole in it or does he think she is manned with alligators who cant be drowned  a languid smile played for a moment round the handsome features of the young man who was rather reclining than sitting in the sternsheets of the barge as he replied  he knows your prudence too well captain barnstable to fear either the wreck of your vessel or the drowning of her crew how near the bottom does your keel lie  i am afraid to sound returned barnstable i have never the heart to touch a leadline when i see the rocks coming up to breathe like so many porpoises  you are afloat exclaimed the other with a vehemence that denoted an abundance of latent fire  afloat echoed his friend ay the little ariel would float in air as he spoke he rose in the boat and lifting his leathern seacap from his head stroked back the thick clusters of black locks which shadowed his sunburnt countenance while he viewed his little vessel with the complacency of a seaman who was proud of her qualities but its close work mr griffith when a man rides to a single anchor in a place like this and at such a nightfall what are the orders  i shall pull into the surf and let go a grapnel you will take mr merry into your whaleboat and try to drive her through the breakers on the beach  beach retorted barnstable do you call a perpendicular rock of a hundred feet in height a beach  we shall not dispute about terms said griffith smiling but you must manage to get on the shore we have seen the signal from the land and know that the pilot whom we have so long expected is ready to come off  barnstable shook his head with a grave air as he muttered to himself this is droll navigation first we run into an unfrequented bay that is full of rocks and sandpits and shoals and then we get off our pilot but how am i to know him  merry will give you the password and tell you where to look for him i would land myself but my orders forbid it if you meet with difficulties show three oarblades in a row and i will pull in to your assistance three oars on end and a pistol will bring the fire of my muskets and the signal repeated from the barge will draw a shot from the ship  i thank you i thank you said barnstable carelessly i believe i can fight my own battles against all the enemies we are likely to fall in with on this coast but the old man is surely mad i would  you would obey his orders if he were here and you will now please to obey mine said griffith in a tone that the friendly expression of his eye contradicted pull in and keep a lookout for a small man in a drab peajacket merry will give you the word if he answer it bring him off to the barge  the young men now nodded familiarly and kindly to each other and the boy who was called mr merry having changed his place from the barge to the whaleboat barnstable threw himself into his seat and making a signal with his hand his men again bent to their oars the light vessel shot away from her companion and dashed in boldly towards the rocks after skirting the shore for some distance in quest of a favorable place she was suddenly turned and dashing over the broken waves was run upon a spot where a landing could be effected in safety  in the mean time the barge followed these movements at some distance with a more measured progress and when the whaleboat was observed to be drawn up alongside of a rock the promised grapnel was cast into the water and her crew deliberately proceeded to get their firearms in a state for immediate service everything appeared to be done in obedience to strict orders that must have been previously communicated for the young man who has been introduced to the reader by the name of griffith seldom spoke and then only in the pithy expressions that are apt to fall from those who are sure of obedience when the boat had brought up to her grapnel he sunk back at his length on the cushioned seats of the barge and drawing his hat over his eyes in a listless manner he continued for many minutes apparently absorbed in thoughts altogether foreign to his present situation occasionally he rose and would first bend his looks in quest of his companions on the shore and then turning his expressive eyes toward the ocean the abstracted and vacant air that so often usurped the place of animation and intelligence in his countenance would give place to the anxious and intelligent look of a seaman gifted with an experience beyond his years his weather beaten and hardy crew having made their dispositions for offence sat in profound silence with their hands thrust into the bosoms of their jackets but with their eyes earnestly regarding every cloud that was gathering in the threatening atmosphere and exchanging looks of deep care whenever the boat rose higher than usual on one of those long heavy groundswells that were heaving in from the ocean with increasing rapidity and magnitude     chapter ii    a horsemans coat shall hide   thy taper shape and comeliness of side   and with a bolder stride and looser air   mingled with men a man thou must appear   prior   when the whaleboat obtained the position we have described the young lieutenant who in consequence of commanding a schooner was usually addressed by the title of captain stepped on the rocks followed by the youthful midshipman who had quitted the barge to aid in the hazardous duty of their expedition  this is at best but a jacobs ladder we have to climb said barnstable casting his eyes upward at the difficult ascent and its by no means certain that we shall be well received when we get up even though we should reach the top  we are under the guns of the frigate returned the boy and you remember sir three oarblades and a pistol repeated from the barge will draw her fire  yes on our own heads boy never be so foolish as to trust a long shot it makes a great smoke and some noise but its a terrible uncertain manner of throwing old iron about in such a business as this i would sooner trust tom coffin and his harpoon to back me than the best broadside that ever rattled out of the three decks of a ninetygun ship come gather your limbs together and try if you can walk on terra firma master coffin  the seaman who was addressed by this dire appellation arose slowly from the place where he was stationed as cockswain of the boat and seemed to ascend high in air by the gradual evolution of numberless folds in his body when erect he stood nearly six feet and as many inches in his shoes though when elevated in his perpendicular attitude there was a forward inclination about his head and shoulders that appeared to be the consequence of habitual confinement in limited lodgings his whole frame was destitute of the rounded outlines of a wellformed man though his enormous hands furnished a display of bones and sinews which gave indication of gigantic strength on his head he wore a little low brown hat of wool with an arched top that threw an expression of peculiar solemnity and hardness over his hard visage the sharp prominent features of which were completely encircled by a set of black whiskers that began to be grizzled a little with age one of his hands grasped with a sort of instinct the staff of a bright harpoon the lower end of which he placed firmly on the rock as in obedience to the order of his commander he left the place where considering his vast dimensions he had been established in an incredibly small space  as soon as captain barnstable received this addition to his strength he gave a few precautionary orders to the men in the boat and proceeded to the difficult task of ascending the rocks notwithstanding the great daring and personal agility of barnstable he would have been completely baffled in this attempt but for the assistance he occasionally received from his cockswain whose prodigious strength and great length of limbs enabled him to make exertions which it would have been useless for most men to attempt when within a few feet of the summit they availed themselves of a projecting rock to pause for consultation and breath both of which seemed necessary for their further movements  this will be but a bad place for a retreat if we should happen to fall in with enemies said barnstable where are we to look for this pilot mr merry or how are we to know him and what certainty have you that he will not betray us  the question you are to put to him is written on this bit of paper returned the boy as he handed the other the word of recognition we made the signal on the point of the rock at yon headland but as he must have seen our boat he will follow us to this place as to his betraying us he seems to have the confidence of captain munson who has kept a bright lookout for him ever since we made the land  ay muttered the lieutenant and i shall have a bright lookout kept on him now we are on the land i like not this business of hugging the shore so closely nor have i much faith in any traitor what think you of it master coffin  the hardy old seaman thus addressed turned his grave visage on his commander and replied with a becoming gravity  give me a plenty of searoom and good canvas where there is no occasion for pilots at all sir for my part i was born on board a chebaccoman and never could see the use of more land than now and then a small island to raise a few vegetables and to dry your fishim sure the sight of it always makes me feel uncomfortable unless we have the wind dead off shore  ah tom you are a sensible fellow said barnstable with an air half comic half serious but we must be moving the sun is just touching those clouds to seaward and god keep us from riding out this night at anchor in such a place as this  laying his hand on a projection of the rock above him barnstable swung himself forward and following this movement with a desperate leap or two he stood at once on the brow of the cliff his cockswain very deliberately raised the midshipman after his officer and proceeding with more caution but less exertion he soon placed himself by his side  when they reached the level land that lay above the cliffs and began to inquire with curious and wary eyes into the surrounding scenery the adventurers discovered a cultivated country divided in the usual manner by hedges and walls only one habitation for man however and that a small dilapidated cottage stood within a mile of them most of the dwellings being placed as far as convenience would permit from the fogs and damps of the ocean  here seems to be neither anything to apprehend nor the object of our search said barnstable when he had taken the whole view in his survey i fear we have landed to no purpose mr merry what say you long tom see you what we want  i see no pilot sir returned the cockswain but its an ill wind that blows luck to nobody there is a mouthful of fresh meat stowed away under that row of bushes that would make a double ration to all hands in the ariel  the midshipman laughed as he pointed out to barnstable the object of the cockswains solicitude which proved to be a fat ox quietly ruminating under a hedge near them  theres many a hungry fellow aboard of us said the boy merrily who would be glad to second long toms motion if the time and business would permit us to slay the animal  it is but a lubbers blow mr merry returned the cockswain without a muscle of his hard face yielding as he struck the end of his harpoon violently against the earth and then made a motion toward poising the weapon let captain barnstable but say the word and ill drive the iron through him to the quick ive sent it to the seizing in many a whale that hadnt a jacket of such blubber as that fellow wears  pshaw you are not on a whalingvoyage where everything that offers is game said barnstable turning himself pettishly away from the beast as if he distrusted his own forbearance but stand fast i see some one approaching behind the hedge look to your arms mr merrythe first thing we hear may be a shot  not from that cruiser cried the thoughtless lad he is a younker like myself and would hardly dare run down upon such a formidable force as we muster  you say true boy returned barnstable relinquishing the grasp he held on his pistol he comes on with caution as if afraid he is small and is in drab though i should hardly call it a peajacketand yet he may be our man stand you both here while i go and hail him  as barnstable walked rapidly towards the hedge that in part concealed the stranger the latter stopped suddenly and seemed to be in doubt whether to advance or to retreat before he had decided on either the active sailor was within a few feet of him  pray sir said barnstable what water have we in this bay  the slight form of the stranger started with an extraordinary emotion at this question and he shrunk aside involuntarily as if to conceal his features before he answered in a voice that was barely audible  i should think it would be the water of the german ocean  indeed you must have passed no small part of your short life in the study of geography to be so well informed returned the lieutenant perhaps sir your cunning is also equal to telling me how long we shall sojourn together if i make you a prisoner in order to enjoy the benefit of your wit  to this alarming intimation the youth who was addressed made no reply but as he averted his face and concealed it with both his hands the offended seaman believing that a salutary impression had been made upon the fears of his auditor was about to proceed with his interrogatories the singular agitation of the strangers frame however caused the lieutenant to continue silent a few moments longer when to his utter amazement he discovered that what he had mistaken for alarm was produced by an endeavor on the part of the youth to suppress a violent fit of laughter  now by all the whales in the sea cried barnstable but you are merry out of season young gentleman its quite bad enough to be ordered to anchor in such a bay as this with a storm brewing before my eyes without landing to be laughed at by a stripling who has not strength to carry a beard if he had one when i ought to be getting an offing for the safety of both body and soul but ill know more of you and your jokes if i take you into my own mess and am giggled out of my sleep for the rest of the cruise  as the commander of the schooner concluded he approached the stranger with an air of offering some violence but the other shrank back from his extended arm and exclaimed with a voice in which real terror had gotten the better of mirth  barnstable dear barnstable would you harm me  the sailor recoiled several feet at this unexpected appeal and rubbing his eyes he threw the cap from his head before he cried  what do i hear and what do i see there lies the arieland yonder is the frigate can this be katherine plowden  his doubts if any doubts remained were soon removed for the stranger sank on the bank at her side in an attitude in which female bashfulness was beautifully contrasted with her attire and gave vent to her mirth in an uncontrollable burst of merriment  from that moment all thoughts of his duty and the pilot or even of the ariel appeared to be banished from the mind of the seaman who sprang to her side and joined in her mirth though he hardly knew why or wherefore  when the diverted girl had in some degree recovered her composure she turned to her companion who had sat goodnaturedly by her side content to be laughed at and said  but this is not only silly but cruel to others i owe you an explanation of my unexpected appearance and perhaps also of my extraordinary attire  i can anticipate everything cried barnstable you heard that we were on the coast and have flown to redeem the promises you made me in america but i ask no more the chaplain of the frigate  may preach as usual and to as little purpose interrupted the disguised female but no nuptial benediction shall be pronounced over me until i have effected the object of this hazardous experiment you are not usually selfish barnstable would you have me forgetful of the happiness of others  of whom do you speak  my poor my devoted cousin i heard that two vessels answering the description of the frigate and the ariel were seen hovering on the coast and i determined at once to have a communication with you i have followed your movements for a week in this dress but have been unsuccessful till now today i observed you to approach nearer to the shore than usual and happily by being adventurous i have been successful  ay god knows we are near enough to the land but does captain munson know of your wish to get on board his ship  certainly notnone know of it but yourself i thought that if griffith and you could learn our situation you might be tempted to hazard a little to redeem us from our thraldom in this paper i have prepared such an account as will i trust excite all your chivalry and by which you may govern your movements  our movements interrupted barnstable you will pilot us in person  then theres two of them said a hoarse voice near them  the alarmed female shrieked as she recovered her feet but she still adhered with instinctive dependence to the side of her lover barnstable who recognized the tones of his cockswain bent an angry brow on the sober visage that was peering at them above the hedge and demanded the meaning of the interruption  seeing you were hull down sir and not knowing but the chase might lead you ashore mr merry thought it best to have a lookout kept i told him that you were overhauling the mailbags of the messenger for the news but as he was an officer sir and i nothing but a common hand i did as he ordered  return sir where i commanded you to remain said barnstable and desire mr merry to wait my pleasure  the cockswain gave the usual reply of an obedient seaman but before he left the hedge he stretched out one of his brawny arms towards the ocean and said in tones of solemnity suited to his apprehensions and character  i showed you how to knot a reefpoint and pass a gasket captain barnstable nor do i believe you could even take two halfhitches when you first came aboard of the spalmacitty these be things that a man is soon expart in but it takes the time of his natral life to larn to know the weather there be streaked windgalls in the offing that speak as plainly to all that see them and know gods language in the clouds as ever you spoke through a trumpet to shorten sail besides sir dont you hear the sea moaning as if it knew the hour was at hand when it was to wake up from its sleep  ay tom returned his officer walking to the edge of the cliffs and throwing a seamans glance at the gloomy ocean tis a threatening night indeed but this pilot must be hadand  is that the man interrupted the cockswain pointing toward a man who was standing not far from them an attentive observer of their proceedings the same time that he was narrowly watched himself by the young midshipman god send that he knows his trade well for the bottom of a ship will need eyes to find its road out of this wild anchorage  that must indeed be the man exclaimed barnstable at once recalled to his duty he then held a short dialogue with his female companion whom he left concealed by the hedge and proceeded to address the stranger when near enough to be heard the commander of the schooner demanded  what water have you in this bay  the stranger who seemed to expect this question answered without the least hesitation  enough to take all out in safety who have entered with confidence  you are the man i seek cried barnstable are you ready to go off  both ready and willing returned the pilot and there is need of haste i would give the best hundred guineas that ever were coined for two hours more use of that sun which has left us or for even the time of this fading twilight  think you our situation so bad said the lieutenant follow this gentleman to the boat then i will join you by the time you can descend the cliffs i believe i can prevail on another hand to go off with us  time is more precious now than any number of hands said the pilot throwing a glance of impatience from under his lowering brows and the consequences of delay must be visited on those who occasion it  and sir i will meet the consequences with those who have a right to inquire into my conduct said barnstable haughtily  with this warning and retort they separated the young officer retracing his steps impatiently toward his mistress muttering his indignation in suppressed execrations and the pilot drawing the leathern belt of his peajacket mechanically around his body as he followed the midshipman and cockswain to their boat in moody silence  barnstable found the disguised female who had announced herself as katherine plowden awaiting his return with intense anxiety depicted on every feature of her intelligent countenance as he felt all the responsibility of his situation notwithstanding his cool reply to the pilot the young man hastily drew an arm of the apparent boy forgetful of her disguise through his own and led her forward  come katherine he said the time urges to be prompt  what pressing necessity is there for immediate departure she inquired checking his movements by withdrawing herself from his side  you heard the ominous prognostic of my cockswain on the weather and i am forced to add my own testimony to his opinion tis a crazy night that threatens us though i cannot repent of coming into the bay since it has led to this interview  god forbid that we should either of us have cause to repent of it said katherine the paleness of anxiety chasing away the rich bloom that had mantled the animated face of the brunette but you have the paper follow its directions and come to our rescue you will find us willing captives if griffith and yourself are our conquerors  what mean you katherine exclaimed her lover you at least are now in safetytwould be madness to tempt your fate again my vessel can and shall protect you until your cousin is redeemed and then remember i have a claim on you for life  and how would you dispose of me in the interval said the young maiden retreating slowly from his advances  in the arielby heaven you shall be her commander i will bear that rank only in name  i thank you thank you barnstable but distrust my abilities to fill such a station she said laughing though the color that again crossed her youthful features was like the glow of a summers sunset and even her mirthful eyes seemed to reflect their tints do not mistake me saucy one if i have done more than my sex will warrant remember it was through a holy motive and if i have more than a womans enterprise it must be  to lift you above the weakness of your sex he cried and to enable you to show your noble confidence in me  to fit me for and to keep me worthy of being one day your wife as she uttered these words she turned and disappeared with a rapidity that eluded his attempts to detain her behind an angle of the hedge that was near them for a moment barnstable remained motionless through surprise and when he sprang forward in pursuit he was able only to catch a glimpse of her light form in the gloom of the evening as she again vanished in a little thicket at some distance  barnstable was about to pursue when the air lighted with a sudden flash and the bellowing report of a cannon rolled along the cliffs and was echoed among the hills far inland  ay grumble away old dotard the disappointed young sailor muttered to himself while he reluctantly obeyed the signal you are in as great a hurry to get out of your danger as you were to run into it  the quick reports of three muskets from the barge beneath where he stood urged him to quicken his pace and as he threw himself carelessly down the rugged and dangerous passes of the cliffs his experienced eye beheld the wellknown lights displayed from the frigate which commanded the recall of all her boats     chapter iii    in such a time as this it is not meet   that every nice offence should bear its comment   shakespeare   the cliffs threw their dark shadows wide on the waters and the gloom of the evening had so far advanced as to conceal the discontent that brooded over the ordinarily open brow of barnstable as he sprang from the rocks into the boat and took his seat by the side of the silent pilot shove off cried the lieutenant in tones that his men knew must be obeyed a seamans curse light on the folly that exposes planks and lives to such navigation and all to burn some old timberman or catch a norway trader asleep give way men give way  notwithstanding the heavy and dangerous surf that was beginning to tumble in upon the rocks in an alarming manner the startled seamen succeeded in urging their light boat over the waves and in a few seconds were without the point where danger was most to be apprehended barnstable had seemingly disregarded the breakers as they passed but sat sternly eyeing the foam that rolled by them in successive surges until the boat rose regularly on the long seas when he turned his looks around the bay in quest of the barge  ay griffith has tired of rocking in his pillowed cradle he muttered and will give us a pull to the frigate when we ought to be getting the schooner out of this hardfeatured landscape this is just such a place as one of your sighing lovers would doat on a little land a little water and a good deal of rock damme long tom but i am more than half of your mind that an island now and then is all the terra firma that a seaman needs  its reason and philosophy sir returned the sedate cockswain and what land there is should always be a soft mud or a sandy ooze in order that an anchor might hold and to make soundings sartin i have lost many a deepsea besides hand leads by the dozen on rocky bottoms but give me the roadstead where a lead comes up light and an anchor heavy theres a boat pulling athwart our forefoot captain barnstable shall i run her aboard or give her a berth sir  tis the barge cried the officer ned has not deserted me after all  a loud hail from the approaching boat confirmed this opinion and in a few seconds the barge and whaleboat were again rolling by each others side griffith was no longer reclining on the cushions of his seats but spoke earnestly and with a slight tone of reproach in his manner  why have you wasted so many precious moments when every minute threatens us with new dangers i was obeying the signal but i heard your oars and pulled back to take out the pilot have you been successful  there he is and if he finds his way out through the shoals he will earn a right to his name this bids fair to be a night when a man will need a spyglass to find the moon but when you hear what i have seen on those rascally cliffs you will be more ready to excuse my delay mr griffith  you have seen the true man i trust or we incur this hazard to an evil purpose  ay i have seen him that is a true man and him that is not replied barnstable bitterly you have the boy with you griffithask him what his young eyes have seen  shall i cried the young midshipman laughing then i have seen a little clipper in disguise out sail an old manofwars man in a hard chase and i have seen a straggling rover in longtogs as much like my cousin  peace gabbler exclaimed barnstable in a voice of thunder would you detain the boats with your silly nonsense at a time like this away into the barge sir and if you find him willing to hear tell mr griffith what your foolish conjectures amount to at your leisure  the boy stepped lightly from the whaleboat to the barge whither the pilot had already preceded him and as he sunk with a mortified air by the side of griffith he said in a low voice  and that wont be long i know if mr griffith thinks and feels on the coast of england as he thought and felt at home  a silent pressure of his hand was the only reply that the young lieutenant made before he paid the parting compliments to barnstable and directed his men to pull for their ship  the boats were separating and the plash of the oars was already heard when the voice of the pilot was for the first time raised in earnest  hold he cried hold water i bid ye  the men ceased their efforts at the commanding tones of his voice and turning toward the whaleboat he continued  you will get your schooner under way immediately captain barnstable and sweep into the offing with as little delay as possible keep the ship well open from the northern headland and as you pass us come within hail  this is a clean chart and plain sailing mr pilot returned barnstable but who is to justify my moving without orders to captain munson i have it in black and white to run the ariel into this featherbed sort of a place and i must at least have it by signal or word of mouth from my betters before my cutwater curls another wave the road may be as hard to find going out as it was coming inand then i had daylight as well as your written directions to steer by  would you lie there to perish on such a night said the pilot sternly two hours hence this heavy swell will break where your vessel now rides so quietly  there we think exactly alike but if i get drowned now i am drowned according to orders whereas if i knock a plank out of the schooners bottom by following your directions twill be a hole to let in mutiny as well as seawater how do i know but the old man wants another pilot or two  thats philosophy muttered the cockswain of the whaleboat in a voice that was audible but its a hard strain on a mans conscience to hold on in such an anchorage  then keep your anchor down and follow it to the bottom said the pilot to himself its worse to contend with a fool than a gale of wind but if  no no sirno fool neither interrupted griffith barnstable does not deserve that epithet though he certainly carries the point of duty to the extreme heave up at once mr barnstable and get out of this bay as fast as possible  ah you dont give the order with half the pleasure with which i shall execute it pull away boysthe ariel shall never lay her bones in such a hard bed if i can help it  as the commander of the schooner uttered these words with a cheering voice his men spontaneously shouted and the whaleboat darted away from her companion and was soon lost in the gloomy shadows cast from the cliffs  in the mean time the oarsmen of the barge were not idle but by strenuous efforts they forced the heavy boat rapidly through the water and in a few minutes she ran alongside of the frigate during this period the pilot in a voice which had lost all the startling fierceness and authority it had manifested in his short dialogue with barnstable requested griffith to repeat to him slowly the names of the officers that belonged to his ship when the young lieutenant had complied with this request he observed to his companion  all good men and true mr pilot and though this business in which you are just now engaged may be hazardous to an englishman there are none with us who will betray you we need your services and as we expect good faith from you so shall we offer it to you in exchange  and how know you that i need its exercise asked the pilot in a manner that denoted a cold indifference to the subject  why though you talk pretty good english for a native returned griffith yet you have a small burrr in your mouth that would prick the tongue of a man who was born on the other side of the atlantic  it is but of little moment where a man is born or how he speaks returned the pilot coldly so that he does his duty bravely and in good faith  it was perhaps fortunate for the harmony of this dialogue that the gloom which had now increased to positive darkness completely concealed the look of scornful irony that crossed the handsome features of the young sailor as he replied true true so that he does his duty as you say in good faith but as barnstable observed you must know your road well to travel among these shoals on such a night as this know you what water we draw  tis a frigates draught and i shall endeavor to keep you in four fathoms less than that would be dangerous  shes a sweet boat said griffith and minds her helm as a marine watches the eye of his sergeant at a drill but you must give her room in stays for she forereaches as if she would put out the winds eye  the pilot attended with a practised ear to this description of the qualities of the ship that he was about to attempt extricating from an extremely dangerous situation not a syllable was lost on him and when griffith had ended he remarked with the singular coldness that pervaded his manner  that is both a good and a bad quality in a narrow channel i fear it will be the latter tonight when we shall require to have the ship in leadingstrings  i suppose we must feel our way with the lead said griffith  we shall need both eyes and leads returned the pilot recurring insensibly to his soliloquizing tone of voice i have been both in and out in darker nights than this though never with a heavier draught than a halftwo  then by heaven you are not fit to handle that ship among these rocks and breakers exclaimed griffith your men of a light draught never know their water tis the deep keel only that finds a channelpilot pilot beware how you trifle with us ignorantly for tis a dangerous experiment to play at hazards with an enemy  young man you know not what you threaten nor whom said the pilot sternly though his quiet manner still remained undisturbed you forget that you have a superior here and that i have none  that shall be as you discharge your duty said griffith for if  peace interrupted the pilot we approach the ship let us enter in harmony  he threw himself back on the cushions when he had said this and griffith though filled with the apprehensions of suffering either by great ignorance or treachery on the part of his companion smothered his feelings so far as to be silent and they ascended the side of the vessel in apparent cordiality  the frigate was already riding on lengthened seas that rolled in from the ocean at each successive moment with increasing violence though her topsails still hung supinely from her yards the air which continued to breathe occasionally from the land being unable to shake the heavy canvas of which they were composed  the only sounds that were audible when griffith and the pilot had ascended to the gangway of the frigate were produced by the sullen dashing of the sea against the massive bows of the ship and the shrill whistle of the boatswains mate as he recalled the sideboys who were placed on either side of the gangway to do honor to the entrance of the first lieutenant and his companion  but though such a profound silence reigned among the hundreds who inhabited the huge fabric the light produced by a dozen battle lanterns that were arranged in different parts of the decks served not only to exhibit faintly the persons of the crew but the mingled feeling of curiosity and care that dwelt on most of their countenances  large groups of men were collected in the gangways around the mainmast and on the booms of the vessel whose faces were distinctly visible while numerous figures lying along the lower yards or bending out of the tops might be dimly traced in the background all of whom expressed by their attitudes the interest they took in the arrival of the boat  though such crowds were collected in other parts of the vessel the quarterdeck was occupied only by the officers who were disposed according to their several ranks and were equally silent and attentive as the remainder of the crew in front stood a small collection of young men who by their similarity of dress were the equals and companions of griffith though his juniors in rank on the opposite side of the vessel was a larger assemblage of youths who claimed mr merry as their fellow around the capstan three or four figures were standing one of whom wore a coat of blue with the scarlet facings of a soldier and another the black vestments of the ships chaplain behind these and nearer the passage to the cabin from which he had just ascended stood the tall erect form of the commander of the vessel  after a brief salutation between griffith and the junior officers the former advanced followed slowly by the pilot to the place where he was expected by his veteran commander the young man removed his hat entirely as he bowed with a little more than his usual ceremony and said  we have succeeded sir though not without more difficulty and delay than were anticipated  but you have not brought off the pilot said the captain and without him all our risk and trouble have been in vain  he is here said griffith stepping aside and extending his arm towards the man that stood behind him wrapped to the chin in his coarse peajacket and his face shadowed by the falling rims of a large hat that had seen much and hard service  this exclaimed the captain then there is a sad mistakethis is not the man i would have seen nor can another supply his place  i know not whom you expected captain munson said the stranger in a low quiet voice but if you have not forgotten the day when a very different flag from that emblem of tyranny that now hangs over yon taffrail was first spread to the wind you may remember the hand that raised it  bring here the light exclaimed the commander hastily  when the lantern was extended towards the pilot and the glare fell strong on his features captain munson started as he beheld the calm blue eye that met his gaze and the composed but pallid countenance of the other involuntarily raising his hat and baring his silver locks the veteran cried  it is he though so changed  that his enemies did not know him interrupted the pilot quickly then touching the other by the arm as he led him aside he continued in a lower tone neither must his friends until the proper hour shall arrive  griffith had fallen back to answer the eager questions of his messmates and no part of this short dialogue was overheard by the officers though it was soon perceived that their commander had discovered his error and was satisfied that the proper man had been brought on board his vessel for many minutes the two continued to pace a part of the quarterdeck by themselves engaged in deep and earnest discourse  as griffith had but little to communicate the curiosity of his listeners was soon appeased and all eyes were directed toward that mysterious guide who was to conduct them from a situation already surrounded by perils which each moment not only magnified in appearance but increased in reality     chapter iv    behold the threaden sails   borne with the invisible and creeping winds   draw the huge bottoms through the furrowed sea   breasting the lofty surge   shakespeare   it has been already explained to the reader that there were threatening symptoms in the appearance of the weather to create serious forebodings of evil in the breast of a seaman when removed from the shadows of the cliffs the night was not so dark but objects could be discerned at some little distance and in the eastern horizon there was a streak of fearful light impending over the gloomy waters in which the swelling outline formed by the rising waves was becoming each moment more distinct and consequently more alarming several dark clouds overhung the vessel whose towering masts apparently propped the black vapor while a few stars were seen twinkling with a sickly flame in the streak of clear sky that skirted the ocean still light currents of air occasionally swept across the bay bringing with them the fresh odor from the shore but their flitting irregularity too surely foretold them to be the expiring breath of the land breeze the roaring of the surf as it rolled on the margin of the bay produced a dull monotonous sound that was only interrupted at times by a hollow bellowing as a larger wave than usual broke violently against some cavity in the rock everything in short united to render the scene gloomy and portentous without creating instant terror for the ship rose easily on the long billows without even straightening the heavy cable that held her to her anchor  the higher officers were collected around the capstan engaged in earnest discourse about their situation and prospects while some of the oldest and most favored seamen would extend their short walk to the hallowed precincts of the quarterdeck to catch with greedy ears the opinions that fell from their superiors numberless were the uneasy glances that were thrown from both officers and men at their commander and the pilot who still continued their secret communion in a distant part of the vessel once an ungovernable curiosity or the heedlessness of his years led one of the youthful midshipmen near them but a stern rebuke from his captain sent the boy abashed and cowering to hide his mortification among his fellows this reprimand was received by the elder officers as an intimation that the consultation which they beheld was to be strictly inviolate and though it by no means suppressed the repeated expressions of their impatience it effectually prevented an interruption to the communications which all however thought were unreasonably protracted for the occasion  this is no time to be talking over bearings and distances observed the officer next in rank to griffith but we should call the hands up and try to kedge her off while the sea will suffer a boat to live  twould be a tedious and bootless job to attempt warping a ship for miles against a headbeating sea returned the first lieutenant but the landbreeze yet flutters aloft and if our light sails would draw with the aid of this ebb tide we might be able to shove her from the shore  hail the tops griffith said the other and ask if they feel the air above twill be a hint at least to set the old man and that lubberly pilot in motion  griffith laughed as he complied with the request and when he received the customary reply to his call he demanded in a loud voice  which way have you the wind aloft  we feel a light catspaw now and then from the land sir returned the sturdy captain of the top but our topsail hangs in the clewlines sir without winking  captain munson and his companion suspended their discourse while this question and answer were exchanged and then resumed their dialogue as earnestly as if it had received no interruption  if it did wink the hint would be lost on our betters said the officer of the marines whose ignorance of seamanship added greatly to his perception of the danger but who from pure idleness made more jokes than any other man in the ship that pilot would not receive a delicate intimation through his ears mr griffith suppose you try him by the nose  faith there was a flash of gunpowder between us in the barge returned the first lieutenant and he does not seem a man to stomach such hints as you advise although he looks so meek and quiet i doubt whether he has paid much attention to the book of job  why should he exclaimed the chaplain whose apprehensions at least equaled those of the marine and with a much more disheartening effect i am sure it would have been a great waste of time there are so many charts of the coast and books on the navigation of these seas for him to study that i sincerely hope he has been much better employed  a loud laugh was created at this speech among the listeners and it apparently produced the effect that was so long anxiously desired by putting an end to the mysterious conference between their captain and the pilot as the former came forward towards his expecting crew he said is the composed steady manner that formed the principal trait in his character  get the anchor mr griffith and make sail on the ship the hour has arrived when we must be moving  the cheerful ay ay sir of the young lieutenant was hardly uttered before the cries of half a dozen midshipmen were heard summoning the boatswain and his mates to their duty  there was a general movement in the living masses that clustered around the mainmast on the booms and in the gangways though their habits of discipline held the crew a moment longer in suspense the silence was first broken by the sound of the boatswains whistle followed by the hoarse cry of all hands up anchor ahoythe former rising on the night air from its first low mellow notes to a piercing shrillness that gradually died away on the waters and the latter bellowing through every cranny of the ship like the hollow murmurs of distant thunder  the change produced by the customary summons was magical human beings sprang out from between the guns rushed up the hatches threw themselves with careless activity from the booms and gathered from every quarter so rapidly that in an instant the deck of the frigate was alive with men the profound silence that had hitherto been only interrupted by the low dialogue of the officers was now changed for the stern orders of the lieutenants mingled with the shriller cries of the midshipmen and the hoarse bawling of the boatswains crew rising above the tumult of preparation and general bustle  the captain and the pilot alone remained passive in this scene of general exertion for apprehension had even stimulated that class of officers which is called idlers to unusual activity though frequently reminded by their more experienced messmates that instead of aiding they retarded the duty of the vessel the bustle however gradually ceased and in a few minutes the same silence pervaded the ship as before  we are broughtto sir said griffith who stood overlooking the scene holding in one hand a short speaking trumpet and grasping with the other one of the shrouds of the ship to steady himself in the position he had taken on a gun  heave round sir was the calm reply  heave round repeated griffith aloud  heave round echoed a dozen eager voices at once and the lively strains of a fife struck up a brisk air to enliven the labor the capstan was instantly set in motion and the measured tread of the seamen was heard as they stamped the deck in the circle of their march for a few minutes no other sounds were heard if we except the voice of an officer occasionally cheering the sailors when it was announced that they were short or in other words that the ship was nearly over her anchor  heave and pull cried griffith when the quivering notes of the whistle were again succeeded by a general stillness in the vessel  what is to be done now sir continued the lieutenant shall we trip the anchor there seems not a breath of air and as the tide runs slack i doubt whether the sea do not heave the ship ashore  there was so much obvious truth in this conjecture that all eyes turned from the light and animation afforded by the decks of the frigate to look abroad on the waters in a vain desire to pierce the darkness as if to read the fate of their apparently devoted ship from the aspect of nature  i leave all to the pilot said the captain after he had stood a short time by the side of griffith anxiously studying the heavens and the ocean what say you mr gray  the man who was thus first addressed by name was leaning over the bulwarks with his eyes bent in the same direction as the others but as he answered he turned his face towards the speaker and the light from the deck fell full upon his quiet features which exhibited a calmness bordering on the supernatural considering his station and responsibility  there is much to fear from this heavy groundswell he said in the same unmoved tones as before but there is certain destruction to us if the gale that is brewing in the east finds us waiting its fury in this wild anchorage all the hemp that ever was spun into cordage would not hold a ship an hour chafing on these rocks with a northeaster pouring its fury on her if the powers of man can compass it gentlemen we must get an offing and that speedily  you say no more sir than the youngest boy in the ship can see for himself said griffithha here comes the schooner  the dashing of the long sweeps in the water was now plainly audible and the little ariel was seen through the gloom moving heavily under their feeble impulse as she passed slowly under the stern of the frigate the cheerful voice of barnstable was first heard opening the communications between them  heres a night for spectacles captain munson he cried but i thought i heard your fife sir i trust in god you do not mean to ride it out here till morning  i like the berth as little as yourself mr barnstable returned the veteran seaman in his calm manner in which anxiety was however beginning to grow evident we are short but are afraid to let go our hold of the bottom lest the sea cast us ashore how make you out the wind  wind echoed the other there is not enough to blow a ladys curl aside if you wait sir till the landbreeze fills your sails you will wait another moon i believe ive got my eggshell out of that nest of graycaps but how it has been done in the dark a better man than myself must explain  take your directions from the pilot mr barnstable returned his commanding officer and follow them strictly and to the letter  a deathlike silence in both vessels succeeded this order for all seemed to listen eagerly to catch the words that fell from the man on whom even the boys now felt depended their only hopes for safety a short time was suffered to elapse before his voice was heard in the same low but distinct tones as before  your sweeps will soon be of no service to you he said against the sea that begins to heave in but your light sails will help them to get you out so long as you can head eastandbynorth you are doing well and you can stand on till you open the light from that northern headland when you can heave to and fire a gun but if as i dread you are struck aback before you open the light you may trust to your lead on the larboard tack but beware with your head to the southward for no lead will serve you there  i can walk over the same ground on one tack as on the other said barnstable and make both legs of a length  it will not do returned the pilot if you fall off a point to starboard from eastandbynorth in going large you will find both rocks and points of shoals to bring you up and beware as i tell you of the starboard tack  and how shall i find my way you will let me trust to neither time lead nor log  you must trust to a quick eye and a ready hand the breakers only will show you the dangers when you are not able to make out the bearings of the land tack in season sir and dont spare the lead when you head to port  ay ay returned barnstable in a low muttering voice this is a sort of blind navigation with a vengeance and all for no purpose that i can seesee damme eyesight is of about as much use now as a mans nose would be in reading the bible  softly softly mr barnstable interrupted his commanderfor such was the anxious stillness in both vessels that even the rattling of the schooners rigging was heard as she rolled in the trough of the sea the duty on which congress has sent us must be performed at the hazard of our lives  i dont mind my life captain munson said barnstable but there is a great want of conscience in trusting a vessel in such a place as this however it is a time to do and not to talk but if there be such danger to an easy draught of water what will become of the frigate had i not better play jackal and try and feel the way for you  i thank you said the pilot the offer is generous but would avail us nothing i have the advantage of knowing the ground well and must trust to my memory and gods good favor make sail make sail sir and if you succeed we will venture to break ground  the order was promptly obeyed and in a very short time the ariel was covered with canvas though no air was perceptible on the decks of the frigate the little schooner was so light that she succeeded in stemming her way over the rising waves aided a little by the tide and in a few minutes her low hull was just discernible in the streak of light along the horizon with the dark outline of her sails rising above the sea until their fanciful summits were lost in the shadows of the clouds  griffith had listened to the foregoing dialogue like the rest of the junior officers in profound silence but when the ariel began to grow indistinct to the eye he jumped lightly from the gun to the deck and cried  she slips off like a vessel from the stocks shall i trip the anchor sir and follow  we have no choice replied his captain you hear the question mr gray shall we let go the bottom  it must be done captain munson we may want more drift than the rest of this tide to get us to a place of safety said the pilot i would give five years from a life that i know will be short if the ship lay one mile further seaward  this remark was unheard by all except the commander of the frigate who again walked aside with the pilot where they resumed their mysterious communications the words of assent were no sooner uttered however than griffith gave forth from his trumpet the command to heave away again the strains of the fife were followed by the tread of the men at the capstan at the same time that the anchor was heaving up the sails were loosened from the yards and opened to invite the breeze in effecting this duty orders were thundered through the trumpet of the first lieutenant and executed with the rapidity of thought men were to be seen like spots in the dim light from the heavens lying on every yard or hanging as in air while strange cries were heard issuing from every part of the rigging and each spar of the vessel ready the foreroyal cried a shrill voice as if from the clouds ready the foreyard uttered the hoarser tones of a seaman beneath him all ready aft sir cried a third from another quarter and in a few moments the order was given to let fall  the little light which fell from the sky was now excluded by the falling canvas and a deeper gloom was cast athwart the decks of the ship that served to render the brilliancy of the lanterns even vivid while it gave to objects outboard a more appalling and dreary appearance than before  every individual excepting the commander and his associate was now earnestly engaged in getting the ship under way the sounds of were away were repeated by a burst from fifty voices and the rapid evolutions of the capstan announced that nothing but the weight of the anchor was to be lifted the hauling of cordage the rattling of blocks blended with the shrill calls of the boatswain and his mates succeeded and though to a landsman all would have appeared confusion and hurry long practice and strict discipline enabled the crew to exhibit their ship under a cloud of canvas from her deck to the trucks in less time than we have consumed in relating it  for a few minutes the officers were not disappointed by the result for though the heavy sails flapped lazily against the masts the light duck on the loftier spars swelled outwardly and the ship began sensibly to yield to their influence  she travels she travels exclaimed griffith joyously ah the hussy she has as much antipathy to the land as any fish that swims it blows a little gale aloft yet  we feel its dying breath said the pilot in low soothing tones but in a manner so sudden as to startle griffith at whose elbow they were unexpectedly uttered let us forget young man everything but the number of lives that depend this night on your exertions and my knowledge  if you be but half as able to exhibit the one as i am willing to make the other we shall do well returned the lieutenant in the same tone remember whatever may be your feelings that we are on an enemys coast and love it not enough to wish to lay our bones there  with this brief explanation they separated the vessel requiring the constant and close attention of the officer to her movements  the exultation produced in the crew by the progress of their ship through the water was of short duration for the breeze that had seemed to await their motions after forcing the vessel for a quarter of a mile fluttered for a few minutes amid their light canvas and then left them entirely the quartermaster whose duty it was to superintend the helm soon announced that he was losing the command of the vessel as she was no longer obedient to her rudder this ungrateful intelligence was promptly communicated to his commander by griffith who suggested the propriety of again dropping an anchor  i refer you to mr gray returned the captain he is the pilot sir and with him rests the safety of the vessel  pilots sometimes lose ships as well as save them said griffith know you the man well captain munson who holds all our lives in his keeping and so coolly as if he cared but little for the venture  mr griffith i do know him he is in my opinion both competent and faithful thus much i tell you to relieve your anxiety more you must not askbut is there not a shift of wind  god forbid exclaimed his lieutenant if that northeaster catches us within the shoals our case will be desperate indeed  the heavy rolling of the vessel caused an occasional expansion and as sudden a reaction in their sails which left the oldest seaman in the ship in doubt which way the currents of air were passing or whether there existed any that were not created by the flapping of their own canvas the head of the ship however began to fall off from the sea and notwithstanding the darkness it soon became apparent that she was driving in bodily towards the shore  during these few minutes of gloomy doubt griffith by one of those sudden revulsions of the mind that connect the opposite extremes of feeling lost his animated anxiety and elapsed into the listless apathy that so often came over him even in the most critical moments of trial and danger he was standing with one elbow resting on his capstan shading his eyes from the light of the battlelantern that stood near him with one hand when he felt a gentle pressure of the other that recalled his recollection looking affectionately though still recklessly at the boy who stood at his side he said  dull music mr merry  so dull sir that i cant dance to it returned the midshipman nor do i believe there is a man in the ship who would not rather hear the girl i left behind me than those execrable sounds  what sounds boy the ship is as quiet as the quaker meeting in the jerseys before your good old grandfather used to break the charm of silence with his sonorous voice  ah laugh at my peaceable blood if thou wilt mr griffith said the arch youngster but remember there is a mixture of it in all sorts of veins i wish i could hear one of the old gentlemans chants now sir i could always sleep to them like a gull in the surf but he that sleeps tonight with that lullaby will make a nap of it  sounds i hear no sounds boy but the flapping aloft even that pilot who struts the quarterdeck like an admiral has nothing to say  is not that a sound to open a seamans ear  it is in truth a heavy roll of the surf lad but the night air carries it heavily to our ears know you not the sounds of the surf yet younker  i know it too well mr griffith and do not wish to know it better how fast are we tumbling in towards that surf sir  i think we hold our own said griffith rousing again though we had better anchor luff fellow luffyou are broadside to the sea  the man at the wheel repeated his former intelligence adding a suggestion that he thought the ship was gathering stern way  haul up your courses mr griffith said captain munson and let us feel the wind  the rattling of the blocks was soon heard and the enormous sheets of canvas that hung from the lower yards were instantly suspended in the brails when this change was effected all on board stood silent and breathless as if expecting to learn their fate by the result several contradictory opinions were at length hazarded among the officers when griffith seized the candle from the lantern and springing on one of the guns held it on high exposed to the action of the air the little flame waved with uncertain glimmering for a moment and then burned steadily in a line with the masts griffith was about to lower his extended arm when feeling a slight sensation of coolness on his hand he paused and the light turned slowly toward the land flared flickered and finally deserted the wick  lose not a moment mr griffith cried the pilot aloud clew up and furl everything but your three topsails and let them be doublereefed now is the time to fulfill your promise  the young man paused one moment in astonishment as the clear distinct tones of the stranger struck his ears so unexpectedly but turning his eyes to seaward he sprang on the deck and proceeded to obey the order as if life and death depended on his dispatch     chapter v    she rights she rights boys ware off shore   song   the extraordinary activity of griffith which communicated itself with promptitude to the crew was produced by a sudden alteration in the weather in place of the welldefined streak along the horizon that has been already described an immense body of misty light appeared to be moving in with rapidity from the ocean while a distinct but distant roaring announced the sure approach of the tempest that had so long troubled the waters even griffith while thundering his orders through the trumpet and urging the men by his cries to expedition would pause for instants to cast anxious glances in the direction of the coming storm and the faces of the sailors who lay on the yards were turned instinctively towards the same quarter of the heavens while they knotted the reefpoints or passed the gaskets that were to confine the unruly canvas to the prescribed limits  the pilot alone in that confused and busy throng where voice rose above voice and cry echoed cry in quick succession appeared as if he held no interest in the important stake with his eye steadily fixed on the approaching mist and his arms folded together in composure he stood calmly waiting the result  the ship had fallen off with her broadside to the sea and was become unmanageable and the sails were already brought into the folds necessary to her security when the quick and heavy fluttering of canvas was thrown across the water with all the gloomy and chilling sensations that such sounds produce where darkness and danger unite to appall the seaman  the schooner has it cried griffith barnstable has held on like himself to the last momentgod send that the squall leave him cloth enough to keep him from the shore  his sails are easily handled the commander observed and she must be over the principal danger we are falling off before it mr gray shall we try a cast of the lead  the pilot turned from his contemplative posture and moved slowly across the deck before he returned any reply to this questionlike a man who not only felt that everything depended on himself but that he was equal to the emergency  tis unnecessary he at length said twould be certain destruction to be taken aback and it is difficult to say within several points how the wind may strike us  tis difficult no longer cried griffith for here it comes and in right earnest  the rushing sounds of the wind were now indeed heard at hand and the words were hardly past the lips of the young lieutenant before the vessel bowed down heavily to one side and then as she began to move through the water rose again majestically to her upright position as if saluting like a courteous champion the powerful antagonist with which she was about to contend not another minute elapsed before the ship was throwing the waters aside with a lively progress and obedient to her helm was brought as near to the desired course as the direction of the wind would allow the hurry and bustle on the yards gradually subsided and the men slowly descended to the deck all straining their eyes to pierce the gloom in which they were enveloped and some shaking their heads in melancholy doubt afraid to express the apprehensions they really entertained all on board anxiously waited for the fury of the gale for there were none so ignorant or inexperienced in that gallant frigate as not to know that as yet they only felt the infant effects of the wind each moment however it increased in power though so gradual was the alteration that the relieved mariners began to believe that all their gloomy forebodings were not to be realized during this short interval of uncertainty no other sounds were heard than the whistling of the breeze as it passed quickly through the mass of rigging that belonged to the vessel and the dashing of the spray that began to fly from her bows like the foam of a cataract  it blows fresh cried griffith who was the first to speak in that moment of doubt and anxiety but it is no more than a capful of wind after all give us elbowroom and the right canvas mr pilot and ill handle the ship like a gentlemans yacht in this breeze  will she stay think ye under this sail said the low voice of the stranger  she will do all that man in reason can ask of wood and iron returned the lieutenant but the vessel dont float the ocean that will tack under doublereefed topsails alone against a heavy sea help her with her courses pilot and you shall see her come round like a dancingmaster  let us feel the strength of the gale first returned the man who was called mr gray moving from the side of griffith to the weather gangway of the vessel where he stood in silence looking ahead of the ship with an air of singular coolness and abstraction  all the lanterns had been extinguished on the deck of the frigate when her anchor was secured and as the first mist of the gale had passed over it was succeeded by a faint light that was a good deal aided by the glittering foam of the waters which now broke in white curls around the vessel in every direction the land could be faintly discerned rising like a heavy bank of black fog above the margin of the waters and was only distinguishable from the heavens by its deeper gloom and obscurity the last rope was coiled and deposited in its proper place by the seamen and for several minutes the stillness of death pervaded the crowded decks it was evident to every one that their ship was dashing at a prodigious rate through the waves and as she was approaching with such velocity the quarter of the bay where the shoals and dangers were known to be situated nothing but the habits of the most exact discipline could suppress the uneasiness of the officers and men within their own bosoms at length the voice of captain munson was heard calling to the pilot  shall i send a hand into the chains mr gray he said and try our water  although this question was asked aloud and the interest it excited drew many of the officers and men around him in eager impatience for his answer it was unheeded by the man to whom it was addressed his head rested on his hand as he leaned over the hammockcloths of the vessel and his whole air was that of one whose thoughts wandered from the pressing necessity of their situation griffith was among those who had approached the pilot and after waiting a moment from respect to hear the answer to his commanders question he presumed on his own rank and leaving the circle that stood at a little distance stepped to the side of the mysterious guardian of their lives  captain munson desires to know whether you wish a cast of the lead said the young officer with a little impatience of manner no immediate answer was made to this repetition of the question and griffith laid his hand unceremoniously on the shoulder of the other with an intent to rouse him before he made another application for a reply but the convulsive start of the pilot held him silent in amazement  fall back there said the lieutenant sternly to the men who were closing around them in compact circle away with you to your stations and see all clear for stays the dense mass of heads dissolved at this order like the water of one of the waves commingling with the ocean and the lieutenant and his companions were left by themselves  this is not a time for musing mr gray continued griffith remember our compact and look to your chargeis it not time to put the vessel in stays of what are you dreaming  the pilot laid his hand on the extended arm of the lieutenant and grasped it with a convulsive pressure as he answered  tis a dream of reality you are young mr griffith nor am i past the noon of life but should you live fifty years longer you never can see and experience what i have encountered in my little period of threeand thirty years  a good deal astonished at this burst of feeling so singular at such a moment the young sailor was at a loss for a reply but as his duty was uppermost in his thoughts he still dwelt on the theme that most interested him  i hope much of your experience has been on this coast for the ship travels lively he said and the daylight showed us so much to dread that we do not feel overvaliant in the dark how much longer shall we stand on upon this tack  the pilot turned slowly from the side of the vessel and walked towards the commander of the frigate as he replied in a tone that seemed deeply agitated by his melancholy reflections  you have your wish then much very much of my early life was passed on this dreaded coast what to you is all darkness and gloom to me is as light as if a noonday sun shone upon it but tack your ship sir tack your ship i would see how she works before we reach the point where she must behave well or we perish  griffith gazed after him in wonder while the pilot slowly paced the quarterdeck and then rousing from his trance gave forth the cheering order that called each man to his station to perform the desired evolution the confident assurances which the young officer had given to the pilot respecting the qualities of his vessel and his own ability to manage her were fully realized by the result the helm was no sooner put alee than the huge ship bore up gallantly against the wind and dashing directly through the waves threw the foam high into the air as she looked boldly into the very eye of the wind and then yielding gracefully to its power she fell off on the other tack with her head pointed from those dangerous shoals that she had so recently approached with such terrifying velocity the heavy yards swung round as if they had been vanes to indicate the currents of the air and in a few moments the frigate again moved with stately progress through the water leaving the rocks and shoals behind her on one side of the bay but advancing towards those that offered equal danger on the other  during this time the sea was becoming more agitated and the violence of the wind was gradually increasing the latter no longer whistled amid the cordage of the vessel but it seemed to howl surlily as it passed the complicated machinery that the frigate obtruded on its path an endless succession of white surges rose above the heavy billows and the very air was glittering with the light that was disengaged from the ocean the ship yielded each moment more and more before the storm and in less than half an hour from the time that she had lifted her anchor she was driven along with tremendous fury by the full power of a gale of wind still the hardy and experienced mariners who directed her movements held her to the course that was necessary to their preservation and still griffith gave forth when directed by their unknown pilot those orders that turned her in the narrow channel where alone safety was to be found  so far the performance of his duty appeared easy to the stranger and he gave the required directions in those still calm tones that formed so remarkable a contrast to the responsibility of his situation but when the land was becoming dim in distance as well as darkness and the agitated sea alone was to be discovered as it swept by them in foam he broke in upon the monotonous roaring of the tempest with the sounds of his voice seeming to shake off his apathy and rouse himself to the occasion  now is the time to watch her closely mr griffith he cried here we get the true tide and the real danger place the best quartermaster of your ship in those chains and let an officer stand by him and see that he gives us the right water  i will take that office on myself said the captain pass a light into the weather mainchains  stand by your braces exclaimed the pilot with startling quickness heave away that lead  these preparations taught the crew to expect the crisis and every officer and man stood in fearful silence at his assigned station awaiting the issue of the trial even the quartermaster at the cun gave out his orders to the men at the wheel in deeper and hoarser tones than usual as if anxious not to disturb the quiet and order of the vessel  while this deep expectation pervaded the frigate the piercing cry of the leadsman as he called by the mark seven rose above the tempest crossed over the decks and appeared to pass away to leeward borne on the blast like the warnings of some waterspirit  tis well returned the pilot calmly try it again  the short pause was succeeded by another cry and a halffive  she shoals she shoals exclaimed griffith keep her a good full  ay you must hold the vessel in command now said the pilot with those cool tones that are most appalling in critical moments because they seem to denote most preparation and care  the third call by the deep four was followed by a prompt direction from the stranger to tack  griffith seemed to emulate the coolness of the pilot in issuing the necessary orders to execute this manoeuvre  the vessel rose slowly from the inclined position into which she had been forced by the tempest and the sails were shaking violently as if to release themselves from their confinement while the ship stemmed the billows when the wellknown voice of the sailingmaster was heard shouting from the forecastle  breakers breakers dead ahead  this appalling sound seemed yet to be lingering about the ship when a second voice cried  breakers on our lee bow  we are in a bite of the shoals mr gray cried the commander she loses her way perhaps an anchor might hold her  clear away that best bower shouted griffith through his trumpet  hold on cried the pilot in a voice that reached the very hearts of all who heard him hold on everything  the young man turned fiercely to the daring stranger who thus defied the discipline of his vessel and at once demanded  who is it that dares to countermand my orders is it not enough that you run the ship into danger but you must interfere to keep her there if another word  peace mr griffith interrupted the captain bending from the rigging his gray locks blowing about in the wind and adding a look of wildness to the haggard care that he exhibited by the light of his lantern yield the trumpet to mr gray he alone can save us  griffith threw his speakingtrumpet on the deck and as he walked proudly away muttered in bitterness of feeling  then all is lost indeed and among the rest the foolish hopes with which i visited this coast  there was however no time for reply the ship had been rapidly running into the wind and as the efforts of the crew were paralyzed by the contradictory orders they had heard she gradually lost her way and in a few seconds all her sails were taken aback  before the crew understood their situation the pilot had applied the trumpet to his mouth and in a voice that rose above the tempest he thundered forth his orders each command was given distinctly and with a precision that showed him to be master of his profession the helm was kept fast the headyards swung up heavily against the wind and the vessel was soon whirling round on her heel with a retrograde movement  griffith was too much of a seaman not to perceive that the pilot had seized with a perception almost intuitive the only method that promised to extricate the vessel from her situation he was young impetuous and proudbut he was also generous forgetting his resentment and his mortification he rushed forward among the men and by his presence and example added certainty to the experiment the ship fell off slowly before the gale and bowed her yards nearly to the water as she felt the blast pouring its fury on her broadside while the surly waves beat violently against her stern as if in reproach at departing from her usual manner of moving  the voice of the pilot however was still heard steady and calm and yet so clear and high as to reach every ear and the obedient seamen whirled the yards at his bidding in despite of the tempest as if they handled the toys of their childhood when the ship had fallen off dead before the wind her headsails were shaken her afteryards trimmed and her helm shifted before she had time to run upon the danger that had threatened as well to leeward as to windward the beautiful fabric obedient to her government threw her bows up gracefully towards the wind again and as her sails were trimmed moved out from among the dangerous shoals in which she had been embayed as steadily and swiftly as she had approached them  a moment of breathless astonishment succeeded the accomplishment of this nice manoeuvre but there was no time for the usual expressions of surprise the stranger still held the trumpet and continued to lift his voice amid the howlings of the blast whenever prudence or skill required any change in the management of the ship for an hour longer there was a fearful struggle for their preservation the channel becoming at each step more complicated and the shoals thickening around the mariners on every side the lead was cast rapidly and the quick eye of the pilot seemed to pierce the darkness with a keenness of vision that exceeded human power it was apparent to all in the vessel that they were under the guidance of one who understood the navigation thoroughly and their exertions kept pace with their reviving confidence again and again the frigate appeared to be rushing blindly on shoals where the sea was covered with foam and where destruction would have been as sudden as it was certain when the clear voice of the stranger was heard warning them of the danger and inciting them to their duty the vessel was implicitly yielded to his government and during those anxious moments when she was dashing the waters aside throwing the spray over her enormous yards each ear would listen eagerly for those sounds that had obtained a command over the crew that can only be acquired under such circumstances by great steadiness and consummate skill the ship was recovering from the inaction of changing her course in one of those critical tacks that she had made so often when the pilot for the first time addressed the commander of the frigate who still continued to superintend the allimportant duty of the leadsman  now is the pinch he said and if the ship behaves well we are safe but if otherwise all we have yet done will be useless  the veteran seaman whom he addressed left the chains at this portentous notice and calling to his first lieutenant required of the stranger an explanation of his warning  see you yon light on the southern headland returned the pilot you may know it from the star near itby its sinking at times in the ocean now observe the hummock a little north of it looking like a shadow in the horizontis a hill far inland if we keep that light open from the hill we shall do wellbut if not we surely go to pieces  let us tack again exclaimed the lieutenant  the pilot shook his head as he replied  there is no more tacking or boxhauling to be done tonight we have barely room to pass out of the shoals on this course and if we can weather the devils grip we clear their outermost pointbut if not as i said before there is but an alternative  if we had beaten out the way we entered exclaimed griffith we should have done well  say also if the tide would have let us do so returned the pilot calmly gentlemen we must be prompt we have but a mile to go and the ship appears to fly that topsail is not enough to keep her up to the wind we want both jib and mainsail  tis a perilous thing to loosen canvas in such a tempest observed the doubtful captain  it must be done returned the collected stranger we perish without itsee the light already touches the edge of the hummock the sea casts us to leeward  it shall be done cried griffith seizing the trumpet from the hand of the pilot  the orders of the lieutenant were executed almost as soon as issued and everything being ready the enormous folds of the mainsail were trusted loose to the blast there was an instant when the result was doubtful the tremendous threshing of the heavy sail seemed to bid defiance to all restraint shaking the ship to her centre but art and strength prevailed and gradually the canvas was distended and bellying as it filled was drawn down to its usual place by the power of a hundred men the vessel yielded to this immense addition of force and bowed before it like a reed bending to a breeze but the success of the measure was announced by a joyful cry from the stranger that seemed to burst from his inmost soul  she feels it she springs her luff observe he said the light opens from the hummock already if she will only bear her canvas we shall go clear  a report like that of a cannon interrupted his exclamation and something resembling a white cloud was seen drifting before the wind from the head of the ship till it was driven into the gloom far to leeward  tis the jib blown from the boltropes said the commander of the frigate this is no time to spread light duckbut the mainsail may stand it yet  the sail would laugh at a tornado returned the lieutenant but the mast springs like a piece of steel  silence all cried the pilot now gentlemen we shall soon know our fate let her luffluff you can  this warning effectually closed all discourse and the hardy mariners knowing that they had already done all in the power of man to insure their safety stood in breathless anxiety awaiting the result at a short distance ahead of them the whole ocean was white with foam and the waves instead of rolling on in regular succession appeared to be tossing about in mad gambols a single streak of dark billows not half a cables length in width could be discerned running into this chaos of water but it was soon lost to the eye amid the confusion of the disturbed element along this narrow path the vessel moved more heavily than before being brought so near the wind as to keep her sails touching the pilot silently proceeded to the wheel and with his own hands he undertook the steerage of the ship no noise proceeded from the frigate to interrupt the horrid tumult of the ocean and she entered the channel among the breakers with the silence of a desperate calmness twenty times as the foam rolled away to leeward the crew were on the eve of uttering their joy as they supposed the vessel past the danger but breaker after breaker would still heave up before them following each other into the general mass to check their exultation occasionally the fluttering of the sails would be heard and when the looks of the startled seamen were turned to the wheel they beheld the stranger grasping its spokes with his quick eye glancing from the water to the canvas at length the ship reached a point where she appeared to be rushing directly into the jaws of destruction when suddenly her course was changed and her head receded rapidly from the wind at the same instant the voice of the pilot was heard shouting  square away the yardsin mainsail  a general burst from the crew echoed square away the yards and quick as thought the frigate was seen gliding along the channel before the wind the eye had hardly time to dwell on the foam which seemed like clouds driving in the heavens and directly the gallant vessel issued from her perils and rose and fell on the heavy waves of the sea  the seamen were yet drawing long breaths and gazing about them like men recovered from a trance when griffith approached the man who had so successfully conducted them through their perils the lieutenant grasped the hand of the other as he said  you have this night proved yourself a faithful pilot and such a seaman as the world cannot equal  the pressure of the hand was warmly returned by the unknown mariner who replied  i am no stranger to the seas and i may yet find my grave in them but you too have deceived me you have acted nobly young man and congress  what of congress asked griffith observing him to pause  why congress is fortunate if it has many such ships as this said the stranger coldly walking away toward the commander  griffith gazed after him a moment in surprise but as his duty required his attention other thoughts soon engaged his mind  the vessel was pronounced to be in safety the gale was heavy and increasing but there was a clear sea before them and as she slowly stretched out into the bosom of the ocean preparations were made for her security during its continuance before midnight everything was in order a gun from the ariel soon announced the safety of the schooner also which had gone out by another and an easier channel that the frigate had not dared to attempt when the commander directed the usual watch to be set and the remainder of the crew to seek their necessary repose  the captain withdrew with the mysterious pilot to his own cabin griffith gave his last order and renewing his charge to the officer instructed with the care of the vessel he wished him a pleasant watch and sought the refreshment of his own cot for an hour the young lieutenant lay musing on the events of the day the remark of barnstable would occur to him in connection with the singular comment of the boy and then his thoughts would recur to the pilot who taken from the hostile shores of britain and with her accent on his tongue had served them so faithfully and so well he remembered the anxiety of captain munson to procure this stranger at the very hazard from which they had just been relieved and puzzled himself with conjecturing why a pilot was to be sought at such a risk his more private feelings would then resume their sway and the recollection of america his mistress and his home mingled with the confused images of the drowsy youth the dashing of the billows against the side of the ship the creaking of guns and bulkheads with the roaring of the tempest however became gradually less and less distinct until nature yielded to necessity and the young man forgot even the romantic images of his love in the deep sleep of a seaman     chapter vi      the letter ay the letter     tis there a woman loves to speak her wishes     it spares the blushes of the lovesick maiden     and every words a smile each line a tongue     duo   the slumbers of griffith continued till late on the following morning when he was awakened by the report of a cannon issuing from the deck above him he threw himself listlessly from his cot and perceiving the officer of marines near him as his servant opened the door of his stateroom he inquired with some little interest in his manner if the ship was in chase of anything that a gun was fired  tis no more than a hint to the ariel the soldier replied that there is bunting abroad for them to read it seems as if all hands were asleep on board her for we have shown her signal these ten minutes and she takes us for a collier i believe by the respect she pays it  say rather that she takes us for an enemy and is wary returned griffith brown dick has played the english so many tricks himself that he is tender of his faith  why they have shown him a yellow flag over a blue one with a cornet and that spells ariel in every signalbook we have surely he cant suspect the english of knowing how to read yankee  i have known yankees read more difficult english said griffith smiling but in truth i suppose that barnstable has been like myself keeping a dead reckoning of his time and his men have profited by the occasion she is lying to i trust  ay like a cork in a millpond and i dare say you are right give barnstable plenty of searoom a heavy wind and but little sail and he will send his men below put that fellow he calls long tom at the tiller and follow himself and sleep as quietly as i ever could at church  ah yours is a somniferous orthodoxy captain manual said the young sailor laughing while he slipped his arms into the sleeves of a morning roundabout covered with the gilded trappings of his profession sleep appears to come most naturally to all you idlers but give me a passage and i will go up and call the schooner down to us in the turning of an hourglass  the indolent soldier raised himself from the leaning posture he had taken against the door of the stateroom and griffith proceeded through the dark wardroom up the narrow stairs that led him to the principal battery of the ship and thence by another and broader flight of steps to the open deck  the gale still blew strong but steadily the blue water of the ocean was rising in mimic mountains that were crowned with white foam which the wind at times lifted from its kindred element to propel in mist through the air from summit to summit but the ship rode on these agitated billows with an easy and regular movement that denoted the skill with which her mechanical powers were directed  the day was bright and clear and the lazy sun who seemed unwilling to meet the toil of ascending to the meridian was crossing the heavens with a southern inclination that hardly allowed him to temper the moist air of the ocean with his genial heat at the distance of a mile directly in the winds eye the ariel was seen obeying the signal which had caused the dialogue we have related her low black hull was barely discernible at moments when she rose to the crest of a larger wave than common but the spot of canvas that she exposed to the wind was to be seen seeming to touch the water on either hand as the little vessel rolled amid the seas at times she was entirely hid from view when the faint lines of her raking masts would again be discovered issuing as it were from the ocean and continuing to ascend until the hull itself would appear thrusting its bows into the air surrounded by foam and apparently ready to take its flight into another element  after dwelling a moment on the beautiful sight we have attempted to describe griffith cast his eyes upward to examine with the keenness of a seaman the disposition of things aloft and then turned his attention to those who were on the deck of the frigate  his commander stood in his composed manner patiently awaiting the execution of his order by the ariel and at his side was placed the stranger who had so recently acted such a conspicuous part in the management of the ship griffith availed himself of daylight and his situation to examine the appearance of this singular being more closely than the darkness and confusion of the preceding night had allowed he was a trifle below the middle size in stature but his form was muscular and athletic exhibiting the finest proportions of manly beauty his face appeared rather characterized by melancholy and thought than by that determined decision which he had so powerfully displayed in the moments of their most extreme danger but griffith well knew that it could also exhibit looks of the fiercest impatience at present it appeared to the curious youth when compared to the glimpses he had caught by the lights of their lanterns like the ocean at rest contrasted with the waters around him the eyes of the pilot rested on the deck or when they did wander it was with uneasy and rapid glances the large peajacket that concealed most of his other attire was as roughly made and of materials as coarse as that worn by the meanest seaman in the vessel and yet it did not escape the inquisitive gaze of the young lieutenant that it was worn with an air of neatness and care that was altogether unusual in men of his profession the examination of griffith ended here for the near approach of the ariel attracted the attention of all on the deck of the frigate to the conversation that was about to pass between their respective commanders  as the little schooner rolled along under their stern captain munson directed his subordinate to leave his vessel and repair on board the ship as soon as the order was received the ariel rounded to and drawing ahead into the smooth water occasioned by the huge fabric that protected her from the gale the whaleboat was again launched from her decks and manned by the same crew that had landed on those shores which were now faintly discerned far to leeward looking like blue clouds on the skirts of the ocean  when barnstable had entered his boat a few strokes of the oars sent it dancing over the waves to the side of the ship the little vessel was then veered off to a distance where it rode in safety under the care of a boatkeeper and the officer and his men ascended the side of the lofty frigate  the usual ceremonials of reception were rigidly observed by griffith and his juniors when barnstable touched the deck and though every hand was ready to be extended toward the reckless seaman none presumed to exceed the salutations of official decorum until a short and private dialogue had taken place between him and their captain  in the mean time the crew of the whaleboat passed forward and mingled with the seamen of the frigate with the exception of the cockswain who established himself in one of the gangways where he stood in the utmost composure fixing his eyes aloft and shaking his head in evident dissatisfaction as he studied the complicated mass of rigging above him this spectacle soon attracted to his side some halfdozen youths with mr merry at their head who endeavored to entertain their guest in a manner that should most conduce to the indulgence of their own waggish propensities  the conversation between barnstable and his superior soon ended when the former beckoning to griffith passed the wondering group who had collected around the capstan awaiting his leisure to greet him more cordially and led the way to the wardroom with the freedom of one who felt himself no stranger as this unsocial manner formed no part of the natural temper or ordinary deportment of the man the remainder of the officers suffered their first lieutenant to follow him alone believing that duty required that their interview should be private barnstable was determined that it should be so at all events for he seized the lamp from the messtable and entered the stateroom of his friend closing the door behind them and turning the key when they were both within its narrow limitspointing to the only chair the little apartment contained with a sort of instinctive deference to his companions rankthe commander of the schooner threw himself carelessly on a seachest and placing the lamp on the table he opened the discourse as follows  what a night we had of it twenty times i thought i could see the sea breaking over you and i had given you over as drowned men or what is worse as men driven ashore to be led to the prisonships of these islanders when i saw your lights in answer to my gun had you hoisted the conscience of a murderer you wouldnt have relieved him more than you did me by showing that bit of tallow and cotton tipped with flint and steel but griffith i have a tale to tell of a different kind  of how you slept when you found yourself in deep water and how your crew strove to outdo their commander and how all succeeded so well that there was a grayhead on board here that began to shake with displeasure interrupted griffith truly dick you will get into lubberly habits on board that bubble in which you float about where all hands go to sleep as regularly as the inhabitants of a poultryyard go to roost  not so bad not half so bad ned returned the other laughing i keep as sharp a discipline as if we wore a flag to be sure forty men cant make as much parade as three or four hundred but as for making or taking in sail i am your better any day  ay because a pockethandkerchief is sooner opened and shut than a tablecloth but i hold it to be unseamanlike to leave any vessel without human eyes and those open to watch whether she goes east or west north or south  and who is guilty of such a dead mans watch  why they say aboard here that when it blows hard you seat the man you call long tom by the side of the tiller tell him to keep her head to sea and then pipe all hands to their nightcaps where you all remain comfortably stowed in your hammocks until you are awakened by the snoring of your helmsman  tis a damned scandalous insinuation cried barnstable with an indignation that he in vain attempted to conceal who gives currency to such a libel mr griffith  i had it of the marine said his friend losing the archness that had instigated him to worry his companion in the vacant air of one who was careless of everything but i dont believe half of it myselfi have no doubt you all had your eyes open last night whatever you might have been about this morning  ah this morning there was an oversight indeed but i was studying a new signalbook griffith that has a thousand times more interest for me than all the bunting you can show from the head to the heel of your masts  what have you found out the englishmans private talk  no no said the other stretching forth his hand and grasping the arm of his friend i met last night one on those cliffs who has proved herself what i always believed her to be and loved her for a girl of quick thought and bold spirit  of whom do you speak  of katherine  griffith started from his chair involuntarily at the sound of this name and the blood passed quickly through the shades of his countenance leaving it now pale as death and then burning as if oppressed by a torrent from his heart struggling to overcome an emotion which he appeared ashamed to betray even to the friend he most loved the young man soon recovered himself so far as to resume his seat when he asked gloomily  was she alone  she was but she left with me this paper and this invaluable book which is worth a library of all other works  the eye of griffith rested vacantly on the treasure that the other valued so highly but his hand seized eagerly the open letter which was laid on the table for his perusal the reader will at once understand that it was in the handwriting of a female and that it was the communication barnstable had received from his betrothed on the cliffs its contents were as follows  believing that providence may conduct me where we shall meet or whence i may be able to transmit to you this account i have prepared a short statement of the situation of cecila howard and myself not however to urge you and griffith to any rash or foolish hazards but that you may both sit down and after due consultation determine what is proper for our relief  by this time you must understand the character of colonel howard too well to expect he will ever consent to give his niece to a rebel he has already sacrificed to his loyalty as he calls it but i whisper to cecilia tis his treason not only his native country but no small part of his fortune also in the frankness of my disposition you know my frankness barnstable but too well i confessed to him after the defeat of the mad attempt griffith made to carry off cecilia in carolina that i had been foolish enough to enter into some weak promise to the brother officer who had accompanied the young sailor in his traitorous visits to the plantation heigho i sometimes think it would have been better for us all if your ship had never been chased into the river or after she was there if griffith had made no attempt to renew his acquaintance with my cousin the colonel received the intelligence as such a guardian would hear that his ward was about to throw away thirty thousand dollars and herself on a traitor to his king and country i defended you stoutly said that you had no king as the tie was dissolved that america was your country and that your profession was honorable but it would not all do he called you rebel that i was used to he said you were a traitor that in his vocabulary amounts to the same thing he even hinted that you were a coward and that i knew to be false and did not hesitate to tell him so he used fifty opprobrious terms that i cannot remember but among others were the beautiful epithets of disorganizer leveller democrat and jacobin i hope he did not mean a monk in short he acted colonel howard in a rage but as his dominion does not like that of his favorite kings continue from generation to generation and one short year will release me from his power and leave me mistress of my own actionsthat is if your fine promises are to be believedi bore it all very well being resolved to suffer anything but martyrdom rather than abandon cecilia she dear girl has much more to distress her than i can have she is not only the ward of colonel howard but his niece and his sole heir i am persuaded this last circumstance makes no difference in either her conduct or her feelings but he appears to think it gives him a right to tyrannize over her on all occasions after all colonel howard is a gentleman when you do not put him in a passion and i believe a thoroughly honest man and cecilia even loves him but a man who is driven from his country in his sixtieth year with the loss of near half his fortune is not apt to canonize those who compel the change  it seems that when the howards lived on this island a hundred years ago they dwelt in the county of northumberland hither then he brought us when political events and his dread of becoming the uncle to a rebel induced him to abandon america as he says forever we have been here now three months and for twothirds of that time we lived in tolerable comfort but latterly the papers have announced the arrival of the ship and your schooner in france and from that moment as strict a watch has been kept over us as if we had meditated a renewal of the carolina flight the colonel on his arrival here hired an old building that is part house part abbey part castle and all prison because it is said to have once belonged to an ancestor of his in this delightful dwelling there are many cages that will secure more uneasy birds than we are about a fortnight ago an alarm was given in a neighboring village which is situated on the shore that two american vessels answering your description had been seen hovering along the coast and as people in this quarter dream of nothing but that terrible fellow paul jones it was said that he was on board one of them but i believe that colonel howard suspects who you really are he was very minute in his inquiries i hear and since then has established a sort of garrison in the house under the pretence of defending it against marauders like those who are said to have laid my lady selkirk under contribution  now understand me barnstable on no account would i have you risk yourself on shore neither must there be blood spilt if you love me but that you may know what sort of a place we are confined in and by whom surrounded i will describe both our prison and the garrison the whole building is of stone and not to be attempted with slight means it has windings and turnings both internally and externally that would require more skill than i possess to make intelligible but the rooms we inhabit are in the upper or third floor of a wing that you may call a tower if you are in a romantic mood but which in truth is nothing but a wing would to god i could fly with it if any accident should bring you in sight of the dwelling you will know our rooms by the three smoky vanes that whiffle about its pointed roof and also by the windows in that story being occasionally open opposite to our windows at the distance of half a mile is a retired unfrequented ruin concealed in a great measure from observation by a wood and affording none of the best accommodations it is true but shelter in some of its vaults or apartments i have prepared according to the explanations you once gave me on this subject a set of small signals of differently colored silks and a little dictionary of all the phrases that i could imagine as useful to refer to properly numbered to correspond with the key and the flags all of which i shall send you with this letter you must prepare your own flags and of course i retain mine as well as a copy of the key and book if opportunity should ever offer we can have at least a pleasant discourse together you from the top of the old tower in the ruins and i from the east window of my dressingroom but now for the garrison in addition to the commandant colonel howard who retains all the fierceness of his former military profession there is as his second in authority that bane of cecilias happiness kit dillon with his long savannah face scornful eyes of black and skin of the same color this gentleman you know is a distant relative of the howards and wishes to be more nearly allied he is poor it is true but then as the colonel daily remarks he is a good and loyal subject and no rebel when i asked why he was not in arms in these stirring times contending for the prince he loves so much the colonel answers that it is not his profession that he has been educated for the law and was destined to fill one of the highest judicial stations in the colonies and that he hoped he should yet live to see him sentence certain nameless gentlemen to condign punishment this was consoling to be sure but i bore it however he left carolina with us and here he is and here he is likely to continue unless you can catch him and anticipate his judgment on himself the colonel has long desired to see this gentleman the husband of cecilia and since the news of your being on the coast the siege has nearly amounted to a storm the consequences are that my cousin at first kept her room and then the colonel kept her there and even now she is precluded from leaving the wing we inhabit in addition to these two principal jailers we have four men servants two black and two white and an officer and twenty soldiers from the neighboring town are billeted on us by particular desire until the coast is declared free from pirates yes that is the musical name they give youand when their own people land and plunder and rob and murder the men and insult the women they are called heroes its a fine thing to be able to invent names and make dictionariesand it must be your fault if mine has been framed for no purpose i declare when i recollect all the insulting and cruel things i hear in this country of my own and her people it makes me lose my temper and forget my sex but do not let my ill humor urge you to anything rash remember your life remember their prisons remember your reputation but do not do not forget your  katherine plowden  ps i had almost forgotten to tell you that in the signalbook you will find a more particular description of our prison where it stands and a drawing of the grounds etc  when griffith concluded this epistle he returned it to the man to whom it was addressed and fell back in his chair in an attitude that denoted deep reflection  i knew she was here or i should have accepted the command offered to me by our commissioners in paris he at length uttered and i thought that some lucky chance might throw her in my way but this is bringing us close indeed this intelligence must be acted on and that promptly poor girl what does she not suffer in such a situation  what a beautiful hand she writes exclaimed barnstable tis as clear and as pretty and as small as her own delicate fingers griff what a logbook she would keep  cecilia howard touch the coarse leaves of a logbook cried the other in amazement but perceiving barnstable to be poring over the contents of his mistress letter he smiled at their mutual folly and continued silent after a short time spent in cool reflection griffith inquired of his friend the nature and circumstances of his interview with katherine plowden barnstable related it briefly as it occurred in the manner already known to the reader  then said griffith merry is the only one besides ourselves who knows of this meeting and he will be too chary of the reputation of his kinswoman to mention it  her reputation needs no shield mr griffith cried her lover tis as spotless as the canvas above your head and  peace dear richard i entreat your pardon my words may have conveyed more than i intended but it is important that our measures should be secret as well as prudently concerted  we must get them both off returned barnstable forgetting his displeasure the moment it was exhibited and that too before the old man takes it into his wise head to leave the coast did you ever get a sight of his instructions or does he keep silent  as the grave this is the first time we have left port that he has not conversed freely with me on the nature of the cruise but not a syllable has been exchanged between us on the subject since we sailed from brest  ah that is your jersey bashfulness said barnstable wait till i come alongside him with my eastern curiosity and i pledge myself to get it out of him in an hour  twill be diamond cut diamond i doubt said griffith laughing you will find him as acute at evasion as you can possibly be at a cross examination  at any rate he gives me a chance today you know i suppose that he sent for me to attend a consultation of his officers on important matters  i did not returned griffith fixing his eyes intently on the speaker what has he to offer  nay that you must ask your pilot for while talking to me the old man would turn and look at the stranger every minute as if watching for signals how to steer  there is a mystery about that man and our connection with him that i cannot fathom said griffith but i hear the voice of manual calling for me we are wanted in the cabin remember you do not leave the ship without seeing me again  no no my dear fellow from the public we must retire to another private consultation  the young men arose and griffith throwing off the roundabout in which he had appeared on deck drew on a coat of more formal appearance and taking a sword carelessly in his hand they proceeded together along the passage already described to the gundeck where they entered with the proper ceremonials into the principal cabin of the frigate     chapter vii    sempronius speak   cato   the arrangements for the consultation were brief and simple the veteran commander of the frigate received his officers with punctilious respect and pointing to the chairs that were placed around the table which was a fixture in the centre of his cabin he silently seated himself and his example was followed by all without further ceremony in taking their stations however a quiet but rigid observance was paid to the rights of seniority and rank on the right of the captain was placed griffith as next in authority and opposite to him was seated the commander of the schooner the officer of marines who was included in the number held the next situation in point of precedence the same order being observed to the bottom of the table which was occupied by a hardfeatured squarebuilt athletic man who held the office of sailingmaster when order was restored after the short interruption of taking their places the officer who had required the advice of his inferiors opened the business on which he demanded their opinions  my instructions direct me gentlemen he said after making the coast of england to run the land down  the hand of griffith was elevated respectfully for silence and the veteran paused with a look that inquired the reason of his interruption  we are not alone said the lieutenant glancing his eye toward the part of the cabin where the pilot stood leaning on one of the guns in an attitude of easy indulgence  the stranger moved not at this direct hint neither did his eye change from its close survey of a chart that lay near him on the deck the captain dropped his voice to tones of cautious respect as he replied  tis only mr gray his services will be necessary on the occasion and therefore nothing need be concealed from him  glances of surprise were exchanged among the young men but griffith bowing his silent acquiescence in the decision of his superior the latter proceeded  i was ordered to watch for certain signals from the headlands that we made and was furnished with the best of charts and such directions as enabled us to stand into the bay we entered last night we have now obtained a pilot and one who has proved himself a skilful man such a one gentlemen as no officer need hesitate to rely on in any emergency either on account of his integrity or his knowledge  the veteran paused and turned his looks on the countenances of the listeners as if to collect their sentiments on this important point receiving no other reply than the one conveyed by the silent inclinations of the heads of his hearers the commander resumed his explanations referring to an open paper in his hand  it is known to you all gentlemen that the unfortunate question of retaliation has been much agitated between the two governments our own and that of the enemy for this reason and for certain political purposes it has become an object of solicitude with our commissioners in paris to obtain a few individuals of character from the enemy who may be held as a check on their proceedings while at the same time it brings the evils of war from our own shores home to those who have caused it an opportunity now offers to put this plan in execution and i have collected you in order to consult on the means  a profound silence succeeded this unexpected communication of the object of their cruise after a short pause their captain added addressing himself to the sailingmaster  what course would you advise me to pursue mr boltrope  the weather beaten seaman who was thus called on to break through the difficulties of a knotty point with his opinion laid one of his short bony hands on the table and began to twirl an inkstand with great industry while with the other he conveyed a pen to his mouth which was apparently masticated with all the relish that he could possibly have felt had it been a leaf from the famous virginian weed but perceiving that he was expected to answer after looking first to his right hand and then to his left he spoke as follows in a hoarse thick voice in which the fogs of the ocean seemed to have united with seadamps and colds to destroy everything like melody  if this matter is ordered it is to be done i suppose he said for the old rule runs obey orders if you break owners though the maxim which says one hand for the owner and tother for yourself is quite as good and has saved many a hearty fellow from a fall that would have balanced the pursers books not that i mean a pursers books are not as good as any other mans but that when a man is dead his account must be closed or there will be a false muster well if the thing is to be done the next question is how is it to be done there is many a man that knows there is too much canvas on a ship who cant tell how to shorten sail well then if the thing is really to be done we must either land a gang to seize them or we must show false lights and sham colors to lead them off to the ship as for landing captain munson i can only speak for one man and that is myself which is to say that if you run the ship with her jibboom into the king of englands parlor windows why im consenting nor do i care how much of his crockery is cracked in so doing but as to putting the print of my foot on one of his sandy beaches if i do that is always speaking for only one man and saving your presence may i hope to be dd  the young men smiled as the tough old seaman uttered his sentiments so frankly rising with his subject to that which with him was the climax of all discussion but his commander who was but a more improved scholar from the same rough school appeared to understand his arguments entirely and without altering a muscle of his rigid countenance he required the opinion of the junior lieutenant  the young man spoke firmly but modestly though the amount of what he said was not much more distinct than that uttered by the master and was very much to the same purpose with the exception that he appeared to entertain no personal reluctance to trusting himself on dry ground  the opinions of the others grew gradually more explicit and clear as they ascended in the scale of rank until it came to the turn of the captain of marines to speak there was a trifling exhibition of professional pride about the soldier in delivering his sentiments on a subject that embraced a good deal more of his peculiar sort of duty than ordinarily occurred in the usual operations of the frigate  it appears to me sir that the success of this expedition depends altogether upon the manner in which it is conducted after this lucid opening the soldier hesitated a moment as if to collect his ideas for a charge that should look down all opposition and proceeded the landing of course will be effected on a fair beach under cover of the frigates guns and could it be possibly done the schooner should be anchored in such a manner as to throw in a flanking fire on the point of debarkation the arrangements for the order of march must a good deal depend on the distance to go over though i should think sir an advanced party of seamen to act as pioneers for the column of marines should be pushed a short distance in front while the baggage and baggageguard might rest upon the frigate until the enemy was driven into the interior when it could advance without danger there should be flankguards under the orders of two of the oldest midshipmen and a light corps might be formed of the topmen to cooperate with the marines of course sir mr griffith will lead in person the musket men and boarders armed with their long pikes whom i presume he will hold in reserve as i trust my military claims and experience entitle me to the command of the main body  well done fieldmarshal cried barnstable with a glee that seldom regarded time or place you should never let saltwater mould your buttons but in washingtons camp ay and in washingtons tent you should swing your hammock in future why sir do you think we are about to invade england  i know that every military movement should be executed with precision captain barnstable returned the marine i am too much accustomed to hear the sneers of the seaofficers to regard what i know proceeds from ignorance if captain munson is disposed to employ me and my command in this expedition i trust he will discover that marines are good for something more than to mount guard and pay salutes then turning haughtily from his antagonist he continued to address himself to their common superior as if disdaining further intercourse with one who from the nature of the case must be unable to comprehend the force of what he said it will be prudent captain munson to send out a party to reconnoitre before we march and as it may be necessary to defend ourselves in case of a repulse i would beg leave to recommend that a corps be provided with entrenching tools to accompany the expedition they would be extremely useful sir in assisting to throw up field works though i doubt not tools might be found in abundance in this country and laborers impressed for the service on an emergency  this was too much for the risibility of barnstable who broke forth in a fit of scornful laughter which no one saw proper to interrupt though griffith on turning his head to conceal the smile that was gathering on his own face perceived the fierce glance which the pilot threw at the merry seaman and wondered at its significance and impatience when captain munson thought that the mirth of the lieutenant was concluded he mildly desired his reasons for amusing himself so exceedingly with the plans of the marine  tis a chart for a campaign cried barnstable and should be sent off express to congress before the frenchmen are brought into the field  have you any better plan to propose mr barnstable inquired the patient commander  better ay one that will take no time and cause no trouble to execute it cried the other tis a seamans job sir and must be done with a seamans means  pardon me captain barnstable interrupted the marine whose jocular vein was entirely absorbed in his military pride if there be service to be done on shore i claim it as my right to be employed  claim what you will soldier but how will you carry on the war with a parcel of fellows who dont know one end of a boat from the other returned the reckless sailor do you think that a barge or a cutter is to be beached in the same manner you ground firelock by word of command no no captain manuali honor your courage for i have seen it tried but de if  you forget we wait for your project mr barnstable said the veteran  i crave your patience sir but no project is necessary point out the bearings and distance of the place where the men you want are to be found and i will take the heel of the gale and run into the land always speaking for good water and no rocks mr pilot you will accompany me for you carry as true a map of the bottom of these seas in your head as ever was made of dry ground i will look out for good anchorage or if the wind should blow off shore let the schooner stand off and on till we should be ready to take the broad sea again i would land out of my whaleboat with long tom and a boats crew and finding out the place you will describe we shall go up and take the men you want and bring them aboard its all plain sailing though as it is a wellpeopled country it may be necessary to do our shore work in the dark  mr griffith we only wait for your sentiments proceeded the captain when by comparing opinions we may decide on the most prudent course  the first lieutenant had been much absorbed in thought during the discussion of the subject and might have been on that account better prepared to give his opinion with effect pointing to the man who yet stood behind him leaning on a gun he commenced by asking  is it your intention that man shall accompany the party  it is  and from him you expect the necessary information sir to guide our movements  you are altogether right  if sir he has but a moiety of the skill on the land that he possesses on the water i will answer for his success returned the lieutenant bowing slightly to the stranger who received the compliment by a cold inclination of his head i must desire the indulgence of both mr barnstable and captain manual he continued and claim the command as of right belonging to my rank  it belongs naturally to the schooner exclaimed the impatient barnstable  there may be enough for us all to do said griffith elevating a finger to the other in a manner and with an impressive look that was instantly comprehended i neither agree wholly with the one nor the other of these gentlemen tis said that since our appearance on the coast the dwellings of many of the gentry are guarded by small detachments of soldiers from the neighboring towns  who says it asked the pilot advancing among them with a suddenness that caused a general silence  i say it sir returned the lieutenant when the momentary surprise had passed away  can you vouch for it  i can  name a house or an individual that is thus protected  griffith gazed at the man who thus forgot himself in the midst of a consultation like the present and yielding to his native pride hesitated to reply but mindful of the declarations of his captain and the recent services of the pilot he at length said with a little embarrassment of manner  i know it to be the fact in the dwelling of a colonel howard who resides but a few leagues to the north of us  the stranger started at the name and then raising his eye keenly to the face of the young man appeared to study his thoughts in his varying countenance but the action and the pause that followed were of short continuance his lip slightly curled whether in scorn or with a concealed smile would have been difficult to say so closely did it resemble both and as he dropped quietly back to his place at the gun he said  tis more than probable you are right sir and if i might presume to advise captain munson it would be to lay great weight on your opinion  griffith turned to see if he could comprehend more meaning in the manner of the stranger than his words expressed but his face was again shaded by his hand and his eyes were once more fixed on the chart with the same vacant abstraction as before  i have said sir that i agree wholly neither with mr barnstable nor captain manual continued the lieutenant after a short pause the command of this party is mine as the senior officer and i must beg leave to claim it i certainly do not think the preparation that captain manual advises necessary neither would i undertake the duty with as little caution as mr barnstable proposes if there are soldiers to be encountered we should have soldiers to oppose them but as it must be sudden boatwork and regular evolutions must give place to a seamans bustle a seaofficer should command is my request granted captain munson  the veteran replied without hesitation  it is sir it was my intention to offer you the service and i rejoice to see you accept it so cheerfully  griffith with difficulty concealed the satisfaction with which he listened to his commander and a radiant smile illumined his pale features when he observed  with me then sir let the responsibility rest i request that captain manual with twenty men may be put under my orders if that gentleman does not dislike the duty the marine bowed and cast a glance of triumph at barnstable i will take my own cutter with her tried crew go on board the schooner and when the wind lulls we will run in to the land and then be governed by circumstances  the commander of the schooner threw back the triumphant look of the marine and exclaimed in his joyous manner  tis a good plan and done like a seaman mr griffith ay ay let the schooner be employed and if it be necessary you shall see her anchored in one of their duckponds with her broadside to bear on the parlor windows of the best house in the island but twenty marines they will cause a jam in my little craft  not a man less than twenty would be prudent returned griffith more service may offer than that we seek  barnstable well understood his allusion but still he replied  make it all seamen and i will give you room for thirty but these soldiers never know how to stow away their arms and legs unless at a drill one will take the room of two sailors they swing their hammocks athwartships heads to leeward and then turn out wrong end uppermost at the call why damn it sir the chalk and rottenstone of twenty soldiers will choke my hatches  give me the launch captain munson exclaimed the indignant marine and we will follow mr griffith in an open boat rather than put captain barnstable to so much inconvenience  no no manual cried the other extending his muscular arm across the table with an open palm to the soldier you would all become so many jonahs in uniform and i doubt whether the fish could digest your cartridgeboxes and bayonetbelts you shall go with me and learn with your own eyes whether we keep the cats watch aboard the ariel that you joke about  the laugh was general at the expense of the soldier if we except the pilot and the commander of the frigate the former was a silent and apparently an abstracted but in reality a deeply interested listener to the discourse and there were moments when he bent his looks on the speakers as if he sought more in their characters than was exhibited by the gay trifling of the moment captain munson seldom allowed a muscle of his wrinkled features to disturb their repose and if he had not the real dignity to repress the untimely mirth of his officers he had too much good nature to wish to disturb their harmless enjoyments he expressed himself satisfied with the proposed arrangements and beckoned to his steward to place before them the usual beverage with which all their consultations concluded  the sailingmaster appeared to think that the same order was to be observed in their potations as in council and helping himself to an allowance which retained its hue even in its diluted state he first raised it to the light and then observed  this ships water is nearly the color of rum itself if it only had its flavor what a set of hearty dogs we should be mr griffith i find you are willing to haul your landtacks aboard well its natural for youth to love the earth but there is one man and he is sailingmaster of this ship who saw land enough last night to last him a twelvemonth but if you will go heres a good landfall and a better offing to you captain munson my respects to you i say sir if we should keep the ship more to the southard its my opinion and thats but one mans we should fall in with some of the enemys homeward bound westindiamen and find wherewithal to keep the life in us when we see fit to go ashore ourselves  as the tough old sailor made frequent application of the glass to his mouth with one hand and kept a firm hold of the decanter with the other during this speech his companions were compelled to listen to his eloquence or depart with their thirst unassuaged barnstable however quite coolly dispossessed the tar of the bottle and mixing for himself a more equal potation observed in the act  that is the most remarkable glass of grog you have boltrope that i ever sailed with it draws as little water as the ariel and is as hard to find the bottom if your spiritroom enjoys the same sort of engine to replenish it as you pump out your rum congress will sail this frigate cheaply  the other officers helped themselves with still greater moderation griffith barely moistening his lips and the pilot rejecting the offered glass altogether captain munson continued standing and his officers perceiving that their presence was no longer necessary bowed and took their leave as griffith was retiring last he felt a hand laid lightly on his shoulder and turning perceived that he was detained by the pilot  mr griffith he said when they were quite alone with the commander of the frigate the occurrences of the last night should teach us confidence in each other without it we go on a dangerous and fruitless errand  is the hazard equal returned the youth i am known to all to be the man i seemam in the service of my countrybelong to a family and enjoy a name that is a pledge for my loyalty to the cause of america and yet i trust myself on hostile ground in the midst of enemies with a weak arm and under circumstances where treachery would prove my ruin who and what is the man who thus enjoys your confidence captain munson i ask the question less for myself than for the gallant men who will fearlessly follow wherever i lead  a shade of dark displeasure crossed the features of the stranger at one part of this speech and at its close he sank into deep thought the commander however replied  there is a show of reason in your question mr griffithand yet you are not the man to be told that implicit obedience is what i have a right to expect i have not your pretensions sir by birth or education and yet congress have not seen proper to overlook my years and services i command this frigate  say no more interrupted the pilot there is reason in his doubts and they shall be appeased i like the proud and fearless eye of the young man and while he dreads a gibbet from my hands i will show him how to repose a noble confidence read this sir and tell me if you distrust me now  while the stranger spoke he thrust his hand into the bosom of his dress and drew forth a parchment decorated with ribands and bearing a massive seal which he opened and laid on the table before the youth as he pointed with his finger impressively to different parts of the writing his eye kindled with a look of unusual fire and there was a faint tinge discernible on his pallid features when he spoke  see he said royalty itself does not hesitate to bear witness in my favor and that is not a name to occasion dread to an american  griffith gazed with wonder at the fair signature of the unfortunate louis which graced the bottom of the parchment but when his eye obeyed the signal of the stranger and rested on the body of the instrument he started back from the table and fixing his animated eyes on the pilot he cried while a glow of fiery courage flitted across his countenance  lead on ill follow you to death  a smile of gratified exultation struggled around the lips of the stranger who took the arm of the young man and led him into a stateroom leaving the commander of the frigate standing in his unmoved and quiet manner a spectator of but hardly an actor in the scene     chapter viii    fierce bounding forward sprang the ship   like a greyhound starting from the slip   to seize his flying prey   lord of the isles   although the subject of the consultation remained a secret with those whose opinions were required yet enough of the result leaked out among the subordinate officers to throw the whole crew into a state of eager excitement the rumor spread itself along the decks of the frigate with the rapidity of an alarm that an expedition was to attempt the shore on some hidden service dictated by the congress itself and conjectures were made respecting its force and destination with all that interest which might be imagined would exist among the men whose lives or liberties were to abide the issue a gallant and reckless daring mingled with the desire of novelty however was the prevailing sentiment among the crew who would have received with cheers the intelligence that their vessel was commanded to force the passage of the united british fleet a few of the older and more prudent of the sailors were exceptions to this thoughtless hardihood and one or two among whom the cockswain of the whaleboat was the most conspicuous ventured to speak doubtingly of all sorts of land service as being of a nature never to be attempted by seamen  captain manual had his men paraded in the weathergangway and after a short address calculated to inflame their military ardor and patriotism acquainted them that he required twenty volunteers which was in truth half their number for a dangerous service after a short pause the company stepped forward like one man and announced themselves as ready to follow him to the end of the world the marine cast a look over his shoulder at this gratifying declaration in quest of barnstable but observing that the sailor was occupied with some papers on a distant part of the quarterdeck he proceeded to make a most impartial division among the candidates for glory taking care at the same time to cull his company in such a manner as to give himself the flower of his men and consequently to leave the ship the refuse  while this arrangement was taking place and the crew of the frigate was in this state of excitement griffith ascended to the deck his countenance flushed with unusual enthusiasm and his eyes beaming with a look of animation and gayety that had long been strangers to the face of the young man he was giving forth the few necessary orders to the seamen he was to take with him from the ship when barnstable again motioned him to follow and led the way once more to the stateroom  let the wind blow its pipe out said the commander of the ariel when they were seated there will be no landing on the eastern coast of england till the sea goes down but this kate was made for a sailors wife see griffith what a set of signals she has formed out of her own cunning head  i hope your opinion may prove true and that you may be the happy sailor who is to wed her returned the other the girl has indeed discovered surprising art in this business where could she have learnt the method and system so well  where why where she learnt better things how to prize a whole hearted seaman for instance do you think that my tongue was jammed in my mouth all the time we used to sit by the side of the river in carolina and that we found nothing to talk about  did you amuse your mistress with treatises on the art of navigation and the science of signals said griffith smiling  i answered her questions mr griffith as any civil man would to a woman he loved the girl has as much curiosity as one of my own townswomen who has weathered cape forty without a husband and her tongue goes like a dogvane in a calm first one way and then another but here is her dictionary now own griff in spite of your college learning and sentimentals that a woman of ingenuity and cleverness is a very good sort of a helpmate  i never doubted the merits of miss plowden said the other with a droll gravity that often mingled with his deeper feelings the result of a sailors habits blended with native character but this indeed surpasses all my expectations why she has in truth made a most judicious selection of phrases no 168  indelible 169  end only with life 170  i fear yours misleads me 171   pshaw exclaimed barnstable snatching the book from before the laughing eyes of griffith what folly to throw away our time now on such nonsense what think you of this expedition to the land  that it may be the means of rescuing the ladies though it fail in making the prisoners we anticipate  but this pilot you remember that he holds us by our necks and can run us all up to the yardarm of some english ship whenever he chooses to open his throat at their threats or bribes  it would have been better that he should have cast the ship ashore when he had her entangled in the shoals it would have been our last thought to suspect him of treachery then returned griffith i follow him with confidence and must believe that we are safer with him than we should be without him  let him lead to the dwelling of his foxhunting ministers of state cried barnstable thrusting his book of signals into his bosom but here is a chart that will show us the way to the port we wish to find let my foot once more touch terra firma and you may write craven against my name if that laughing vixen slips her cable before my eyes and shoots into the winds eye again like a flyingfish chased by a dolphin mr griffith we must have the chaplain with us to the shore  the madness of love is driving you into the errors of the soldier would you lie by to hear sermons with a flying party like ours  nay nay we must lay to for nothing that is not unavoidable but there are so many tacks in such a chase when one has time to breathe that we might as well spend our leisure in getting that fellow to splice us together he has a handy way with a prayer book and could do the job as well as a bishop and i should like to be able to say that this is the last time these two saucy names which are written at the bottom of this letter should ever be seen sailing in the company of each other  it will not do said his friend shaking his head and endeavoring to force a smile which his feelings suppressed it will not do richard we must yield our own inclinations to the service of our country nor is this pilot a man who will consent to be led from his purpose  then let him follow his purpose alone cried barnstable there is no human power always saving my superior officer that shall keep me from throwing abroad these tiny signals and having a private talk with my darkeyed kate but for a paltry pilot he may luff and bear away as he pleases while i shall steer as true as a magnet for that old ruin where i can bring my eyes to bear on that romantic wing and three smoky vanes not that ill forget my duty no ill help you catch the englishman but when that is done hey for katherine plowden and my true love  hush madcap the wardroom holds long ears and our bulkheads grow thin by wear i must keep you and myself to our duty this is no childrens game that we play it seems the commissioners at paris have thought proper to employ a frigate in the sport  barnstables gayety was a little repressed by the grave manner of his companion but after reflecting a moment he started on his feet and made the usual movements for departure  whither asked griffith gently detaining his impatient friend  to old moderate i have a proposal to make that may remove every difficulty  name it to me then i am in his council and may save you the trouble and mortification of a refusal  how many of those gentry does he wish to line his cabin with  the pilot has named no less than six all men of rank and consideration with the enemy two of them are peers two more belong to the commons house of parliament one is a general and the sixth like ourselves is a sailor and holds the rank of captain they muster at a huntingseat near the coast and believe me the scheme is not without its plausibility  well then there are two apiece for us you follow the pilot if you will but let me sheer off for this dwelling of colonel howard with my cockswain and boats crew i will surprise his house release the ladies and on my way back lay my hands on two of the first lords i fall in with i suppose for our business one is as good as another  griffith could not repress a faint laugh while he replied  though they are said to be each others peers there is i believe some difference even in the quality of lords england might thank us for ridding her of some among them neither are they to be found like beggars under every hedge no no the men we seek must have something better than their nobility to recommend them to our favor but let us examine more closely into this plan and map of miss plowden something may occur that shall yet bring the place within our circuit like a contingent duty of the cruise  barnstable reluctantly relinquished his own wild plan to the more sober judgment of his friend and they passed an hour together inquiring into the practicability and consulting on the means of making their public duty subserve the purpose of their private feelings  the gale continued to blow heavily during the whole of that morning but toward noon the usual indications of better weather became apparent during these few hours of inaction in the frigate the marines who were drafted for service on the land moved through the vessel with a busy and stirring air as if they were about to participate in the glory and danger of the campaign their officer had planned while the few seamen who were to accompany the expedition steadily paced the deck with their hands thrust into the bosoms of their neat blue jackets or occasionally stretched toward the horizon as their fingers traced for their less experienced shipmates the signs of an abatement in the gale among the driving clouds the last lagger among the soldiers had appeared with his knapsack on his back in the lee gangway where his comrades were collected armed and accoutered for the strife when captain munson ascended to the quarterdeck accompanied by the stranger and his first lieutenant a word was spoken by the latter in a low voice to a midshipman who skipped gayly along the deck and presently the shrill call of the boatswain was beard preceding the hoarse cry of  away there you tigers away  a smart roll of the drum followed and the marines paraded while the six seamen who belonged to the cutter that owned so fierce a name made their preparations for lowering their little bark from the quarter of the frigate into the troubled sea everything was conducted in the most exact order and with a coolness and skill that bade defiance to the turbulence of the angry elements the marines were safely transported from the ship to the schooner under the favoring shelter of the former though the boat appeared at times to be seeking the cavities of the ocean and again to be riding in the clouds as she passed from one vessel to the other  at length it was announced that the cutter was ready to receive the officers of the party the pilot walked aside and held private discourse for a few moments with the commander who listened to his sentences with marked and singular attention when their conference was ended the veteran bared his gray head to the blasts and offered his hand to the other with a seamans frankness mingled with the deference of an inferior the compliment was courteously returned by the stranger who turned quickly on his heel and directed the attention of those who awaited his movements by a significant gesture to the gangway  come gentlemen let us go said griffith starting from a reverie and bowing his hasty compliments to his brethren in arms  when it appeared that his superiors were ready to enter the boat the boy who by nautical courtesy was styled mr merry and who had been ordered to be in readiness sprang over the side of the frigate and glided into the cutter with the activity of a squirrel but the captain of marines paused and cast a meaning glance at the pilot whose place it was to precede him the stranger as he lingered on the deck was examining the aspect of the heavens and seemed unconscious of the expectations of the soldier who gave vent to his impatience after a moments detention by saying  we wait for you mr gray  aroused by the sound of his name the pilot glanced his quick eye on the speaker but instead of advancing he gently bent his body as he again signed toward the gangway with his hand to the astonishment not only of the soldier but of all who witnessed this breach of naval etiquette griffith bowed low and entered the boat with the same promptitude as if he were preceding an admiral whether the stranger became conscious of his want of courtesy or was too indifferent to surrounding objects to note occurrences he immediately followed himself leaving to the marine the post of honor the latter who was distinguished for his skill in all matters of naval or military etiquette thought proper to apologize at a fitting time to the first lieutenant for suffering his senior officer to precede him into a boat but never failed to show a becoming exultation when he recounted the circumstance by dwelling on the manner in which he had brought down the pride of the haughty pilot  barnstable had been several hours on board his little vessel which was every way prepared for their reception and as soon as the heavy cutter of the frigate was hoisted on her deck he announced that the schooner was ready to sail it has been already intimated that the ariel belonged to the smallest class of seavessels and as the symmetry of her construction reduced even that size in appearance she was peculiarly well adapted to the sort of service in which she was about to be employed notwithstanding her lightness rendered her nearly as buoyant as a cork and at times she actually seemed to ride on the foam her low decks were perpetually washed by the heavy seas that dashed against her frail sides and she tossed and rolled in the hollows of the waves in a manner that compelled even the practised seamen who trod her decks to move with guarded steps still she was trimmed and cleared with an air of nautical neatness and attention that afforded the utmost possible room for her dimensions and though in miniature she wore the trappings of war as proudly as if the metal she bore was of a more fatal and dangerous character the murderous gun which since the period of which we are writing has been universally adopted in all vessels of inferior size was then in the infancy of its invention and was known to the american mariner only by reputation under the appalling name of a smasher of a vast calibre though short and easily managed its advantages were even in that early day beginning to be appreciated and the largest ships were thought to be unusually well provided with the means of offence when they carried two or three cannon of this formidable invention among their armament at a later day this weapon has been improved and altered until its use has become general in vessels of a certain size taking its appellation from the carron on the banks of which river it was first moulded in place of these carronades six light brass cannon were firmly lashed to the bulwarks of the ariel their brazen throats blackened by the seawater which so often broke harmlessly over these engines of destruction in the centre of the vessel between her two masts a gun of the same metal but of nearly twice the length of the other was mounted on a carriage of a new and singular construction which admitted of its being turned in any direction so as to be of service in most of the emergencies that occur in naval warfare  the eye of the pilot examined this armament closely and then turned to the wellordered decks the neat and compact rigging and the hardy faces of the fine young crew with manifest satisfaction contrary to what had been his practice during the short time he had been with them he uttered his gratification freely and aloud  you have a tight boat mr barnstable he said and a gallantlooking crew you promise good service sir in time of need and that hour may not be far distant  the sooner the better returned the reckless sailor i have not had an opportunity of scaling my guns since we quitted brest though we passed several of the enemys cutters coming up channel with whom our bulldogs longed for a conversation mr griffith will tell you pilot that my little sixes can speak on occasion with a voice nearly as loud as the frigates eighteens  but not to as much purpose observed griffith vox et praeterea nihil as we said at school  i know nothing of your greek and latin mr griffith retorted the commander of the ariel but if you mean that those seven brass playthings wont throw a roundshot as far as any gun of their size and height above the water or wont scatter grape and canister with any blunderbuss in your ship you may possibly find an opportunity that will convince you to the contrary before we part company  they promise well said the pilot who was evidently ignorant of the good understanding that existed between the two officers and wished to conciliate all under his directions and i doubt not they will argue the leading points of a combat with good discretion i see that you have christened themi suppose for their respective merits they are indeed expressive names  tis the freak of an idle moment said barnstable laughing as he glanced his eye to the cannon above which were painted the several quaint names of boxer plumper grinder scatterer exterminator and naildriver  why have you thrown the midship gun without the pale of your baptism asked the pilot or do you know it by the usual title of the old woman  no no i have no such petticoat terms on board me cried the other but move more to starboard and you will see its style painted on the cheeks of the carriage its a name that need not cause them to blush either  tis a singular epithet though not without some meaning  it has more than you perhaps dream of sir that worthy seaman whom you see leaning against the foremast and who would serve on occasion for a spare spar himself is the captain of that gun and more than once has decided some warm disputes with john bull by the manner in which he has wielded it no marine can trail his musket more easily than my cockswain can train his ninepounder on an object and thus from their connection and some resemblance there is between them in length it has got the name which you perceive it carriesthat of long tom  the pilot smiled as he listened but turning away from the speaker the deep reflection that crossed his brow but too plainly showed that he trifled only from momentary indulgence and griffith intimated to barnstable that as the gale was sensibly abating they would pursue the object of their destination  thus recalled to his duty the commander of the schooner forgot the delightful theme of expatiating on the merits of his vessel and issued the necessary orders to direct their movements the little schooner slowly obeyed the impulse of her helm and fell off before the wind when the folds of her squaresail though limited by a prudent reef were opened to the blasts and she shot away from her consort like a meteor dancing across the waves the black mass of the frigates hull soon sunk in distance and long before the sun had fallen below the hills of england her tall masts were barely distinguishable by the small cloud of sail that held the vessel to her station as the ship disappeared the land seemed to issue out of the bosom of the deep and so rapid was their progress that the dwellings of the gentry the humbler cottages and even the dim lines of the hedges became gradually more distinct to the eyes of the bold mariners until they were beset with the gloom of evening when the whole scene faded from their view in the darkness of the hour leaving only the faint outline of the land visible in the tract before them and the sullen billows of the ocean raging with appalling violence in their rear  still the little ariel held on her way skimming the ocean like a water fowl seeking its place of nightly rest and shooting in towards the land as fearlessly as if the dangers of the preceding night were already forgotten no shoals or rocks appeared to arrest her course and we must leave her gliding into the dark streak that was thrown from the high and rocky cliffs that lined a basin of bold entrance where the mariners often sought and found a refuge from the dangers of the german ocean     chapter ix    sirrah how dare you leave your barleybroth   to come in armor thus against your king   drama   the large irregular building inhabited by colonel howard well deserved the name it had received from the pen of katherine plowden notwithstanding the confusion in its orders owing to the different ages in which its several parts had been erected the interior was not wanting in that appearance of comfort which forms the great characteristic of english domestic life its dark and intricate mazes of halls galleries and apartments were all well provided with good and substantial furniture and whatever might have been the purposes of their original construction they were now peacefully appropriated to the service of a quiet and wellordered family  there were divers portentous traditions of cruel separations and blighted loves which always linger like cobwebs around the walls of old houses to be heard here also and which doubtless in abler hands might easily have been wrought up into scenes of high interest and delectable pathos but our humbler efforts must be limited by an attempt to describe man as god has made him vulgar and unseemly as he may appear to sublimated faculties to the possessors of which enviable qualifications we desire to say at once that we are determined to eschew all things supernaturally refined as we would the devil to all those then who are tired of the company of their species we would bluntly insinuate that the sooner they throw aside our pages and seize upon those of some more highly gifted bard the sooner will they be in the way of quitting earth if not of attaining heaven our business is solely to treat of man and this fair scene on which he acts and that not in his subtleties and metaphysical contradictions but in his palpable nature that all may understand our meaning as well as ourselveswhereby we may manifestly reject the prodigious advantage of being thought a genius by perhaps foolishly refusing the mighty aid of incomprehensibility to establish such a character  leaving the gloomy shadows of the cliffs under which the little ariel had been seen to steer and the sullen roaring of the surf along the margin of the ocean we shall endeavor to transport the reader to the dining parlor of st ruths abbey taking the evening of the same day as the time for introducing another collection of those personages whose acts and characters it has become our duty to describe  the room was not of very large dimensions and every part was glittering with the collected light of half a dozen candles aided by the fierce rays that glanced from the grate which held a most cheerful fire of seacoal the mouldings of the dark oak wainscoting threw back upon the massive table of mahogany streaks of strong light which played among the rich fluids that were sparkling on the board in mimic haloes the outline of this picture of comfort was formed by damask curtains of a deep red and enormous oak chairs with leathern backs and cushioned seats as if the apartment were hermetically sealed against the world and its chilling cares  around the table which still stood in the centre of the floor were seated three gentlemen in the easy enjoyment of their daily repast the cloth had been drawn and the bottle was slowly passing among them as if those who partook of its bounty well knew that neither the time nor the opportunity would be wanting for their deliberate indulgence in its pleasures  at one end of the table an elderly man was seated who performed whatever little acts of courtesy the duties of a host would appear to render necessary in a company where all seemed to be equally at their ease and at home this gentleman was in the decline of life though his erect carriage quick movements and steady hand equally denoted that it was an old age free from the usual infirmities in his dress he belonged to that class whose members always follow the fashions of the age anterior to the one in which they live whether from disinclination to sudden changes of any kind or from the recollections of a period which with them has been hallowed by scenes and feelings that the chilling evening of life can neither revive nor equal age might possibly have thrown its blighting frosts on his thin locks but art had labored to conceal the ravages with the nicest care an accurate outline of powder covered not only the parts where the hair actually remained but wherever nature had prescribed that hair should grow his countenance was strongly marked in features if not in expression exhibiting on the whole a look of noble integrity and high honor which was a good deal aided in its effect by the lofty receding forehead that rose like a monument above the whole to record the character of the aged veteran a few streaks of branching red mingled with a swarthiness of complexion that was rendered more conspicuous by the outline of unsullied white which nearly surrounded his prominent features  opposite to the host who it will at once be understood was colonel howard was the thin yellow visage of mr christopher dillon that bane to the happiness of her cousin already mentioned by miss plowden  between these two gentlemen was a middleaged hardfeatured man attired in the livery of king george whose countenance emulated the scarlet of his coat and whose principal employment at the moment appeared to consist in doing honor to the cheer of his entertainer  occasionally a servant entered or left the room in silence giving admission however through the opened door to the rushing sounds of the gale as the wind murmured amid the angles and high chimneys of the edifice  a man in the dress of a rustic was standing near the chair of colonel howard between whom and the master of the mansion a dialogue had been maintained which closed as follows the colonel was the first to speak after the curtain is drawn from between the eyes of the reader and the scene  said you farmer that the scotchman beheld the vessels with his own eyes  the answer was a simple negative  well well continued the colonel you can withdraw  the man made a rude attempt at a bow which being returned by the old soldier with formal grace he left the room the host turning to his companions resumed the subject  if those rash boys have really persuaded the silly dotard who commands the frigate to trust himself within the shoals on the eve of such a gale as this their case must have been hopeless indeed thus may rebellion and disaffection ever meet with the just indignation of providence it would not surprise me gentleman to hear that my native land had been engulfed by earthquakes or swallowed by the ocean so awful and inexcusable has been the weight of her transgressions and yet it was a proud and daring boy who held the second station in that ship i knew his father well and a gallant gentleman he was who like my own brother the parent of cecilia preferred to serve his master on the ocean rather than on the land his son inherited the bravery of his high spirit without its loyalty one would not wish to have such a youth drowned either  this speech which partook much of the nature of a soliloquy especially toward its close called for no immediate reply but the soldier having held his glass to the candle to admire the rosy hue of its contents and then sipped of the fluid so often that nothing but a clear light remained to gaze at quietly replaced the empty vessel on the table and as he extended an arm toward the blushing bottle he spoke in the careless tones of one whose thoughts were dwelling on another theme  ay true enough sir good men are scarce and as you say one cannot but mourn his fate though his death be glorious quite a loss to his majestys service i dare say it will prove  a loss to the service of his majesty echoed the hosthis death glorious no captain borroughcliffe the death of no rebel can be glorious and how he can be a loss to his majestys service i myself am quite at a loss to understand  the soldier whose ideas were in that happy state of confusion that renders it difficult to command the one most needed but who still from long discipline had them under a wonderful control for the disorder of his brain answered with great promptitude  i mean the loss of his example sir it would have been so appalling to others to have seen the young man executed instead of shot in battle  he is drowned sir  ah that is the next thing to being hanged that circumstance had escaped me  it is by no means certain sir that the ship and schooner that the drover saw are the vessels you take them to have been said mr dillon in a harsh drawling tone of voice i should doubt their daring to venture so openly on the coast and in the direct track of our vessels of war  these people are our countrymen christopher though they are rebels exclaimed the colonel they are a hardy and brave nation when i had the honor of serving his majesty some twenty years since it was my fortune to face the enemies of my king in a few small affairs captain borroughcliffe such as the siege of quebec and the battle before its gates a trifling occasion at ticonderoga and that unfortunate catastrophe of general braddockwith a few others i must say sir in favor of the colonists that they played a manful game on the latter day and this gentleman who now heads the rebels sustained a gallant name among us for his conduct in that disastrous business he was a discreet wellbehaved young man and quite a gentleman i have never denied that mr washington was very much of a gentleman  yes said the soldier yawning he was educated among his majestys troops and he could hardly be other wise but i am quite melancholy about this unfortunate drowning colonel howard here will be an end of my vocation i suppose and i am far from denying that your hospitality has made these quarters most agreeable to me  then sir the obligation is only mutual returned the host with a polite inclination of his head but gentlemen who like ourselves have been made free of the camp need not bandy idle compliments about such trifles if it were my kinsman dillon now whose thoughts ran more on coke upon littleton than on the gayeties of a messtable and a soldiers life he might think such formalities as necessary as his hard words are to a deed come borroughcliffe my dear fellow i believe we have given an honest glass to each of the royal family god bless them all let us swallow a bumper to the memory of the immortal wolfe  an honest proposal my gallant host and such a one as a soldier will never decline returned the captain who roused himself with the occasion god bless them all say i in echo and if this gracious queen of ours ends as famously as she has begun twill be such a family of princes as no other army of europe can brag of around a messtable  ay ay there is some consolation in that thought in the midst of this dire rebellion of my countrymen but ill vex myself no more with the unpleasant recollections the arms of my sovereign will soon purge that wicked land of the foul stain  of that there can be no doubt said borroughcliffe whose thoughts still continued a little obscured by the sparkling madeira that had long lain ripening under a carolinian sun these yankees fly before his majestys regulars like so many dirty clowns in a london mob before a charge of the horseguards  pardon me captain borroughcliffe said his host elevating his person to more than its usually erect attitude they may be misguided deluded and betrayed but the comparison is unjust give them arms and give them discipline and he who gets an inch of their land from them plentiful as it is will find a bloody day on which to take possession  the veriest coward in christendom would fight in country where wine brews itself into such a cordial as this returned the cool soldier i am a living proof that you mistook my meaning for had not those loose flapped gentlemen they call vermontese and hampshiregranters god grant them his blessing for the deed finished twothirds of my company i should not have been at this day under your roof a recruiting instead of a marching officer neither should i have been bound up in a covenant like the law of moses could burgoyne have made head against their longlegged marchings and countermarchings sir i drink their healths with all my heart and with such a bottle of golden sunshine before me rather than displease so good a friend i will go through gates whole army regiment by regiment company by company or if you insist on the same even man by man in a bumper  on no account would i tax your politeness so far returned the colonel abundantly mollified by this ample concession i stand too much your debtor captain borroughcliffe for so freely volunteering to defend my house against the attacks of my piratical rebellious and misguided countrymen to think of requiring such a concession  harder duty might be performed and no favors asked my respectable host returned the soldier country quarters are apt to be dull and the liquor is commonly execrable but in such a dwelling as this a man can rock himself in the very cradle of contentment and yet there is one subject of complaint that i should disgrace my regiment did i not speak offor it is incumbent on me both as a man and a soldier to be no longer silent  name it sir freely and its cause shall be as freely redressed said the host in some amazement  here we three sit from morning to night continued the soldier bachelors all well provisioned and better liquored i grant you but like so many wellfed anchorites while two of the loveliest damsels in the island pine in solitude within a hundred feet of us without tasting the homage of our sighs this i will maintain is a reproach both to your character colonel howard as an old soldier and to mine as a young one as to our old friend coke on top of littleton here i leave him to the quiddities of the law to plead his own cause  the brow of the host contracted for a moment and the sallow cheek of dillon who had sat during the dialogue in a sullen silence appeared to grow even livid but gradually the open brow of the veteran resumed its frank expression and the lips of the other relaxed into a jesuitical sort of a smile that was totally disregarded by the captain who amused himself with sipping his wine while he waited for an answer as if he analyzed each drop that crossed his palate  after an embarrassing pause of a moment colonel howard broke the silence  there is reason in borroughcliffes hint for such i take it to be  i meant it for a plain matteroffact complaint interrupted the soldier  and you have cause for it continued the colonel it is unreasonable christopher that the ladies should allow their dread of these piratical countrymen of ours to exclude us from their society though prudence may require that they remain secluded in their apartments we owe the respect to captain borroughcliffe that at least we admit him to the sight of the coffeeurn in an evening  that is precisely my meaning said the captain as for dining with them why i am well provided for here but there is no one knows how to set hot water a hissing in so professional a manner as a woman so forward my dear and honored colonel and lay your injunctions on them that they command your humble servant and mr coke unto littleton to advance and give the countersign of gallantry  dillon contracted his disagreeable features into something that was intended for a satirical smile before he spoke as follows  both the veteran colonel howard and the gallant captain borroughcliffe may find it easier to overcome the enemies of his majesty in the field than to shake a womans caprice not a day has passed these three weeks that i have not sent my inquiries to the door of miss howard as became her fathers kinsman with a wish to appease her apprehensions of the pirates but little has she deigned me in reply more than such thanks as her sex and breeding could not well dispense with  well you have been as fortunate as myself and why you should be more so i see no reason cried the soldier throwing a glance of cool contempt at the other fear whitens the cheek and ladies best love to be seen when the roses flourish rather than the lilies  a woman is never so interesting captain borroughcliffe said the gallant host as when she appears to lean on man for support and he who does not feel himself honored by the trust is a disgrace to his species  bravo my honored sir a worthy sentiment and spoken like a true soldier but i have heard much of the loveliness of the ladies of the abbey since i have been in my present quarters and i feel a strong desire to witness beauty encircled by such loyalty as could induce them to flee their native country rather than to devote their charms to the rude keeping of the rebels  the colonel looked grave and for a moment fierce but the expression of his displeasure soon passed away in a smile of forced gayety and as he cheerfully rose from his seat he cried  you shall be admitted this very night and this instant captain borroughcliffe we owe it sir to your services here as well as in the field and those forward girls shall be humored no longer nay it is nearly two weeks since i have seen my ward myself nor have i laid my eyes on my niece but twice in all that time christopher i leave the captain under your good care while i go seek admission into the cloisters we call that part of the building the cloisters because it holds our nuns sir you will pardon my early absence from the table captain borroughcliffe  i beg it may not be mentioned you leave an excellent representative behind you sir cried the soldier taking in the lank figure of mr dillon in a sweeping glance that terminated with a settled gaze on his decanter make my devoirs to the recluses and say all that your own excellent wit shall suggest as an apology for my impatience mr dillon i meet you in a bumper to their healths and in their honor  the challenge was coldly accepted and while these gentlemen still held their glasses to their lips colonel howard left the apartment bowing low and uttering a thousand excuses to his guest as he proceeded and even offering a very unnecessary apology of the same effect to his habitual inmate mr dillon  is fear so very powerful within these old walls said the soldier when the door closed behind their host that your ladies deem it necessary to conceal themselves before even an enemy is known to have landed  dillon coldly replied  the name of paul jones is terrific to all on this coast i believe nor are the ladies of st ruth singular in their apprehensions  ah the pirate has bought himself a desperate name since the affair of flamborough head but let him look tot if he trusts himself in another whitehaven expedition while there is a detachment of the th in the neighborhood though the men should be nothing better than recruits  our last accounts leave him safe in the court of louis returned his companion but there are men as desperate as himself who sail the ocean under the rebel flag and from one or two of them we have had much reason to apprehend the vengeance of disappointed men it is they that we hope we lost in this gale  hum i hope they were dastards or your hopes are a little unchristian and  he would have proceeded but the door opened and his orderly entered and announced that a sentinel had detained three men who were passing along the highway near the abbey and who by their dress appeared to be seamen  well let them pass cried the captain what have we nothing to do better than to stop passengers like footpads on the kings highway give them of your canteens and let the rascals pass your orders were to give the alarm if any hostile party landed on the coast not to detain peaceable subjects on their lawful business  i beg your honors pardon returned the sergeant but these men seemed lurking about the grounds for no good and as they kept carefully aloof from the place where our sentinel was posted until tonight downing thought it looked suspiciously and detained them  downing is a fool and it may go hard with him for his officiousness what have you done with the men  i took them to the guardroom in the east wings your honor  then feed them and hark ye sirrah liquor them well that we hear no complaints and let them go  yes sir yes your honor shall be obeyed but there is a straight soldierlylooking fellow among them that i think might be persuaded to enlist if he were detained till morning i doubt sir by his walk but he has served already  ha what say you cried the captain pricking up his ears like a hound who hears a wellknown cry served think ye already  there are signs about him your honor to that effect an old soldier is seldom deceived in such a thing and considering his disguise for it can be no other and the place where we took him there is no danger of a haveus corpses until he is tied to us by the laws of the kingdom  peace you knave said borroughcliffe rising and making a devious route toward the door you speak in the presence of my lord chief justice that is to be and should not talk lightly of the laws but still you say reason give me your arm sergeant and lead the way to the east wing my eyesight is good for nothing in such a dark night a soldier should always visit his guard before the tattoo beats  after emulating the courtesy of their host captain borroughcliffe retired on this patriotic errand leaning on his subordinate in a style of most familiar condescension dillon continued at the table endeavoring to express the rancorous feelings of his breast by a satirical smile of contempt that was necessarily lost on all but himself as a large mirror threw back the image of his morose and unpleasant features  but we must precede the veteran colonel in his visits to the cloisters     chapter x    and kindness like their own   inspired those eyes affectionate and glad   that seemd to love whateer they looked upon   whether with hebes mirth her features shone   or if a shade more pleasing them oercast   yet so becomingly th expression past   that each succeeding look was lovelier than the last   gertrude of wyoming   the western wing of st ruth house or abbey as the building was indiscriminately called retained but few vestiges of the uses to which it had been originally devoted the upper apartments were small and numerous extending on either side of a long low and dark gallery and might have been the dormitories of the sisterhood who were said to have once inhabited that portion of the edifice but the groundfloor had been modernized as it was then called about a century before and retained just enough of its ancient character to blend the venerable with what was thought comfortable in the commencement of the reign of the third george as this wing had been appropriated to the mistress of the mansion ever since the building had changed its spiritual character for one of a more carnal nature colonel howard continued the arrangement when he became the temporary possessor of st ruth until in the course of events the apartments which had been appropriated for the accommodation and convenience of his niece were eventually converted into her prison but as the severity of the old veteran was as often marked by an exhibition of his virtues as of his foibles the confinement and his displeasure constituted the sole subjects of complaint that were given to the young lady that our readers may be better qualified to judge of the nature of their imprisonment we shall transport them without further circumlocution into the presence of the two females whom they must be already prepared to receive  the withdrawingroom of st ruths was an apartment which tradition said had formerly been the refectory of the little bevy of fair sinners who sought a refuge within its walls from the temptations of the world their number was not large nor their entertainments very splendid or this limited space could not have contained them the room however was of fair dimensions and an air of peculiar comfort mingled with chastened luxury was thrown around it by the voluminous folds of the blue damask curtains that nearly concealed the sides where the deep windows were placed and by the dark leathern hangings richly stamped with cunning devices in gold that ornamented the two others massive couches in carved mahogany with chairs of a similar material and fashion all covered by the same rich fabric that composed the curtains together with a turkey carpet over the shaggy surface of which all the colors of the rainbow were scattered in bright confusion united to relieve the gloomy splendor of the enormous mantel deep heavy cornices and the complicated carvings of the massive woodwork which cumbered the walls a brisk fire of wood was burning on the hearth in compliment to the willful prejudice of miss plowden who had maintained in her most vivacious manner that seacoal was only tolerable for blacksmiths and englishmen in addition to the cheerful blaze from the hearth two waxen lights in candlesticks of massive silver were lending their aid to enliven the apartment one of these was casting its rays brightly along the confused colors of the carpet on which it stood flickering before the active movements of the form that played around it with light and animated inflections the posture of this young lady was infantile in grace and with one ignorant of her motives her employment would have been obnoxious to the same construction divers small square pieces of silk strongly contrasted to each other in color lay on every side of her and were changed as she kneeled on the floor by her nimble hands into as many different combinations as if she was humoring the fancies of her sex or consulting the shades of her own dark but rich complexion in the shop of a mercer the close satin dress of this young female served to display her small figure in its true proportions while her dancing eyes of jet black shamed the dyes of the italian manufacturer by their superior radiance a few ribbons of pink disposed about her person with an air partly studied and yet carelessly coquettish seemed rather to reflect than lend the rich bloom that mantled around her laughing countenance leaving to the eye no cause to regret that she was not fairer  another female figure clad in virgin white was reclining on the end of a distant couch the seclusion in which they lived might have rendered this female a little careless of her appearance or what was more probable the comb had been found unequal to its burden for her tresses which rivaled the hue and gloss of the raven had burst from their confinement and dropping over her shoulders fell along her dress in rich profusion finally resting on the damask of the couch in dark folds like glittering silk a small hand which seemed to blush at its own naked beauties supported her head embedded in the volumes of her hair like the fairest alabaster set in the deepest ebony beneath the dark profusion of her curls which notwithstanding the sweeping train that fell about her person covered the summit of her head lay a low spotless forehead of dazzling whiteness that was relieved by two arches so slightly and truly drawn that they appeared to have been produced by the nicest touches of art the fallen lids and long silken lashes concealed the eyes that rested on the floor as if their mistress mused in melancholy the remainder of the features of this maiden were of a kind that is most difficult to describe being neither regular nor perfect in their several parts yet harmonizing and composing a whole that formed an exquisite picture of female delicacy and loveliness there might or there might not have been a tinge of slight red in her cheeks but it varied with each emotion of her bosom even as she mused in quiet now seeming to steal insidiously over her glowing temples and then leaving on her face an almost startling paleness her stature as she reclined seemed above the medium height of womanhood and her figure was rather delicate than full though the little foot that rested on the damask cushion before her displayed a rounded outline that any of her sex might envy  oh im as expert as if i were signal officer to the lord high admiral of this realm exclaimed the laughing female on the floor clapping her hands together in girlish exultation i do long cecilia for an opportunity to exhibit my skill  while her cousin was speaking miss howard raised her head with a faint smile and as she turned her eyes toward the other a spectator might have been disappointed but could not have been displeased by the unexpected change the action produced in the expression of her countenance  instead of the piercing black eyes that the deep color of her tresses would lead him to expect he would have beheld two large mild blue orbs that seemed to float in a liquid so pure as to be nearly invisible and which were more remarkable for their tenderness and persuasion than for the vivid flashes that darted from the quick glances of her companion  the success of your mad excursion to the seaside my cousin has bewildered your brain returned cecilia but i know not how to conquer your disease unless we prescribe salt water for the remedy as in some other cases of madness  ah i am afraid your nostrum would be useless cried katherine it has failed to wash out the disorder from the sedate mr richard barnstable who has had the regimen administered to him through many a hard gale but who continues as fair a candidate for bedlam as ever would you think it cicely the crazy one urged me in the ten minutes conversation we held together on the cliffs to accept of his schooner as a showerbath  i can think that your hardihood might encourage him to expect much but surely he could not have been serious in such a proposal  oh to do the wretch justice he did say something of a chaplain to consecrate the measure but there was boundless impudence in the thought i have not nor shall i forget it or forgive him for it these sixandtwenty years what a fine time he must have had of it in his little ariel among the monstrous waves we saw tumbling in upon the shore today coz i hope they will wash his impudence out of him i do think the man cannot have had a dry thread about him from sun to sun i must believe it as a punishment for his boldness and be certain i shall tell him of it i will form half a dozen signals this instant to joke at his moist condition in very revenge  pleased with her own thoughts and buoyant with the secret hope that her adventurous undertaking would be finally crowned with complete success the gay girl shook her black locks in infinite mirth and tossed the mimic flags gaily around her person as she was busied in forming new combinations in order to amuse herself with her lovers disastrous situation but the features of her cousin clouded with the thoughts that were excited by her remarks and she replied in a tone that bore some little of the accents of reproach  katherine katherine can you jest when there is so much to apprehend forget you what alice dunscombe told us of the gale this morning and that she spoke of two vessels a ship and a schooner that had been seen venturing with fearful temerity within the shoals only six miles from the abbey and that unless god in his gracious providence had been kind to them there was but little doubt that their fate would be a sad one can you that know so well who and what these daring mariners are be merry about the selfsame winds that caused their danger  the thoughtless laughing girl was recalled to her recollection by this remonstrance and every trace of mirth vanished from her countenance leaving a momentary deathlike paleness crossing her face as she clasped her hands before her and fastened her keen eyes vacantly on the splendid pieces of silk that now lay unheeded around her at this critical moment the door of the room slowly opened and colonel howard entered the apartment with an air that displayed a droll mixture of stern indignation with a chivalric and habitual respect to the sex  i solicit your pardon young ladies for the interruption he said i trust however that an old mans presence can never be entirely unexpected in the drawingroom of his wards  as he bowed the colonel seated himself on the end of the couch opposite to the place where his niece had been reclining for miss howard had risen at his entrance and continued standing until her uncle had comfortably disposed of himself throwing a glance which was not entirely free from selfcommendation around the comfortable apartment the veteran proceeded in the same tone as before  you are not without the means of making any guest welcome nor do i see the necessity of such constant seclusion from the eyes of the world as you thus rigidly practise  cecilia looked timidly at her uncle with surprise before she returned an answer to his remark  we certainly owe much to your kind attention dear sir she at length uttered but is our retirement altogether voluntary  how can it be otherwise are you not mistress of this mansion madam in selecting the residence where your and permit me to add my ancestors so long dwelt in credit and honor i have surely been less governed by any natural pride that i might have entertained on such a subject than by a desire to consult your comfort and happiness everything appears to my aged eyes as if we ought not to be ashamed to receive our friends within these walls the cloisters of st ruth miss howard are not entirely bare neither are their tenants wholly unworthy to be seen  open then the portals of the abbey sir and your niece will endeavor to do proper credit to the hospitality of its master  that was spoken like harry howards daughter frankly and generously cried the old soldier insensibly edging himself nearer to his niece if my brother had devoted himself to the camp instead of the sea cecilia he would have made one of the bravest and ablest generals in his majestys servicepoor harry he might have been living at this very day and at this moment leading the victorious troops of his sovereign through the revolted colonies in triumph but he is gone cecilia and has left you behind him as his dear representative to perpetuate our family and to possess what little has been left to us from the ravages of the times  surely dear sir said cecilia taking his hand which had unconsciously approached her person and pressing it to her lips we have no cause to complain of our lot in respect to fortune though it may cause us bitter regret that so few of us are left to enjoy it  no no no said katherine in a low hurried voice alice dunscombe is and must be wrong providence would never abandon brave men to so cruel a fate  alice dunscombe is here to atone for her error if she has fallen into one said a quiet subdued voice in which the accents of a provincial dialect however were slightly perceptible and which in its low tones wanted that silvery clearness that gave so much feminine sweetness to the words of miss howard and which even rang melodiously in the ordinarily vivacious strains of her cousin  the surprise created by these sudden interruptions caused a total suspension of the discourse katherine plowden who had continued kneeling in the attitude before described arose and as she looked about her in momentary confusion the blood again mantled her face with the fresh and joyous springs of life the other speaker advanced steadily into the middle of the room and after returning with studied civility the low bow of colonel howard seated herself in silence on the opposite couch the manner of her entrance her reception and her attire sufficiently denoted that the presence of this female was neither unusual nor unwelcome she was dressed with marked simplicity though with a studied neatness that more than compensated for the absence of ornaments her age might not have much exceeded thirty but there was an adoption of customs in her attire that indicated she was not unwilling to be thought older her fair flaxen hair was closely confined by a dark bandeau such as was worn in a nation farther north by virgins only over which a few curls strayed in a manner that showed the will of their mistress alone restrained their luxuriance her light complexion had lost much of its brilliancy but enough still remained to assert its original beauty and clearness to this description might be added fine mellow blue eyes beautifully white though large teeth a regular set of features and a person that was clad in a dark lead colored silk which fitted her full but gracefully moulded form with the closest exactness  colonel howard paused a moment after this lady was seated and then turning himself to katherine with an air that became stiff and constrained by attempting to seem extremely easy he said  you no sooner summon miss alice but she appears miss plowdenready and i am bold to say miss alice able to defend herself against all charges that her worst enemies can allege against her  i have no charges to make against miss dunscombe said katherine pettishly nor do i wish to have dissensions created between me and my friends even by colonel howard  colonel howard will studiously avoid such offences in future said the veteran bowing and turning stiffly to the others he continued i was just conversing with my niece as you entered miss alice on the subject of her immuring herself like one of the veriest nuns who ever inhabited these cloisters i tell her madam that neither her years nor my fortune nor indeed her own for the child of harry howard was not left penniless require that we should live as if the doors of the world were closed against us or there was no other entrance to st ruths but through those antiquated windows miss plowden i feel it to be my duty to inquire why those pieces of silk are provided in such an unusual abundance and in so extraordinary a shape  to make a gala dress for the ball you are about to give sir said katherine with a saucy smile that was only checked by the reproachful glance of her cousin you have taste in a ladys attire colonel howard will not this bright yellow form a charming relief to my brown face while this white and black relieve one another and this pink contrasts so sweetly with black eyes will not the whole form a turban fit for an empress to wear  as the arch maiden prattled on in this unmeaning manner her rapid fingers entwined the flags in a confused maze which she threw over her head in a form not unlike the ornament for which she intimated it was intended the veteran was by far too polite to dispute a ladys taste and he renewed the dialogue with his slightly awakened suspicion completely quieted by her dexterity and artifice but although it was not difficult to deceive colonel howard in matters of female dress the case was very different with alice dunscombe this lady gazed with a steady eye and reproving countenance on the fantastical turban until katherine threw herself by her side and endeavored to lead her attention to other subjects by her playful motions and whispered questions  i was observing miss alice continued the colonel that although the times had certainly inflicted some loss on my estate yet we were not so much reduced as to be unable to receive our friends in a manner that would not disgrace the descendants of the ancient possessors of st ruth cecilia here my brother harrys daughter is a young lady that any uncle might be proud to exhibit and i would have her madam show your english dames that we rear no unworthy specimens of the parent stock on the other side of the atlantic  you have only to declare your pleasure my good uncle said miss howard and it shall be executed  tell us how we can oblige you sir continued katherine and if it be in any manner that will relieve the tedium of this dull residence i promise you at least one cheerful assistant to your scheme  you speak fair cried the colonel and like two discreet and worthy girls well then our first step shall be to send a message to dillon and the captain and invite them to attend your coffee i see the hour approaches  cecilia made no reply but looked distressed and dropped her mild eyes to the carpet miss plowden took it upon herself to answer  nay sir that would be for them to proceed in the matter as your proposal was that the first step should be ours suppose we all adjourn to your part of the house and do the honors of the teatable in your drawingroom instead of our own i understand sir that you have had an apartment fitted up for that purpose in some style a womans taste might aid your designs however  miss plowden i believe i intimated to you some time since said the displeased colonel that so long as certain suspicious vessels were known to hover on this coast i should desire that you and miss howard would confine yourselves to this wing  do not say that we confine ourselves said katherine but let it be spoken in plain english that you confine us here  am i a jailer madam that you apply such epithets to my conduct miss alice must form strange conclusions of our manners if she receive her impressions from your very singular remarks i  all measures adopted from a dread of the ship and the schooner that ran within the devils grip yestereve may be dispensed with now interrupted miss dunscombe in a melancholy reflecting tone there are few living who know the dangerous paths that can conduct even the smallest craft in safety from the land with daylight and fair winds but when darkness and adverse gales oppose them the chance for safety lies wholly in gods kindness  there is truly much reason to believe they are lost returned the veteran in a voice in which no exultation was apparent  they are not lost exclaimed katherine with startling energy leaving her seat and walking across the room to join cecilia with an air that seemed to elevate her little figure to the height of her cousin they are skilful and they are brave and what gallant sailors can do will they do and successfully besides in what behalf would a just providence sooner exercise its merciful power than to protect the daring children of an oppressed country while contending against tyranny and countless wrongs  the conciliating disposition of the colonel deserted him as he listened his own black eyes sparkled with a vividness unusual for his years and his courtesy barely permitted the lady to conclude ere he broke forth  what sin madam what damning crime would sooner call down the just wrath of heaven on the transgressors than the act of foul rebellion it was this crime madam that deluged england in blood in the reign of the first charles it is this crime that has dyed more fields red than all the rest of mans offences united it has been visited on our race as a condign punishment from the days of the deservedly devoted absalom down to the present time in short it lost heaven forever to some of the most glorious of its angels and there is much reason to believe that it is the one unpardonable sin named in the holy gospels  i know that you have authority for believing it to be the heavy enormity that you mention colonel howard said miss dunscombe anticipating the spirited reply of katherine and willing to avert it she hesitated an instant and then drawing a heavy shivering sigh she continued in a voice that grew softer as she spoke tis indeed a crime of magnitude and one that throws the common blackslidings of our lives speaking by comparison into the sunshine of his favor many there are who sever the dearest ties of this life by madly rushing into its sinful vortex for i fain think the heart grows hard with the sight of human calamity and becomes callous to the miseries its owner inflicts especially where we act the wrongs on our own kith and kin regardless who or how many that are dear to us suffer by our evil deeds it is besides colonel howard a dangerous temptation to one little practiced in the great world to find himself suddenly elevated into the seat of power and if it does not lead to the commission of great crimes it surely prepares the way to it by hardening the heart  i hear you patiently miss alice said katherine dancing her little foot in affected coolness for you neither know of whom nor to whom you speak but colonel howard has not that apology peace cecilia for i must speak believe them not dear girl there is not a wet hair on their heads for you colonel howard who must recollect that the sisters son of the mothers of both your niece and myself is on board that frigate there is an appearance of cruelty in using such language  i pity the boy from my soul i pity him exclaimed the veteran he is a child and has followed the current that is sweeping our unhappy colonies down the tide of destruction there are others in that vessel who have no excuse of ignorance to offer there is a son of my old acquaintance and the bosom friend of my brother harry cecilias father dashing hugh griffith as we called him the urchins left home together and were rated on board one of his majestys vessels on the same day poor harry lived to carry a broad pennant in the service and hugh died in command of a frigate this boy too he was a nurtured on board his fathers vessel and learned from his majestys discipline how to turn his arms against his king there is something shockingly unnatural in that circumstance miss alice tis the child inflicting a blow on the parent tis such men as these with washington at their heads who maintain the bold front this rebellion wears  there are men who have never won the servile livery of britain sir whose names are as fondly cherished in america as any that she boasts of said katherine proudly ay sir and those who would gladly oppose the bravest officers in the british fleet  i contend not against your misguided reason said colonel howard rising with cool respect a young lady who ventures to compare rebels with gallant gentlemen engaged in their duty to their prince cannot escape the imputation of possessing a misguided reason no mani speak not of women who cannot be supposed so well versed in human naturebut no man who has reached the time of life that entitles him to be called by that name can consort with these disorganizers who would destroy everything that is sacredthese levellers who would pull down the great to exalt the littlethese jacobins whowho  nay sir if you are at a loss for opprobrious epithets said katherine with provoking coolness call on mr christopher dillon for assistance he waits your pleasure at the door  colonel howard turned in amazement forgetting his angry declamations at this unexpected intelligence and beheld in reality the sombre visage of his kinsman who stood holding the door in his hand apparently as much surprised at finding himself in the presence of the ladies as they themselves could be at his unusual visit     chapter xi    prithee kate lets stand aside and see the end of this controversy   shakspeare   during the warm discussions of the preceding chapter miss howard had bowed her pale face to the arm of the couch and sat an unwilling and distressed listener to the controversy but now that another and one whom she thought an unauthorized intruder on her privacy was announced she asserted the dignity of her sex as proudly though with something more of discretion than her cousin could possibly have done rising from her seat she inquired  to what are we indebted for so unexpected a visit from mr dillon surely he must know that we are prohibited going to the part of the dwelling where he resides and i trust colonel howard will tell him that common justice requires we should be permitted to be private  the gentleman replied in a manner in which malignant anger was sufficiently mingled with calculating humility  miss howard will think better of my intrusion when she knows that i am come on business of importance to her uncle  ah that may alter the case kit but the ladies must have the respect that is due to their sex i forgot somehow to have myself announced but that borroughcliffe leads me deeper into my madeira than i have been accustomed to go since the time when my poor brother harry with his worthy friend hugh griffiththe devil seize hugh griffith and all his raceyour pardon miss alicewhat is your business with me mr dillon  i bear a message from captain borroughcliffe you may remember that according to your suggestions the sentinels were to be changed every night sir  ay ay we practised that in our campaign against montcalm twas necessary to avoid the murders of their indians who were sure miss alice to shoot down a man at his post if he were placed two nights running in the same place  well sir your prudent precautions have not been thrown away continued dillon moving farther into the apartment as if he felt himself becoming a more welcome guest as he proceeded the consequences are that we have already made three prisoners  truly it has been a most politic scheme exclaimed katherine plowden with infinite contempt i suppose as mr christopher dillon applauds it so highly that it has some communion with the law and that the redoubtable garrison of st ruth are about to reap the high glory of being most successful thieftakers  the sallow face of dillon actually became livid as he replied and his whole frame shook with the rage he vainly endeavored to suppress  there may be a closer communion with the law and its ministers perhaps than miss plowden can desire he said for rebellion seldom finds favor in any christian code  rebellion exclaimed the colonel and what has this detention of three vagabonds to do with rebellion kit has the damnable poison found its way across the atlanticyour pardonmiss alicebut this is a subject on which you can feel with me i know your sentiments on the allegiance that is due to our anointed sovereign speak mr dillon are we surrounded by another set of demons if so we must give ourselves to the work and rally round our prince for this island is the main pillar of his throne  i cannot say that there is any appearance at present of an intention to rise in this island said dillon with demure gravity though the riots in london warrant any precautionary measures on the part of his majestys ministers even to a suspension of the habeas corpus but you have had your suspicions concerning two certain vessels that have been threatening the coast for several days past in a most piratical manner  the little foot of katherine played rapidly on the splendid carpet but she contented herself with bestowing a glance of the most sovereign contempt on the speaker as if she disdained any further reply with the colonel however this was touching a theme that lay nearest his heart and he answered in a manner worthy of the importance of the subject  you speak like a sensible man and a loyal subject mr dillon the habeas corpus miss alice was obtained in the reign of king john along with magna charta for the security of the throne by his majestys barons some of my own blood were of the number which alone would be a pledge that the dignity of the crown was properly consulted as to our piratical countrymen christopher there is much reason to think that the vengeance of an offended providence has already reached them those who know the coast well tell me that without a better pilot than an enemy would be likely to procure it would be impossible for any vessel to escape the shoals among which they entered on a dark night and with an adverse gale the morning has arrived and they are not to be seen  but be they friends or be they enemies sir continued dillon respectfully there is much reason to think that we have now in the abbey those who can tell us something of their true character for the men we have detained carry with them the appearance of having just landed and wear not only the dress but the air of seamen  of seamen echoed katherine a deadly paleness chasing from her cheeks the bloom which indignation had heightened  of seamen miss plowden repeated dillon with malignant satisfaction but concealing it under an air of submissive respect  i thank you sir for so gentle a term replied the young lady recollecting herself and recovering her presence of mind in the same instant the imagination of mr dillon is so apt to conjure the worst that he is entitled to our praise for so far humoring our weakness as not to alarm us with the apprehensions of their being pirates  nay madam they may yet deserve that name returned the other coolly but my education has instructed me to hear the testimony before i pronounce sentence  ah that the boy has found in his coke upon littleton cried the colonel the law is a salutary corrective to human infirmities miss alice and among other things it teaches patience to a hasty temperament but for this cursed unnatural rebellion madam the young man would at this moment have been diffusing its blessings from a judicial chair in one of the coloniesay and i pledge myself to all alike black and white red and yellow with such proper distinctions as nature has made between the officer and the private keep a good heart kinsman we shall yet find a time the royal arms have many hands and things look better at the last advices but come we will proceed to the guardroom and put these stragglers to the question runaways ill venture to predict from one of his majestys cruisers or perhaps honest subjects engaged in supplying the service with men come kit come let us go and  are we then to lose the company of colonel howard so soon said katherine advancing to her guardian with an air of blandishment and pleasantry i know that he too soon forgets the hasty language of our little disputes to part in anger if indeed he will even quit us till he has tasted of our coffee  the veteran turned to the speaker of this unexpected address and listened with profound attention when she had done he replied with a good deal of softness in his tones  ah provoking one you know me too well to doubt my forgiveness but duty must be attended to though even a young ladys smiles tempt me to remain yes yes child you too are the daughter of a very brave and worthy seaman but you carry your attachment to that profession too far miss plowdenyou do indeed you do  katherine might have faintly blushed but the slight smile which mingled with the expression of her shame gave to her countenance a look of additional archness and she laid her hand lightly on the sleeve of her guardian to detain him as she replied  yet why leave us colonel howard it is long since we have seen you in the cloisters and you know you come as a father tarry and you may yet add confessor to the title  i know thy sins already girl said the worthy colonel unconsciously yielding to her gentle efforts to lead him back to his seat they are deadly rebellion in your heart to your prince a most inveterate propensity to salt water and a great disrespect to the advice and wishes of an old fellow whom your fathers will and the laws of the realm have made the guardian of your person and fortune  nay say not the last dear sir cried katherine for there is not a syllable you have ever said to me on that foolish subject that i have forgotten will you resume your seat again cecilia colonel howard consents to take his coffee with us  but you forget the three men honest kit there and our respectable guest captain borroughcliffe  let honest kit stay there if he please you may send a request to captain borroughcliffe to join our party i have a womans curiosity to see the soldier and as for the three men she paused and affected to muse a moment when she continued as if struck by an obvious thought yes and the men can be brought in and examined here who knows but they may have been wrecked in the gale and need our pity and assistance rather than deserve your suspicions  there is a solemn warning in miss plowdens conjecture that should come home to the breasts of all who live on this wild coast said alice dunscombe i have known many a sad wreck among the hidden shoals and when the wind has blown but a gentle gale compared to last nights tempest the wars and the uncertainties of the times together with mans own wicked passions have made great havoc with those who knew well the windings of the channels among the ripples some there were who could pass as i have often heard within a fearful distance of the devils grip the darkest night that ever shadowed england but all are now gone of that daring set either by the hand of death or what is even as mournful by unnatural banishment from the land of their fathers  this war has then probably drawn off most of them for your recollections must be quite recent miss alice said the veteran as many of them were engaged in the business of robbing his majestys revenue the country is in some measure requited for the former depredations by their present services and at the same time it is happily rid of their presence ah madam ours is a glorious constitution where things are so nicely balanced that as in the physical organization of a healthy vigorous man the baser parts are purified in the course of things by its own wholesome struggles  the pale features of alice dunscombe became slightly tinged with red as the colonel proceeded nor did the faint glow entirely leave her pallid face until she had said  there might have been some who knew not how to respect the laws of the land for such are never wanting but there were others who however guilty they might be in many respects need not charge themselves with that mean crime and yet who could find the passages that lie hid from common eyes beneath the rude waves as well as you could find the way through the halls and galleries of the abbey with a noonday sun shining upon its vanes and high chimneys  is it your pleasure colonel howard that we examine the three men and ascertain whether they belong to the number of these gifted pilots said christopher dillon who was growing uneasy at his awkward situation and who hardly deemed it necessary to conceal the look of contempt which he cast at the mild alice while he spoke perhaps we may gather information enough from them to draw a chart of the coast that may gain us credit with my lords of the admiralty  this unprovoked attack on their unresisting and unoffending guest brought the rich blood to the very temples of miss howard who rose and addressed herself to her kinsman with a manner that could not easily be mistaken any more than it could be condemned  if mr dillon will comply with the wishes of colonel howard as my cousin has expressed them we shall not at least have to accuse ourselves of unnecessarily detaining men who probably are more unfortunate than guilty  when she concluded cecilia walked across the apartment and took a seat by the side of alice dunscombe with whom she began to converse in a low soothing tone of voice mr dillon bowed with a deprecating humility and having ascertained that colonel howard chose to give an audience where he sat to the prisoners he withdrew to execute his mission secretly exulting at any change that promised to lead to a renewal of an intercourse that might terminate more to his advantage than the lofty beauty whose favor he courted was at present disposed to concede  christopher is a worthy serviceable good fellow said the colonel when the door closed and i hope to live yet to see him clad in ermine i would not be understood literally but figuratively for furs would but ill comport with the climate of the carolinas i trust i am to be consulted by his majestys ministers when the new appointments shall be made for the subdued colonies and he may safely rely on my good word being spoken in his favor would he not make an excellent and independent ornament of the bench miss plowden  katherine compressed her lips a little as she replied  i must profit by his own discreet rules and see testimony to that effect before i decide sir but listen the young ladys color changed rapidly and her eyes became fixed in a sort of feverish gaze on the door he has at least been active i hear the heavy tread of men already approaching  ah it is he certainly justice ought always to be prompt as well as certain to make it perfect like a drumhead courtmartial which by the way is as summary a sort of government as heart could wish to live under if his majestys ministers could be persuaded to introduce into the revolted colonies  listen interrupted katherine in a voice which bespoke her deep anxiety they draw near  the sound of footsteps was in fact now so audible as to induce the colonel to suspend the delivery of his plan for governing the recovered provinces the long low gallery which was paved with a stone flagging soon brought the footsteps of the approaching party more distinctly to their ears and presently a low tap at the door announced their arrival colonel howard arose with the air of one who was to sustain the principal character in the ensuing interview and bade them enter cecilia and alice dunscombe merely cast careless looks at the opening door indifferent to the scene but the quick eye of katherine embraced at a glance every figure in the group drawing a long quivering breath she fell back on the couch and her eyes again lighted with their playful expression as she hummed a low rapid air with a voice in which even the suppressed tones were liquid melody  dillon entered preceding the soldier whose gait had become more steady and in whose rigid eye a thoughtful expression had taken the place of its former vacant gaze in short something had manifestly restored to him a more complete command of his mental powers although he might not have been absolutely sobered the rest of the party continued in the gallery while mr dillon presented the renovated captain to the colonel when the latter did him the same kind office with the ladies  miss plowden said the veteran for she offered first in the circle this is my friend captain borroughcliffe he has long been ambitious of this honor and i have no doubt his reception will be such as to leave him no cause to repent he has been at last successful  katherine smiled and answered with ambiguous emphasis  i know not how to thank him sufficiently for the care he has bestowed on our poor persons  the soldier looked steadily at her for a moment with an eye that seemed to threaten a retaliation in kind ere he replied  one of those smiles madam would be an ample compensation for services that are more real than such as exist only in intention  katherine bowed with more complacency than she usually bestowed on those who wore the british uniform and they proceeded to the next  this is miss alice dunscombe captain borroughcliffe daughter of a very worthy clergyman who was formerly the curate of this parish and a lady who does us the pleasure of giving us a good deal of her society though far less than we all wish for  the captain returned the civil inclination of alice and the colonel proceeded  miss howard allow me to present captain borroughcliffe a gentleman who having volunteered to defend st ruth in these critical times merits all the favor of its mistress  cecilia gracefully rose and received her guest with sweet complacency the soldier made no reply to the customary compliments that she uttered but stood an instant gazing at her speaking countenance and then laying his hand involuntarily on his breast bowed nearly to his sword hilt  these formalities duly observed the colonel declared his readiness to receive the prisoners as the door was opened by dillon katherine cast a cool and steady look at the strangers and beheld the light glancing along the arms of the soldiers who guarded them but the seamen entered alone while the rattling of arms and the heavy dash of the muskets on the stone pavement announced that it was thought prudent to retain a force at hand to watch these secret intruders on the grounds of the abbey     chapter xii   food for powder theyll fill a pit as well as better falstaff   the three men who now entered the apartment appeared to be nothing daunted by the presence into which they were ushered though clad in the coarse and weatherbeaten vestments of seamen who had been exposed to recent and severe duty they silently obeyed the direction of the soldiers finger and took their stations in a distant corner of the room like men who knew the deference due to rank at the same time that the habits of their lives had long accustomed them to encounter the vicissitudes of the world with this slight preparation colonel howard began the business of examination  i trust ye are all good and loyal subjects the veteran commenced with a considerate respect for innocence but the times are such that even the most worthy characters become liable to suspicion and consequently if our apprehensions should prove erroneous you must overlook the mistake and attribute it to the awful condition into which rebellion has plunged this empire we have much reason to fear that some project is about to be undertaken on the coast by the enemy who has appeared we know with a frigate and schooner and the audacity of the rebels is only equaled by their shameless and wicked disrespect for the rights of the sovereign  while colonel howard was uttering his apologetic preamble the prisoners fastened their eyes on him with much interest but when he alluded to the apprehended attack the gaze of two of them became more keenly attentive and before he concluded they exchanged furtive glances of deep meaning no reply was made however and after a short pause as if to allow time for his words to make a proper impression the veteran continued  we have no evidence i understand that you are in the smallest degree connected with the enemies of this country but as you have been found out of the kings highway or rather on a bypath which i must confess is frequently used by the people of the neighborhood but which is nevertheless nothing but a bypath it becomes no more than what selfpreservation requires of us to ask you a few such questions as i trust will be satisfactorily answered to use your own nautical phrases from whence came ye pray and whither are ye bound  a low deep voice replied  from sunderland last and bound overland to whitehaven  this simple and direct answer was hardly given before the attention of the listeners was called to alice dunscombe who uttered a faint shriek and rose from her seat involuntarily while her eyes seemed to roll fearfully and perhaps a little wildly round the room  are you ill miss alice said the sweet soothing tones of cecilia howard you are indeed you are lean on me that i may lead you to your apartment  did you hear it or was it only fancy she answered her cheek blanched to the whiteness of death and her whole frame shuddering as if in convulsions say did you hear it too  i have heard nothing but the voice of my uncle who is standing near you anxious as we all are for your recovery from this dreadful agitation  alice still gazed wildly from face to face her eye did not rest satisfied with dwelling on those who surrounded her but surveyed with a sort of frantic eagerness the figures and appearance of the three men who stood in humble patience the silent and unmoved witnesses of this extraordinary scene at length she veiled her eyes with both her hands as if to shut out some horrid vision and then removing them she smiled languidly as she signed for cecilia to assist her from the room to the polite and assiduous offers of the gentlemen she returned no other thanks than those conveyed in her looks and gestures but when the sentinels who paced the gallery were passed and the ladies were alone she breathed a long shivering sigh and found an utterance  twas like a voice from the silent grave she said but it could be no more than mockery no no tis a just punishment for letting the image of the creature fill the place that should be occupied only with the creator ah miss howard miss plowden ye are both youngin the pride of your beauty and lovelinessbut little do ye know and less do ye dread the temptations and errors of a sinful world  her thoughts wander whispered katherine with anxious tenderness some awful calamity has affected her intellect  yes it must be my sinful thoughts have wandered and conjured sounds that it would have been dreadful to hear in truth and within these walls said alice more composedly smiling with a ghastly expression as she gazed on the two beautiful solicitous maidens who supported her yielding person but the moment of weakness is passed and i am better aid me to my room and return that you may not interrupt the reviving harmony between yourselves and colonel howard i am now betternay i am quite restored  say not so dear miss alice returned cecilia your face denies what your kindness to us induces you to utter ill very ill you are nor shall even your own commands induce me to leave you  remain then said miss dunscombe bestowing a look of grateful affection on her lovely supporter and while our katherine returns to the drawingroom to give the gentlemen their coffee you shall continue with me as my gentle nurse  by this time they had gained the apartment and katherine after assisting her cousin to place alice on her bed returned to do the honors of the drawingroom  colonel howard ceased his examination of the prisoners at her entrance to inquire with courtly solicitude after the invalid and when his questions were answered he again proceeded as follows  this is what the lads would call plain sailing borroughcliffe they are out of employment in sunderland and have acquaintances and relatives in whitehaven to whom they are going for assistance and labor all very probable and perfectly harmless  nothing more so my respectable host returned the jocund soldier but it seemeth a grievous misfortune that a trio of such flesh and blood should need work wherewithal to exercise their thews and sinews while so many of the vessels of his majestys fleet navigate the ocean in quest of the enemies of old england  there is truth in that much truth in your remark cried the colonel what say you my lads will you fight the frenchmen and the donay and even my own rebellious and infatuated countrymen nay by heaven it is not a trifle that shall prevent his majesty from possessing the services of three such heroes here are five guineas apiece for you the moment that you put foot on board the alacrity cutter and that can easily be done as she lies at anchor this very night only two short leagues to the south of this in a small port where she is riding out the gale as snugly as if she were in a corner of this room  one of the men affected to gaze at the money with longing eyes while he asked as if weighing the terms of the engagement  whether the alacrity was called a good seaboat and was thought to give a comfortable berth to her crew  comfortable echoed borroughcliffe for that matter she is called the bravest cutter in the navy you have seen much of the world i dare say did you ever see such a place as the marine arsenal at carthagena in old spain  indeed i have sir returned the seaman in a cool collected tone  ah you have well did you ever meet with a house in paris that they call the tuileries because its a dogkennel to the alacrity  i have even fallen in with the place you mention sir returned the sailor and must own the berth quite good enough for such as i am if it tallies with your description  the deuce take these bluejackets muttered borroughcliffe addressing himself unconsciously to miss plowden near whom he happened to be at the time they run their tarry countenances into all the corners of the earth and abridge a man most lamentably in his comparisons now who the devil would have thought that fellow had ever put his seagreen eyes on the palace of king louis  katherine heeded not his speech but sat eying the prisoners with a confused and wavering expression of countenance while colonel howard renewed the discourse by exclaiming  come come borroughcliffe let us give the lads no tales for a recruit but good plain honest englishgod bless the language and the land for which it was first made too there is no necessity to tell these men if they are what they seem to be practical seamen that a cutter of ten guns contains all the room and accommodation of a palace  do you allow nothing for english oak and english comfort mine host said the immovable captain do you think good sir that i measure fitness and propriety by square and compass as if i were planning solomons temple anew all i mean to say is that the alacrity is a vessel of singular compactness and magical arrangement of room like the tent of that handsome brother of the fairy in the arabian nights she is big or she is little as occasion needeth and now hang me if i dont think i have uttered more in her favor than her commander would say to help me to a recruit though no lad in the three kingdoms should appear willing to try how a scarlet coat would suit his boorish figure  that time has not yet arrived and god forbid that it ever should while the monarch needs a soldier in the field to protect his rights but what say ye my men you have heard the recommendation that captain borroughcliffe has given of the alacrity which is altogether true after making some allowances for language will ye serve shall i order you a cheering glass a man and lay by the gold till i hear from the cutter that you are enrolled under the banners of the best of kings  katherine plowden who hardly seemed to breathe so close and intent was the interest with which she regarded the seamen fancied she observed lurking smiles on their faces but if her conjectures were true their disposition to be merry went no further and the one who had spoken hitherto replied in the same calm manner as before  you will excuse us if we decline shipping in the cutter sir we are used to distant voyages and large vessels whereas the alacrity is kept at coast duty and is not of a size to lay herself alongside of a don or a frenchman with a double row of teeth  if you prefer that sort of sport you must to the right about for yarmouth there you will find ships that will meet anything that swims said the colonel  perhaps the gentlemen would prefer abandoning the cares and dangers of the ocean for a life of ease and gayety said the captain the hand that has long dallied with a marlinspike may be easily made to feel a trigger as gracefully as a lady touches the keys of her piano in short there is and there is not a great resemblance between the life of a sailor and that of a soldier there are no gales of wind nor short allowances nor reefing topsails nor shipwrecks among soldiers and at the same time there is just as much or even more grogdrinking jollifying carekilling fun around a canteen and an open knapsack than there is on the end of a messchest with a full can and a saturday nights breeze i have crossed the ocean several times and i must own that a ship in good weather is very much the same as a camp or comfortable barracks mind i say only in very good weather  we have no doubt that all you say is true sir observed the spokesman of the three but what to you may seem a hardship to us is pleasure we have faced too many a gale to mind a capful of wind and should think ourselves always in the calm latitudes in one of your barracks where there is nothing to do but to eat our grub and to march a little fore and aft a small piece of green earth we hardly know one end of a musket from the other  no said borroughcliffe musing and then advancing with a quick step toward them he cried in a spirited manner attention right dress  the speaker and the seaman next him gazed at the captain in silent wonder but the third individual of the party who had drawn himself a little aside as if willing to be unnoticed or perhaps pondering on his condition involuntarily started at this unexpected order and erecting himself threw his head to the right as promptly as if he had been on a paradeground  oho ye are apt scholars gentlemen and ye can learn i see continued borroughcliffe i feel it to be proper that i detain these men till tomorrow morning colonel howard and yet i would give them better quarters than the hard benches of the guardroom  act your pleasure captain borroughcliffe returned the host so you do but your duty to our royal master they shall not want for cheer and they can have a room over the servants offices in the south side of the abbey  three rooms my colonel three rooms must be provided though i give up my own  there are severalsmall empty apartments there where blankets might be taken and the men placed for safekeeping if you deem it necessary though to me they seem like good loyal tars whose greatest glory it would be to serve their prince and whose chief pleasure would consist in getting alongside of a don or a monsieur  we shall discuss these matters anon said borroughcliffe dryly i see miss plowden begins to look grave at our abusing her patience so long and i know that cold coffee is like withered love but a tasteless sort of a beverage come gentlemen en avant you have seen the tuileries and must have heard a little french mr christopher dillon know you where these three small apartments are situate lying and being as your parchments read  i do sir said the complying lawyer and shall take much pleasure in guiding you to them i think your decision that of a prudent and sagacious officer and much doubt whether durham castle or some other fortress will be thought too big to hold them ere long  as this speech was uttered while the men were passing from the room its effect on them was unnoticed but katherine plowden who was left for a few moments by herself sat and pondered over what she had seen and heard with a thoughtfulness of manner that was not usual to her gay and buoyant spirits the sounds of the retiring footsteps however gradually grew fainter and the return of her guardian alone recalled the recollection of the young lady to the duties of her situation  while engaged in the little offices of the teatable katherine threw many furtive glances at the veteran but although he seemed to be musing there was nothing austere or suspicious in his frank open countenance there is much useless trouble taken with these wandering seamen sir said katherine at length it seems to be the particular province of mr christopher dillon to make all that come in contact with him excessively uncomfortable  and what has kit to do with the detention of the men  what why has he not undertaken to stand godfather to their prisons by a womans patience i think colonel howard this business will gain a pretty addition to the names of st ruth it is already called a house an abbey a place and by some a castle let mr dillon have his way for a month and it will add jail to the number  kit is not so happy as to possess the favor of miss plowden but still kit is a worthy fellow and a good fellow and a sensible fellow ay and what is of more value than all these put together miss katherine mr christopher dillon is a faithful and loyal subject to his prince his mother was my cousingerman madam and i cannot say how soon i may call him my nephew the dillons are of good irish extraction and i believe that even miss plowden will admit that the howards have some pretensions to a name  ah it is those very things called names that i most allude to said katherine quickly but an hour since you were indignant my dear guardian because you suspected that i insinuated you ought to write jailer behind the name of howard and even now you submit to have the office palmed upon you  you forget miss katherine plowden that it is the pleasure of one of his majestys officers to detain these men  but i thought that the glorious british constitution which you so often mention interrupted the young lady spiritedly gives liberty to all who touch these blessed shores you know sir that out of twenty blacks that you brought with you how few remain the rest having fled on the wings of the spirit of british liberty  this was touching a festering sore in the colonels feelings and his provoking ward well knew the effects her observation was likely to produce her guardian did not break forth in a violent burst of rage or furnish those manifestations of his ire that he was wont to do on less important subjects but he arose with all his dignity concentred in a look and after making a violent effort to restrain his feelings within the bounds necessary to preserve the decorum of his exit he ventured a reply  that the british constitution is glorious madam is most true that this island is the sole refuge where liberty has been able to find a home is also true the tyranny and oppression of the congress which are grinding down the colonies to the powder of desolation and poverty are not worthy the sacred name rebellion pollutes all that it touches madam although it often commences under the sanction of holy liberty it ever terminates in despotism the annals of the world from the time of the greeks and romans down to the present day abundantly prove it there was that julius caesarhe was one of your peoples men and he ended a tyrant oliver cromwell was anothera rebel a demagogue and a tyrant the gradations madam are as inevitable as from childhood to youth and from youth to age as for the little affair that you have been pleased to mention of theof theof my private concerns i can only say that the affairs of nations are not to be judged of by domestic incidents any more than domestic occurrences are to be judged of by national politics the colonel like many a better logician mistook his antithesis for argument and paused a moment to admire his own eloquence but the current of his thoughts which always flowed in torrents on this subject swept him along in its course and he continued yes madam here and here alone is true liberty to be found with this solemn asseveration which is not lightly made but which is the result of sixty years experience i leave you miss plowden let it be a subject of deep reflection with you for i too well understand your treacherous feelings not to know that your political errors encourage your personal foibles reflect for your own sake if you love not only your own happiness but your respectability and standing in the world as for the black hounds that you spoke of they are a set of rebellious mutinous ungrateful rascals and if ever i meet one of the damned  the colonel had so far controlled his feelings as to leave the presence of the lady before he broke out into the bitter invectives we have recorded and katherine stood a minute pressing her forefinger on her lips listening to his voice as it grumbled along the gallery until the sounds were finally excluded by the closing of a distant door the willful girl then shook her dark locks and a smile of arch mischief blended with an expression of regret in her countenance as she spoke to herself while with hurried hands she threw her tea equipage aside in a confused pile  it was perhaps a cruel experiment but it has succeeded though prisoners ourselves we are at least left free for the remainder of this night these mysterious sailors must be examined more closely if the proud eye of edward griffith was not glaring under the black wig of one of them i am no judge of features and where has master barnstable concealed his charming visage for neither of the others could be he but now for cecilia  her light form glided from the room while she was yet speaking and flitting along the dimly lighted passages it disappeared in one of those turnings that led to the more secret apartments of the abbey     chapter xiii    how lucia wouldst them have me sink away   in pleasing dreams and lose myself in love   cato   the reader must not imagine that the world stood still during the occurrence of the scenes we have related by the time the three seamen were placed in as many different rooms and a sentinel was stationed in the gallery common to them all in such a manner as to keep an eye on his whole charge at once the hour had run deep into the night captain borroughcliffe obeyed a summons from the colonel who made him an evasive apology for the change in their evenings amusement and challenged his guest to a renewal of the attack on the madeira this was too grateful a theme to be lightly discussed by the captain and the abbey clock had given forth as many of its mournful remonstrances as the division of the hours would permit before they separated in the mean time mr dillon became invisible though a servant when questioned by the host on the subject announced that he believed mr christopher had chosen to ride over to to be in readiness to join the hunt on the morning with the dawn while the gentlemen were thus indulging themselves in the diningparlor and laughing over the tales of other times and hard campaigns two very different scenes occurred in other parts of the building  when the quiet of the abbey was only interrupted by the howling of the wind or by the loud and prolonged laughs which echoed through the passages from the joyous pair who were thus comfortably established by the side of the bottle a door was gently opened on one of the galleries of the cloisters and katherine plowden issued from it wrapped in a close mantle and holding in her hand a chamberlamp which threw its dim light faintly along the gloomy walls in front leaving all behind her obscured in darkness she was however soon followed by two other female figures clad in the same manner and provided with similar lights when all were in the gallery katherine drew the door softly to and proceeded in front to lead the way  hist said the low tremulous voice of cecilia they are yet up in the other parts of the house and if it be as you suspect our visit would betray them and prove the means of their certain destruction  is the laugh of colonel howard in his cups so singular and unknown to your ear cecilia that you know it not said katherine with a little spirit or do you forget that on such occasions he seldom leaves himself ears to hear or eyes to see with but follow me it is as i suspectit must be as i suspect and unless we do something to rescue them they are lost unless they have laid a deeper scheme than is apparent  it is a dangerous road ye both journey added the placid tones of alice dunscombe but ye are young and ye are credulous  if you disapprove of our visit said cecilia it cannot be right and we had better return  no no i have said nought to disapprove of your present errand if god has put the lives of those in your custody whom ye have taught yourselves to look up to with love and reverence such as woman is bound to yield to one man he has done it for no idle purpose lead us to their doors katherine let us relieve our doubts at least  the ardent girl did not wait for a second bidding but she led them with light and quick steps along the gallery until they reached its termination where they descended to the basement floor by a flight of narrow steps and carefully opening a small door emerged into the open air they now stood on a small plat of grass which lay between the building and the ornamental garden across which they moved rapidly concealing their lights and bending their shrinking forms before the shivering blasts that poured their fury upon them from the ocean they soon reached a large but rough addition to the buildings that concealed its plain architecture behind the more labored and highly finished parts of the edifice into which they entered through a massive door that stood ajar as if to admit them  chloe has been true to my orders whispered katherine as they passed out of the chilling air now if all the servants are asleep our chance to escape unnoticed amounts to certainty  it became necessary to go through the servants hall which they effected unobserved as it had but one occupant an aged black man who being posted with his ear within two feet of a bell in this attitude had committed himself to a deep sleep gliding through this hall they entered divers long and intricate passages all of which seemed as familiar to katherine as they were unknown to her companions until they reached another flight of steps which they ascended they were now near their goal and stopped to examine whether any or what difficulties were likely to be opposed to their further progress  now indeed our case seems hopeless whispered katherine as they stood concealed by the darkness in one end of an extremely long narrow passage here is the sentinel in the building instead of being as i had supposed under the windows what is to be done now  let us return said cecilia in the same manner my influence with my uncle is great even though he seems unkind to us at times in the morning i will use it to persuade him to free them on receiving their promise to abandon all such attempts in future  in the morning it will be too late returned katherine i saw that demon kit dillon mount his horse under the pretence of riding to the great hunt of tomorrow but i know his malicious eye too well to be deceived in his errand he is silent that he may be sure and if to morrow comes and finds griffith within these walls he will be condemned to a scaffold  say no more said alice dunscombe with singular emotion some lucky circumstance may aid us with this sentinel  as she spoke she advanced they had not proceeded far before the stern voice of the soldier challenged the party  tis no time to hesitate whispered katherine we are the ladies of the abbey looking to our domestic affairs she continued aloud and think it a little remarkable that we are to encounter armed men while going through our own dwelling  the soldier respectfully presented his musket and replied  my orders are to guard the doors of these three rooms ladies we have prisoners in them and as for anything else my duty will be to serve you all in my power  prisoners exclaimed katherine in affected surprise does captain borroughcliffe make st ruths abbey a jail of what offences are the poor men guilty  i know not my lady but as they are sailors i suppose they have run from his majestys service  this is singular truly and why are they not sent to the county prison  this must be examined into said cecilia dropping the mantle from before her face as mistress of this house i claim a right to know whom its walls contain you will oblige me by opening the doors for i see you have the keys suspended from your belt  the sentinel hesitated he was greatly awed by the presence and beauty of the speakers but a still voice reminded him of his duty a lucky thought however interposed to relieve him from his dilemma and at the same time to comply with the request or rather order of the lady as he handed her the keys he said  here they are my lady my orders are to keep the prisoners in not to keep any one out when you are done with them you will please to return them to me if it be only to save a poor fellows eye for unless the door is kept locked i shall not dare to look about me for a moment  cecilia promised to return the keys and she had applied one of them to a lock with a trembling hand when alice dunscombe arrested her arm and addressed the soldier  say you there are threeare they men in years  no my lady all good serviceable lads who couldnt do better than to serve his majesty or as it may prove worse than to run from their colors  but are their years and appearance similar i ask for i have a friend who has been guilty of some boyish tricks and has tried the seas i hear among other foolish hazards  there is no boy here in the far room on the left is a smart soldier looking chap of about thirty who the captain thinks has carried a musket before now on him i am charged to keep a particular eye next to him is as pretty a looking youth as eyes could wish to see and it makes one feel mournful to think what he must come to if he has really deserted his ship in the room near you is a smaller quiet little body who might make a better preacher than a sailor or a soldier either he has such a gentle way with him  alice covered her eyes with her hand a moment and then recovering herself proceeded  gentleness may do more with the unfortunate men than fear here is a guinea withdraw to the far end of the passage where you can watch them as well as here while we enter and endeavor to make them confess who and what they really are  the soldier took the money and after looking about him in a little uncertainty he at length complied as it was obviously true they could only escape by passing him near the flight of steps when he was beyond hearing alice dunscombe turned to her companions and a slight glow appeared in feverish spots on her cheeks as she addressed them  it would be idle to attempt to hide from you that i expect to meet the individual whose voice i must have heard in reality tonight instead of only imaginary sounds as i vainly if not wickedly supposed i have many reasons for changing my opinion the chief of which is that he is leagued with the rebellious americans in this unnatural war nay chide me not miss plowden you will remember that i found my being on this island i come here on no vain or weak errand miss howard but to spare human blood she paused as if struggling to speak calmly but no one can witness the interview except our god  go then said katherine secretly rejoicing at her determination while we inquire into the characters of the others  alice dunscombe turned the key and gently opening the door she desired her companions to tap for her as they returned and then instantly disappeared in the apartment  cecilia and her cousin proceeded to the next door which they opened in silence and entered cautiously into the room katherine plowden had so far examined into the arrangements of colonel howard as to know that at the same time he had ordered blankets to be provided for the prisoners he had not thought it necessary to administer any further to the accommodations of men who had apparently made their beds and pillows of planks for the greater part of their lives  the ladies accordingly found the youthful sailor whom they sought with his body rolled in the shaggy covering extended at his length along the naked boards and buried in a deep sleep so timid were the steps of his visitors and so noiseless was their entrance that they approached even to his side without disturbing his slumbers the head of the prisoner lay rudely pillowed on a billet of wood one hand protecting his face from its rough surface and the other thrust in his bosom where it rested with a relaxed grasp on the handle of a dirk although he slept and that heavily yet his rest was unnatural and perturbed his breathing was hard and quick and something like the low rapid murmurings of a confused utterance mingled with his respiration the moment had now arrived when the character of cecilia howard appeared to undergo an entire change hitherto she had been led by her cousin whose activity and enterprise seemed to qualify her so well for the office of guide but now she advanced before katherine and extending her lamp in such a manner as to throw the light across the face of the sleeper she bent to examine his countenance with keen and anxious eyes  am i right whispered her cousin  may god in his infinite compassion pity and protect him murmured cecilia her whole frame involuntarily shuddering as the conviction that she beheld griffith flashed across her mind yes katherine it is he and presumptuous madness has driven him here but time presses he must be awakened and his escape effected at every hazard  nay then delay no longer but rouse him from his sleep  griffith edward griffith said the soft tones of cecilia griffith awake  your call is useless for they sleep nightly among tempests and boisterous sounds said katherine but i have heard it said that the smallest touch will generally cause one of them to stir  griffith repeated cecilia laying her fair hand timidly on his own  the flash of lightning is not more nimble than the leap that the young man made to his feet which he no sooner gained than his dirk gleamed in the light of the lamps as he brandished it fiercely with one hand while with the other he extended a pistol in a menacing attitude towards his disturbers  stand back he exclaimed i am your prisoner only as a corpse  the fierceness of his front and the glaring eyeballs that tolled wildly around him appalled cecilia who shrank back in fear dropping her mantle from her person but still keeping her mild eyes fastened on his countenance with a confiding gaze that contradicted her shrinking attitude as she replied  edward it is i cecilia howard come to save you from destruction you are known even through your ingenious disguise  the pistol and the dirk fell together on the blanket of the young sailor whose looks instantly lost their disturbed expression in a glow of pleasure  fortune at length favors me he cried this is kind cecilia more than i deserve and much more than i expected but you are not alone  tis my cousin kate to her piercing eyes you owe your detection and she has kindly consented to accompany me that we might urge you to nay that we might if necessary assist you to fly for tis cruel folly griffith thus to tempt your fate  have i tempted it then in vain miss plowden to you i must appeal for an answer and a justification  katherine looked displeased but after a moments hesitation she replied  your servant mr griffith i perceive that the erudite captain barnstable has not only succeeded in spelling through my scrawl but he has also given it to all hands for perusal  now you do both him and me injustice said griffith it surely was not treachery to show me a plan in which i was to be a principal actor  ah doubtless your excuses are as obedient to your calls as your men returned the young lady but how comes it that the hero of the ariel sends a deputy to perform a duty that is so peculiarly his own is he wont to be second in rescues  heaven forbid that you should think so meanly of him for a moment we owe you much miss plowden but we may have other duties you know that we serve our common country and have a superior with us whose beck is our law  return then mr griffith while you may to the service of our bleeding country said cecilia and after the joint efforts of her brave children have expelled the intruders from her soil let us hope there shall come a time when katherine and myself may be restored to our native homes  think you miss howard to how long a period the mighty arm of the british king may extend that time we shall prevail a nation fighting for its dearest rights must ever prevail but tis not the work of a day for a people poor scattered and impoverished as we have been to beat down a power like that of england surely you forget that in bidding me to leave you with such expectations miss howard you doom me to an almost hopeless banishment  we must trust to the will of god said cecilia if he ordain that america is to be free only after protracted sufferings i can aid her but with my prayers but you have an arm and an experience griffith that might do her better service waste not your usefulness then in visionary schemes for private happiness but seize the moments as they offer and return to your ship if indeed it is yet in safety and endeavor to forget this mad undertaking and for a time the being who has led you to the adventure  this is a reception that i had not anticipated returned griffith for though accident and not intention has thrown me into your presence this evening i did hope that when i again saw the frigate it would be in your company cecilia  you cannot justly reproach me mr griffith with your disappointment for i have not uttered or authorized a syllable that could induce you or any one to believe that i would consent to quit my uncle  miss howard will not think me presumptuous if i remind her that there was a time when she did not think me unworthy to be entrusted with her person and happiness  a rich bloom mantled on the face of cecilia as she replied  nor do i now mr griffith but you do well to remind me of my former weakness for the recollection of its folly and imprudence only adds to my present strength  nay interrupted her eager lover if i intended a reproach or harbored a boastful thought spurn me from you forever as unworthy of your favor  i acquit you of both much easier than i can acquit myself of the charge of weakness and folly continued cecilia but there are many things that have occurred since we last met to prevent a repetition of such inconsiderate rashness on my part one of them is she added smiling sweetly that i have numbered twelve additional months to my age and a hundred to my experience another and perhaps a more important one is that my uncle then continued among the friends of his youth surrounded by those whose blood mingles with his own but here he lives a stranger and though he finds some consolation in dwelling in a building where his ancestors have dwelt before him yet he walks as an alien through its gloomy passages and would find the empty honor but a miserable compensation for the kindness and affection of one whom he has loved and cherished from her infancy  and yet he is opposed to you in your private wishes cecilia unless my besotted vanity has led me to believe what it would now be madness to learn was false and in your opinions of public things you are quite as widely separated i should think there could be but little happiness dependent on a connection where there is no one feeling entertained in common  there is and an allimportant one said miss howard tis our love he is my kind my affectionate and unless thwarted by some evil cause my indulgent uncle and guardianand i am his brother harrys child this tie is not easily to be severed mr griffith though as i do not wish to see you crazed i shall not add that your besotted vanity has played you false but surely edward it is possible to feel a double tie and so to act as to discharge our duties to both i never never can or will consent to desert my uncle a stranger as he is in the land whose rule he upholds so blindly you know not this england griffith she receives her children from the colonies with cold and haughty distrust like a jealous stepmother who is wary of the favors that she bestows on her fictitious offspring  i know her in peace and i know her in war said the young sailor proudly and can add that she is a haughty friend and a stubborn foe but she grapples now with those who ask no more of her than an open sea and an enemys favors but this determination will be melancholy tidings for me to convey to barnstable  nay said cecilia smiling i cannot vouch for others who have no uncles and who have an extra quantity of ill humor and spleen against this country its people and its laws although profoundly ignorant of them all  is miss howard tired of seeing me under the tiles of st ruth asked katherine but hark are there not footsteps approaching along the gallery  they listened in breathless silence and soon heard distinctly the approaching tread of more than one person voices were quite audible and before they had time to consult on what was best to be done the words of the speakers were distinctly heard at the door of their own apartment  ay he has a military air about him peters that will make him a prize come open the door  this is not his room your honor said the alarmed soldier he quarters in the last room in the gallery  how know you that fellow come produce the key and open the way for me i care not who sleeps here there is no saying but i may enlist them all three  a single moment of dreadful incertitude succeeded when the sentinel was heard saying in reply to this peremptory order  i thought your honor wanted to see the one with the black stock and so left the rest of the keys at the other end of the passage but  but nothing you loon a sentinel should always carry his keys about him like a jailer follow then and let me see the lad who dresses so well to the right  as the heart of katherine began to beat less vehemently she said  tis borroughcliffe and too drunk to see that we have left the key in the door but what is to be done we have but a moment for consultation  as the day dawns said cecilia quickly i shall send here under the pretence of conveying you food my own woman  there is no need of risking anything for my safety interrupted griffith i hardly think we shall be detained and if we are barnstable is at hand with a force that would scatter these recruits to the four winds of heaven  ah that would lead to bloodshed and scenes of horror exclaimed cecilia  listen cried katherine they approach again  a man now stopped once more at their door which was opened softly and the face of the sentinel was thrust into the apartment  captain borroughcliffe is on his rounds and for fifty of your guineas i would not leave you here another minute  but one word more said cecilia  not a syllable my lady for my life returned the man the lady from the next room waits for you and in mercy to a poor fellow go back where you came from  the appeal was unanswerable and they complied cecilia saying as they left the room  i shall send you food in the morning young man and directions how to take the remedy necessary to your safety  in the passage they found alice dunscombe with her face concealed in her mantle and it would seem by the heavy sighs that escaped from her deeply agitated by the interview which she had just encountered  but as the reader may have some curiosity to know what occurred to distress this unoffending lady so sensibly we shall detain the narrative to relate the substance of that which passed between her and the individual whom she sought     chapter xiv    as when a lion in his den     hath heard the hunters cries   and rushes forth to meet his foes     so did the douglas rise   percy   alice dunscombe did not find the second of the prisoners buried like griffith in sleep but he was seated on one of the old chairs that were in the apartment with his back to the door and apparently looking through the small window on the dark and dreary scenery over which the tempest was yet sweeping in its fury her approach was unheeded until the light from her lamp glared across his eyes when he started from his musing posture and advanced to meet her he was the first to speak  i expected this visit he said when i found that you recognized my voice and i felt a deep assurance in my breast that alice dunscombe would never betray me  his listener though expecting this confirmation of her conjectures was unable to make an immediate reply but she sank into the seat he had abandoned and waited a few moments as if to recover her powers  it was then no mysterious warning no airy voice that mocked my ear but a dread reality she at length said why have you thus braved the indignation of the laws of your country on what errand of fell mischief has your ruthless temper again urged you to embark  this is strong and cruel language coming from you to me alice dunscombe returned the stranger with cool asperity and the time has been when i should have been greeted after a shorter absence with milder terms  i deny it not i cannot if i would conceal my infirmity from myself or you i hardly wish it to continue unknown to the world if i have once esteemed you if i have plighted to you my troth and in my confiding folly forgot my higher duties god has amply punished me for the weakness in your own evil deeds  nay let not our meeting be embittered with useless and provoking recriminations said the other for we have much to say before you communicate the errand of mercy on which you have come hither i know you too well alice not to see that you perceive the peril in which i am placed and are willing to venture something for my safety your motherdoes she yet live  she is gone in quest of my blessed father said alice covering her pale face with her hands they have left me alone truly for he who was to have been all to me was first false to his faith and has since become unworthy of my confidence  the stranger became singularly agitated his usually quiet eye glancing hastily from the floor to the countenance of his companion as he paced the room with hurried steps at length he replied  there is much perhaps to be said in explanation that you do not know i left the country because i found in it nothing but oppression and injustice and i could not invite you to become the bride of a wanderer without either name or fortune but i have now the opportunity of proving my truth you say you are alone be so no longer and try how far you were mistaken in believing that i should one day supply the place to you of both father and mother  there is something soothing to a female ear in the offer of even protracted justice and alice spoke with less of acrimony in her tones during the remainder of their conference if not with less of severity in her language  you talk not like a man whose very life hangs but on a thread that the next minute may snap asunder whither would you lead me is it to the tower at london  think not that i have weakly exposed my person without a sufficient protection returned the stranger with cool indifference there are many gallant men who only wait my signal to crush the paltry force of this officer like a worm beneath my feet  then has the conjecture of colonel howard been true i and the manner in which the enemys vessels have passed the shoals is no longer a mystery you have been their pilot  i have  what would ye pervert the knowledge gained in the springtime of your guileless youth to the foul purpose of bringing desolation to the doors of those you once knew and respected john john is the image of the maiden whom in her morning of beauty and simplicity i believe you did love so faintly impressed that it cannot soften your hard heart to the misery of those among whom she has been born and who compose her little world  not a hair of theirs shall be touched not a thatch shall blaze nor shall a sleepless night befall the vilest among themand all for your sake alice england comes to this contest with a seared conscience and bloody hands but all shall be forgotten for the present when both opportunity and power offer to make her feel our vengeance even in her vitals i came on no such errand  what then has led you blindly into snares where all your boasted aid would avail you nothing for should i call aloud your name even here in the dark and dreary passages of this obscure edifice the cry would echo through the country ere the morning and a whole people would be found in arms to punish your audacity  my name has been sounded and that in no gentle strains returned the pilot scornfully when a whole people have quailed at it the craven cowardly wretches flying before the man they had wronged i have lived to bear the banners of the new republic proudly in sight of the three kingdoms when practised skill and equal arms have in vain struggled to pluck it down ay alice the echoes of my guns are still roaring among your eastern hills and would render my name more appalling than inviting to your sleeping yeomen  boast not of the momentary success that the arm of god has yielded to your unhallowed efforts said alice for a day of severe and heavy retribution must follow nor flatter yourself with the idle hope that your name terrible as ye have rendered it to the virtuous is sufficient of itself to drive the thoughts of home and country and kin from all who hear itnay i know not that even now in listening to you i am not forgetting a solemn duty which would teach me to proclaim your presence that the land might know that her unnatural son is a dangerous burden in her bosom  the pilot turned quickly in his short walk and after reading her countenance with the expression of one who felt his security he said in gentler tones  would that be alice dunscombe would that be like the mild generous girl whom i knew in my youth but i repeat the threat would fail to intimidate even if you were capable of executing it i have said that it is only to make the signal to draw around me a force sufficient to scatter these dogs of soldiers to the four winds of heaven  have you calculated your power justly john said alice unconsciously betraying her deep interest in his safety have you reckoned the probability of mr dillons arriving accompanied by an armed band of horsemen with the mornings sun for its no secret in the abbey that he is gone in quest of such assistance  dillon exclaimed the pilot starting who is he and on what suspicion does he seek this addition to your guard  nay john look not at me as if you would know the secrets of my heart it was not i who prompted him to such a step you cannot for a moment think that i would betray you but too surely he has gone and as the night wears rapidly away you should be using the hour of grace to effect our own security  fear not for me alice returned the pilot proudly while a faint smile struggled around his compressed lip and yet i like not this movement either how call you his name dillon is he a minion of king george  he is john what you are not a loyal subject of his sovereign lord the king and though a native of the revolted colonies he has preserved his virtue uncontaminated amid the corruptions and temptations of the times  an american and disloyal to the liberties of the human race by heaven he had better not cross me for if my arm reach him it shall hold him forth as a spectacle of treason to the world  and has not the world enough of such a spectacle in yourself are ye not even now breathing your native air though lurking through the mists of the island with desperate intent against its peace and happiness  a dark and fierce expression of angry resentment flashed from the eyes of the pilot and even his iron frame seemed to shake with emotion as he answered  call you his dastardly and selfish treason aiming as it does to aggrandize a few at the expense of millions a parallel case to the generous ardor that impels a man to fight in the defence of sacred liberty i might tell you that i am armed in the common cause of my fellowsubjects and countrymen that though an ocean divided us in distance yet are we a people of the same blood and children of the same parents and that the hand which oppresses one inflicts an injury on the other but i disdain all such narrow apologies i was born on this orb and i claim to be a citizen of it a man with a soul not to be limited by the arbitrary boundaries of tyrants and hirelings but one who has the right as well as the inclination to grapple with oppression in whose name so ever it is exercised or in whatever hollow and specious shape it founds its claim to abuse our race  ah john john though this may sound like reason to rebellious ears to mine it seemeth only as the ravings of insanity it is in vain ye build up your new and disorganizing systems of rule or rather misrule which are opposed to all that the world has ever yet done or ever will see done in peace and happiness what avail your subtleties and false reasonings against the heart it is the heart which tells us where our home is and how to love it  you talk like a weak and prejudiced woman alice said the pilot more composedly and one who would shackle nations with the ties that bind the young and feeble of your own sex together  and by what holier or better bond can they be united said alice are not the relations of domestic life of gods establishing and have not the nations grown from families as branches spread from the stem till the tree overshadows the land tis an ancient and sacred tie that binds man to his nation neither can it be severed without infamy  the pilot smiled disdainfully and throwing open the rough exterior of his dress he drew forth in succession several articles while a glowing pride lighted his countenance as he offered them singly to her notice  see alice he said call you this infamy this broad sheet of parchment is stamped with a seal of no mean importance and it bears the royal name of the princely louis also and view this cross decorated as it is with jewels the gift of the same illustrious hand it is not apt to be given to the children of infamy neither is it wise or decorous to stigmatize a man who has not been thought unworthy to consort with princes and nobles by the opprobrious name of the scotch pirate  and have ye not earned the title john by ruthless deeds and bitter animosity i could kiss the baubles ye show me if they were a thousand times less splendid had they been laid upon your breast by the hands of your lawful prince but now they appear to my eyes as indelible blots upon your attainted name as for your associates i have heard of them and it seemeth that a queen might be better employed than encouraging by her smiles the disloyal subjects of other monarchs though even her enemies god only knows when his pleasure may suffer a spirit of disaffection to rise up among the people of her own nation and then the thought that she has encouraged rebellion may prove both bitter and unwelcome  that the royal and lovely antoinette has deigned to repay my services with a small portion of her gracious approbation is not among the least of my boasts returned the pilot in affected humility while secret pride was manifested even in his lofty attitude but venture not a syllable in her dispraise for you know not whom you censure she is less distinguished by her illustrious birth and elevated station than by her virtues and loveliness she lives the first of her sex in europe the daughter of an emperor the consort of the most powerful king and the smiling and beloved patroness of a nation who worship at her feet her life is above all reproach as it is above all earthly punishment were she so lost as to merit it and it has been the will of providence to place her far beyond the reach of all human misfortunes  has it placed her above human errors john punishment is the natural and inevitable consequence of sin and unless she can say more than has ever fallen to the lot of humanity to say truly she may yet be made to feel the chastening arm of one to whose eyes all her pageantry and power are as vacant as the air she breathesso insignificant must it seem when compared to his own just rule but if you vaunt that you have been permitted to kiss the hem of the robes of the french queen and have been the companion of highborn and flaunting ladies clad in their richest array can ye yet say to yourself that amid them all ye have found one whose tongue has been bold to tell you the truth or whose heart has sincerely joined in her false professions  certainly none have met me with the reproaches that i have this night received from alice dunscombe after a separation of six long years returned the pilot  if i have spoken to you the words of holy truth john let them not be the less welcome because they are strangers to your ears oh think that she who has thus dared to use the language of reproach to one whose name is terrible to all who live on the border of this island is led to the rash act by no other motive than interest in your eternal welfare  alice alice you madden me with these foolish speeches am i a monster to frighten unprotected women and helpless children what mean these epithets as coupled with my name have you too lent a credulous ear to the vile calumnies with which the policy of your rulers has ever attempted to destroy the fair fame of those who oppose them and those chiefly who oppose them with success my name may be terrible to the officers of the royal fleet but where and how have i earned a claim to be considered formidable to the helpless and unoffending  alice dunscombe cast a furtive and timid glance at the pilot which spoke even stronger than her words as she replied  i know not that all which is said of you and your deeds is true i have often prayed in bitterness and sorrow that a tenth part of that which is laid to your charge may not be heaped on your devoted head at the great and final account but john i have known you long and well and heaven forbid that on this solemn occasion which may be the last the last of our earthly interviews i should be found wanting in christian duty through a womans weakness i have often thought when i have heard the gall of bitter reproach and envenomed language hurled against your name that they who spoke so rashly little understood the man they vituperated but though ye are at times and i may say almost always as mild and even as the smoothest sea over which ye have ever sailed yet god has mingled in your nature a fearful mixture of fierce passions which roused are more like the southern waters when troubled with the tornado it is difficult for me to say how far this evil spirit may lead a man who has been goaded by fancied wrongs to forget his country and home and who is suddenly clothed with power to show his resentments  the pilot listened with rooted attention and his piercing eye seemed to reach the seat of those thoughts which she but half expressed still he retained the entire command of himself and answered more in sorrow than in anger  if anything could convert me to your own peaceful and unresisting opinions alice it would be the reflections that offer themselves at this conviction that even you have been led by the base tongues of my dastardly enemies to doubt my honor and conduct what is fame when a man can be thus traduced to his nearest friends but no more of these childish reflections they are unworthy of myself my office and the sacred cause in which i have enlisted  nay john shake them not off said alice unconsciously laying her hand on his arm they are as the dew to the parched herbage and may freshen the feelings of your youth and soften the heart that has grown hard if hard it be more by unnatural indulgence than its own base inclinations  alice dunscombe said the pilot approaching her with solemn earnestness i have learnt much this night though i came not in quest of such knowledge you have taught me how powerful is the breath of the slanderer and how frail is the tenure by which we hold our good names full twenty times have i met the hirelings of your prince in open battle fighting ever manfully under that flag which was first raised to the breeze by my own hands and which i thank my god i have never yet seen lowered an inch but with no one act of cowardice or private wrong in all that service can i reproach myself and yet how am i rewarded the tongue of the vile calumniator is keener than the sword of the warrior and leaves a more indelible scar  never have ye uttered a truer sentiment john and god send that ye may encourage such thoughts to your own eternal advantage said alice with engaging interest you say that you have risked your precious life in twenty combats and observe how little of heavens favor is bestowed on the abettors of rebellion they tell me that the world has never witnessed a more desperate and bloody struggle than this last for which your name has been made to sound to the furthermost ends of the isle  twill be known wherever naval combats are spoken of interrupted the pilot the melancholy which had begun to lower in his countenance giving place to a look of proud exultation  and yet its fancied glory cannot shield your name from wrong nor are the rewards of the victor equal in a temporal sense to those which the vanquished has received know you that our gracious monarch deeming your adversarys cause so sacred has extended to him his royal favor  ay he has dubbed him knight exclaimed the pilot with a scornful and bitter laugh let him be again furnished with a ship and me with another opportunity and i promise him an earldom if being again vanquished can constitute a claim  speak not so rashly nor vaunt yourself of possessing a protecting power that may desert you john when you most need it and least expect the change returned his companion the battle is not always to the strong neither is the race to the swift  forget you my good alice that your words will admit of a double meaning has the battle been to the strong though you say not well in denying the race to the swift yes yes often and again have the dastards escaped me by their prudent speed alice dunscombe you know not a thousandth part of the torture that i have been made to feel by highborn miscreants who envy the merit they cannot equal and detract from the glory of deeds that they dare not attempt to emulate how have i been cast upon the ocean like some unworthy vessel that is commissioned to do a desperate deed and then to bury itself in the ruin it has made how many malignant hearts have triumphed as they beheld my canvas open thinking that it was spread to hasten me to a gibbet or to a tomb in the bosom of the ocean but i have disappointed them  the eyes of the pilot no longer gazed with their piercing and settled meaning but they flashed with a fierce and wild pleasure as he continued in a louder voice  yes bitterly have i disappointed them oh the triumph over my fallen enemies has been tame to this heartfelt exultation which places me immeasurably above those false and craven hypocrites i begged i implored the frenchmen for the meanest of their craft which possessed but the common qualities of a ship of war i urged the policy and necessity of giving me such a force for even then i promised to be found in harms way but envy and jealousy robbed me of my just dues and of more than half my glory they call me pirate if i have claim to the name it was furnished more by the paltry outfit of my friends than by any act towards my enemies  and do not these recollections prompt you to return to your allegiance to your prince and native land john said alice in a subdued voice  away with the silly thought interrupted the pilot recalled to himself as if by a sudden conviction of the weakness he had betrayed it is ever thus where men are made conspicuous by their worksbut to your visiti have the power to rescue myself and companions from this paltry confinement and yet i would not have it done with violence for your sake bring you the means of doing it in quiet  when the morning arrives you will all be conducted to the apartment where we first metthis will be done at the solicitation of miss howard under the plea of compassion and justice and with the professed object of inquiring into your situations her request will not be refused and while your guard is stationed at the door you will be shown by another entrance through the private apartments of the wing to a window whence you can easily leap to the ground where a thicket is at hand afterwards we shall trust your safety to your own discretion  and if this dillon of whom you have spoken should suspect the truth how will you answer to the law for aiding our escape  i believe he little dreams who is among the prisoners said alice musing though he may have detected the character of one of your companions but it is private feeling rather than public spirit that urges him on  i have suspected something of this returned the pilot with a smile that crossed those features where ungovernable passions that had so lately been exhibited with an effect that might be likened to the last glimmering of an expiring conflagration serving to render the surrounding ruin more obvious this young griffith has led me from my direct path with his idle imprudence and it is right that his mistress should incur some risk but with you alice the case is different here you are only a guest and it is unnecessary that you should be known in the unfortunate affair should my name get abroad this recreant american this colonel howard will find all the favor he has purchased by advocating the cause of tyranny necessary to protect him from the displeasure of the ministry  i fear to trust so delicate a measure to the young discretion of my amiable friend said alice shaking her head  remember that she has her attachment to plead in her excuse but dare you say to the world that you still remember with gentle feelings the man whom you stigmatize with such opprobrious epithets  a slight color gleamed over the brow of alice dunscombe as she uttered in a voice that was barely audible  there is no longer a reason why the world should know of such a weakness though it did exist and as the faint glow passed away leaving her face pale nearly as the hue of death her eyes kindled with unusual fire and she added they can but take my life john and that i am ready to lay down in your service  alice exclaimed the softened pilot my kind my gentle alice  the knock of the sentinel at the door was heard at this critical moment without waiting for a reply to his summons the man entered the apartment and in hurried language declared the urgent necessity that existed for the lady to retire a few brief remonstrances were uttered by both alice and the pilot who wished to comprehend more clearly each others intentions relative to the intended escape but the fear of personal punishment rendered the soldier obdurate and a dread of exposure at length induced the lady to comply she arose and was leaving the apartment with lingering steps when the pilot touching her hand whispered to her impressively  alice we meet again before i leave this island forever  we meet in the morning john she returned in the same tone of voice in the apartments of miss howard  he dropped her hand and she glided from the room when the impatient sentinel closed the door and silently turned the key on his prisoner the pilot remained in a listening attitude until the light footsteps of the retiring pair were no longer audible when he paced his confined apartment with perturbed steps occasionally pausing to look out at the driving clouds and the groaning oaks that were trembling and rocking their broad arms in the fitful gusts of the gale in a few minutes the tempest in his own passions had gradually subsided to the desperate and still calmness that made him the man he was when he again seated himself where alice had found him and began to muse on the events of the times from which the transition to projecting schemes of daring enterprise and mighty consequences was but the usual employment of his active and restless mind     chapter xv    sir and i have no exquisite reason fort but ive reason   good enough    twelfth night   the countenance of captain borroughcliffe when the sentinel admitted him to the apartment he had selected was in that state of doubtful illumination when looks of peculiar cunning blend so nicely with the stare of vacancy that the human face is rendered not unlike an april day now smiling and inviting and at the next moment clouded and dreary it was quite apparent that the soldier had an object for his unexpected visit by the importance of his air and the solemnity of the manner with which he entered on the business he waved his hand for the sentinel to retire with lofty dignity and continued balancing his body during the closing of the door and while a sound continued audible to his confused faculties with his eyes fixed in the direction of the noise with that certain sort of wise look that in many men supplies the place of something better when the captain felt himself secure from interruption he moved round with quick military precision in order to face the man of whom he was in quest griffith had been sleeping though uneasily and with watchfulness and the pilot had been calmly awaiting the visit which it seemed he had anticipated but their associate who was no other than captain manual of the marines was discovered in a very different condition from either though the weather was cool and the night tempestuous he had thrown aside his peajacket with most of his disguise and was sitting ruefully on his blanket wiping with one hand the large drops of sweat from his forehead and occasionally grasping his throat with the other with a kind of convulsed mechanical movement he stared wildly at his visitor though his entrance produced no other alteration in these pursuits than a more diligent application of his handkerchief and a more frequent grasping of his naked neck as if he were willing to ascertain by actual experiment what degree of pressure the part was able to sustain without exceeding a given quantity of inconvenience  comrade i greet ye said borroughcliffe staggering to the side of his prisoner where he seated himself with an entire absence of ceremony comrade i greet ye is the kingdom in danger that gentlemen traverse the island in the uniform of the regiment of incognitus incognitii torumdamme how i forget my latin say my fine fellow are you one of these torums  manual breathed a little hard which considering the manner he had been using his throat was a thing to be expected but swallowing his apprehensions he answered with more spirit than his situation rendered prudent or the occasion demanded  say what you will of me and treat me as you please i defy any man to call me tory with truth  you are no torum well then the waroffice has got up a new dress your regiment must have earned their facings in storming some water battery or perhaps it has done duty as marines am i right  ill not deny it said manual more stoutly i have served as a marine for two years though taken from the line of  the army said borroughcliffe interrupting a most damning confession of which state line the other had belonged to i kept a dogwatch myself once on board the fleet of my lord howe but it is a service that i do not envy any man our afternoon parades were dreadfully unsteady for its a time you know when a man wants solid ground to stand on however i purchased my company with some prizemoney that fell in my way and i always remember the marine service with gratitude but this is dry work i have put a bottle of sparkling madeira in my pocket with a couple of glasses which we will discuss while we talk over more important matters thrust your hand into my right pocket i have been used to dress to the front so long that it comes mighty awkward to me to make this backward motion as if it were into a cartridgebox  manual who had been at a loss how to construe the manner of the other perceived at once a good deal of plain english in this request and he dislodged one of colonel howards dusty bottles with a dexterity that denoted the earnestness of his purpose borroughcliffe had made a suitable provision of glasses and extracting the cork in a certain scientific manner he tendered to his companion a bumper of the liquor before another syllable was uttered by either of the expectants the gentlemen concluded their draughts with a couple of smacks that sounded not unlike the pistols of two practised duellists though certainly a much less alarming noise when the entertainer renewed the discourse  i like one of your mustylooking bottles that is covered with dust and cobwebs with a good southern tan on it he said such liquor does not abide in the stomach but it gets into the heart at once and becomes blood in the beating of a pulse but how soon i knew you that sort of knowledge is the freemasonry of our craft i knew you to be the man you are the moment i laid eyes on you in what we call our guardroom but i thought i would humor the old soldier who lives here by letting him have the formula of an examination as a sort of deference to his age and former rank but i knew you the instant i saw you i have seen you before  the theory of borroughcliffe in relation to the incorporation of wine with the blood might have been true in the case of the marine whose whole frame appeared to undergo a kind of magical change by the experiment of drinking which the reader will understand was diligently persevered in while a drop remained in the bottle the perspiration no longer rolled from his brow neither did his throat manifest that uneasiness which had rendered such constant external applications necessary but he settled down into an air of cool but curious interest which in some measure was the necessary concomitant of his situation  we may have met before as i have been much in service and yet i know not where you could have seen me said manual were you ever a prisoner of war  hum not exactly such an unfortunate devil but a sort of conventional noncombatant i shared the hardships the glory the equivocal victories where we killed and drove countless numbers of rebelswho were not and woe is me the capitulation of burgoyne but let that passwhich was more than the yankees would allow us to do you know not where i could have seen you i have seen you on parade in the field in battle and out of battle in camp in barracks in short everywhere but in a drawingroom no no i have never seen you before this night in a drawingroom  manual stared in a good deal of wonder and some uneasiness at these confident assertions which promised to put his life in no little jeopardy and it is to be supposed that the peculiar sensation about the throat was revived as he made a heavy draught before he said  you will swear to thiscan you call me by name  i will swear to it in any court in christendom said the dogmatical soldier and your name isisfugleman  if it is ill be damnd exclaimed the other with exulting precipitation  swear not said borroughcliffe with a solemn air for what mattereth an empty name call thyself by what appellation thou wilt i know thee soldier is written on thy martial front thy knee bendeth not nay i even doubt if the rebellious member bow in prayer  come sir interrupted manual a little sternly no more of this trifling but declare your will at once rebellious member indeed these fellows will call the skies of america rebellious heavens shortly  i like thy spirit lad returned the undisturbed borroughcliffe it sits as gracefully on a soldier as his sash and gorget but it is lost on an old campaigner i marvel however that thou takest such umbrage at my slight attack on thy orthodoxy i fear the fortress must be weak where the outworks are defended with such a waste of unnecessary courage  i know not why or wherefore you have paid me this visit captain borroughcliffe said manual with a laudable discretion which prompted him to reconnoitre the others views a little before he laid himself more open if captain be your rank and borroughcliffe be your name but this i do know that if it be only to mock me in my present situation it is neither soldier like nor manly and it is what in other circumstances might be attended by some hazard  hum said the other with his immovable coolness i see you set the wine down as nothing though the king drinks not as good for the plain reason that the sun of england cannot find its way through the walls of windsor castle as easily as the sun of carolina can warm a garret covered with cedar shingles but i like your spirit more and more so draw yourself up in battle array and let us have another charge at this black bottle when i shall lay before your military eyes a plan of the whole campaign  manual first bestowed an inquiring glance on his companion when discovering no other expression than foolish cunning which was fast yielding before the encroaching footsteps of stupid inebriety he quietly placed himself in the desired position the wine was drunk when borroughcliffe proceeded to open his communications more unreservedly  you are a soldier and i am a soldier that you are a soldier my orderly could tell for the dog has both seen a campaign and smelt villanous saltpetre when compounded according to a wicked invention but it required the officer to detect the officer privates do not wear such linen as this which seemeth to me an unreasonably cool attire for the season nor velvet stocks with silver buckles nor is there often the odorous flavor of sweetscented pomatum to be discovered around their greasy locks in short thou art both soldier and officer  i confess it said manual i hold the rank of captain and shall expect the treatment of one  i think i have furnished you with wine fit for a general returned borroughcliffe but have your own way now it would be apparent to men whose faculties had not been rendered clear by such cordials as this dwelling aboundeth with that when you officers journey through the island clad in the uniform incognitorum which in your case means the marine corps that something is in the wind of more than usual moment soldiers owe their allegiance to their prince and next to him to war women and wine of war there is none in the realm of women plenty but wine i regret to say that is good wine grows both scarce and dear do i speak to the purpose comrade  proceed said manual whose eyes were not less attentive than his ears in a hope to discover whether his true character were understood  en avant in plain english forward march well then the difficulty lies between women and wine which when the former are pretty and the latter rich is a very agreeable sort of an alternative that it is not wine of which you are in quest i must believe my comrade captain or you would not go on the adventure in such shabby attire you will excuse me but who would think of putting anything better than their port before a man in a pair of tarred trousers no no hollands greenand yellow hollands is a potation good enough to set before one of the present bearing  and yet i have met with him who has treated me to the choicest of the southside madeira  know you the very side from which the precious fluid comes that looks more in favor of the wine but after all woman dear capricious woman who one moment fancies she sees a hero in regimentals and the next a saint in a cassock and who always sees something admirable in a suitor whether he be clad in tow or velvetwoman is at the bottom of this mysterious masquerading am i right comrade  by this time manual had discovered that he was safe and he returned to the conversation with a revival of all his ready wits which had been strangely paralyzed by his previous disorder in the region of the throat first bestowing a wicked wink on his companion and a look that would have outdone the wisest aspect of solomon he replied  ah woman has much to answer for  i knew it exclaimed borroughcliffe and this confession only confirms me in the good opinion i have always entertained of myself if his majesty has any particular wish to close this american business let him have a certain convention burnt and a nameless person promoted and we shall see but answer as you love truth is it a business of holy matrimony or a mere dalliance with the sweets of cupid  of honest wedlock said manual with an air as serious as if hymen already held him in his fetters  tis honest is there money  is there money repeated manual with a sort of contemptuous echo would a soldier part with his liberty but with his life unless the chains were made of gold  thats the true military doctrine cried the other faith you have some discretion in your amphibious corps i find but why this disguise are the seniors grave as well as potent and reverend why this disguise i again ask  why this disguise repeated manual coolly is there any such thing as love in your regiment without disguise with us it is a regular symptom of the disease  a most just and discreet description of the passion my amphibious comrade said the english officer and yet the symptoms in your case are attended by some very malignant tokens does your mistress love tar  no but she loveth me and of course whatever attire i choose to appear in  still discreet and sagacious and yet only a most palpable feint to avoid my direct attack you have heard of such a place as gretna green a little to the north of this i dare say my aquatic comrade am i right  gretna green said manual a little embarrassed by his ignorance some paradeground i suppose  ay for those who suffer under the fire of master cupid a parade ground well there is some artful simplicity in that but all will not do with an old campaigner it is a difficult thing to impose on an old soldier my waterbattery now listen and answer and you shall see what it is to possess a discernmenttherefore deny nothing you are in love  i deny nothing said manual comprehending at once that this was his safest course  your mistress is willing and the money is ready but the old people say halt  i am still mute  tis prudent you say marchgretna green is the object and your flight is to be by water  unless i can make my escape by water i shall never make it said manual with another sympathetic movement with his hand to his throat  keep mute you need tell me nothing i can see into a mystery that is as deep as a well tonight your companions are hirelings perhaps your shipmates or men to pilot you on this expedition  one is my shipmate and the other is our pilot said manual with more truth than usual  you are well provided one thing more and i shall become mute in my turn does she whom you seek lie in this house  she does not she lies but a short distance from this place and i should be a happy fellow could i but once more put foot  eyes on her now listen and you shall have your wish you possess the ability to march yet which considering the lateness of the hour is no trifling privilege open that windowis it possible to descend from it  manual eagerly complied but he turned from the place in disappointment  it would be certain death to attempt the leap the devil only could escape from it  so i should think returned borroughcliffe dryly you must be content to pass for that respectable gentleman for the rest of your days in st ruths abbey for through that identical hole must you wing your flight on the pinions of love  but how the thing is impossible  in imagination only there is some stir a good deal of foolish apprehension and a great excess of idle curiosity among certain of the tenants of this house on your account they fear the rebels who we all know have not soldiers enough to do their work neatly at home and who of course would never think of sending any here you wish to be snugi wish to serve a brother in distress through that window you must be supposed to flyno matter how while by following me you can pass the sentinel and retire peaceably like any other mortal on your own two stout legs  this was a result that exceeded all that manual had anticipated from their amicable but droll dialogue and the hint was hardly given before he threw on the garments that agitation had before rendered such encumbrances and in less time than we have taken to relate it the marine was completely equipped for his departure in the mean time captain borroughcliffe raised himself to an extremely erect posture which he maintained with the inflexibility of a rigid martinet when he found himself established on his feet the soldier intimated to his prisoner that he was ready to proceed the door was instantly opened by manual and together they entered the gallery  who comes there cried the sentinel with a vigilance and vigor that he intended should compensate for his previous neglect of duty  walk straight that he may see you said borroughcliffe with much philosophy  who goes there repeated the sentinel throwing his musket to a poise with a rattling sound that echoed along the naked walls  walk crooked added borroughcliffe that if he fire he may miss  we shall be shot at with this folly muttered manual  we are friends and your officer is one of us  stand friendsadvance officer and give the countersign cried the sentinel  that is much easier said than done returned his captain forward mr amphibious you can walk like a postmanmove to the front and proclaim the magical word loyalty tis a standing countersign ready furnished to my hands by mine hosts the colonel your road is then clear before youbut hark  manual made an eager step forward when recollecting himself he turned and added my assistants the seamen i can do nothing without them  lo the keys are in the doors ready for my admission said the englishman turn them and bring out your forces  quick as thought manual was in the room of griffith to whom he briefly communicated the situation of things when he reappeared in the passage and then proceeded on a similar errand to the room of the pilot  follow and behave as usual he whispered say not a word but trust all to me  the pilot arose and obeyed these instructions without asking a question with the most admirable coolness  i am now ready to proceed said manual when they had joined borroughcliffe  during the short time occupied in these arrangements the sentinel and his captain had stood looking at each other with great military exactitude the former ambitious of manifesting his watchfulness the latter awaiting the return of the marine the captain now beckoned to manual to advance and give the countersign  loyalty whispered manual when he approached the sentinel but the soldier had been allowed time to reflect and as he well understood the situation of his officer he hesitated to allow the prisoner to pass after a moments pause he said  advance friends at this summons the whole party moved to the point of his bayonet when the man continued the prisoners have the countersign captain borroughcliffe but i dare not let them pass  why not asked the captain am i not here sirrah do you not know me  yes sir i know your honor and respect your honor but i was posted here by my sergeant and ordered not to let these men pass out on any account  thats what i call good discipline said borroughcliffe with an exulting laugh i knew the lad would not mind me any more than that he would obey the orders of that lamp here are no slaves of the lamp my amphibious comrade drill ye your marines in this consummate style to niceties  what means this trifling said the pilot sternly  ah i thought i should turn the laugh on you cried manual affecting to join in the mirth we know all these things well and we practise them in our corps but though the sentinel cannot know you the sergeant will so let him be called and orders be given through him to the man on post that we may pass out  your throat grows uneasy i see said borroughcliffe you crave another bottle of the generous fluid well it shall be done sentinel you can throw up yon window and give a call to the sergeant  the outcry will ruin us said the pilot in a whisper to griffith  follow me said the young sailor the sentinel was turning to execute the orders of his captain as griffith spoke when springing forward in an instant he wrenched the musket from his hands a heavy blow with its butt felled the astonished soldier to the floor then poising his weapon griffith exclaimed  forward we can clear our own way now  on said the pilot leaping lightly over the prostrate soldier a dagger gleaming in one hand and a pistol presented in the other  manual was by his side in an instant armed in a similar manner and the three rushed together from the building without meeting any one to oppose their flight  borroughcliffe was utterly unable to follow and so astounded was he by this sudden violence that several minutes passed before he was restored to the use of his speech a faculty which seldom deserted him the man had recovered his senses and his feet however and the two stood gazing at each other in mute condolence at length the sentinel broke the silence  shall i give the alarm your honor  i rather think not peters i wonder if there be any such thing as gratitude or goodbreeding in the marine corps  i hope your honor will remember that i did my duty and that i was disarmed while executing your orders  i can remember nothing about it peters except that it is rascally treatment and such as i shall yet make this amphibious aquatic gentleman answer for but lock the doorlook as if nothing had happened and  ah your honor that is not so easily done as your honor may please to think i have not any doubt but there is the print of the breech of a musket stamped on my back and shoulders as plainly to be seen as that light  then look as you please but hold your peace sirrah here is a crown to buy a plaster i heard the dog throw away your musket on the stairs go seek it and return to your post and when you are relieved act as if nothing had happened i take the responsibility on myself  the man obeyed and when he was once more armed borroughcliffe a good deal sobered by the surprise made the best of his way to his own apartment muttering threats and execrations against the corps of marines and the whole race as he called them of aquatic amphibii     chapter xvi    away away the coveys fled the cover   put forth the dogs and let the falcon fly   ill spend some leisure in the keen pursuit   nor longer waste my hours in sluggish quiet   the soldier passed the remainder of the night in the heavy sleep of a bacchanalian and awoke late on the following morning only when aroused by the entrance of his servant when the customary summons had induced the captain to unclose his eyelids he arose in his bed and after performing the usual operation of a diligent friction on his organs of vision he turned sternly to his man and remarked with an illhumor that seemed to implicate the innocent servant in the fault which his master condemned  i thought sirrah that i ordered sergeant drill not to let a drumstick touch a sheepskin while we quartered in the dwelling of this hospitable old colonel does the fellow despise my commands or does he think the roll of a drum echoing through the crooked passages of st ruth a melody that is fit to disturb the slumbers of its inmates  i believe sir returned the man it was the wish of colonel howard himself that on this occasion the sergeant should turn out the guard by the roll of the drum  the devil it wasi see the old fellow loves to tickle the drum of his own ear now and then with familiar sounds but have you had a muster of the cattle from the farmyard too as well as a parade of the guard i hear the trampling of feet as if the old abbey were a second ark and all the beasts of the field were coming aboard of us  tis nothing but the party of dragoons from who are wheeling into the courtyard sir where the colonel has gone out to receive them  courtyard light dragoons repeated borroughcliffe in amazement and has it come to this that twenty stout fellows of the th are not enough to guard such a rookery as this old abbey against the ghosts and northeast storms but we must have horse to reinforce us hum i suppose some of these booted gentlemen have heard of this south carolina madeira  oh no sir cried his man it is only the party that mr dillon went to seek last evening after you saw fit sir to put the three pirates in irons  pirates in irons said borroughcliffe again passing his hands over his eyes though in a more reflecting manner than before ha oh i remember to have put three suspicious looking rascals in the blackhole or some such place but what can mr dillon or the light dragoons have to do with these fellows  that we do not know sir but it is said below sir as some suspicions had fallen on their being conspirators and rebels from the colonies and that they were great officers and tories in disguise some said that one was general washington and others that it was only three members of the yankee parliament come over to get our good old english fashions to set themselves up with  washington members of congress gogo simpleton and learn how many these troopers muster and what halt they make but stay place my clothes near me now do as i bid you and if the dragoon officer enquire for me make my respects and tell him i shall be with him soon go fellow go  when the man left the room the captain while he proceeded with the business of the toilet occasionally gave utterance to the thoughts that crowded on his recollection after the manner of a soliloquy  ay my commission to a halfpay ensigncy that some of these lazy fellows who must have a fourlegged beast to carry them to the wars have heard of the south side south side i believe i must put an advertisement in the london gazette calling that amphibious soldier to an account if he be a true man he will not hide himself under his incognito but will give me a meeting if that should fail damme ill ride across to yarmouth and call out the first of the mongrel breed that i fall in with sdeath was ever such an insult practised on a gentleman and a soldier before would that i only knew his name why if the tale should get abroad i shall be the standing joke of the mess table until some greater fool than myself can be found it would cost me at least six duels to get rid of it no no not a trigger will i pull in my own regiment about the silly affair but ill have a crack at some marine in very revenge for that is no more than reasonable that peters if the scoundrel should dare whisper anything of the manner in which he was stamped with the breech of the musket i cant flog him for it but if i dont make it up to him the first time he gives me a chance i am ignorant of the true art of balancing regimental accounts  by the time the recruiting officer had concluded this soliloquy which affords a very fair exposition of the current of his thoughts he was prepared to meet the new comers and he accordingly descended to the courtyard as in duty bound to receive them in his proper person boroughcliffe encountered his host in earnest conversation with a young man in a cavalry uniform in the principal entrance of the abbey and was greeted by the former with  a good morning to you my worthy guard and protector here is rare news for your loyal ears it seems that our prisoners are enemies to the king in disguise and cornet fitzgeraldcaptain borroughcliffe of the th permit me to make you acquainted with mr fitzgerald of the th light dragoons while the soldiers exchanged their salutations the old man continued the cornet has been kind enough to lead down a detachment of his troop to escort the rogues up to london or some other place where they will find enough good and loyal officers to form a courtmartial that can authorize their execution as spies christopher dillon my worthy kinsman kit saw into their real characters at a glance while you and i like two unsuspecting boys thought the rascals would have made fit men to serve the king but kit has an eye and a head that few enjoy like him and i would that he might receive his dues at the english bar  it is to be desired sir said borroughcliffe with a grave aspect that was produced chiefly by his effort to give effect to his sarcasm but a little also by the recollection of the occurrences that were yet to be explained but what reason has mr christopher dillon to believe that the three seamen are more or less than they seem  i know not what but a good and sufficient reason i will venture my life cried the colonel kit is a lad for reasons which you know is the foundation of his profession and knows how to deliver them manfully in the proper place but you know gentlemen that the members of the bar cannot assume the open and bold front that becomes a soldier without often endangering the cause in which they are concerned no no trust me kit has his reasons and in good time will he deliver them  i hope then said the captain carelessly that it may be found that we have had a proper watch on our charge colonel howard i think you told me the windows were too high for an escape in that direction for i had no sentinel outside of the building  fear nothing my worthy friend cried his host unless your men have slept instead of watching we have them safe but as it will be necessary to convey them away before any of the civil authority can lay hands on them let us proceed to the rear and unkennel the dogs a party of the horse might proceed at once with them to while we are breaking our fasts it would be no very wise thing to allow the civilians to deal with them for they seldom have a true idea of the nature of the crime  pardon me sir said the young officer of horse i was led to believe by mr dillon that we might meet with a party of the enemy in some little force and that i should find a pleasanter duty than that of a constable besides sir the laws of the realm guarantee to the subject a trial by his peers and it is more than i dare do to carry the men to the barracks without first taking them before a magistrate  ay you speak of loyal and dutiful subjects said the colonel and as respects them doubtless you are right but such privileges are withheld from enemies and traitors  it must be first proved that they are such before they can receive the treatment or the punishment that they merit returned the young man a little positively who felt the more confidence because he had only left the temple the year before if i take charge of the men at all it will be only to transfer them safely to the civil authority  let us go and see the prisoners cried borroughcliffe with a view to terminate a discussion that was likely to wax warm and which he knew to be useless perhaps they may quietly enroll themselves under the banners of our sovereign when all other interference save that of wholesome discipline will become unnecessary  nay if they are of a rank in life to render such a step probable returned the cornet i am well content that the matter should be thus settled i trust however that captain borroughcliffe will consider that the th light dragoons has some merit in this affair and that we are far short of our numbers in the second squadron  we shall not be difficult at a compromise returned the captain there is one apiece for us and a toss of a guinea shall determine who has the third man sergeant follow to deliver over your prisoners and relieve your sentry  as they proceeded in compliance with this arrangement to the building in the rear colonel howard who made one of the party observed  i dispute not the penetration of captain borroughcliffe but i understand mr christopher dillon that there is reason to believe one of these men at least to be of a class altogether above that of a common soldier in which case your plans may fall to the ground  and who does he deem the gentleman to be asked borroughcliffea bourbon in disguise or a secret representative of the rebel congress  nay nay he said nothing more my kinsman kit keeps a close mouth whenever dame justice is about to balance her scales there are men who may be said to have been born to be soldiers of which number i should call the earl cornwallis who makes such head against the rebels in the two carolinas others seem to be intended by nature for divines and saints on earth such as their graces of york and canterbury while another class appears as if it were impossible for them to behold things unless with discriminating impartial and disinterested eyes to which i should say belong my lord chief justice mansfield and my kinsman mr christopher dillon i trust gentlemen that when the royal arms have crushed this rebellion his majestys ministers will see the propriety of extending the dignity of the peerage to the colonies as a means of reward to the loyal and a measure of policy to prevent further disaffection in which case i hope to see my kinsman decorated with the ermine of justice bordering the mantle of a peer  your expectations my excellent sir are right reasonable as i doubt not your kinsman will become at some future day that which he is not at present unhappily for his deserts right honorable said borroughcliffe but be of good heart sir from what i have seen of his merits i doubt not that the law will yet have its revenge in due season and that we shall be properly edified and instructed how to attain elevation in life by the future exaltation of mr christopher dillon though by what title he is to be then known i am at a loss to say  colonel howard was too much occupied with his own exparte views of the war and things in general to observe the shrewd looks that were exchanged between the soldiers but he answered with perfect simplicity  i have reflected much on that point and have come to the opinion that as he has a small estate on that river he should cause his first barony to be known by the title of pedee  barony echoed borroughcliffe i trust the new nobles of a new world will disdain the old wornout distinctions of a hackneyed universe eschew all baronies mine host and cast earldoms and dukedoms to the shades the immortal locke has unlocked his fertile mind to furnish you with appellations suited to the originality of your condition and the nature of your country ah here comes the cacique of pedee in his proper person  as borroughcliffe spoke they were ascending the flight of stone steps which led to the upper apartments where the prisoners were still supposed to be confined and at the same moment the sullen gloomy features of dillon were seen as he advanced along the lower passage with an expression of malicious exultation hovering above his dark brow that denoted his secret satisfaction as the hours passed away the period had come round when the man who had been present at the escape of griffith and his friends was again posted to perform the duty of sentinel as this soldier well knew the situation of his trust he was very coolly adjusted with his back against the wall endeavoring to compensate himself for his disturbed slumbers during the night when the sounds of the approaching footsteps warned him to assume the appearance of watchfulness  how now fellow cried borroughcliffe what have you to say to your charge  i believe the men sleep your honor for i have heard no noises from the rooms since i relieved the last sentinel  the lads are weary and are right to catch what sleep they can in their comfortable quarters returned the captain stand to your arms sirrah and throw back your shoulders and do not move like a crab or a trainband corporal do you not see an officer of horse coming up would you disgrace your regiment  ah your honor heaven only knows whether i shall ever get my shoulders even again  buy another plaster said borroughcliffe slipping a shilling into his hand observe you know nothing but your duty  which is your honor  to mind me and be silent but here comes the sergeant with his guard he will relieve you  the rest of the party stopped at the other end of the gallery to allow the few files of soldiers who were led by the orderly to pass them when they all moved towards the prison in a body the sentinel was relieved in due military style when dillon placed his hand on one of the doors and said with a malicious sneer  open here first mr sergeant this cage holds the man we most want  softly softly my lord chief justice and most puissant cacique said the captain the hour has not yet come to empanel a jury of fat yeomen and no man must interfere with my boys but myself  the rebuke is harsh i must observe captain borroughcliffe said the colonel but i pardon it because it is military no no kit these nice points must be left to martial usages be not impatient my cousin i doubt not the hour will come when you shall hold the scales of justice and satisfy your loyal longings on many a traitor zounds i could almost turn executioner myself in such a cause  i can curb my impatience sir returned dillon with hypocritical meekness and great selfcommand though his eyes were gleaming with savage exultation i beg pardon of captain borroughcliffe if in my desire to render the civil authority superior to the military i have trespassed on your customs  you see borroughcliffe exclaimed the colonel exultingly the lad is ruled by an instinct in all matters of law and justice i hold it to be impossible that a man thus endowed can ever become a disloyal subject but our breakfast waits and mr fitzgerald has breathed his horse this cool morning let us proceed at once to the examination  borroughcliffe motioned to the sergeant to open the door when the whole party entered the vacant room  your prisoner has escaped cried the cornet after a single moment employed in making sure of the fact  never it must not shall not be cried dillon quivering with rage as he glanced his eyes furiously around the apartment here has been treachery and foul treason to the king  by whom committed mr christopher dillon said borroughcliffe knitting his brow and speaking in a suppressed tone dare you or any man living charge treason to the th  a very different feeling from rage appeared now to increase the shivering propensities of the future judge who at once perceived it was necessary to moderate his passion and he returned as it were by magic to his former plausible and insinuating manner as he replied  colonel howard will understand the cause of my warm feelings when i tell him that this very room contained last night that disgrace to his name and country as well as traitor to his king edward griffith of the rebel navy  what exclaimed the colonel starting has that recreant youth dared to pollute the threshold of st ruth with his footstep but you dream kit there would be too much hardihood in the act  it appears not sir returned the other for though in this very apartment he most certainly was he is here no longer and yet from this window though open escape would seem to be impossible even with much assistance  if i thought that the contumelious boy had dared to be guilty of such an act of gross impudence cried the colonel i should be tempted to resume my arms in my old age to punish his effrontery what is it not enough that he entered my dwelling in the colony availing himself of the distraction of the times with an intent to rob me of my choicest jewelay gentlemen even of my brother harrys daughterbut that he must also invade this hallowed island with a like purpose thus thrusting his treason as it were into the presence of his abused prince no no kit thy loyalty misleads thee he has never dared to do the deed  listen sir and you shall be convinced returned the pliant christopher i do not wonder at your unbelief but as a good testimony is the soul of justice i cannot resist its influence you know that two vessels corresponding in appearance to the two rebel cruisers that annoyed us so much in the carolinas have been seen on the coast for several days which induced us to beg the protection of captain borroughcliffe three men are found the day succeeding that on which we hear that these vessels came within the shoals stealing through the grounds of st ruth in sailors attire they are arrested and in the voice of one of them sir i immediately detected that of the traitor griffith he was disguised it is true and cunningly so but when a man has devoted his whole life to the business of investigating truth he added with an air of much modesty it is difficult to palm any disguise on his senses  colonel howard was strongly impressed with the probability of these conjectures and the closing appeal confirmed him immediately in his kinsmans opinion while borroughcliffe listened with deep interest to the speakers and more than once bit his lip with vexation when dillon concluded the soldier exclaimed  ill swear there was a man among them who has been used to the drill  nothing more probable my worthy friend said dillon for as the landing was never made without some evil purpose rely on it he came not unguarded or unprotected i dare say the three were all officers and one of them might have been of the marines that they had assistance is certain and it was because i felt assured they had a force secreted at hand that i went in quest of the reinforcement  there was so much plausibility and in fact so much truth in all this that conviction was unwillingly admitted by borroughcliffe who walked aside a moment to conceal the confusion which in spite of his ordinary inflexibility of countenance he felt was manifesting itself in his rubric visage while he muttered  the amphibious dog he was a soldier but a traitor and an enemy no doubt he will have a marvelous satisfaction in delighting the rebellious ears of his messmates by rehearsing the manner in which he poured cold water down the back of one borroughcliffe of the th who was amusing him at the same time by pouring good rich southside madeira down his own rebellious throat i have a good mind to exchange my scarlet coat for a blue jacket on purpose to meet the sly rascal on the other element where we can discuss the matter over again well sergeant do you find the other two  they are gone together your honor returned the orderly who just then reentered from an examination of the other apartments and unless the evil one helped them off its a mysterious business to me  colonel howard said borroughcliffe gravely your precious south side cordial must be banished from the board regularly with the cloth until i have my revenge for satisfaction of this insult is mine to claim and i seek it this instant go drill detail a guard for the protection of the house and feed the rest of your command then beat the general and we will take the field ay my worthy veteran host for the first time since the days of the unlucky charles stuart there shall be a campaign in the heart of england  ah rebellion rebellion accursed unnatural unholy rebellion caused the calamity then and now exclaimed the colonel  had i not better take a hasty refreshment for my men and their horses asked the cornet and then make a sweep for a few miles along the coast it may be my luck to encounter the fugitives or some part of their force  you have anticipated my very thoughts returned borroughcliffe the cacique of pedee may close the gates of st ruth and by barring the windows and arming the servants he can make a very good defence against an attack should they think proper to assail our fortress after he has repulsed them leave it to me to cut off their retreat  dillon but little relished this proposal for he thought an attempt to storm the abbey would be the most probable course adopted by griffith in order to rescue his mistress and the jurist had none of the spirit of a soldier in his composition in truth it was this deficiency that had induced him to depart in person the preceding night in quest of the reinforcement instead of sending an express on the errand but the necessity of devising an excuse for a change in this dangerous arrangement was obviated by colonel howard who exclaimed as soon as borroughcliffe concluded his plan  to me captain borroughcliffe belongs of right the duty of defending st ruth and it shall be no boys play to force my works but kit would rather try his chance in the open field i know come let us to our breakfast and then he shall mount and act as a guide to the horse along the difficult passes of the seashore  to breakfast then let it be cried the captain i distrust not my new commander of the fortress and in the field the cacique forever we follow you my worthy host  this arrangement was hastily executed in all its parts the gentlemen swallowed their meal in the manner of men who ate only to sustain nature and as a duty after which the whole house became a scene of bustling activity the troops were mustered and paraded borroughcliffe setting apart a guard for the building placed himself at the head of the remainder of his little party and they moved out of the courtyard in open order and at quick time dillon joyfully beheld himself mounted on one of the best of colonel howards hunters where he knew that he had the control in a great measure of his own destiny his bosom throbbing with a powerful desire to destroy griffith while he entertained a lively wish to effect his object without incurring any personal risk at his side was the young cornet seated with practised grace in his saddle who after giving time for the party of foot soldiers to clear the premises glanced his eye along the few files he led and then gave the word to move the little division of horse wheeled briskly into open column and the officer touching his cap to colonel howard they dashed through the gateway together and pursued their route towards the seaside at a handgallop  the veteran lingered a few minutes while the clattering of hoofs was to be heard or the gleam of arms was visible to hear and gaze at sounds and sights that he still loved after which he proceeded in person and not without a secret enjoyment of the excitement to barricade the doors and windows with an undaunted determination of making in case of need a stout defence  st ruth lay but a short two miles from the ocean to which numerous roads led through the grounds of the abbey which extended to the shore along one of these paths dillon conducted his party until after a few minutes of hard riding they approached the cliffs when posting his troopers under cover of a little copse the cornet rode in advance with his guide to the verge of the perpendicular rocks whose bases were washed by the foam that still whitened the waters from the surges of the subsiding sea  the gale had broken before the escape of the prisoners and as the power of the eastern tempest had gradually diminished a light current from the south that blew directly along the land prevailed and though the ocean still rolled in fearful billows their surfaces were smooth and they were becoming at each moment less precipitous and more regular the eyes of the horsemen were cast in vain over the immense expanse of water that was glistening brightly under the rays of the sun which had just risen from its bosom in quest of some object or distant sail that might confirm their suspicions or relieve their doubts but everything of that description appeared to have avoided the dangerous navigation during the violence of the late tempest and dillon was withdrawing his eyes in disappointment from the vacant view when as they fell towards the shore he beheld that which caused him to exclaim  there they go and by heaven they will escape  the cornet looked in the direction of the others finger when he beheld at a short distance from the land and apparently immediately under his feet a little boat that looked like a dark shell upon the water rising and sinking amid the waves as if the men it obviously contained were resting on their oars in idle expectation  tis they continued dillon or what is more probable it is their boat waiting to convey them to their vessel no common business would induce seamen to lie in this careless manner within such a narrow distance of the surf  and what is to be done they cannot be made to feel horse where they are nor would the muskets of the foot be of any use a light three pounder would do its work handsomely on them  the strong desire which dillon entertained to intercept or rather to destroy the party rendered him prompt at expedients after a moment of musing he replied  the runaways must yet be on the land and by scouring the coast and posting men at proper intervals their retreat can easily be prevented in the mean time i will ride under the spur tobay where one of his majestys cutters now lies at anchor it is but half an hour of hard riding and i can be on board of her the wind blows directly in her favor and if we can once bring her down behind that headland we shall infallibly cut off or sink these midnight depredators  off then cried the cornet whose young blood was boiling for a skirmish you will at least drive them to the shore where i can deal with them  the words were hardly uttered before dillon after galloping furiously along the cliffs and turning short into a thick wood that lay in his route was out of sight the loyalty of this gentleman was altogether of a calculating nature and was intimately connected with what he considered his fealty to himself he believed that the possession of miss howards person and fortune were advantages that would much more than counterbalance any elevation that he was likely to obtain by the revolution of affairs in his native colony he considered griffith as the only natural obstacle to his success and he urged his horse forward with a desperate determination to work the ruin of the young sailor before another sun had set when a man labors in an evil cause with such feelings and with such incentives he seldom slights or neglects his work and mr dillon accordingly was on board the alacrity several minutes short of the time in which he had promised to perform the distance  the plain old seaman who commanded the cutter listened to his tale with cautious ears and examined into the state of the weather and other matters connected with his duty with the slow and deliberate decision of one who had never done much to acquire a confidence in himself and who had been but niggardly rewarded for the little he had actually performed  as dillon was urgent however and the day seemed propitious he at length decided to act as he was desired and the cutter was accordingly gotten under way  a crew of something less than fifty men moved with no little of their commanders deliberation but as the little vessel rounded the point behind which she had been anchored her guns were cleared and the usual preparations were completed for immediate and actual service  dillon sorely against his will was compelled to continue on board in order to point out the place where the suspecting boatmen were expected to be entrapped everything being ready when they had gained a safe distance from the land the alacrity was kept away before the wind and glided along the shore with a swift and easy progress that promised a speedy execution of the business in which her commander had embarked     chapter xvii    pol very like a whale    shakespeare   notwithstanding the object of their expedition was of a public nature the feelings which had induced both griffith and barnstable to accompany the pilot with so much willingness it will easily be seen were entirely personal the short intercourse that he had maintained with his associates enabled the mysterious leader of their party to understand the characters of his two principal officers so thoroughly as to induce him when he landed with the purpose of reconnoitering to ascertain whether the objects of his pursuit still held their determination to assemble at the appointed hour to choose griffith and manual as his only associates leaving barnstable in command of his own vessel to await their return and to cover their retreat a good deal of argument and some little of the authority of his superior officer was necessary to make barnstable quietly acquiesce in this arrangement but as his good sense told him that nothing should be unnecessarily hazarded until the moment to strike the final blow had arrived he became gradually more resigned taking care however to caution griffith to reconnoiter the abbey while his companion was reconnoitering  house it was the strong desire of griffith to comply with this injunction which carried them a little out of their proper path and led to the consequences that we have partly related the evening of that day was the time when the pilot intended to complete his enterprise thinking to entrap his game while enjoying the festivities that usually succeed their sports and an early hour in the morning was appointed when barnstable should appear at the nearest point to the abbey to take off his countrymen in order that they might be as little as possible subjected to the gaze of their enemies by daylight if they failed to arrive at the appointed time his instructions were to return to his schooner which lay snugly embayed in a secret and retired haven that but few ever approached either by land or water  while the young cornet still continued gazing at the whaleboat for it was the party from the schooner that he saw the hour expired for the appearance of griffith and his companions and barnstable reluctantly determined to comply with the letter of his instructions and leave them to their own sagacity and skill to regain the ariel the boat had been suffered to ride in the edge of the surf since the appearance of the sun and the eyes of her crew were kept anxiously fixed on the cliffs though in vain to discover the signal that was to call them to the place of landing after looking at his watch for the twentieth time and as often casting glances of uneasy dissatisfaction towards the shore the lieutenant exclaimed  a charming prospect this master coffin but rather too much poetry in it for your taste i believe you relish no land that is of a harder consistency than mud  i was born on the waters sir returned the cockswain from his snug abode where he was bestowed with his usual economy of room and its according to all things for a man to love his native soil ill not deny captain barnstable but i would rather drop my anchor on a bottom that wont broom a keel though at the same time i harbor no great malice against dry land  i shall never forgive it myself if any accident has befallen griffith in this excursion rejoined the lieutenant his pilot may be a better man on the water than on terra firma long tom  the cockswain turned his solemn visage with an extraordinary meaning towards his commander before he replied  for as long a time as i have followed the waters sir and that has been ever since ive drawn my rations seeing that i was born while the boat was crossing nantucket shoals ive never known a pilot come off in greater need than the one we fell in with when we made that stretch of two on the land in the dogwatch of yesterday  ay the fellow has played his part like a man the occasion was great and it seems that he was quite equal to his work  the frigates people tell me sir that he handled the ship like a top continued the cockswain but she is a ship that is a nateral inimy of the bottom  can you say as much for this boat master coffin cried barnstable keep her out of the surf or youll have us rolling in upon the beach presently like an empty watercask you must remember that we cannot all wade like yourself in twofathom water  the cockswain cast a cool glance at the crests of foam that were breaking over the tops of the billows within a few yards of where their boat was riding and called aloud to his men  pull a stroke or two away with her into dark water  the drop of the oars resembled the movements of a nice machine and the light boat skimmed along the water like a duck that approaches to the very brink of some imminent danger and then avoids it at the most critical moment apparently without an effort while this necessary movement was making barnstable arose and surveyed the cliffs with keen eyes and then turning once more in disappointment from his search he said  pull more from the land and let her run down at an easy stroke to the schooner keep a lookout at the cliffs boys it is possible that they are stowed in some of the holes in the rocks for its no daylight business they are on  the order was promptly obeyed and they had glided along for nearly a mile in this manner in the most profound silence when suddenly the stillness was broken by a heavy rush of air and a dash of the water seemingly at no great distance from them  by heaven tom cried barnstable starting there is the blow of a whale  ay ay sir returned the cockswain with undisturbed composure here is his spout not half a mile to seaward the easterly gale has driven the creatur to leeward and he begins to find himself in shoal water hes been sleeping while he should have been working to windward  the fellow takes it coolly too hes in no hurry to get an offing  i rather conclude sir said the cockswain rolling over his tobacco in his mouth very composedly while his little sunken eyes began to twinkle with pleasure at the sight the gentleman has lost his reckoning and dont know which way to head to take himself back into blue water  tis a finback exclaimed the lieutenant he will soon make headway and be off  no sir tis a rightwhale answered tom i saw his spout he threw up a pair of as pretty rainbows as a christian would wish to look at hes a raal oilbutt that fellow  barnstable laughed turned himself away from the tempting sight and tried to look at the cliffs and then unconsciously bent his longing eyes again on the sluggish animal who was throwing his huge carcass at times for many feet from the water in idle gambols the temptation for sport and the recollection of his early habits at length prevailed over his anxiety in behalf of his friends and the young officer inquired of his cockswain  is there any whaleline in the boat to make fast to that harpoon which you bear about with you in fair weather or foul  i never trust the boat from the schooner without part of a shot sir returned the cockswain there if something nateral in the sight of a tub to my old eyes  barnstable looked at his watch and again at the cliffs when he exclaimed in joyous tones  give strong way my hearties there seems nothing better to be done let us have a stroke of a harpoon at that impudent rascal  the men shouted spontaneously and the old cockswain suffered his solemn visage to relax into a small laugh while the whaleboat sprang forward like a courser for the goal during the few minutes they were pulling towards their game long tom arose from his crouching attitude in the sternsheets and transferred his huge form to the bows of the boat where he made such preparations to strike the whale as the occasion required the tub containing about half of a whaleline was placed at the feet of barnstabie who had been preparing an oar to steer with in place of the rudder which was unshipped in order that if necessary the boat might be whirled round when not advancing  their approach was utterly unnoticed by the monster of the deep who continued to amuse himself with throwing the water in two circular spouts high into the air occasionally flourishing the broad flukes of his tail with a graceful but terrific force until the hardy seamen were within a few hundred feet of him when he suddenly cast his head downward and without an apparent effort reared his immense body for many feet above the water waving his tail violently and producing a whizzing noise that sounded like the rushing of winds  the cockswain stood erect poising his harpoon ready for the blow but when he beheld the creature assume this formidable attitude he waved his hand to his commander who instantly signed to his men to cease rowing in this situation the sportsmen rested a few moments while the whale struck several blows on the water in rapid succession the noise of which reechoed along the cliffs like the hollow reports of so many cannon after this wanton exhibition of his terrible strength the monster sank again into his native element and slowly disappeared from the eyes of his pursuers  which way did he head tom cried barnstable the moment the whale was out of sight  pretty much up and down sir returned the cockswain whose eye was gradually brightened with the excitement of the sport hell soon run his nose against the bottom if he stands long on that course and will be glad to get another snuff of pure air send her a few fathoms to starboard sir and i promise we shall not be out of his track  the conjecture of the experienced old seaman proved true for in a few moments the water broke near them and another spout was cast into the air when the huge animal rushed for half his length in the same direction and fell on the sea with a turbulence and foam equal to that which is produced by the launching of a vessel for the first time into its proper element after this evolution the whale rolled heavily and seemed to rest for further efforts  his slightest movements were closely watched by barnstable and his cockswain and when he was in a state of comparative rest the former gave a signal to his crew to ply their oars once more a few long and vigorous strokes sent the boat directly up to the broadside of the whale with its bows pointing towards one of the fins which was at times as the animal yielded sluggishly to the action of the waves exposed to view the cockswain poised his harpoon with much precision and then darted it from him with a violence that buried the iron in the blubber of their foe the instant the blow was made long tom shouted with singular earnestness  starn all  stern all echoed barnstable when the obedient seamen by united efforts forced the boat in a backward direction beyond the reach of any blow from their formidable antagonist the alarmed animal however meditated no such resistance ignorant of his own power and of the insignificance of his enemies he sought refuge in flight one moment of stupid surprise succeeded the entrance of the iron when he cast his huge tail into the air with a violence that threw the sea around him into increased commotion and then disappeared with the quickness of lightning amid a cloud of foam  snub him shouted barnstable hold on tom he rises already  ay ay sir replied the composed cockswain seizing the line which was running out of the boat with a velocity that rendered such a manoeuvre rather hazardous and causing it to yield more gradually round the large loggerhead that was placed in the bows of the boat for that purpose presently the line stretched forward and rising to the surface with tremulous vibrations it indicated the direction in which the animal might be expected to reappear barnstable had cast the bows of the boat towards that point before the terrified and wounded victim rose once more to the surface whose time was however no longer wasted in his sports but who cast the waters aside as he forced his way with prodigious velocity along the surface the boat was dragged violently in his wake and cut through the billows with a terrific rapidity that at moments appeared to bury the slight fabric in the ocean when long tom beheld his victim throwing his spouts on high again he pointed with exultation to the jetting fluid which was streaked with the deep red of blood and cried  ay ive touched the fellows life it must be more than two foot of blubber that stops my iron from reaching the life of any whale that ever sculled the ocean  i believe you have saved yourself the trouble of using the bayonet you have rigged for a lance said his commander who entered into the sport with all the ardor of one whose youth had been chiefly passed in such pursuits feel your line master coffin can we haul alongside of our enemy i like not the course he is steering as he tows us from the schooner  tis the creaturs way sir said the cockswain you know they need the air in their nostrils when they run the same as a man but lay hold boys and lets haul up to him  the seamen now seized the whaleline and slowly drew their boat to within a few feet of the tail of the fish whose progress became sensibly less rapid as he grew weak with the loss of blood in a few minutes he stopped running and appeared to roll uneasily on the water as if suffering the agony of death  shall we pull in and finish him tom cried barnstable a few sets from your bayonet would do it  the cockswain stood examining his game with cool discretion and replied to this interrogatory  no sir nohes going into his flurry theres no occasion for disgracing ourselves by using a soldiers weapon in taking a whale starn off sir starn off the creaters in his flurry  the warning of the prudent cockswain was promptly obeyed and the boat cautiously drew off to a distance leaving to the animal a clear space while under its dying agonies from a state of perfect rest the terrible monster threw its tail on high as when in sport but its blows were trebled in rapidity and violence till all was hid from view by a pyramid of foam that was deeply dyed with blood the roarings of the fish were like the bellowing of a herd of bulls and to one who was ignorant of the fact it would have appeared as if a thousand monsters were engaged in deadly combat behind the bloody mist that obscured the view gradually these effects subsided and when the discolored water again settled down to the long and regular swell of the ocean the fish was seen exhausted and yielding passively to its fate as life departed the enormous black mass rolled to one side and when the white and glistening skin of the belly became apparent the seamen well knew that their victory was achieved  whats to be done now said barnstable as he stood and gazed with a diminished excitement at their victim he will yield no food and his carcass will probably drift to land and furnish our enemies with the oil  if i had but that creatur in boston bay said the cockswain it would prove the making of me but such is my luck forever pull up at any rate and let me get my harpoon and linethe english shall never get them while old tom coffin can blow  dont speak too fast said the strokesman of the boat whether he get your iron or not here he comes in chase  what mean you fellow cried barnstable  captain barnstable can look for himself returned the seaman and tell whether i speak truth  the young sailor turned and saw the alacrity bearing down before the wind with all her sails set as she rounded a headland but a short halfleague to windward of the place where the boat lay  pass that glass to me said the captain with steady composure this promises us work in one of two ways if she be armed it has become our turn to run if not we are strong enough to carry her  a very brief survey made the experienced officer acquainted with the true character of the vessel in sight and replacing the glass with much coolness he said  that fellow shows long arms and ten teeth besides king georges pennant from his topmasthead now my lads you are to pull for your lives for whatever may be the notions of master coffin on the subject of his harpoon i have no inclination to have my arms pinioned by john bull though his majesty himself put on the irons  the men well understood the manner and meaning of their commander and throwing aside their coats they applied themselves in earnest to their task for half an hour a profound silence reigned in the boat which made an amazing progress but many circumstances conspired to aid the cutter she had a fine breeze with smooth water and a strong tide in her favor and at the expiration of the time we have mentioned it was but too apparent that the distance between the pursued and the pursuers was lessened nearly by half barnstable preserved his steady countenance but there was an expression of care gathering around his dark brow which indicated that he saw the increasing danger of their situation  that fellow has long legs master coffin he said in a cheerful tone your whaleline must go overboard and the fifth oar must be handled by your delicate hands  tom arose from his seat and proceeding forward he cast the tub and its contents together into the sea when he seated himself at the bow oar and bent his athletic frame with amazing vigor to the task  ah there is much of your philosophy in that stroke long tom cried his commander keep it up boys and if we gain nothing else we shall at least gain time for deliberation come master coffin what think you we have three resources before us let us hear which is jour choice first we can turn and fight and be sunk secondly we can pull to the land and endeavor to make good our retreat to the schooner in that manner and thirdly we can head to the shore and possibly by running under the guns of that fellow get the wind of him and keep the air in our nostrils after the manner of the whale damn the whale but for the tow the black rascal gave us we should have been out of sight of this rover  if we fight said tom with quite as much composure as his commander manifested we shall be taken or sunk if we land sir i shall be taken for one man as i never could make any headway on dry ground and if we try to get the wind of him by pulling under the cliffs we shall be cut off by a parcel of lubbers that i can see running along their edges hoping i dare say that they shall be able to get a skulking shot at a boats crew of honest seafaring men  you speak with as much truth as philosophy tom said barnstable who saw his slender hopes of success curtailed by the open appearance of the horse and foot on the cliffs these englishmen have not slept the last night and i fear griffith and manual will fare but badly that fellow brings a capful of wind down with himtis just his play and he walks like a racehorse ha he begins to be in earnest  while barnstable was speaking a column of white smoke was seen issuing from the bows of the cutter and as the report of a cannon was wafted to their ears the shot was seen skipping from wave to wave tossing the water in spray and flying to a considerable distance beyond them the seamen cast cursory glances in the direction of the passing ball but it produced no manifest effect in either their conduct or appearance the cockswain who scanned its range with an eye of more practice than the rest observed thats a lively piece for its metal and it speaks with a good clear voice but if they hear it aboard the ariel the man who fired it will be sorry it wasnt born dumb  you are the prince of philosophers master coffin cried barnstable there is some hope in that let the englishmen talk away and my life on it the ariels dont believe it is thunder hand me a musketill draw another shot  the piece was given to barnstable who discharged it several times as if to taunt their enemies and the scheme was completely successful goaded by the insults the cutter discharged gun after gun at the little boat throwing the shot frequently so near as to wet her crew with the spray but without injuring them in the least the failure of these attempts of the enemy excited the mirth of the reckless seamen instead of creating any alarm and whenever a shot came nearer than common the cockswain would utter some such expression as  a ground swell a long shot and a small object make a clean target or a man must squint straight to hit a boat  as notwithstanding their unsuccessful gunnery the cutter was constantly gaining on the whaleboat there was a prospect of a speedy termination of the chase when the report of a cannon was thrown back like an echo from one of the englishmans discharges and barnstable and his companions had the pleasure of seeing the ariel stretching slowly out of the little bay where she had passed the night with the smoke of the gun of defiance curling above her taper masts  a loud and simultaneous shout of rapture was given by the lieutenant and all his boats crew at this cheering sight while the cutter took in all her light sails and as she hauled up on a wind she fired a whole broadside at the successful fugitives many stands of grape with several round shot flew by the boat and fell upon the water near them raising a cloud of foam but without doing any injury  she dies in a flurry said tom casting his eyes at the little vortex into which the boat was then entering  if her commander be a true man cried barnstable hell not leave us on so short an acquaintance give way my souls give way i would see more of this loquacious cruiser  the temptation for exertion was great and it was not disregarded by the men in a few minutes the whaleboat reached the schooner when the crew of the latter received their commander and his companions with shouts and cheers that rang across the waters and reached the ears of the disappointed spectators on the verge of the cliffs     chapter xviii    thus guided on their course they bore   until they neard the mainland shore   when frequent on the hollow blast   wild shouts of merriment were cast   lord of the isles   the joyful shouts and hearty cheers of the ariels crew continued for some time after her commander had reached her deck barnstable answered the congratulations of his officers by cordial shakes of the hand and after waiting for the ebullition of delight among the seamen to subside a little he beckoned with an air of authority for silence  i thank you my lads for your goodwill he said when all were gathered around him in deep attention they have given us a tough chase and if you had left us another mile to go we had been lost that fellow is a kings cutter and though his disposition to run to leeward is a good deal mollified yet he shows signs of fight at any rate he is stripping off some of his clothes which looks as if he were game luckily for us captain manual has taken all the marines ashore with him though what he has done with them or himself is a mystery or we should have had our decks lumbered with live cattle but as it is we have a good working breeze tolerably smooth water and a dead match there is a sort of national obligation on us to whip that fellow and therefore without more words about the matter let us turn to and do it that we may get our breakfasts  to this specimen of marine eloquence the crew cheered as usual the young men burning for the combat and the few old sailors who belonged to the schooner shaking their heads with infinite satisfaction and swearing by sundry strange oaths that their captain could talk when there was need of such thing like the best dictionary that ever was launched  during this short harangue and the subsequent comments the ariel had been kept under a cloud of canvas as near to the wind as she could lie and as this was her best sailing she had stretched swiftly out from the land to a distance whence the cliffs and the soldiers who were spread along their summits became plainly visible barnstable turned his glass repeatedly from the cutter to the shore as different feelings predominated in his breast before he again spoke  if mr griffith is stowed away among those rocks he at length said he shall see as pretty an argument discussed in as few words as he ever listened to provided the gentlemen in yonder cutter have not changed their minds as to the road they intend to journeywhat think you mr merry  i wish with all my heart and soul sir returned the fearless boy that mr griffith was safe aboard us it seems the country is alarmed and god knows what will happen if he is taken as to the fellow to windward hell find it easier to deal with the ariels boat than with her mother but he carries a broad sail i question if he means to show play  never doubt him boy said barnstable he is working off the shore like a man of sense and besides he has his spectacles on trying to make out what tribe of yankee indians we belong to youll see him come to the wind presently and send a few pieces of iron down this way by way of letting us know where to find him much as i like your first lieutenant mr merry i would rather leave him on the land this day than see him on my decks i want no fighting captain to work this boat for me but tell the drummer sir to beat to quarters  the boy who was staggering under the weight of his melodious instrument had been expecting this command and without waiting for the midshipman to communicate the order he commenced that short ruba dub air that will at any time rouse a thousand men from the deepest sleep and cause them to fly to their means of offence with a common soul the crew of the ariel had been collected in groups studying the appearance of the enemy cracking their jokes and waiting only for this usual order to repair to the guns and at the first tap of the drum they spread with steadiness to the different parts of the little vessel where their various duties called them the cannon were surrounded by small parties of vigorous and athletic young men the few marines were drawn up in array with muskets the officers appeared in their boarding caps with pistols stuck in their belts and naked sabres in their hands barnstable paced his little quarterdeck with a firm tread dangling a speakingtrumpet by its lanyard on his forefinger or occasionally applying the glass to his eye which when not in use was placed under one arm while his sword was resting against the foot of the mainmast a pair of heavy ships pistols were thrust into his belt also and piles of muskets boardingpikes and naked sabres were placed on different parts of the deck the laugh of the seamen was heard no longer and those who spoke uttered their thoughts only in low and indistinct whispers  the english cutter held her way from the land until she got an offing of more than two miles when she reduced her sails to a yet smaller number and heaving into the wind she fired a gun in a direction opposite to that which pointed to the ariel  now i would wager a quintal of codfish master coffin said barnstable against the best cask of porter that was ever brewed in england that fellow believes a yankee schooner can fly in the winds eye if he wishes to speak to us why dont he give his cutter a little sheet and come down  the cockswain had made his arrangements for the combat with much more method and philosophy than any other man in the vessel when the drum beat to quarters he threw aside his jacket vest and shirt with as little hesitation as if he stood under an american sun and with all the discretion of a man who had engaged in an undertaking that required the free use of his utmost powers as he was known to be a privileged individual in the ariel and one whose opinions in all matters of seamanship were regarded as oracles by the crew and were listened to by his commander with no little demonstration of respect the question excited no surprise he was standing at the breech of his long gun with his brawny arms folded on a breast that had been turned to the color of blood by long exposure his grizzled locks fluttering in the breeze and his tall form towering far above the heads of all near him  he hugs the wind sir as if it was his sweetheart was his answer but hell let go his hold soon and if he dont we can find a way to make him fall to leeward  keep a good full cried the commander in a stern voice and let the vessel go through the water that fellow walks well long tom but we are too much for him on a bowline though if he continue to draw ahead in this manner it will be night before we can get alongside him  ay ay sir returned the cockswain them cutters carries a press of canvas when they seem to have but little their gafts are all the same as young booms and spread a broad head to their mainsails but its no hard matter to knock a few cloths out of their boltropes when she will both drop astarn and to leeward  i believe there is good sense in your scheme this time said barnstable for i am anxious about the frigates peoplethough i hate a noisy chase speak to him tom and let us see if he will answer  ay ay sir cried the cockswain sinking his body in such a manner as to let his head fall to a level with the cannon that he controlled when after divers orders and sundry movements to govern the direction of the piece he applied a match with a rapid motion to the priming an immense body of white smoke rushed from the muzzle of the cannon followed by a sheet of vivid fire until losing its power it yielded to the wind and as it rose from the water spread like a cloud and passing through the masts of the schooner was driven far to leeward and soon blended in the mists which were swiftly scudding before the fresh breezes of the ocean  although many curious eyes were watching this beautiful sight from the cliffs there was too little of novelty in the exhibition to attract a single look of the crew of the schooner from the more important examination of the effect of the shot on their enemy barnstable sprang lightly on a gun and watched the instant when the ball would strike with keen interest while long tom threw himself aside from the line of the smoke with a similar intention holding one of his long arms extended toward his namesake with a finger on the vent and supporting his frame by placing the hand of the other on the deck as his eyes glanced through an opposite porthole in an attitude that most men might have despaired of imitating with success  there go the chips cried barnstable bravo master coffin you never planted iron in the ribs of an english man with more judgment let him have another piece of it and if he like the sport well play a game of long bowls with him  ay ay sir returned the cockswain who the instant he witnessed the effects of his shot had returned to superintend the reloading of his gun if he holds on half an hour longer ill dub him down to our own size when we can close and make an even fight of it  the drum of the englishman was now for the first time heard rattling across the waters and echoing the call to quarters that had already proceeded from the ariel  ay you have sent him to his guns said barnstable we shall now hear more of it wake him up tomwake him up  we shall start him on end or put him to sleep altogether shortly said the deliberate cockswain who never allowed himself to be at all hurried even by his commander my shot are pretty much like a shoal of porpoises and commonly sail in each others wake stand byheave her breech forwardso get out of that you damned young reprobate and let my harpoon alone  what are you at there master coffin cried barnstable are you tonguetied  heres one of the boys skylarking with my harpoon in the leescuppers and by and by when i shall want it most therell be a nomans land to hunt for it in  never mind the boy tom send him aft here to me and ill polish his behavior give the englishman some more iron  i want the little villain to pass up my cartridges returned the angry old seaman but if youll be so good sir as to hit him a crack or two now and then as he goes by you to the magazine the monkey will learn his manners and the schooners work will be all the better done for it a young herringfaced monkey to meddle with a tool ye dont know the use of if your parents had spent more of their money on your edication and less on your outfit youd ha been a gentleman to what ye are now  hurrah tom hurrah cried barnstable a little impatiently is your namesake never to open his throat again  ay ay sir all ready grumbled the cockswain depress a little so so a damned young baboonbehaved curmudgeon overhaul that forward fall more stand by with your matchbut ill pay himfire this was the actual commencement of the fight for as the shot of tom coffin traveled as he had intimated very much in the same direction their enemy found the sport becoming too hot to be endured in silence and the report of the second gun from the ariel was instantly followed by that of the whole broadside of the alacrity the shot of the cutter flew in a very good direction but her guns were too light to give them efficiency at that distance and as one or two were heard to strike against the bends of the schooner and fall back innocuously into the water the cockswain whose goodhumor became gradually restored as the combat thickened remarked with his customary apathy  them count for no more than lovetapsdoes the englishman think that we are firing salutes  stir him up tom every blow you give him will help to open his eyes cried barnstable rubbing his hands with glee as he witnessed the success of his efforts to close  thus far the cockswain and his crew had the fight on the part of the ariel altogether to themselves the men who were stationed at the smaller and shorter guns standing in perfect idleness by their sides but in ten or fifteen minutes the commander of the alacrity who had been staggered by the weight of the shot that had struck him found that it was no longer in his power to retreat if he wished it when he decided on the only course that was left for a brave man to pursue and steered boldly in such a direction as would soonest bring him in contact with his enemy without exposing his vessel to be raked by his fire barnstable watched each movement of his foe with eagle eyes and when the vessel had got within a lessened distance he gave the order for a general fire to be opened the action now grew warm and spirited on both sides the power of the wind was counteracted by the constant explosion of the cannon and instead of driving rapidly to leeward a white canopy of curling smoke hung above the ariel or rested on the water lingering in her wake so as to mark the path by which she was approaching to a closer and still deadlier struggle the shouts of the young sailors as they handled their instruments of death became more animated and fierce while the cockswain pursued his occupation with the silence and skill of one who labored in a regular vocation barnstable was unusually composed and quiet maintaining the grave deportment of a commander on whom rested the fortunes of the contest at the same time that his dark eyes were dancing with the fire of suppressed animation  give it them he occasionally cried in a voice that might be heard amid the bellowing of the cannon never mind their cordage my lads drive home their bolts and make your marks below their ridgeropes  in the mean time the englishman played a manful game  he had suffered a heavy loss by the distant cannonade which no metal he possessed could retort upon his enemy but he struggled nobly to repair the error in judgment with which he had begun the contest the two vessels gradually drew nigher to each other until they both entered into the common cloud created by their fire which thickened and spread around them in such a manner as to conceal their dark hulls from the gaze of the curious and interested spectators on the cliffs the heavy reports of the cannon were now mingled with the rattling of muskets and pistols and streaks of fire might be seen glancing like flashes of lightning through the white cloud which enshrouded the combatants and many minutes of painful uncertainty followed before the deeply interested soldiers who were gazing at the scene discovered on whose banners victory had alighted  we shall follow the combatants into their misty wreath and display to the reader the events as they occurred  the fire of the ariel was much the most quick and deadly both because she had suffered less and her men were less exhausted and the cutter stood desperately on to decide the combat after grappling hand to hand barnstable anticipated her intention and well understood her commanders reason for adopting this course but he was not a man to calculate coolly his advantages when pride and daring invited him to a more severe trial accordingly he met the enemy halfway and as the vessels rushed together the stern of the schooner was secured to the bows of the cutter by the joint efforts of both parties the voice of the english commander was now plainly to be heard in the uproar calling to his men to follow him  away there boarders repel boarders on the starboard quarter shouted barnstable through his trumpet  this was the last order that the gallant young sailor gave with this instrument for as he spoke he cast it from him and seizing his sabre flew to the spot where the enemy was about to make his most desperate effort the shouts execrations and tauntings of the combatants now succeeded to the roar of the cannon which could be used no longer with effect though the fight was still maintained with spirited discharges of the smallarms  sweep him from his decks cried the english commander as he appeared on his own bulwarks surrounded by a dozen of his bravest men drive the rebellious dogs into the sea  away there marines retorted barnstable firing his pistol at the advancing enemy leave not a man of them to sup his grog again  the tremendous and close volley that succeeded this order nearly accomplished the command of barnstable to the letter and the commander of the alacrity perceiving that he stood alone reluctantly fell back on the deck of his own vessel in order to bring on his men once more  board her graybeards and boys idlers and all shouted barnstable springing in advance of his crewa powerful arm arrested the movement of the dauntless seaman and before he had time to recover himself he was drawn violently back to his own vessel by the irresistible grasp of his cockswain  the fellows in his flurry said tom and it wouldnt be wise to go within reach of his flukes but ill just step ahead and give him a set with my harpoon  without waiting for a reply the cockswain reared his tall frame on the bulwarks and was in the attitude of stepping on board of his enemy when a sea separated the vessels and he fell with a heavy dash of the waters into the ocean as twenty muskets and pistols were discharged at the instant he appeared the crew of the ariel supposed his fall to be occasioned by his wounds and were rendered doubly fierce by the sight and the cry of their commander to  revenge long tom board her long tom or death  they threw themselves forward in irresistible numbers and forced a passage with much bloodshed to the forecastle of the alacrity the englishman was overpowered but still remained undauntedhe rallied his crew and bore up most gallantly to the fray thrusts of pikes and blows of sabres were becoming close and deadly while muskets and pistols were constantly discharged by those who were kept at a distance by the pressure of the throng of closer combatants  barnstable led his men in advance and became a mark of peculiar vengeance to his enemies as they slowly yielded before his vigorous assaults chance had placed the two commanders on opposite sides of the cutters deck and the victory seemed to incline towards either party whenever these daring officers directed the struggle in person but the englishman perceiving that the ground he maintained in person was lost elsewhere made an effort to restore the battle by changing his position followed by one or two of his best men a marine who preceded him leveled his musket within a few feet of the head of the american commander and was about to fire when merry glided among the combatants and passed his dirk into the body of the man who fell at the blow shaking his piece with horrid imprecations the wounded soldier prepared to deal his vengeance on his youthful assailant when the fearless boy leaped within its muzzle and buried his own keen weapon in his heart  hurrah shouted the unconscious barnstable from the edge of the quarterdeck where attended by a few men he was driving all before him revengelong tom and victory  we have them exclaimed the englishman handle your pikes we have them between two fires  the battle would probably have terminated very differently from what previous circumstances had indicated had not a wildlooking figure appeared in the cutters channels at that moment issuing from the sea and gaining the deck at the same instant it was long tom with his iron visage rendered fierce by his previous discomfiture and his grizzled locks drenched with the briny element from which he had risen looking like neptune with his trident without speaking he poised his harpoon and with a powerful effort pinned the unfortunate englishman to the mast of his own vessel  starn all cried tom by a sort of instinct when the blow was struck and catching up the musket of the fallen marine he dealt out terrible and fatal blows with its butt on all who approached him utterly disregarding the use of the bayonet on its muzzle the unfortunate commander of the alacrity brandished his sword with frantic gestures while his eyes rolled in horrid wildness when he writhed for an instant in his passing agonies and then as his head dropped lifeless upon his gored breast he hung against the spar a spectacle of dismay to his crew a few of the englishmen stood chained to the spot in silent horror at the sight but most of them fled to their lower deck or hastened to conceal themselves in the secret parts of the vessel leaving to the americans the undisputed possession of the alacrity  twothirds of the cutters crew suffered either in life or limbs by this short struggle nor was the victory obtained by barnstable without paying the price of several valuable lives the first burst of conquest was not however the moment to appreciate the sacrifice and loud and reiterated shouts proclaimed the exultation of the conquerors as the flush of victory subsided however recollection returned and barnstable issued such orders as humanity and his duty rendered necessary while the vessels were separating and the bodies of the dead and wounded were removing the conqueror paced the deck of his prize as if lost in deep reflection he passed his hand frequently across his blackened and bloodstained brow while his eyes would rise to examine the vast canopy of smoke that was hovering above the vessels like a dense fog exhaling from the ocean the result of his deliberations was soon announced to the crew  haul down all your flags he cried set the englishmans colors again and show the enemys jack above our ensign in the ariel  the appearance of the whole channelfleet within half gunshot would not have occasioned more astonishment among the victors than this extraordinary mandate the wondering seamen suspended their several employments to gaze at the singular change that was making in the flags those symbols that were viewed with a sort of reverence but none presumed to comment openly on the procedure except long tom who stood on the quarterdeck of the prize straightening the pliable iron of the harpoon which be had recovered with as much care and diligence as if it were necessary to the maintenance of their conquest like the others however he suspended his employment when he heard this order and manifested no reluctance to express his dissatisfaction at the measure  if the englishmen grumble at the fight and think it not fair play muttered the old cockswain let us try it over again sir as they are somewhat short of hands they can send a boat to the land and get off a gang of them lazy riptyles the soldiers who stand looking at us like so many red lizards crawling on a beach and well give them another chance but damme if i see the use of whipping them if this is to be the better end of the matter  whats that youre grumbling there like a dead northeaster you horse mackerel said barnstable where are our friends and countrymen who are on the land are we to leave them to swing on gibbets or rot in dungeons  the cockswain listened with great earnestness and when his commander had spoken he struck the palm of his broad hand against his brawny thigh with a report like a pistol and answered  i see how it is sir you reckon the redcoats have mr griffith in tow just run the schooner into shoal water captain barnstable and drop an anchor where we can get the long gun to bear on them and give me the whaleboat and five or six men to back methey must have long legs if they get an offing before i run them aboard  fool do you think a boats crew could contend with fifty armed soldiers  soldiers echoed tom whose spirits had been strongly excited by the conflict snapping his fingers with ineffable disdain that for all the soldiers that were ever rigged one whale could kill a thousand of them and here stands the man that has killed his round hundred of whales  pshaw you grampus do you turn braggart in your old age  its no bragging sir to speak a logbook truth but if captain barnstable thinks that old tom coffin carries a speakingtrumpet for a figurehead let him pass the word forrard to man the boats  no no my old master at the marlinspike said barnstable kindly i know thee too well thou brother of neptune but shall we not throw the breadroom dust in those englishmens eyes by wearing their bunting a while till something may offer to help our captured countrymen  the cockswain shook his head and cogitated a moment as if struck with sundry new ideas when he answered  ay ay sir thats bluewater philosophy as deep as the sea let the riptyles clew up the corners of their mouths to their eyebrows now when they come to hear the raal yankee truth of the matter they will sheet them down to their leather neckcloths  with this reflection the cockswain was much consoled and the business of repairing damages and securing the prize proceeded without further interruption on his part the few prisoners who were unhurt were rapidly transferred to the ariel while barnstable was attending to this duty an unusual bustle drew his eyes to one of the hatchways where he beheld a couple of his marines dragging forward a gentleman whose demeanor and appearance indicated the most abject terror after examining the extraordinary appearance of this individual for a moment in silent amazement the lieutenant exclaimed  who have we here some amateur in fights an inquisitive wonder seeking noncombatant who has volunteered to serve his king and perhaps draw a picture or write a book to serve himself pray sir in what capacity did you serve in this vessel  the captive ventured a sidelong glance at his interrogator in whom he expected to encounter griffith but perceiving that it was a face he did not know he felt a revival of confidence that enabled him to reply  i came here by accident being on board the cutter at the time her late commander determined to engage you it was not in his power to land me as i trust you will not hesitate to do your conjecture of my being a noncombatant  is perfectly true interrupted barnstable it requires no spyglass to read that name written on you from stem to stern but for certain weighty reasons  he paused to turn at a signal given him by young merry who whispered eagerly in his ear  tis mr dillon kinsman of colonel howard ive seen him often sailing in the wake of my cousin cicely  dillon exclaimed barnstable rubbing his hands with pleasure what kit of that name he with the savannah face eyes of black and skin of the same color hes grown a little whiter with fear but hes a prize at this moment worth twenty alacrities  these exclamations were made in a low voice and at some little distance from the prisoner whom he now approached and addressed  policy and consequently duty require that i should detain you for a short time sir but you shall have a sailors welcome to whatever we possess to lessen the weight of captivity  barnstable precluded any reply by bowing to his captive and turning away to superintend the management of his vessels in a short time it was announced that they were ready to make sail when the ariel and her prize were brought close to the wind and commenced beating slowly along the land as if intending to return to the bay whence the latter had sailed that morning as they stretched in to the shore on the first tack the soldiers on the cliffs rent the air with their shouts and acclamations to which barnstable pointing to the assumed symbols that were fluttering in the breeze from his masts directed his crew to respond in the most cordial manner as the distance and the want of boats prevented any further communication the soldiers after gazing at the receding vessels for a time disappeared from the cliffs and were soon lost from the sight of the adventurous mariners hour after hour was consumed in the tedious navigation against an adverse tide and the short day was drawing to a close before they approached the mouth of their destined haven while making one of their numerous stretches to and from the land the cutter in which barnstable continued passed the victim of their mornings sport riding on the water the waves curling over his huge carcass as on some rounded rock and already surrounded by the sharks who were preying on his defenceless body  see master coffin cried the lieutenant pointing out the object to his cockswain as they glided by it the shovelnosed gentlemen are regaling daintily you have neglected the christians duty of burying your dead  the old seaman cast a melancholy look at the dead whale and replied  if i had the creatur in boston bay or on the sandy point of munnymoy twould be the making of me but riches and honor are for the great and the larned and theres nothing left for poor tom coffin to do but to veer and haul on his own rollingtackle that he may ride out on the rest of the gale of life without springing any of his old spars  how now long tom cried his officer these rocks and cliffs will shipwreck you on the shoals of poetry yet you grow sentimental  them rocks might wrack any vessel that struck them said the literal cockswain and as for poetry i wants none better than the good old song of captain kidd but its enough to raise solemn thoughts in a cape poge indian to see an eightybarrel whale devoured by shirkstis an awful waste of property ive seen the death of two hundred of the creaturs though it seems to keep the rations of poor old tom as short as ever  the cockswain walked aft while the vessel was passing the whale and seating himself on the taffrail with his face resting gloomily on his bony hand he fastened his eyes on the object of his solicitude and continued to gaze at it with melancholy regret while it was to be seen glistening in the sunbeams as it rolled its glittering side of white into the air or the rays fell unreflected on the black and rougher coat of the back of the monster in the mean time the navigators diligently pursued their way for the haven we have mentioned into which they steered with every appearance of the fearlessness of friends and the exultation of conquerors  a few eager and gratified spectators lined the edges of the small bay and barnstable concluded his arrangement for deceiving the enemy by admonishing his crew that they were now about to enter on a service that would require their utmost intrepidity and sagacity     chapter xix    our trumpet called you to this gentle parle   king john   as griffith and his companions rushed from the offices of st ruth into the open air they encountered no one to intercept their flight or communicate the alarm warned by the experience of the earlier part of the same night they avoided the points where they knew the sentinels were posted though fully prepared to bear down all resistance and were soon beyond the probability of immediate detection they proceeded for the distance of half a mile with rapid strides and with the stern and sullen silence of men who expected to encounter immediate danger resolved to breast it with desperate resolution but as they plunged into a copse that clustered around the ruin which has been already mentioned they lessened their exertions to a more deliberate pace and a short but guarded dialogue ensued we have had a timely escape said griffith i would much rather have endured captivity than have been the cause of introducing confusion and bloodshed in the peaceful residence of colonel howard  i would sir that you had been of this opinion some hours earlier returned the pilot with a severity in his tones that even conveyed more meaning than his words  i may have forgotten my duty sir in my anxiety to enquire into the condition of a family in whom i feel a particular interest returned griffith in a manner in which pride evidently struggled with respect but this is not a time for regrets i apprehend that we follow you on an errand of some moment where actions would be more acceptable than any words of apology what is your pleasure now  i much fear that our project will be defeated said the pilot gloomily the alarm will spread with the morning fogs and there will be musterings of the yeomen and consultations of the gentry that will drive all thoughts of amusement from their minds the rumor of a descent will at any time force sleep from the shores of this island to at least ten leagues inland  ay you have probably passed some pleasant nights with your eyes open among them yourself master pilot said manual they may thank the frenchman thurot in the old business of 56 and our own daredevil the bloody scotchman as the causes of their quarters being so often beaten up after all thurot with his fleet did no more than bully them a little and the poor fellow was finally extinguished by a few small cruisers like a drummers boy under a grenadiers cap but honest paul sang a different tune for his countrymen to dance to and  i believe you will shortly dance yourself manual interrupted griffith quickly and in very pleasure that you have escaped an english prison  say rather an english gibbet continued the elated marine for had a courtmartial or a courtcivil discussed the manner of our entrance into this island i doubt whether we should have fared better than the daredevil himself honest  pshaw exclaimed the impatient griffith enough of this nonsense captain manual we have other matters to discuss now what course have you determined to pursue mr gray  the pilot started like a man aroused from a deep musing at this question and after a pause of a moment he spoke in a low tone of voice as if still under the influence of deep and melancholy feeling  the night has already run into the morning watch but the sun is backward to show himself in this latitude in the heart of winteri must depart my friends to rejoin you some ten hours hence it will be necessary to look deeper into our scheme before we hazard anything and no one can do the service but myself where shall we meet again  i have reason to think that there is an unfrequented ruin at no great distance from us said griffith perhaps we might find both shelter and privacy among its deserted walls  the thought is good returned the pilot and twill answer a double purpose could you find the place where you put the marines in ambush captain manual  has a dog a nose and can he follow a clean scent exclaimed the marine do you think signor pilota that a general ever puts his forces in an ambuscade where he cant find them himself fore god i knew well enough where the rascals lay snoring on their knapsacks some half an hour ago and i would have given the oldest majority in washingtons army to have had them where a small intimation from myself could have brought them in line ready dressed for a charge i know not how you fared gentlemen but with me the sight of twenty such vagabonds would have been a joyous spectacle we would have tossed that captain borroughcliffe and his recruits on the point of our bayonets as the devil would pitch  come come manual said griffith a little angrily you constantly forget our situation and our errand can you lead your men hither without discovery before the day dawns  i want but the shortest halfhour that a bad watch ever traveled over to do it in  then follow and i will appoint a place of secret rendezvous rejoined griffith mr gray can learn our situation at the same time  the pilot was seen to beckon through the gloom of the night for his companions to come forward when they proceeded with cautious steps in quest of the desired shelter a short search brought them in contact with a part of the ruinous walls which spread over a large surface and which in places reared their black fragments against the sky casting a deeper obscurity across the secret recesses of the wood  this will do said griffith when they had skirted for some distance the outline of the crumbling fabric bring up your men to this point where i will meet you and conduct them to some more secret place for which i shall search during your absence  a perfect paradise after the cabletiers of the ariel exclaimed manual i doubt not but a good spot might be selected among these trees for a steady drilla thing my soul has pined after for six long months  away away cried griffith here is no place for idle parades if we find shelter from discovery and capture until you shall be needed in a deadly struggle twill be well  manual was slowly retracing his steps to the skirts of the wood when he suddenly turned and asked  shall i post a small picket a mere corporals guard in the open ground in front and make a chain of sentinels to our works  we have no workswe want no sentinels returned his impatient commander our security is only to be found in secrecy lead up your men under the cover of the trees and let those three bright stars be your landmarksbring them in a range with the northern corner of the wood  enough mr griffith interrupted manual a column of troops is not to be steered like a ship by compass and bearings and distancestrust me sir the march shall be conducted with proper discretion though in a military manner  any reply or expostulation was prevented by the sudden disappearance of the marine whose retreating footsteps were heard for several moments as he moved at a deliberate pace through the underwood during this short interval the pilot stood reclining against the corner of the ruins in profound silence but when the sounds of manuals march were no longer audible he advanced from under the deeper shadows of the wall and approached his youthful companion  we are indebted to the marine for our escape he said i hope we are not to suffer by his folly  he is what barnstable calls a rectangular man returned griffith and will have his way in matters of his profession though a daring companion in a hazardous expedition if we can keep him from exposing us by his silly parade we shall find him a man who will do his work like a soldier sir when need happens  tis all i ask until the last moment he and his command must be torpid for if we are discovered any attempt of ours with some twenty bayonets and a halfpike or two would be useless against the force that would be brought to crush us  the truth of your opinion is too obvious returned griffith these fellows will sleep a week at a time in a gale at sea but the smell of the land wakes them up and i fear twill be hard to keep them close during the day  it must be done sir by the strong hand of force said the pilot sternly if it cannot be done by admonition if we had no more than the recruits of that drunken martinet to cope with it would be no hard task to drive them into the sea but i learned in my prison that horse are expected on the shore with the dawn there is one they call dillon who is on the alert to do us mischief  the miscreant muttered griffith then you also have had communion sir with some of the inmates of st ruth  it behooves a man who is embarked in a perilous enterprise to seize all opportunities to learn his hazard said the pilot evasively if the report be true i fear we have but little hopes of succeeding in our plans  nay then let us take the advantage of the darkness to regain the schooner the coasts of england swarm with hostile cruisers and a rich trade is flowing into the bosom of this island from the four quarters of the world we shall not seek long for a foe worthy to contend with nor for the opportunities to cut up the englishman in his sinews of warhis wealth  griffith returned the pilot in his still low tones that seemed to belong to a man who never knew ambition nor felt human passion i grow sick of this struggle between merit and privileged rank it is in vain that i scour the waters which the king of england boastingly calls his own and capture his vessels in the very mouths of his harbors if my reward is to consist only of isolated promises and hollow professions but your proposition is useless to me i have at length obtained a ship of a size sufficient to convey my person to the shores of honest plain dealing america and i would enter the hall of congress on my return attended by a few of the legislators of this learned isle who think they possess the exclusive privilege to be wise and virtuous and great  such a retinue might doubtless be grateful both to your own feelings and those who would receive you said griffith modestly but would it effect the great purposes of our struggle or is it an exploit when achieved worth the hazard you incur  griffith felt the hand of the pilot on his own pressing it with a convulsive grasp as he replied in a voice if possible even more desperately calm than his former tones  there is a glory in it young man if it be purchased with danger it shall be rewarded by fame it is true i wear your republican livery and call the americans my brothers but it is because you combat in behalf of human nature were your cause less holy i would not shed the meanest drop that flows in english veins to serve it but now it hallows every exploit that is undertaken in its favor and the names of all who contend for it shall belong to posterity is there no merit in teaching these proud islanders that the arm of liberty can pluck them from the very empire of their corruption and oppression  then let me go and ascertain what we most wish to know you have been seen there and might attract  you little know me interrupted the pilot the deed is my own if i succeed i shall claim the honor and it is proper that i incur the hazard if i fail it will be buried in oblivion like fifty others of my schemes which had i power to back me would have thrown this kingdom in consternation from the lookouts on the boldest of its headlands to those on the turrets of windsor castle but i was born without nobility of twenty generations to corrupt my blood and deaden my soul and am not trusted by the degenerate wretches who rule the french marine  tis said that ships of two decks are building from our own oak said griffith and you have only to present yourself in america to be employed most honorably  ay the republics cannot doubt the man who has supported their flag without lowering it an inch in so many bloody conflicts i do go there griffith but my way lies on this path my pretended friends have bound my hands often but my enemies neverneither shall they now ten hours will determine all i wish to know and with you i trust the safety of the party till my return be vigilant but be prudent  if you should not appear at the appointed hour exclaimed griffith as he beheld the pilot turning to depart where am i to seek and how serve you  seek me not but return to your vessel my earliest years were passed on this coastand i can leave the island should it be necessary as i entered it aided by this disguise and my own knowledge in such an event look to your charge and forget me entirely  griffith could distinguish the silent wave of his hand when the pilot concluded and the next instant he was left alone for several minutes the young man continued where he had been standing musing on the singular endowments and restless enterprise of the being with whom chance had thus unexpectedly brought him in contact and with whose fate and fortune his own prospects had by the intervention of unlookedfor circumstances become intimately connected when the reflections excited by recent occurrences had passed away he entered within the sweeping circle of the ruinous walls and after a very cursory survey of the state of the dilapidated building he was satisfied that it contained enough secret places to conceal his men until the return of the pilot should warn them that the hour had come when they must attempt the seizure of the devoted sportsmen or darkness should again facilitate their return to the ariel it was now about the commencement of that period of deep night which seamen distinguish as the morning watch and griffith ventured to the edge of the little wood to listen if any sounds or tumult indicated that they were pursued on reaching a point where his eye could faintly distinguish distant objects the young man paused and bestowed a close and wary investigation on the surrounding scene  the fury of the gale had sensibly abated but a steady current of sea air was rushing through the naked branches of the oaks lending a dreary and mournful sound to the gloom of the dim prospect at the distance of a short half mile the confused outline of the pile of st ruth rose proudly against the streak of light which was gradually increasing above the ocean and there were moments when the young seaman even fancied he could discern the bright caps that topped the waves of his own disturbed element the long dull roar of the surf as it tumbled heavily on the beach or dashed with unbroken violence against the hard boundary of rocks was borne along by the blasts distinctly to his ears it was a time and a situation to cause the young seaman to ponder deeply on the changes and chances of his hazardous profession only a few short hours had passed since he was striving with his utmost skill and with all his collected energy to guide the enormous fabric in which so many of his comrades were now quietly sleeping on the broad ocean from that very shore on which he now stood in cool indifference to the danger the recollection of home america his youthful and enduring passion and the character and charms of his mistress blended in a sort of wild and feverish confusion which was not however without its pleasures in the ardent fancy of the young man and he was slowly approaching step by step toward the abbey when the sound of footsteps proceeding evidently from the measured tread of disciplined men reached his ears he was instantly recalled to his recollection by this noise which increased as the party deliberately approached and in a few moments he was able to distinguish a line of men marching in order towards the edge of the wood from which he had himself so recently issued retiring rapidly under the deeper shadow of the trees he waited until it was apparent the party intended to enter under its cover also when he ventured to speak  who comes and on what errand he cried a skulker and to burrow like a rabbit or jump from hole to hole like a wharfrat said manual sulkily here have i been marching within half musket shot of the enemy without daring to pull a trigger even on their outposts because our muzzles are plugged with that universal extinguisher of gunpowder called prudence fore god  mr griffith i hope you may never feel the temptation to do an evil deed which i felt just now to throw a volley of small shot into that dogkennel of a place if it were only to break its windows and let in the night air upon the sleeping sot who is dozing away the fumes of some as good old southsidehark ye mr griffith one word in your ear  a short conference took place between he two officers apart from the men at the close of which as they rejoined the party manual might be heard urging his plans on the reluctant ears of griffith in the following words  i could carry the old dungeon without waking one of the snorers and consider sir we might get a stock of as rich cordial from its cellars as ever oiled the throat of a gentleman  tis idle tis idle said griffith impatiently we are not robbers of henroosts nor winegaugers to be prying into the vaults of the english gentry captain manual but honorable men employed in the sacred cause of liberty and our country lead your party into the ruin and let them seek their rest we may have work for them with the dawn  evil was the hour when i quitted the line of the army to place a soldier under the orders of an awkward squad of tarry jackets muttered manual as he proceeded to execute an order that was delivered with an air of authority that he knew must be obeyed as pretty an opportunity for a surprise and a forage thrown away as ever crossed the path of a partisan but by all the rights of man ill have an encampment in some order here you sergeant detail a corporal and three men for a picket and station them ii the skirts of this wood we shall have a sentinel in advance of our position and things shall be conducted with some air of discipline  griffith heard this order with great inward disgust but as he anticipated the return of the pilot before the light could arrive to render his weak exposure of their situation apparent he forbore exercising his power to alter the arrangement manual had therefore the satisfaction of seeing his little party quartered as he thought in military manner before he retired with griffith and his men into one of the vaulted apartments of the ruin which by its open and broken doors invited their entrance here the marines disposed themselves to rest while the two officers succeeded in passing the tedious hours without losing their characters for watchfulness by conversing with each other or at whiles suffering their thoughts to roam in the very different fields which fancy would exhibit to men of such differing characters in this manner hour after hour passed in listless quiet or sullen expectation until the day had gradually advanced and it became dangerous to keep the sentinels and picket in a situation where they were liable to be seen by any straggler who might be passing near the wood manual remonstrated against any alteration as being entirely unmilitary for he was apt to carry his notions of tactics to extremes whenever he came in collision with a sea officer but in this instance his superior was firm and the only concession the captain could obtain was the permission to place a solitary sentinel within a few feet of the vault though under the cover of the crumbling walls of the building itself with this slight deviation in their arrangements the uneasy party remained for several hours longer impatiently awaiting the period when they should be required to move  the guns first fired from the alacrity had been distinctly audible and were pronounced by griffith whose practised ear detected the metal of the piece that was used as not proceeding from the schooner when the rapid though distant rumbling of the spirited cannonade became audible it was with difficulty that griffith could restrain either his own feelings or the conduct of his companions within those bounds that prudence and their situation required the last gun was however fired and not a man had left the vault and conjectures as to the result of the fight succeeded to those which had been made on the character of the combatants during the action some of the marines would raise their heads from the fragments which served them as the pillows on which they were seeking disturbed and stolen slumbers and after listening to the cannon would again compose themselves to sleep like men who felt no concern in a contest in which they did not participate others more alive to events and less drowsy lavishly expended their rude jokes on those who were engaged in the struggle or listened with a curious interest to mark the progress of the battle by the uncertain index of its noise when the fight had been some time concluded manual indulged his illhumor more at length  there has been a party of pleasure within a league of us mr griffith he said at which but for our present subterraneous quarters we might have been guests and thus laid some claim to the honor of sharing in the victory but it is not too late to push the party on as far as the cliffs where we shall be in sight of the vessels and we may possibly establish a claim to our share of the prizemoney  there is but little wealth to be gleaned from the capture of a kings cutter returned griffith and there would be less honor were barnstable encumbered with our additional and useless numbers  useless repeated manual there is much good service to be got out of twentythree welldrilled and wellchosen marines look at those fellows mr griffith and then tell me if you think them an encumbrance in the hour of need  griffith smiled and glanced his eye over the sleeping groupfor when the firing had ceased the whole party had again sought their repose and he could not help admiring the athletic and sinewy limbs that lay scattered around the gloomy vault in every posture that ease or whim dictated from the stout frames of the men his glance was directed to the stack of firearms from whose glittering tubes and polished bayonets strong rays of light were reflected even in that dark apartment manual followed the direction of his eyes and watched the expression of his countenance with inward exultation but he had the forbearance to await his reply before he manifested his feeling more openly  i know them to be true men said griffith when needed buthark what says he  who goes there what noise is that repeated the sentinel who was placed at the entrance of the vault  manual and griffith sprang at the same instant from their places of rest and stood unwilling to create the slightest sounds listening with the most intense anxiety to catch the next indications of the cause of their guardians alarm a short stillness like that of death succeeded during which griffith whispered  tis the pilot his hour has been long passed  the words were hardly spoken when the clashing of steel in fierce and sudden contact was heard and at the next instant the body of the sentinel fell heavily along the stone steps that led to the open air and rolled lifelessly to their feet with the bayonet that had caused his death projecting from a deep wound in his breast  away away sleepers away shouted griffith  to arms cried manual in a voice of thunder  the alarmed marines suddenly aroused from their slumbers at these thrilling cries sprang on their feet in a confused cluster and at that fatal moment a body of living fire darted into the vault which re echoed with the reports of twenty muskets the uproar the smoke and the groans which escaped from many of his party could not restrain griffith another instant his pistol was fired through the cloud which concealed the entrance of the vault and he followed the leaden messenger trailing a halfpike and shouting to his men  come on follow my lads they are nothing but soldiers  even while he spoke the ardent young seaman was rushing up the narrow passage but as he gained the open space his foot struck the writhing body of the victim of his shot and he was precipitated headlong into a group of armed men  fire manual fire shouted the infuriated prisoner fire while you have them in a cluster  ay fire mr manual said borroughcliffe with great coolness and shoot your own officer hold him up boys hold him up in front the safest place is nighest to him  fire repeated griffith making desperate efforts to release himself from the grasp of five or six men fire and disregard me  if he do he deserves to be hung said borroughcliffe such fine fellows are not sufficiently plenty to be shot at like wild beasts in chains take him from before the mouth of the vault boys and spread yourselves to your duty  at the time griffith issued from the cover manual was mechanically employed in placing his men in order and the marines accustomed to do everything in concert and array lost the moment to advance the soldiers of borroughcliffe reloaded their muskets and fell back behind different portions of the wall where they could command the entrance to the vault with their fire without much exposure to themselves this disposition was very coolly reconnoitered by manual in person through some of the crevices in the wall and he hesitated to advance against the force he beheld while so advantageously posted in this situation several shots were fired by either party without effect until borroughcliffe perceiving the inefficacy of that mode of attack summoned the garrison of the vault to a parley  surrender to the forces of his majesty king george the third he cried and i promise you quarter  will you release your prisoner and give us free passage to our vessels asked manual the garrison to march out with all the honors of war and officers to retain their sidearms  inadmissible returned borroughcliffe with great gravity the honor of his majestys arms and the welfare of the realm forbid such a treaty but i offer you safe quarters and honorable treatment  officers to retain their sidearms your prisoner to be released and the whole party to return to america on parole not to serve until exchanged  not granted said borroughcliffe the most that i can yield is a good potation of the generous southside and if you are the man i take you for you will know how to prize such an offer  in what capacity do you summon us to yield as men entitled to the benefit of the laws of arms or as rebels to your king  ye are rebels all gentlemen returned the deliberate borroughcliffe and as such ye must yield though so far as good treatment and good fare goes you are sure of it while in my power in all other respects you lie at the mercy of his most gracious majesty  then let his majesty show his gracious face and come and take us for ill be  the asseveration of the marine was interrupted by griffith whose blood had sensibly cooled and whose generous feelings were awakened in behalf of his comrades now that his own fate seemed decided  hold manual he cried make no rash oaths captain borroughcliffe i am edward griffith a lieutenant in the navy of the united american states and i pledge you my honor to a parole  release him said borroughcliffe  griffith advanced between the two parties and spoke so as to be heard by both  i propose to descend to the vault and ascertain the loss and present strength of captain manuals party if the latter be not greater than i apprehend i shall advise him to a surrender on the usual conditions of civilized nations  go said the soldier but stay is he a halfandhalfan amphibiouspshaw i mean a marine  he is sir a captain in that corps  the very man interrupted borroughcliffe i thought i recollected the liquid sounds of his voice it will be well to speak to him of the good fare of st ruth and you may add that i know my man i shall besiege instead of storming him with the certainty of a surrender when his canteen is empty the vault he is in holds no such beverage as the cellars of the abbey  griffith smiled in spite of the occasion and his vexation and making a slight inclination of his head he passed into the vault giving notice to his friends by his voice in order to apprise them who approached  he found six of the marines including the sentinel lying dead on the ragged pavement and four others wounded but stifling their groans by the order of their commander that they might not inform the enemy of his weakness with the remainder of his command manual had entrenched himself behind the fragment of a wall that intersected the vault and regardless of the dismaying objects before him maintained as bold a front and as momentous an air as if the fate of a walled town depended on his resolution and ingenuity  you see mr griffith he cried when the young sailor approached this gloomy but really formidable arrangement that nothing short of artillery can dislodge me as for that drinking englishman above let him send down his men by platoons of eight or ten and ill pile them up on those steps four and five deep  but artillery can and will be brought if it should be necessary said griffith and there is not the least chance of your eventual escape it may be possible for you to destroy a few of the enemy but you are too humane to wish to do it unnecessarily  no doubt returned manual with a grim smile and yet methinks i could find present pleasure in shooting seven of themyes just seven which is one more than they have struck off my roster  remember your own wounded added griffith they suffer for want of aid while you protract a useless defence  a few smothered groans from the sufferers seconded this appeal and manual yielded though with a very ill grace to the necessity of the case  go then and tell him that we will surrender as prisoners of war he said on the conditions that he grants me my sidearms and that suitable care shall be taken of the sickbe particular to call them sickfor some lucky accident may yet occur before the compact is ratified and i would not have him learn our loss  griffith without waiting for a second bidding hastened to borroughcliffe with his intelligence  his sidearms repeated the soldier when the other had done what are they i pray theea marlinespike for if his equipments be no better than thine own my worthy prisoner there is little need to quarrel about their ownership  had i but ten of my meanest men armed with such halfpikes and captain borroughcliffe and his party were put at deadly strife with us retorted griffith he might find occasion to value our weapons more highly  four such fiery gentlemen as yourself would have routed my command returned borroughcliffe with undisturbed composure i trembled for my ranks when i saw you coming out of the smoke like a blazing comet from behind a cloud and i shall never think of somersets without returning inward thanks to their inventor but our treaty is made let your comrades come forth and pile their arms  griffith communicated the result to the captain of marines when the latter led the remnant of his party out of his sunken fortress into the open air  the men who had manifested throughout the whole business that cool subordination and unyielding front mixed with the dauntless spirit that to this day distinguishes the corps of which they were members followed their commander in sullen silence and stacked their arms with as much regularity and precision as if they had been ordered to relieve themselves after a march when this necessary preliminary had been observed borroughcliffe unmasked his forces and our adventurers found themselves once more in the power of the enemy and under circumstances which rendered the prospect of a speedy release from their captivity nearly hopeless     chapter xx    if your father will do me any honor so   if not let him kill the next percy himself   i look to be either earl or duke i can assure you   falstaff   manual cast sundry discontented and sullen looks from his captors to the remnant of his own command while the process of pinioning the latter was conducted with much discretion under the directions of sergeant drill when meeting in one of his dissatisfied glances with the pale and disturbed features of griffith he gave vent to his ill humor by saying  this results from neglecting the precautions of military discipline had the command been with men who i may say without boasting have been accustomed to the duties of the field proper pickets would have been posted and instead of being caught like so many rabbits in a burrow to be smoked out with brimstone we should have had an open field for the struggle or we might have possessed ourselves of these walls which i could have made good for two hours at least against the best regiment that ever wore king georges facings  defend the outworks before retreating to the citadel cried borroughcliffe tis the game of war and shows science but had you kept closer to your burrow the rabbits might now have all been frisking about in that pleasant abode the eyes of a timid hind were greeted this morning while journeying near this wood with a passing sight of armed men in strange attire and as he fled with an intent of casting himself into the sea as fear will sometimes urge one of his kind to do he luckily encountered me on the cliffs who humanely saved his life by compelling him to conduct us hither there is often wisdom in science my worthy contemporary in arms but there is sometimes safety in ignorance  you have succeeded sir and have a right to be pleasant said manual seating himself gloomily on a fragment of the ruin and fastening his looks on the melancholy spectacle of the lifeless bodies as they were successively brought from the vault and placed at his feet but these men have been my own children and you will excuse me if i cannot retort your pleasantries ah captain borroughcliffe you are a soldier and know how to value merit i took those very fellows who sleep on these stones so quietly from the hands of nature and made them the pride of our art they were no longer men but brave lads who ate and drank wheeled and marched loaded and fired laughed or were sorrowful spoke or were silent only at my will as for soul there was but one among them all and that was in my keeping groan my children groan freely now there is no longer a reason to be silent i have known a single musketbullet cut the buttons from the coats of five of them in a row without raising the skin of a man i could ever calculate with certainty how many it would be necessary to expend in all regular service but this accursed banditti business has robbed me of the choicest of my treasures you stand at ease now my children groan it will soften your anguish  borroughcliffe appeared to participate in some degree in the feelings of his captive and he made a few appropriate remarks in the way of condolence while he watched the preparations that were making by his own men to move at length his orderly announced that substitutes for barrows were provided to sustain the wounded and inquired if it were his pleasure to return to their quarters  who has seen the horse demanded the captain which way did they march have they gained any tidings of the discovery of this party of the enemy  not from us your honor returned the sergeant they had ridden along the coast before we left the cliffs and it was said their officer intended to scour the shore for several miles and spread the alarm  let him it is all such gay gallants are good for drill honor is almost as scarce an article with our arms just now as promotion we seem but the degenerate children of the heroes of poictiersyou understand me sergeant  some battle fout by his majestys troops against the french your honor returned the orderly a little at a loss to comprehend the expression of his officers eye  fellow you grow dull on victory exclaimed borroughcliffe come hither i would give you orders do you think mister drill there is more honor or likely to be more profit in this little mornings amusement than you and i can stand under  i should not your honor we have both pretty broad shoulders  that are not weakened by undue burdens of this nature interrupted his captain significantly if we let the news of this affair reach the ears of those hungry dragoons they would charge upon us openmouthed like a pack of famished beagles and claim at least half the credit and certainly all the profit  but your honor there was not a man of them even  no matter drill ive known troops that have been engaged and have suffered cheated out of their share of victory by a wellworded despatch you know fellow that in the smoke and confusion of a battle a man can only see what passes near him and common prudence requires that he only mention in his official letters what he knows cant be easily contradicted thus your indians and indeed all allies are not entitled to the right of a general order any more than to the right of a parade now i dare say you have heard of a certain battle of blenheim  lord your honor tis the pride of the british army that and the culloden twas when the great corporal john beat the french king and all his lords and nobility with half his nation in arms to back him  ay there is a little of the barrack readings in the account but it is substantially true know you how many french were in the field that day mister drill  i have never seen the totals of their muster sir in print but judging by the difference betwixt the nations i should suppose some hundreds of thousands  and yet to oppose this vast army the duke had only ten or twelve thousand wellfed englishmen you look astounded sergeant  why your honor that does seem rather an overmatch for an old soldier to swallow the random shot would sweep away so small a force  and yet the battle was fought and the victory won but the duke of marlborough had a certain mr eugene with some fifty or sixty thousand highdutchers to back him you never heard of mr eugene  not a syllable your honor i always thought that corporal john  was a gallant and great general you thought right mister drill so would a certain nameless gentleman be also if his majesty would sign a commission to that effect however a majority is on the high road to a regiment and with even a regiment a man is comfortable in plain english mister drill we must get our prisoners into the abbey with as little noise as possible in order that the horse may continue their gambols along the coast without coming to devour our meal all the fuss must be made at the waroffice for that trifle you may trust me i think i know who holds a quill that is as good in its way as the sword he wears drill is a short name and can easily be written within the folds of a letter  lord your honor said the gratified halberdier im sure such an honor is morebut your honor can ever command me  i do and it is to be close and to make your men keep close until it shall be time to speak when i pledge myself there shall be noise enough borroughcliffe shook his head with a grave air as he continued it has been a devil of a bloody fight sergeant look at the dead and wounded a wood on each flanksupported by a ruin in the centre oh inkink can be spilt on the details with great effect go fellow and prepare to march  thus enlightened on the subject of his commanders ulterior views the noncommissioned agent of the captains wishes proceeded to give suitable instructions to the rest of the party and to make the more immediate preparations for a march the arrangements were soon completed the bodies of the slain were left unsheltered the seclusion of the ruin being deemed a sufficient security against the danger of any discovery until darkness should favor their removal in conformity with borroughcliffes plan to monopolize the glory the wounded were placed on rude litters composed of the muskets and blankets of the prisoners when the conquerors and vanquished moved together in a compact body from the ruin in such a manner as to make the former serve as a mask to conceal the latter from the curious gaze of any casual passenger there was but little indeed to apprehend on this head for the alarm and terror consequent on the exaggerated reports that flew through the country effectually prevented any intruders on the usually quiet and retired domains of st ruth  the party was emerging from the wood when the cracking of branches and rustling of dried leaves announced however that an interruption of some sort was about to occur  if it should be one of their rascally patrols exclaimed borroughcliffe with very obvious displeasure they trample like a regiment of cavalry but gentlemen you will acknowledge yourselves that we were retiring from the field of battle when we met the reinforcement if it should prove to be such  we are not disposed sir to deny you the glory of having achieved your victory singlehanded said griffith glancing his eyes uneasily in the direction of the approaching sounds expecting to see the pilot issue from the thicket in which he seemed to be entangled instead of any detachment of his enemies  clear the way caesar cried a voice at no great distance from them break through the accursed vines on my right pompeypress forward my fine fellows or we may be too late to smell even the smoke of the fight  hum ejaculated the captain with his philosophic indifference of manner entirely reestablished this must be a roman legion just awoke from a trance of some seventeen centuries and that the voice of a centurion we will halt mister drill and view the manner of an ancient march  while the captain was yet speaking a violent effort disengaged the advancing party from the thicket of brambles in which they had been entangled when two blacks each bending under a load of firearms preceded colonel howard into the clear space where borroughcliffe had halted his detachment some little time was necessary to enable the veteran to arrange his disordered dress and to remove the perspiring effects of the unusual toil from his features before he could observe the addition to the captains numbers  we heard you fire cried the old soldier making at the same time the most diligent application of his bandana and i determined to aid you with a sortie which when judiciously timed has been the means of raising many a siege though had montcalm rested quietly within his walls the plains of abram might never have drunk his blood  oh his decision was soldierly and according to all rules of war exclaimed manual and had i followed his example this day might have produced a different tale  why who have we here cried the colonel in astonishment who is it that pretends to criticise battles and sieges dressed in such a garb  tis a dux incognitorum my worthy host said borroughcliffe which means in our english language a captain of marines in the service of the american congress  what have you then met the enemy ay and by the fame of the immortal wolfe you have captured them cried the delighted veteran i was pressing on with a part of my garrison to your assistance for i had seen that you were marching in this direction and even the report of a few muskets was heard  a few interrupted the conqueror i know not what you call a few my gallant and ancient friend you may possibly have shot at each other by the week in the days of wolfe and abercrombie and braddock but i too have seen smart firing and can hazard an opinion in such matters there was as pretty a roll made by firearms at the battles on the hudson as ever rattled from a drum it is all over and many live to talk of it but this has been the most desperate affair for the numbers i ever was engaged in i speak always with a reference to the numbers the wood is pretty well sprinkled with dead and we have contrived to bring off a few of the desperately wounded with us as you may perceive  bless me exclaimed the surprised veteran that such an engagement should happen within musketshot of the abbey and i know so little of it my faculties are on the wane i fear for the time has been when a single discharge would rouse me from the deepest sleep  the bayonet is a silent weapon returned the composed captain with a significant wave of his hand tis the englishmans pride and every experienced officer knows that one thrust from it is worth the fire of a whole platoon  what did you come to the charge cried the colonel by the lord borroughcliffe my gallant young friend i would have given twenty tierces of rice and two ablebodied negroes to have seen the fray  it would have been a pleasant spectacle to witness sans disputation returned the captain but victory is ours without the presence of achilles this time i have them all that survive the affair at least all that have put foot on english soil  ay and the kings cutter has brought in the schooner added colonel howard thus perish all rebellion for ever more wheres kit my kinsman mr christopher dillon i would ask him what the laws of the realm next prescribe to loyal subjects here will be work for the jurors of middlesex captain borroughcliffe if not for a secretary of states warrant where is kit my kinsman the ductile the sagacious the loyal christopher  the cacique non est as more than one bailiff has said of sundry clever fellows in our regiment when there has been a pressing occasion for their appearance said the soldier but the cornet of horse has given me reason to believe that his provincial lordship who repaired on board the cutter to give intelligence of the position of the enemy continued there to share the dangers and honors of naval combat  ay tis like him cried the colonel rubbing his hands with glee tis like him he has forgotten the law and his peaceful occupations at the sounds of military preparation and has carried the head of a statesman into the fight with the ardor and thoughtlessness of a boy  the cacique is a man of discretion observed the captain with all his usual dryness of manner and will doubtless recollect his obligations to posterity and himself though he be found entangled in the mazes of a combat but i marvel that he does not return for some time has now elapsed since the schooner struck her flag as my own eyes have witnessed  you will pardon me gentlemen said griffith advancing towards them with uncontrollable interest but i have unavoidably heard part of your discourse and cannot think you will find it necessary to withhold the whole truth from a disarmed captive say you that a schooner has been captured this morning  it is assuredly true said borroughcliffe with a display of nature and delicacy in his manner that did his heart infinite credit but i forbore to tell you because i thought your own misfortunes would be enough for one time mr griffith this gentleman is colonel howard to whose hospitality you will be indebted for some favors before we separate  griffith echoed the colonel in quick reply griffith what a sight for my old eyes to witnessthe child of worthy gallant loyal hugh griffith a captive and taken in arms against his prince young man young man what would thy honest father what would his bosom friend my own poor brother harry have said had it pleased god that they had survived to witness this burning shame and lasting stigma on thy respectable name  had my father lived he would now have been upholding the independence of his native land said the young man proudly i wish to respect even the prejudices of colonel howard and beg he will forbear urging a subject on which i fear we never shall agree  never while thou art to be found in the ranks of rebellion cried the colonel oh boy boy how i could have loved and cherished thee if the skill and knowledge obtained in the service of thy prince were now devoted to the maintenance of his unalienable rights i loved thy father worthy hugh even as i loved my own brother harry  and his son should still be dear to you interrupted griffith taking the reluctant hand of the colonel into both his own  ah edward edward continued the softened veteran how many of my daydreams have been destroyed by thy perversity nay i know not that kit discreet and loyal as he is could have found such a favor in my eyes as thyself there is a cast of thy father in that face and smile ned that might have won me to anything short of treasonand then cicely provoking tender mutinous kind affectionate good cicely would have been a link to unite us forever  the youth cast a hasty glance at the deliberate borroughcliffe who if he had obeyed the impatient expression of his eye would have followed the party that was slowly bearing the wounded towards the abbey before he yielded to his feelings and answered  nay sir let this then be the termination of our misunderstanding your lovely niece shall be that link and you shall be to me as your friend hugh would have been had he lived and to cecilia twice a parent  boy boy said the veteran averting his face to conceal the working of his muscles you talk idly my word is now plighted to my kinsman kit and thy scheme is impracticable  nothing is impracticable sir to youth and enterprise when aided by age and experience like yours returned griffith this war must soon terminate  this war echoed the colonel shaking loose the grasp which griffith held on his arm ay what of this war young man is it not an accursed attempt to deny the rights of our gracious sovereign and to place tyrants reared in kennels on the throne of princes a scheme to elevate the wicked at the expense of the good a project to aid unrighteous ambition under the mask of sacred liberty and the popular cry of equality as if there could be liberty without order or equality of rights where the privileges of the sovereign are not as sacred as those of the people  you judge us harshly colonel howard said griffith  i judge you interrupted the old soldier who by this time thought the youth resembled any one rather than his friend hugh it is not my province to judge you at all if it werebut the time will come the time will come i am a patient man and can wait the course of things yes yes age cools the blood and we learn to suppress the passions and impatience of youth but if the ministry would issue a commission of justice for the colonies and put the name of old george howard in it i am a dog if there should be a rebel alive in twelve months sir turning sternly to borroughcliffe in such a case i could prove a roman and hanghangyes i do think sir i could hang my kinsman mr christopher dillon  spare the cacique such unnatural elevation before his time returned the captain with a grave wave of the hand behold pointing towards the wood there is a more befitting subject for the gallows mr griffith yonder man calls himself your comrade  the eyes of colonel howard and griffith followed the direction of his finger and the latter instantly recognized the pilot standing in the skirts of the wood with his arms folded apparently surveying the condition of his friends  that man said griffith in confusion and hesitating to utter even the equivocal truth that suggested itself that man does not belong to our ships company  and yet he has been seen in your company returned the incredulous borroughcliffe he was the spokesman in last nights examination colonel howard and doubtless commands the rearguard of the rebels  you say true cried the veteran pompey caesar present fire  the blacks started at the sudden orders of their master of whom they stood in the deepest awe and presenting their muskets they averted their faces and shutting their eyes obeyed the bloody mandate  charge shouted the colonel flourishing the ancient sword with which he had armed himself and pressing forward with all the activity that a recent fit of the gout would allow charge and exterminate the dogs with the bayonet push on pompeydress boys dress  if your friend stands this charge said borroughcliffe to griffith with unmoved composure his nerves are made of iron such a charge would break the coldstreams with pompey in the ranks  i trust in god cried griffith he will have forbearance enough to respect the weakness of colonel howardhe presents a pistol  but he will not fire the romans deem it prudent to halt nay by heaven they countermarch to the rear holla colonel howard my worthy host fall back on your reinforcements the wood is full of armed men they cannot escape us i only wait for the horse to cut off the retreat  the veteran who had advanced within a short distance of the single man who thus deliberately awaited the attack halted at this summons and by a glance of his eye ascertained that he stood alone believing the words of borroughcliffe to be true he slowly retired keeping his face manfully towards his enemy until he gained the support of the captain  recall the troops borroughcliffe he cried and let us charge into the wood they will fly before his majestys arms like guilty scoundrels as they are as for the negroes ill teach the black rascals to desert their master at such a moment they say fear is pale but damme borroughcliffe if i dont believe his skin is black  i have seen him of all colors blue white black and particolored said the captain i must take the command of matters on myself however my excellent host let us retire into the abbey and trust me to cut off the remainder of the rebels  in this arrangement the colonel reluctantly acquiesced and the three followed the soldier to the dwelling at a pace that was adapted to the infirmities of its master the excitement of the onset and the current of his ideas had united however to banish every amicable thought from the breast of the colonel and he entered the abbey with a resolute determination of seeing justice dealt to griffith and his companions even though it should push them to the foot of the gallows  as the gentlemen disappeared from his view among the shrubbery of the grounds the pilot replaced the weapon that was hanging from his hand in his bosom and turning with a saddened and thoughtful brow he slowly reentered the wood     chapter xxi    when these prodigies   do so conjointly meet let not men say   these are their reasonsthey are natural   for i believe they are portentous things   unto the climate that they point upon   casca   the reader will discover by referring to the time consumed in the foregoing events that the ariel with her prize did not anchor in the bay already mentioned until griffith and his party had been for several hours in the custody of their enemies the supposed capture of the rebel schooner was an incident that excited but little interest and no surprise among a people who were accustomed to consider their seamen as invincible and barnstable had not found it a difficult task to practise his deception on the few rustics whom curiosity induced to venture alongside the vessels during the short continuance of daylight when however the fogs of evening began to rise along the narrow basin and the curvatures of its margin were lost in the single outline of its dark and gloomy border the young seaman thought it time to apply himself in earnest to his duty the alacrity containing all his own crew together with the ariels wounded was gotten silently under way and driving easily before the heavy air that swept from the land she drifted from the harbor until the open sea lay before her when her sails were spread and she continued to make the best of her way in quest of the frigate barnstable had watched this movement with breathless anxiety for on an eminence that completely commanded the waters to some distance a small but rude battery had been erected for the purpose of protecting the harbor against the depredations and insults of the smaller vessels of the enemy and a guard of sufficient force to manage the two heavy guns it contained was maintained in the work at all times he was ignorant how far his stratagem had been successful and it was only when he heard the fluttering of the alacritys canvas as she opened it to the breeze he felt that he was yet secure  twill reach the englishmens ears said the boy merry who stood on the forecastle of the schooner by the side of his commander listening with breathless interest to the sounds they set a sentinel on the point as the sun went down and if he is a trifle better than a dead man or a marine asleep he will suspect something is wrong  never returned barnstable with a long breath that announced all his apprehensions were removed he will be more likely to believe it a mermaid fanning herself this cool evening than to suspect the real fact what say you master coffin will the soldier smell the truth  theyre a dumb race said the cockswain casting his eyes over his shoulders to ascertain that none of their own marine guard was near him now there was our sergeant who ought to know something seeing that he has been afloat these four years maintained dead in the face and eyes of what every man who has ever doubled good hope knows to be true that there was no such vessel to be fallen in with in them seas as the flying dutchman and then again when i told him that he was a knownothing and asked him if the dutchman was a more unlikely thing than that there should be places where the inhabitants split the year into two watches and had day for six months and night the rest of the time the greenhorn laughed in my face and i do believe he would have told me i lied but for one thing  and what might that be asked barnstable gravely  why sir returned tom stretching his bony fingers as he surveyed his broad palm by the little light that remained though i am a peaceable man i can be roused  and you have seen the flying dutchman  i never doubled the east cape though i can find my way through le maire in the darkest night that ever fell from the heavens but i have seen them that have seen her and spoken her too  well be it so you must turn flying yankee yourself tonight master coffin man your boat at once sir and arm your crew  the cockswain paused a moment before he proceeded to obey this unexpected order and pointing towards the battery he inquired with infinite phlegm  for shorework sir shall we take the cutlashes and pistols or shall we want the pikes  there may be soldiers in our way with their bayonets said barnstable musing arm as usual but throw a few long pikes into the boat and harkye master coffin out with your tub and whaleline for i see you have rigged yourself anew in that way  the cockswain who was moving from the forecastle turned short at this new mandate and with an air of remonstrance ventured to say  trust an old whaler captain barnstable who has been used to these craft all his life a whaleboat is made to pull with a tub and line in it as naturally as a ship is made to sail with ballast and  out with it out with it interrupted the other with an impatient gesture that his cockswain knew signified a positive determination heaving a sigh at what he deemed his commanders prejudice tom applied himself without further delay to the execution of the orders barnstable laid his hand familiarly on the shoulder of the boy and led him to the stern of his little vessel in profound silence the canvas hood that covered the entrance to the cabin was thrown partly aside and by the light of the lamp that was burning in the small apartment it was easy to overlook from the deck what was passing beneath them dillon sat supporting his head with his two hands in a manner that shaded his face but in an attitude that denoted deep and abstracted musing  i would that i could see the face of my prisoner said barnstable in an undertone that was audible only to his companion the eye of a man is a sort of lighthouse to tell one how to steer into the haven of his confidence boy  and sometimes a beacon sir to warn you there is no safe anchorage near him returned the ready boy  rogue muttered barnstable your cousin kate spoke there  if my cousin plowden were here mr barnstable i know that her opinion of yon gentleman would not be at all more favorable  and yet i have determined to trust him listen boy and tell me if i am wrong you have a quick wit like some others of your family and may suggest something advantageous the gratified midshipman swelled with the conscious pleasure of possessing his commanders confidence and followed to the taffrail over which barnstable leaned while he delivered the remainder of his communication i have gathered from the longshoremen who have come off this evening to stare at the vessel which the rebels have been able to build that a party of seamen and marines have been captured in an old ruin near the abbey of st ruth this very day  tis mr griffith exclaimed the boy  ay the wit of your cousin katherine was not necessary to discover that now i have proposed to this gentleman with the savannah face that he should go into the abbey and negotiate an exchange i will give him for griffith and the crew of the alacrity for manuals command and the tigers  the tigers cried the lad with emotion have they got my tigers too would to god that mr griffith had permitted me to land  it was no boys work they were about and room was scarcer in their boat than live lumber but this mr dillon has accepted my proposition and has pledged himself that griffith shall return within an hour after he is permitted to enter the abbey will he redeem his honor from the pledge  he may said merry musing a moment for i believe he thinks the presence of mr griffith under the same roof with miss howard a thing to be prevented if possible he may be true in this instance though he has a hollow look  he has badlooking lighthouses i will own said barnstable and yet he is a gentleman and promises fair tis unmanly to suspect him in such a matter and i will have faith now listen sir the absence of older heads must throw great responsibility on your young shoulders watch that battery as closely as if you were at the masthead of your frigate on the lookout for an enemy the instant you see lights moving in it cut and run into the offing you will find me somewhere under the cliffs and you will stand off and on keeping the abbey in sight until you fall in with us  merry gave an attentive ear to these and divers other solemn injunctions that he received from his commander who having sent the officer next to himself in authority in charge of the prize the third in command being included in the list of the wounded was compelled to entrust his beloved schooner to the vigilance of a lad whose years gave no promise of the experience and skill that he actually possessed  when his admonitory instructions were ended barnstable stepped again to the opening in the cabinhood and for a single moment before he spoke once more examined the countenance of his prisoner with a keen eye dillon had removed his hands from before his sallow features and as if conscious of the scrutiny his looks were to undergo had concentrated the whole expression of his forbidding aspect in a settled gaze of hopeless submission to his fate at least so thought his captor and the idea touched some of the finer feelings in the bosom of the generous young seaman discarding instantly every suspicion of his prisoners honor as alike unworthy of them both barnstable summoned him in a cheerful voice to the boat there was a flashing of the features of dillon at this call which gave an indefinable expression to his countenance that again startled the sailor but it was so very transient and could so easily be mistaken for a smile of pleasure at his promised liberation that the doubts it engendered passed away almost as speedily as the equivocal expression itself barnstable was in the act of following his companion into the boat when he felt himself detained by a slight hold of his arm  what would you have he asked of the midshipman who had given him the signal  do not trust too much to that dillon sir returned the anxious boy in a whisper if you had seen his face as i did when the binnacle light fell upon it as he came up the cabin ladder you would put no faith in him  i should have seen no beauty said the generous lieutenant laughing but there is long tom as hardfeatured a youth of two score and ten as ever washed in brine who has a heart as big ay bigger than that of a kraaken a bright watch to you boy and remember a keen eye on the battery as he was yet speaking barnstable crossed the gunwale of his little vessel and it was not until he was seated by the side of his prisoner that he continued aloud cast the stops off your sails mr merry and see all clear to make a run of everything recollect you are shorthanded sir god bless ye and dye hear if there is a man among you who shuts more than one eye at a time ill make him when i get back open both wider than if tom coffins friend the flying dutchman was booming down upon him god bless ye merry my boy give em the squaresail if this breeze offshore holds on till morningshove off  as barnstable gave the last order he fell back on his seat and drawing back his boatcloak around him maintained a profound silence until they had passed the two small headlands that fanned the mouth of the harbor the men pulled with muffled oars their long vigorous strokes and the boat glided with amazing rapidity past the objects that could be yet indistinctly seen along the dim shore when however they had gained the open ocean and the direction of their little bark was changed to one that led them in a line with the coast and within the shadows of the cliffs the cockswain deeming that the silence was no longer necessary to their safety ventured to break it as follows  a squaresail is a good sail to carry on a craft dead afore it and in a heavy sea but if fifty years can teach a man to know the weather its my judgment that should the ariel break ground after the night turns at eight bells shell need her mainsail to hold her up to her course  the lieutenant started at this sudden interruption and casting his cloak from his shoulders he looked abroad on the waters as if seeking those portentous omens which disturbed the imagination of his cockswain  how now tom he said sharply have ye turned croaker in your old age what see you to cause such an old womans ditty  tis no song of an old woman returned the cockswain with solemn earnestness but the warning of an old man and one who has spent his days where there were no hills to prevent the winds of heaven from blowing on him unless they were hills of salt water and foam i judge sir therell be a heavy northeaster setting in upon us afore the morning watch is called  barnstable knew the experience of his old messmate too well not to feel uneasiness at such an opinion delivered in so confident a manner but after again surveying the horizon the heavens and the ocean he said with a continued severity of manner  your prophecy is idle this time master coffin everything looks like a dead calm this swell is what is left from the last blow the mist overhead is nothing but the nightly fog and you can see with own eyes that it is driving seaward even this landbreeze is nothing but the air of the ground mixing with that of the ocean it is heavy with dew and fog but its as sluggish as a dutch galliot  ay sir it is damp and there is little of it rejoined tom but as it comes only from the shore so it never goes far on the water it is hard to learn the true signs of the weather captain barnstable and none get to know them well but such as study little else or feel but little else there is only one who can see the winds of heaven or who can tell when a hurricane is to begin or where it will end still a man isnt like a whale or a porpoise that takes the air in his nostrils and never knows whether it is a southeaster or a northwester that he feeds upon look broadoff to leeward sir see the streak of clear sky shining under the mists take an old seafaring mans word for it captain barnstable that whenever the light shines out of the heavens in that fashion tis never done for nothing besides the sun set in a dark bank of clouds and the little moon we had was dry and windy  barnstable listened attentively and with increasing concern for he well knew that his cockswain possessed a quick and almost unerring judgment of the weather notwithstanding the confused medley of superstitious omens and signs with which it was blended but again throwing himself back in his boat he muttered  then let it blow griffith is worth a heavier risk and if the battery cant be cheated it can be carried  nothing further passed on the state of the weather dillon had not ventured a single remark since he entered the boat and the cockswain had the discretion to understand that his officer was willing to be left to his own thoughts for nearly an hour they pursued their way with diligence the sinewy seamen who wielded the oars urging their light boat along the edge of the surf with unabated velocity and apparently with untired exertions occasionally barnstable would cast an inquiring glance at the little inlets that they passed or would note with a seamans eye the small portions of sandy beach that were scattered here and there along the rocky boundaries of the coast one in particular a deeper inlet than common where a run of fresh water was heard gurgling as it met the tide he pointed out to his cockswain by significant but silent gestures as a place to be especially noted tom who understood the signal as intended for his own eye alone made his observations on the spot with equal taciturnity but with all the minuteness that would distinguish one long accustomed to find his way whether by land or water by landmarks and the bearings of different objects soon after this silent communication between the lieutenant and his cockswain the boat was suddenly turned and was in the act of dashing upon the spit of sand before it when barnstable checked the movement by his voice  hold water he said tis the sound of oars  the seamen held their boat at rest while a deep attention was given to the noise that had alarmed the ears of their commander  see sir said the cockswain pointing towards the eastern horizon it is just rising into the streak of light to seaward of usnow it settles in the troughah here you have it again  by heavens cried barnstable tis a manofwars stroke it pulls i saw the oarblades as they fell and listen to the sound neither your fisherman nor your smuggler pulls such a regular oar  tom had bowed his head nearly to the water in the act of listening and now raising himself he spoke with confidence  that is the tiger i know the stroke of her crew as well as i do of my own mr merry has made them learn the newfashioned jerk as they dip their blades and they feather with such a roll in their rullocks i could swear to the stroke  hand me the nightglass said his commander impatiently i can catch them as they are lifted into the streak you are right by every star in our flag tombut there is only one man in her sternsheets by my good eyes i believe it is that accursed pilot sneaking from the land and leaving griffith and manual to die in english prisons to shore with youbeach her at once  the order was no sooner given than it was obeyed and in less than two minutes the impatient barnstable dillon and the cockswain were standing together on the sands  the impression he had received that his friends were abandoned to their fate by the pilot urged the generous young seaman to hasten the departure of his prisoner as he was fearful every moment might interpose some new obstacle to the success of his plans  mr dillon he said the instant they were landed i exact no new promiseyour honor is already plighted  if oaths can make it stronger interrupted dillon i will take them  oaths cannotthe honor of a gentleman is at all times enough i shall send my cockswain with you to the abbey and you will either return with him in person within two hours or give mr griffith and captain manual to his guidance proceed sir you are conditionally free there is an easy opening by which to ascend the cliffs  dillon once more thanked his generous captor and then proceeded to force his way up the rough eminence  follow and obey his instructions said barnstable to his cockswain aloud  tom long accustomed to implicit obedience handled his harpoon and was quietly following in the footsteps of his new leader when he felt the hand of the lieutenant on his shoulder  you saw where the brook emptied over the hillock of sand said barnstable in an undertone  tom nodded assent  you will find us there riding without the surftwill not do to trust too much to an enemy  the cockswain made a gesture of great significance with his weapon that was intended to indicate the danger their prisoner would incur should he prove false when applying the wooden end of the harpoon to the rocks he ascended the ravine at a rate that soon brought him to the side of his companion     chapter xxii    ay marry let me have him to sit under   hes like to be a cold soldier   falstaff   barnstable lingered on the sands for a few minutes until the footsteps of dillon and the cockswain were no longer audible when he ordered his men to launch their boat once more into the surf while the seamen pulled leisurely towards the place he had designated as the point where he would await the return of tom the lieutenant first began to entertain serious apprehensions concerning the good faith of his prisoner now that dillon was beyond his control his imagination presented in very vivid colors several little circumstances in the others conduct which might readily excuse some doubts of his good faith and by the time they had reached the place of rendezvous and had cast a light grapnel into the sea his fears had rendered him excessively uncomfortable leaving the lieutenant to his reflections on this unpleasant subject we shall follow dillon and his fearless and unsuspecting companion in their progress towards st ruth  the mists to which tom had alluded in his discussion with his commander on the state of the weather appeared to be settling nearer to the earth and assuming more decidedly the appearance of a fog hanging above them in sluggish volumes but little agitated by the air the consequent obscurity added deeply to the gloom of the night and it would have been difficult for one less acquainted than dillon with the surrounding localities to find the path which led to the dwelling of colonel howard after some little search this desirable object was effected and the civilian led the way with rapid strides towards the abbey  ay ay said tom who followed his steps and equaled his paces without any apparent effort you shore people have an easy way to find your course and distance when you get into the track i was once left by the craft i belonged to in boston to find my way to plymouth which is a matter of fifteen leagues or thereaway and so finding nothing was bound up the bay after lyingby for a week i concluded to haul aboard my land tacks i spent the better part of another week in a search for some hooker on board which i might work my passage across the country for money was as scarce then with old tom coffin as it is now and is likely to be unless the fisheries get a good luff soon but it seems that nothing but your horseflesh and horned cattle and jackasses are privileged to do the pulling and hauling in your shore hookers and i was forced to pay a weeks wages for a berth besides keeping a banyan on a mouthful of bread and cheese from the time we hove up in boston till we came to in plymouth town  it was certainly an unreasonable exaction on the part of the wagoners from a man in your situation said dillon in a friendly soothing tone of voice that denoted a willingness to pursue the conversation  my situation was that of a cabin passenger returned the cockswain for there was but one hand forward besides the cattle i mentioned that was he who steeredand an easy berth he had of it for there his course lay atween walls of stone and fences and as for his reckoning why they had stuck up bits of stone on an end with his days work footed up ready to his hand every half league or so besides the landmarks were so plenty that a man with half an eye might steer her and no fear of getting to leeward  you must have found yourself as it were in a new world observed dillon  why to me it was pretty much the same as if i had been set afloat in a strange country though i may be said to be a native of those parts being born on the coast i had often heard shoremen say that there was as much arth as water in the world which i always set down as a rank lie for ive sailed with a flowing sheet months anend without falling in with as much land or rock as would answer a gull to lay its eggs on but i will own that atween boston and plymouth we were out of sight of water for as much as two full watches  dillon pursued this interesting subject with great diligence and by the time they reached the wall which enclosed the large paddock that surrounded the abbey the cockswain was deeply involved in a discussion of the comparative magnitude of the atlantic ocean and the continent of america  avoiding the principal entrance to the building through the great gates which communicated with the court in front dillon followed the windings of the wall until it led them to a wicket which he knew was seldom closed for the night until the hour for general rest had arrived their way now lay in the rear of the principal edifice and soon conducted them to the confused pile which contained the offices the cockswain followed his companion with a confiding reliance on his knowledge and good faith that was somewhat increased by the freedom of communication that had been maintained during their walk from the cliffs he did not perceive anything extraordinary in the others stopping at the room which had been provided as a sort of barracks for the soldiers of captain borroughcliffe a conference which took place between dillon and the sergeant was soon ended when the former beckoned to the cockswain to follow and taking a circuit round the whole of the offices they entered the abbey together by the door through which the ladies had issued when in quest of the three prisoners as has been already relatedafter a turn or two among the narrow passages of that part of the edifice tom whose faith in the facilities of land navigation began to be a little shaken found himself following his guide through a long dark gallery that was terminated at the end toward which they were approaching by a halfopen door that admitted a glimpse into a well lighted and comfortable apartment to this door dillon hastily advanced and throwing it open the cockswain enjoyed a full view of the very scene that we described in introducing colonel howard to the acquaintance of the reader and under circumstances of great similitude the cheerful fire of coal the strong and glaring lights the tables of polished mahogany and the blushing fluids were still the same in appearance while the only perceptible change was in the number of those who partook of the cheer the master of the mansion and borroughcliffe were seated opposite to each other employed in discussing the events of the day and diligently pushing to and fro the glittering vessel that contained a portion of the generous liquor they both loved so well a task which each moment rendered lighter  if kit would but return exclaimed the veteran whose back was to the opening door bringing with him his honest brows encircled as they will be or ought to be with laurel i should be the happiest old fool borroughcliffe in his majestys realm of great britain  the captain who felt the necessity for the unnatural restraint he had imposed on his thirst to be removed by the capture of his enemies pointed towards the door with one hand while he grasped the sparkling reservoir of the south side with the other and answered  lo the cacique himself his brow inviting the diademha who have we in his highness train by the lord sir cacique if you travel with a bodyguard of such grenadiers old frederick of prussia himself will have occasion to envy you the corps a clear sixfooter in natures stockings and the arms as unique as the armed  the colonel did not however attend to half of his companions exclamations but turning he beheld the individual he had so much desired and received him with a delight proportioned to the unexpectedness of the pleasure for several minutes dillon was compelled to listen to the rapid questions of his venerable relative to all of which he answered with a prudent reserve that might in some measure have been governed by the presence of the cockswain tom stood with infinite composure leaning on his harpoon and surveying with a countenance where wonder was singularly blended with contempt the furniture and arrangements of an apartment that was far more splendid than any he had before seen in the mean time borroughcliffe entirely disregarded the private communications that passed between his host and dillon which gradually became more deeply interesting and finally drew them to a distant corner of the apartment but taking a most undue advantage of the absence of the gentleman who had so lately been his boon companion he swallowed one potation after another as if a double duty had devolved on him in consequence of the desertion of the veteran whenever his eye did wander from the ruby tints of his glass it was to survey with unrepressed admiration the inches of the cockswain about whose stature and frame there were numberless excellent points to attract the gaze of a recruiting officer from this double pleasure the captain was however at last summoned to participate in the councils of his friends  dillon was spared the disagreeable duty of repeating the artful tale he had found it necessary to palm on the colonel by the ardor of the veteran himself who executed the task in a manner that gave to the treachery of his kinsman every appearance of a justifiable artifice and of unshaken zeal in the cause of his prince in substance tom was to be detained as a prisoner and the party of barnstable were to be entrapped and of course to share a similar fate the sunken eye of dillon cowered before the steady gaze which borroughcliffe fastened on him as the latter listened to the plaudits the colonel lavished on his cousins ingenuity but the hesitation that lingered in the soldiers manner vanished when he turned to examine their unsuspecting prisoner who was continuing his survey of the apartment while he innocently imagined the consultations he witnessed were merely the proper and preparatory steps to his admission into the presence of mr griffith  drill said borroughcliffe aloud advance and receive your orders the cockswain turned quickly at this sudden mandate and for the first time perceived that he had been followed into the gallery by the orderly and two files of the recruits armed take this man to the guardroom and feed him and see that he dies not of thirst  there was nothing alarming in this order and tom was following the soldiers in obedience to a gesture from their captain when their steps were arrested in the gallery by the cry of halt  on recollection drill said borroughcliffe in a tone from which all dictatorial sounds were banished show the gentleman into my own room and see him properly supplied  the orderly gave such an intimation of his comprehending the meaning of his officer as the latter was accustomed to receive when borroughcliffe returned to his bottle and the cockswain followed his guide with an alacrity and good will that were not a little increased by the repeated mention of the cheer that awaited him  luckily for the impatience of tom the quarters of the captain were at hand and the promised entertainment by no means slow in making its appearance the former was an apartment that opened from a lesser gallery which communicated with the principal passage already mentioned and the latter was a bountiful but ungarnished supply of that staple of the british isles called roast beef of which the kitchen of colonel howard was never without a due and loyal provisionthe sergeant who certainly understood one of the signs of his captain to imply an attack on the citadel of the cockswains brain mingled with his own hands a potation that he styled a rummer of grog and which he thought would have felled the animal itself that tom was so diligently masticating had it been alive and in its vigor every calculation that was made on the infirmity of the cockswains intellect under the stimulus of jamaica was however futile he swallowed glass after glass with prodigious relish but at the same time with immovable steadiness and the eyes of the sergeant who felt it incumbent to do honor to his own cheer were already glistening in his head when happily for the credit of his heart a tap at the door announced the presence of his captain and relieved him from the impending disgrace of being drunk blind by a recruit  as borroughcliffe entered the apartment he commanded his orderly to retire adding  mr dillon will give you instructions which you are implicitly to obey  drill who had sense enough remaining to apprehend the displeasure of his officer should the latter discover his condition quickened his departure and the cockswain soon found himself alone with the captain the vigor of toms attacks on the remnant of the sirloin was now much abated leaving in its stead that placid quiet which is apt to linger about the palate long after the cravings of the appetite have been appeased he had seated himself on one of the trunks of borroughcliffe utterly disdaining the use of a chair and with the trencher in his lap was using his own jackknife on the dilapidated fragment of the ox with something of that nicety with which the female ghoul of the arabian tales might be supposed to pick her rice with the point of her bodkin the captain drew a seat nigh the cockswain and with a familiarity and kindness infinitely condescending when the difference in their several conditions is considered he commenced the following dialogue  i hope you have found your entertainment to your liking mr aai must own my ignorance of your name  tom said the cockswain keeping his eyes roaming over the contents of the trencher commonly called long tom by my shipmates  you have sailed with discreet men and able navigators it will seem as they understood longitude so well rejoined the captain but you have a patronymici would say another name  coffin returned the cockswain im called tom when there is any hurry such as letting go the haulyards or a sheet long tom when they want to get to windward of an old seaman by fair weather and long tom coffin when they wish to hail me so that none of my cousins of the same name about the islands shall answer for i believe the best man among them cant measure much over a fathom taking him from his headworks to his heel  you are a most deserving fellow cried borroughcliffe and it is painful to think to what a fate the treachery of mr dillon has consigned you  the suspicions of tom if he ever entertained any were lulled to rest too effectually by the kindness he had received to be awakened by this equivocal lament he therefore after renewing his intimacy with the rummer contented himself by saying with a satisfied simplicity  i am consigned to no one carrying no cargo but this mr dillon who is to give me mr griffith in exchange or go back to the ariel himself as my prisoner  ah my good friend i fear you will find when the time comes to make this exchange that he will refuse to do either  but ill be dd if he dont do one of them my orders are to see it done and back he goes or mr griffith who is as good a seaman for his years as ever trod a deck slips his cable from this here anchorage  borroughcliffe affected to eye his companion with great commiseration an exhibition of compassion that was however completely lost on the cockswain whose nerves were strung to their happiest tension by his repeated libations while his wit was if anything quickened by the same cause though his own want of guile rendered him slow to comprehend its existence in others perceiving it necessary to speak plainly the captain renewed the attack in a more direct manner  i am sorry to say that you will not be permitted to return to the ariel and that your commander mr barnstable will be a prisoner within the hour and in fact that your schooner will be taken before the morning breaks  wholl take her asked the cockswain with a grim smile on whose feelings however this combination of threatened calamities was beginning to make some impression  you must remember that she lies immediately under the heavy guns of a battery that can sink her in a few minutes an express has already been sent to acquaint the commander of the work with the ariels true character and as the wind has already begun to blow from the ocean her escape is impossible  the truth together with its portentous consequences now began to glare across the faculties of the cockswain he remembered his own prognostics on the weather and the helpless situation of the schooner deprived of more than half her crew and left to the keeping of a boy while her commander himself was on the eve of captivity the trencher fell from his lap to the floor his head sunk on his knees his face was concealed between his broad palms and in spite of every effort the old seaman could make to conceal his emotion he fairly groaned aloud  for a moment the better feelings of borroughcliffe prevailed and he paused as he witnessed this exhibition of suffering in one whose head was already sprinkled with the marks of time but his habits and the impressions left by many years passed in collecting victims for the wars soon resumed their ascendency and the recruiting officer diligently addressed himself to an improvement of his advantage  i pity from my heart the poor lads whom artifice or mistaken notions of duty may have led astray and who will thus be taken in arms against their sovereign but as they are found in the very island of britain they must be made examples to deter others i fear that unless they can make their peace with government they will all be condemned to death  let them make their peace with god then your government can do but little to clear the logaccount of a man whose watch is up for this world  but by making their peace with those who have the power their lives may be spared said the captain watching with keen eyes the effect his words produced on the cockswain  it matters but little when a man hears the messenger pipe his hammock down for the last time he keeps his watch in another world though he goes below in this but to see wood and iron that has been put together after such moulds as the ariels go into strange hands is a blow that a man may remember long after the pursers books have been squared against his name for ever i would rather that twenty shot should strike my old carcass than one should hull the schooner that didnt pass out above her waterline  borroughcliffe replied somewhat carelessly i may be mistaken after all and instead of putting any of you to death they may place you all on board the prisonships where you may yet have a merry time of it these ten or fifteen years to come  hows that shipmate cried the cockswain with a start a prison ship dye say you may tell them they can save the expense of one mans rations by hanging him if they please and that is old tom coffin  there is no answering for their caprice today they may order a dozen of you to be shot for rebels tomorrow they may choose to consider you as prisoners of war and send you to the hulks for a dozen years  tell them brother that im a rebel will ye and yell tell em no lieone that has fout them since manlys time in boston bay to this hour i hope the boy will blow her up it would be the death of poor richard barnstable to see her in the hands of the english  i know of one way said borroughcliffe affecting to muse and but one that will certainly avert the prisonship for on second thoughts they will hardly put you to death  name it friend cried the cockswain rising from his seat in evident perturbation and if it lies in the power of man it shall be done  nay said the captain dropping his hand familiarly on the shoulder of the other who listened with the most eager attention tis easily done and no dreadful thing in itself you are used to gunpowder and know its smell from otto of roses  ay ay cried the impatient old seaman i have had it flashing under my nose by the hour what then  why then what i have to propose will be nothing to a man like you you found the beef wholesome and the grog mellow  ay ay all well enough but what is that to an old sailor asked the cockswain unconsciously grasping the collar of borroughcliffes coat in his agitation what then  the captain manifested no displeasure at this unexpected familiarity but with suavity as he unmasked the battery from behind which he had hitherto carried on his attacks  why then you have only to serve your king as you have before served the congressand let me be the man to show you your colors  the cockswain stared at the speaker intently but it was evident he did not clearly comprehend the nature of the proposition and the captain pursued the subject  in plain english enlist in my company my fine fellow and your life and liberty are both safe  tom did not laugh aloud for that was a burst of feeling in which he was seldom known to indulge but every feature of his weatherbeaten visage contracted into an expression of bitter ironical contempt borroughcliffe felt the iron fingers that still grasped his collar gradually tightening about his throat like a vice and as the arm slowly contracted his body was drawn by a power that it was in vain to resist close to that of the cockswain who when their faces were within a foot of each other gave vent to his emotions in words  a messmate before a shipmate a shipmate before a stranger a stranger before a dogbut a dog before a soldier  as tom concluded his nervous arm was suddenly extended to the utmost the fingers relinquishing their grasp at the same time and when borroughcliffe recovered his disordered faculties he found himself in a distant corner of the apartment prostrate among a confused pile of chairs tables and wearingapparel in endeavoring to rise from this humble posture the hand of the captain fell on the hilt of his sword which had been included in the confused assemblage of articles produced by his overthrow  how now scoundrel he cried baring the glittering weapon and springing on his feet you must be taught your distance i perceive  the cockswain seized the harpoon which leaned against the wall and dropped its barbed extremity within a foot of the breast of his assailant with an expression of the eye that denoted the danger of a nearer approach the captain however wanted not for courage and stung to the quick by the insult he had received he made a desperate parry and attempted to pass within the point of the novel weapon of his adversary the slight shock was followed by a sweeping whirl of the harpoon and borroughchffe found himself without arms completely at the mercy of his foe the bloody intentions of tom vanished with his success for laying aside his weapon he advanced upon his antagonist and seized him with an open palm one more struggle in which the captain discovered his incompetency to make any defence against the strength of a man who managed him as if he had been a child decided the matter when the captain was passive in the hands of his foe the cockswain produced sundry pieces of sennit marline and ratlinstuff from his pockets which appeared to contain as great a variety of small cordage as a boatswains storeroom and proceeded to lash the arms of the conquered soldier to the posts of his bed with a coolness that had not been disturbed since the commencement of hostilities a silence that seemed inflexible and a dexterity that none but a seaman could equal when this part of his plan was executed tom paused a moment and gazed around him as if in quest of something the naked sword caught his eye and with this weapon in his hand he deliberately approached his captive whose alarm prevented his observing that the cockswain had snapped the blade asunder from the handle and that he had already encircled the latter with marline  for gods sake exclaimed borroughcliffe murder me not in cold blood  the silver hilt entered his mouth as the words issued from it and the captain found while the line was passed and repassed in repeated involutions across the back of his neck that he was in a condition to which he often subjected his own men when unruly and which is universally called being gagged the cockswain now appeared to think himself entitled to all the privileges of a conqueror for taking the light in his hand he commenced a scrutiny into the nature and quality of the worldly effects that lay at his mercy sundry articles that belonged to the equipments of a soldier were examined and cast aside with great contempt and divers garments of plainer exterior were rejected as unsuited to the frame of the victor he however soon encountered two articles of a metal that is universally understood but uncertainty as to their use appeared greatly to embarrass him the circular prongs of these curiosities were applied to either hand to the wrists and even to the nose and the little wheels at their opposite extremity were turned and examined with as much curiosity and care as a savage would expend on a watch until the idea seemed to cross the mind of the honest seaman that they formed part of the useless trappings of a military man and he cast them aside also as utterly worthless borroughcliffe who watched every movement of his conqueror with a goodhumor that would have restored perfect harmony between them could he but have expressed half what he felt witnessed the safety of a favorite pair of spurs with much pleasure though nearly suffocated by the mirth that was unnaturally repressed at length the cockswain found a pair of handsomely mounted pistols a sort of weapon with which he seemed quite familiar they were loaded and the knowledge of that fact appeared to remind tom of the necessity of departing by bringing to his recollection the danger of his commander and of the ariel he thrust the weapons into the canvas belt that encircled his body and grasping his harpoon approached the bed where borroughcliffe was seated in duresse  harkye friend said the cockswain may the lord forgive you as i do for wishing to make a soldier of a seafaring man and one who has followed the waters since he was an hour old and one who hopes to die off soundings and to be buried in brine i wish you no harm friend but youll have to keep a stopper on your conversation till such time as some of your messmates call in this way which i hope will be as soon after i get an offing as may be  with these amicable wishes the cockswain departed leaving borroughcliffe the light and the undisturbed possession of his apartment though not in the most easy or the most enviable situation imaginable the captain heard the bolt of his lock turn and the key rattle as the cockswain withdrew it from the doortwo precautionary steps which clearly indicated that the vanquisher deemed it prudent to secure his retreat by insuring the detention of the vanquished for at least a time     chapter xxiii    whilst vengeance in the lurid air   lifts her red arm exposed and bare   who fear this ghastly train can see   and look not madly wild like thee   collins   it is certain that tom coffin had devised no settled plan of operations when he issued from the apartment of borroughcliffe if we except a most resolute determination to make the best of his way to the ariel and to share her fate let it be either to sink or swim but this was a resolution much easier formed by the honest seaman than executed in his present situation he would have found it less difficult to extricate a vessel from the dangerous shoals of the devils grip than to thread the mazes of the labyrinth of passages galleries and apartments in which he found himself involved he remembered as he expressed it to himself in a low soliloquy to have run into a narrow passage from the main channel but whether he had sheered to the starboard or larboard hand was a material fact that had entirely escaped his memory tom was in that part of the building that colonel howard had designated as the cloisters and in which luckily for him he was but little liable to encounter any foe the room occupied by borroughcliffe being the only one in the entire wing that was not exclusively devoted to the service of the ladies the circumstance of the soldiers being permitted to invade this sanctuary was owing to the necessity on the part of colonel howard of placing either griffith manual or the recruiting officer in the vicinity of his wards or of subjecting his prisoners to a treatment that the veteran would have thought unworthy of his name and character this recent change in the quarters of borroughcliffe operated doubly to the advantage of tom by lessening the chance of the speedy release of his uneasy captive as well as by diminishing his own danger of the former circumstance he was however not aware and the consideration of the latter was a sort of reflection to which the cockswain was in no degree addicted  following necessarily the line of the wall he soon emerged from the dark and narrow passage in which he had first found himself and entered the principal gallery that communicated with all the lower apartments of that wing as well as with the main body of the edifice an open door through which a strong light was glaring at a distant end of this gallery instantly caught his eye and the old seaman had not advanced many steps towards it before he discovered that he was approaching the very room which had so much excited his curiosity and by the identical passage through which he had entered the abbey to turn and retrace his steps was the most obvious course for any man to take who felt anxious to escape but the sounds of high conviviality bursting from the cheerful apartment among which the cockswain thought he distinguished the name of griffith determined tom to advance and reconnoitre the scene more closely the reader will anticipate that when he paused in the shadow the doubting old seaman stood once more near the threshold which he had so lately crossed when conducted to the room of borroughcliffe the seat of that gentleman was now occupied by dillon and colonel howard had resumed his wonted station at the foot of the table the noise was chiefly made by the latter who had evidently been enjoying a more minute relation of the means by which his kinsman had entrapped his unwary enemy  a noble ruse cried the veteran as tom assumed his post in ambush a most noble and ingenious ruse and such a one as would have baffled caesar he must have been a cunning dog that caesar but i do think kit you would have been too much for him hang me if i dont think you would have puzzled wolfe himself had you held quebec instead of montcalm ah boy we want you in the colonies with the ermine over your shoulders such men as you cousin christopher are sadly sadly wanted there to defend his majestys rights  indeed dear sir your partiality gives me credit for qualities i do not possess said dillon dropping his eyes perhaps with a feeling of conscious unworthiness but with an air of much humility the little justifiable artifice  ay there lies the beauty of the transaction interrupted the colonel shoving the bottle from him with the free open air of a man who never harbored disguise you told no lie no mean deception that any dog however base and unworthy might invent but you practised a neat a military aayes a classical deception on your enemy a classical deception that is the very term for it such a deception as pompey or mark antony ororyou know those old fellows names better than i do kit but name the cleverest fellow that ever lived in greece or rome and i shall say he is a dunce compared to you twas a real spartan trick both simple and honest  it was extremely fortunate for dillon that the animation of his aged kinsman kept his head and body in such constant motion during this apostrophe as to intercept the aim that the cockswain was deliberately taking at his head with one of borroughcliffes pistols and perhaps the sense of shame which induced him to sink his face on his hands was another means of saving his life by giving the indignant old seaman time for reflection  but you have not spoken of the ladies said dillon after a moments pause i should hope they have borne the alarm of the day like kinswomen of the family of howard  the colonel glanced his eyes around him as if to assure himself they were alone and dropped his voice as he answered  ah kit they have come to since this rebel scoundrel griffith has been brought into the abbey we were favored with the company of even miss howard in the diningroom today there was a good deal of dear uncleing and fears that my life might be exposed by the quarrels and skirmishes of these desperadoes who have landed as if an old fellow who served through the whole war from 56 to 63 was afraid to let his nose smell gunpowder any more than if it were snuff but it will be a hard matter to wheedle an old soldier out of his allegiance this griffith goes to the tower at least mr dillon  it would be advisable to commit his person to the civil authority without delay  to the constable of the tower the earl cornwallis a good and loyal nobleman who is at this moment fighting the rebels in my own native province christopher interrupted the colonel that will be what i call retributive justice but continued the veteran rising with an air of gentlemanly dignity it will not do to permit even the constable of the tower of london to surpass the master of st ruth in hospitality and kindness to his prisoners i have ordered suitable refreshments to their apartments and it is incumbent on me to see that my commands have been properly obeyed arrangements must also be made for the reception of this captain barnstable who will doubtless soon be here  within the hour at farthest said dillon looking uneasily at his watch  we must be stirring boy continued the colonel moving towards the door that led to the apartments of his prisoners but there is a courtesy due to the ladies as well as to those unfortunate violators of the lawsgo christopher convey my kindest wishes to cecilia she dont deserve them the obstinate vixen but then she is my brother harrys child and while there you arch dog plead your own cause mark antony was a fool to you at a ruse and yet mark was one of your successful suitors too there was that queen of the pyramids  the door closed on the excited veteran at these words and dillon was left standing by himself at the side of the table musing as if in doubt whether to venture on the step that his kinsman had proposed or not  the greater part of the preceding discourse was unintelligible to the cockswain who had waited its termination with extraordinary patience in hopes he might obtain some information that he could render of service to the captives before he had time to decide on what was now best for him to do dillon suddenly determined to venture himself in the cloisters and swallowing a couple of glasses of wine in a breath he passed the hesitating cockswain who was concealed by the opening door so closely as to brush his person and moved down the gallery with those rapid strides which men who act under the impulse of forced resolutions are very apt to assume as if to conceal their weakness from themselvestom hesitated no longer but aiding the impulse given to the door by dillon as he passed so as to darken the passage he followed the sounds of the others footsteps while he trod in the manner already described the stone pavement of the gallery dillon paused an instant at the turning that led to the room of borroughcliffe but whether irresolute which way to urge his steps or listening to the incautious and heavy tread of the cockswain is not known if the latter he mistook them for the echoes of his own footsteps and moved forward again without making any discovery  the light tap which dillon gave on the door of the withdrawingroom of the cloisters was answered by the soft voice of cecilia howard herself who bid the applicant enter there was a slight confusion evident in the manner of the gentleman as he complied with the bidding and in its hesitancy the door was for an instant neglected  i come miss howard said dillon by the commands of your uncle and permit me to add by my own  may heaven shield us exclaimed cecilia clasping her hands in affright and rising involuntarily from her couch are we too to be imprisoned and murdered  surely miss howard will not impute to me dillon paused observing that the wild looks not only of cecilia but of katherine and alice dunscombe also were directed at some other object and turning to his manifest terror he beheld the gigantic frame of the cockswain surmounted by an iron visage fixed in settled hostility in possession of the only passage from the apartment  if theres murder to be done said tom after surveying the astonished group with a stern eye its as likely this here liar will be the one to do it as another but you have nothing to fear from a man who has followed the seas too long and has grappled with too many monsters both fish and flesh not to know how to treat a helpless woman none who know him will say that thomas coffin ever used uncivil language or unseamanlike conduct to any of his mothers kind  coffin exclaimed katherine advancing with a more confident air from the corner into which terror had driven her with her companions  ay coffin continued the old sailor his grim features gradually relaxing as he gazed on her bright looks tis a solemn word but its a word that passes over the shoals among the islands and along the cape oftener than any other my father was a coffin and my mother was a joy and the two names can count more flukes than all the rest in the island together though the worths and the garners and the swaines dart better harpoons and set truer lances than any men who come from the weatherside of the atlantic  katherine listened to this digression in honor of the whalers of nantucket with marked complacency and when he concluded she repeated slowly  coffin this then is long tom  ay ay long tom and no sham in the name either returned the cockswain suffering the stern indignation that had lowered around his hard visage to relax into a low laugh as he gazed on her animated features the lord bless your smiling face and bright black eyes young madam you have heard of old long tom then most likely twas something about the blow he strikes at the fishah im old and im stiff now young madam but afore i was nineteen i stood at the head of the dance at a ball on the cape and that with a partner almost as handsome as yourselfay and this was after i had three broad flukes loggd against my name  no said katherine advancing in her eagerness a step or two nigher to the old tar her cheeks flushing while she spoke i had heard of you as an instructor in a seamans duty as the faithful cockswain nay i may say as the devoted companion and friend of mr richard barnstable but perhaps you come now as the bearer of some message or letter from that gentleman  the sound of his commanders name suddenly revived the recollection of coffin and with it all the fierce sternness of his manner returned bending his eyes keenly on the cowering form of dillon he said in those deep harsh tones that seem peculiar to men who have braved the elements until they appear to have imbided some of their roughest qualities  liar how now what brought old tom coffin into these shoals and narrow channels was it a letter ha but by the lord that maketh the winds to blow and teacheth the lost mariner how to steer over the wide waters you shall sleep this night villain on the planks of the ariel and if it be the will of god that beautiful piece of handicraft is to sink at her moorings like a worthless hulk ye shall still sleep in her ay and a sleep that shall not end till they call all hands to foot up the days work of this life at the close of mans longest voyage  the extraordinary vehemence the language the attitude of the old seaman commanding in its energy and the honest indignation that shone in every look of his keen eyes together with the nature of the address and its paralyzing effect on dillon who quailed before it like the stricken deer united to keep the female listeners for many moments silent through amazement during this brief period tom advanced upon his nerveless victim and lashing his arms together behind his back he fastened him by a strong cord to the broad canvas belt that he constantly wore around his own body leaving to himself by this arrangement the free use of his arms and weapons of offence while he secured his captive  surely said cecilia recovering her recollection the first of the astonished group mr barnstable has not commissioned you to offer this violence to my uncles kinsman under the roof of colonel howardmiss plowden your friend has strangely forgotten himself in this transaction if this man acts in obedience to his order  my friend my cousin howard returned katharine would never commission his cockswain or any one to do an unworthy deed speak honest sailor why do you commit this outrage on the worthy mr dillon colonel howards kinsman and a cupboard cousin of st ruths abbey  nay katherine  nay cecilia be patient and let the stranger have utterance he may solve the difficulty altogether  the cockswain understanding that an explanation was expected from his lips addressed himself to the task with an energy suitable both to the subject and to his own feelings in a very few words though a little obscured by his peculiar diction he made his listeners understand the confidence that barnstable had reposed in dillon and the treachery of the latter they heard him with increased astonishment and cecilia hardly allowed him time to conclude before she exclaimed  and did colonel howard could colonel howard listen to this treacherous project  ay they spliced it together among them returned tom though one part of this cruise will turn out but badly  even borroughcliffe cold and hardened as he appears to be by habit would spurn at such dishonor added miss howard  but mr barnstable at length katherine succeeded in saying when her feelings permitted her utterance said you not that soldiers were in quest of him  ay ay young madam the cockswain replied smiling with grim ferocity they are in chase but he has shifted his anchorage and even if they should find him his long pikes would make short work of a dozen redcoats the lord of tempests and calms have mercy though on the schooner ah young madam she is as lovely to the eyes of an old seafaring man as any of your kind can be to human nature  but why this delayaway then honest tom and reveal the treachery to your commander you may not yet be too latewhy delay a moment  the ship tarries for want of a piloti could carry three fathom over the shoals of nantucket the darkest night that ever shut the windows of heaven but i should be likely to run upon breakers in this navigation as it was i was near getting into company that i should have had to fight my way out of  if that be all follow me cried the ardent katherine i will conduct you to a path that leads to the ocean without approaching the sentinels  until this moment dillon had entertained a secret expectation of a rescue but when he heard this proposal he felt his blood retreating to his heart from every part of his agitated frame and his last hope seemed wrested from him raising himself from the abject shrinking attitude in which both shame and dread had conspired to keep him as though he had been fettered to the spot he approached cecilia and cried in tones of horror  do not do not consent miss howard to abandon me to the fury of this man your uncle your honorable uncle even now applauded and united with me in my enterprise which is no more than a common artifice in war  my uncle would unite mr dillon in no project of deliberate treachery like this said cecilia coldly  he did i swear by  liar interrupted the deep tones of the cockswain  dillon shivered with agony and terror while the sounds of this appalling voice sunk into his inmost soul but as the gloom of the night the secret ravines of the cliffs and the turbulence of the ocean flashed across his imagination he again yielded to a dread of the horrors to which he should be exposed in encountering them at the mercy of his powerful enemy and he continued his solicitations  hear me once more hear memiss howard i beseech you hear me am i not of your own blood and country will you see me abandoned to the wild merciless malignant fury of this man who will transfix me with thatoh god if you had but seen the sight i beheld in the alacrity hear me miss howard for the love you bear your maker intercede for me mr griffith shall be released  liar again interrupted the cockswain  what promises he asked cecilia turning her averted face once more at the miserable captive  nothing at all that will be fulfilled said katherine follow honest tom and i at least will conduct you in good faith  cruel obdurate miss plowden gentle kind miss alice you will not refuse to raise your voice in my favor your heart is not hardened by any imaginary dangers to those you love  nay address not me said alice bending her meek eyes to the floor i trust your life is in no danger and i pray that he who has the power will have the mercy to see you unharmed  away said tom grasping the collar of the helpless dillon and rather carrying than leading him into the gallery if a sound onequarter as loud as a young porpoise makes when he draws his first breath comes from you villain you shall see the sight of the alacrity over again my harpoon keeps its edge well and the old arm can yet drive it to the seizing  this menace effectually silenced even the hard perturbed breathings of the captive who with his conductor followed the light steps of katherine through some of the secret mazes of the building until in a few minutes they issued through a small door into the open air without pausing to deliberate miss plowden led the cockswain through the grounds to a different wicket from the one by which he had entered the paddock and pointing to the path which might be dimly traced along the faded herbage she bade god bless him in a voice that discovered her interest in his safety and vanished from his sight like an aerial being  tom needed no incentive to his speed now that his course lay so plainly before him but loosening his pistols in his belt and poising his harpoon he crossed the fields at a gait that compelled his companion to exert his utmost powers in the way of walking to equal once or twice dillon ventured to utter a word or two but a stern silence from the cockswain warned him to cease until perceiving that they were approaching the cliffs he made a final effort to obtain his liberty by hurriedly promising a large bribe the cockswain made no reply and the captive was secretly hoping that his scheme was producing its wonted effects when he unexpectedly felt the keen cold edge of the barbed iron of the harpoon pressing against his breast through the opening of his ruffles and even raising the skin  liar said tom another word and ill drive it through your heart  from that moment dillon was as silent as the grave they reached the edge of the cliffs without encountering the party that had been sent in quest of barnstable and at a point near where they had landed the old seaman paused an instant on the verge of the precipice and cast his experienced eyes along the wide expanse of water that lay before him the sea was no longer sleeping but already in heavy motion and rolling its surly waves against the base of the rocks on which he stood scattering their white crests high in foam the cockswain after bending his looks along the whole line of the eastern horizon gave utterance to a low and stifled groan and then striking the staff of his harpoon violently against the earth he pursued his way along the very edge of the cliffs muttering certain dreadful denunciations which the conscience of his appalled listener did not fail to apply to himself it appeared to the latter that his angry and excited leader sought the giddy verge of the precipice with a sort of wanton recklessness so daring were the steps that he took along its brow notwithstanding the darkness of the hour and the violence of the blasts that occasionally rushed by them leaving behind a kind of reaction that more than once brought the life of the manacled captive in imminent jeopardy but it would seem the wary cockswain had a motive for this apparently inconsiderate desperation when they had made good quite half the distance between the point where barnstable had landed and that where he had appointed to meet his cockswain the sounds of voices were brought indistinctly to their ears in one of the momentary pauses of the rushing winds and caused the cockswain to make a dead stand in his progress he listened intently for a single minute when his resolution appeared to be taken he turned to dillon and spoke though his voice was suppressed and low it was deep and resolute  one word and you die over the cliffs you must take a seamans ladder there is footing on the rocks and crags for your hands over the cliff i bid ye or ill cast ye into the sea as i would a dead enemy  mercy mercy implored dillon i could not do it in the day by this light i shall surely perish  over with ye said tom or  dillon waited for no more but descended with trembling steps the dangerous precipice that lay before him he was followed by the cockswain with a haste that unavoidably dislodged his captive from the trembling stand he had taken on the shelf of a rock who to his increased horror found himself dangling in the air his body impending over the sullen surf that was tumbling in with violence upon the rocks beneath him an involuntary shriek burst from dillon as he felt his person thrust from the narrow shelf and his cry sounded amidst the tempest like the screechings of the spirit of the storm  another such a call and i cut your towline villain said the determined seaman when nothing short of eternity will bring you up  the sounds of footsteps and voices were now distinctly audible and presently a party of armed men appeared on the edges of the rocks directly above them  it was a human voice said one of them and like a man in distress  it cannot be the men we are sent in search of returned sergeant drill for no watchword that i ever heard sounded like that cry  they say that such cries are often heard in storms along this coast said a voice that was uttered with less of military confidence than the two others and they are thought to come from drowned seamen  a feeble laugh arose among the listeners and one or two forced jokes were made at the expense of their superstitious comrade but the scene did not fail to produce its effect on even the most sturdy among the unbelievers in the marvelous for after a few more similar remarks the whole party retired from the cliffs at a pace that might have been accelerated by the nature of their discourse the cockswain who had stood all this time firm as the rock which supported him bearing up not only his own weight but the person of dillon also raised his head above the brow of the precipice as they withdrew to reconnoitre and then drawing up the nearly insensible captive and placing him in safety on the bank he followed himself not a moment was wasted in unnecessary explanations but dillon found himself again urged forward with the same velocity as before in a few minutes they gained the desired ravine down which tom plunged with a seamans nerve dragging his prisoner after him and directly they stood where the waves rose to their feet as they flowed far and foaming across the sandsthe cockswain stooped so low as to bring the crest of the billows in a line with the horizon when he discovered the dark boat playing in the outer edge of the surf  what hoa ariels there shouted tom in a voice that the growing tempest carried to the ears of the retreating soldiers who quickened their footsteps as they listened to sounds which their fears taught them to believe supernatural  who hails cried the wellknown voice of barnstable  once your master now your servant answered the cockswain with a watchword of his own invention  tis he returned the lieutenant veer away boys veer away you must wade into the surf  tom caught dillon in his arms and throwing him like a cork across his shoulder he dashed into the streak of foam that was bearing the boat on its crest and before his companion had time for remonstrance or entreaty he found himself once more by the side of barnstable  who have we here asked the lieutenant this is not griffith  haul out and weigh your grapnel said the excited cockswain and then boys if you love the ariel pull while the life and the will is left in you  barnstable knew his man and not another question was asked until the boat was without the breakers now skimming the rounded summits of the waves or settling into the hollows of the seas but always cutting the waters asunder as she urged her course with amazing velocity towards the haven where the schooner had been left at anchor then in a few but bitter sentences the cockswain explained to his commander the treachery of dillon and the danger of the schooner  the soldiers are slow at a night muster tom concluded and from what i overheard the express will have to make a crooked course to double the head of the bay so that but for this northeaster we might weather upon them yet but its a matter that lies altogether in the will of providence pull my hearties pulleverything depends on your oars to night  barnstable listened in deep silence to this unexpected narration which sounded in the ears of dillon like his funeral knell at length the suppressed voice of the lieutenant was heard also uttering  wretch if i should cast you into the sea as food for the fishes who could blame me but if my schooner goes to the bottom she shall prove your coffin     chapter xxiv    had i been any god of power i would   have sunk the sea within the earth ere   it should the good ship so have swallowed   tempest   the arms of dillon were released from their confinement by the cockswain as a measure of humane caution against accidents when they entered the surf and the captive now availed himself of the circumstance to bury his features in the folds of his attire when he brooded over the events of the last few hours with that mixture of malignant passion and pusillanimous dread of the future that formed the chief ingredients in his character from this state of apparent quietude neither barnstable nor tom seemed disposed to rouse him by their remarks for both were too much engaged with their own gloomy forebodings to indulge in any unnecessary words an occasional ejaculation from the former as if to propitiate the spirit of the storm as he gazed on the troubled appearance of the elements or a cheering cry from the latter to animate his crew alone were heard amid the sullen roaring of the waters and the mournful whistling of the winds that swept heavily across the broad waste of the german ocean there might have been an hour consumed thus in a vigorous struggle between the seamen and the growing billows when the boat doubled the northern headland of the desired haven and shot at once from its boisterous passage along the margin of the breakers into the placid waters of the sequestered bay the passing blasts were still heard rushing above the high lands that surrounded and in fact formed the estuary but the profound stillness of deep night pervaded the secret recesses along the unruffled surface of its waters the shadows of the hills seemed to have accumulated like a mass of gloom in the centre of the basin and though every eye involuntarily turned to search it was in vain that the anxious seamen endeavored to discover their little vessel through its density while the boat glided into this quiet scene barnstable anxiously observed  everything is as still as death  god send it is not the stillness of death ejaculated the cockswain here here he continued speaking in a lower tone as if fearful of being overheard here she lies sir more to port look into the streak of clear sky above the marsh on the starboard hand of the wood there that long black line is her maintopmast i know it by the rake and there is her nightpennant fluttering about that bright star ay ay sir there go our own stars aloft yet dancing among the stars in the heavens god bless her god bless her she rides as easy and as quiet as a gull asleep  i believe all in her sleep too returned his commander ha by heaven we have arrived in good time the soldiers are moving  the quick eye of barnstable had detected the glimmering of passing lanterns as they flitted across the embrasures of the battery and at the next moment the guarded but distinct sounds of an active bustle on the decks of the schooner were plainly audible the lieutenant was rubbing his hands together with a sort of ecstasy that probably will not be understood by the great majority of our readers while long tom was actually indulging in a paroxysm of his low spiritless laughter as these certain intimations of the safety of the ariel and of the vigilance of her crew were conveyed to their ears when the whole hull and taper spars of their floating home became unexpectedly visible and the sky the placid basin and the adjacent hills were illuminated by a flash as sudden and as vivid as the keenest lightning both barnstable and his cockswain seemed instinctively to strain their eyes towards the schooner with an effort to surpass human vision but ere the rolling reverberations of the report of a heavy piece of ordnance from the heights had commenced the dull whistling rush of the shot swept over their heads like the moaning of a hurricane and was succeeded by the plash of the waters which was followed in a breath by the rattling of the mass of iron as it bounded with violent fury from rock to rock shivering and tearing the fragments that lined the margin of the bay  a bad aim with the first gun generally leaves your enemy clean decks said the cockswain with his deliberate sort of philosophy smoke makes but dim spectacles besides the night always grows darkest as you call off the morning watch  that boy is a miracle for his years rejoined the delighted lieutenant see tom the younker has shifted his berth in the dark and the englishmen have fired by the dayrange they must have taken for we left him in a direct line between the battery and yon hummock what would have become of us if that heavy fellow had plunged upon our decks and gone out below the waterline  we should have sunk into english mud for eternity as sure as our metal and kentledge would have taken us down responded tom such a pointblanker would have torn off a streak of our wales outboard and not even left the marines time to say a prayertend bow there  it is not to be supposed that the crew of the whaleboat continued idle during this interchange of opinions between the lieutenant and his cockswain on the contrary the sight of their vessel acted on them like a charm and believing that all necessity for caution was now over they had expended their utmost strength in efforts that had already brought them as the last words of tom indicated to the side of the ariel though every nerve of barnstable was thrilling with the excitement produced by his feelings passing from a state of the most doubtful apprehension to that of a revived and almost confident hope of effecting his escape he assumed the command of his vessel with all that stern but calm authority that seamen find is most necessary to exert in the moments of extremest danger any one of the heavy shot that their enemies continued to hurl from their heights into the darkness of the haven he well knew must prove fatal to them as it would unavoidably pass through the slight fabric of the ariel and open a passage to the water that no means he possessed could remedyhis mandates were therefore issued with a full perception of the critical nature of the emergency but with that collectedness of manner and intonation of voice that were best adapted to enforce a ready and animated obedience under this impulse the crew of the schooner soon got their anchor freed from the bottom and seizing their sweeps they forced her by their united efforts directly in the face of the battery under that shore whose summit was now crowned with a canopy of smoke that every discharge of the ordnance tinged with dim colors like the faintest tints that are reflected from the clouds towards a setting sun so long as the seamen were enabled to keep their little bark under the cover of the hill they were of course safe but barnstable perceived as they emerged from its shadow and were drawing nigh the passage which led into the ocean that the action of his sweeps would no longer avail them against the currents of air they encountered neither would the darkness conceal their movements from his enemy who had already employed men on the shore to discern the position of the schooner throwing off at once therefore all appearance of disguise he gave forth the word to spread the canvas of his vessel in his ordinary cheerful manner  let them do their worst now merry he added we have brought them to a distance that i think will keep their iron above water and we have no dodge about us younker  it must be keener marksmen than the militia or volunteers or fencibles or whatever they call themselves behind yon grassbank to frighten the saucy ariel from the wind returned the reckless boy but why have you brought jonah aboard us again sir look at him by the light of the cabin lamp he winks at every gun as if he expected the shot would hull his own ugly yellow physiognomy and what tidings have we sir from mr griffith and the marine  name him not said barnstable pressing the shoulder on which he lightly leaned with a convulsive grasp that caused the boy to yield with pain name him not merry i want my temper and my faculties at this moment undisturbed and thinking of the wretch unfits me for my duty but there will come a time go forward sir we feel the wind and have a narrow passage to work through  the boy obeyed a mandate which was given in the usual prompt manner of their profession and which he well understood was intended to intimate that the distance which years and rank had created between them but which barnstable often chose to forget while communing with merry was now to be resumed the sails had been loosened and set and as the vessel approached the throat of the passage the gale which was blowing with increasing violence began to make a very sensible impression on the light bark the cockswain who in the absence of most of the inferior officers had been acting on the forecastle the part of one who felt from his years and experience that he had some right to advise if not to command at such a juncture now walked to the station which his commander had taken near the helmsman as if willing to place himself in the way of being seen  well master coffin said barnstable who well understood the propensity his old shipmate had to commune with him on all important occasions what think you of the cruise now those gentlemen on the hill make a great noise but i have lost even the whistling of their shot one would think they could see our sails against the broad band of light which is opening to seaward  ay ay sir they see us and mean to hit us too but we are running across their fire and that with a tenknot breeze but when we heave in stays and get in a line with their guns we shall see and it may be feel more of their work than we do now a thirtytwo ant trained as easily as a fowlingpiece or a duckinggun  barnstable was struck with the truth of this observation but as there existed an immediate necessity for placing the schooner in the very situation to which the other alluded he gave his orders at once and the vessel came about and ran with her head pointing towards the sea in as short a time as we have taken to record it  there they have us now or never cried the lieutenant when the evolution was completed if we fetch to windward off the northern point we shall lay out into the offing and in ten minutes we might laugh at queen annes pocketpiece which you know old boy sent a ball from dover to calais  ay sir ive heard of the gun returned the grave seaman and a lively piece it must have been if the straits were always of the same width they are now but i see that captain barnstable which is more dangerous than a dozen of the heaviest cannon that were ever cast can be at half a leagues distance the water is bubbling through our lee scuppers already sir  and what of that havnt i buried her guns often and yet kept every spar in her without crack or splinter  ay ay sir you have done it and can do it again where there is sea room which is all that a man wants for comfort in this life but when we are out of these chops we shall be embayed with a heavy northeaster setting dead into the bight it is that which i fear captain barnstable more than all the powder and ball in the whole island  and yet tom the balls are not to be despised either those fellows have found out their range and send their iron within hail again we walk pretty fast mr coffin but a thirtytwo can cuttravel us with the best wind that ever blew  tom threw a cursory glance towards the battery which had renewed its fire with a spirit that denoted they saw their object as he answered  it is never worth a mans while to strive to dodge a shot for they are all commissioned to do their work the same as a ship is commissioned to cruise in certain latitudes but for the winds and the weather they are given for a seafaring man to guard against by making or shortening sail as the case may be now the headland to the southward stretches full three leagues to windward and the shoals lie to the north among which god keep us from ever running this craft again  we will beat her out of the bight old fellow cried the lieutenant we shall have a leg of three leagues in length to do it in  i have known longer legs too short returned the cockswain shaking his head a tumbling sea with a leetide on a leeshore makes a sad leeway  the lieutenant was in the act of replying to this saying with a cheerful laugh when the whistling of a passing shot was instantly succeeded by a crash of splintered wood and at the next moment the head of the mainmast after tottering for an instant in the gale fell towards the deck bringing with it the mainsail and the long line of topmast that had been bearing the emblems of america as the cockswain had expressed it among the stars of the heavens  that was a most unlucky hit barnstable suffered to escape him in the concern of the moment but instantly resuming all his collectedness of manner and voice he gave his orders to clear the wreck and secure the fluttering canvas  the mournful forebodings of tom seemed to vanish with the appearance of a necessity for his exertions and he was foremost among the crew in executing the orders of their commander the loss of all the sail on the mainmast forced the ariel so much from her course as to render it difficult to weather the point that jutted under her lee for some distance into the ocean this desirable object was however effected by the skill of barnstable aided by the excellent properties of his vessel and the schooner borne down by the power of the gale from whose fury she had now no protection passed heavily along the land heading as far as possible from the breakers while the seamen were engaged in making their preparations to display as much of their mainsail as the stump of the mast would allow them to spread the firing from the battery ceased as the ariel rounded the little promontory but barnstable whose gaze was now bent intently on the ocean soon perceived that as his cockswain had predicted he had a much more threatening danger to encounter in the elements when their damages were repaired so far as circumstances would permit the cockswain returned to his wonted station near the lieutenant and after a momentary pause during which his eyes roved over the rigging with a seamans scrutiny he resumed the discourse  it would have been better for us that the best man in the schooner should have been dubbd of a limb by that shot than that the ariel should have lost her best leg a mainsail closereefed may be prudent canvas as the wind blows but it holds a poor luff to keep a craft to windward  what would you have tom coffin retorted his commander you see she draws ahead and offshore do you expect a vessel to fly in the very teeth of the gale or would you have me ware and beach her at once  i would have nothing nothing captain barnstable returned the old seaman sensibly touched at his commanders displeasure you are as able as any man that ever trod a plank to work her into an offing but sir when that soldierofficer told me of the scheme to sink the ariel at her anchor there were such feelings come athwart my philosophy as never crossed it afore i thought i saw her a wrack as plainly ay as plainly as you may see the stump of that mast and i will own it for its as natural to love the craft you sail in as it is to love ones self i will own that my manhood fetched a heavy leelurch at the sight  away with ye ye old seacroaker forward with ye and see that the headsheets are trimmed flat but hold come hither tom if you have sights of wrecks and sharks and other beautiful objects keep them stowed in your own silly brain dont make a ghostparlor of my forecastle the lads begin to look to leeward now oftener than i would have them go sirrah go and take example from mr merry who is seated on your namesake there and is singing as if he were a chorister in his fathers church  ah captain barnstable mr merry is a boy and knows nothing so fears nothing but i shall obey your orders sir and if the men fall astarn this gale it shant be for anything theyll hear from old tom coffin  the cockswain lingered a moment notwithstanding his promised obedience and then ventured to request that  captain barnstable would please call mr merry from the gun for i know from having followed the seas my natural life that singing in a gale is sure to bring the wind down upon a vessel the heavier for he who rules the tempests is displeased that mans voice shall be heard when he chooses to send his own breath on the water  barnstable was at a loss whether to laugh at his cockswains infirmity or to yield to the impression which his earnest and solemn manner had a powerful tendency to produce amid such a scene but making an effort to shake off the superstitious awe that he felt creeping around his own heart the lieutenant relieved the mind of the worthy old seaman so far as to call the careless boy from his perch to his own side where respect for the sacred character of the quarterdeck instantly put an end to the lively air he had been humming tom walked slowly forward apparently much relieved by the reflection that he had effected so important an object  the ariel continued to struggle against the winds and ocean for several hours longer before the day broke on the tempestuous scene and the anxious mariners were enabled to form a more accurate estimate of their real danger as the violence of the gale increased the canvas of the schooner had been gradually reduced until she was unable to show more than was absolutely necessary to prevent her driving helplessly on the land barnstable watched the appearance of the weather as the light slowly opened upon them with an intense anxiety which denoted that the presentiments of the cockswain were no longer deemed idle on looking to windward he beheld the green masses of water that were rolling in towards the land with a violence that seemed irresistible crowned with ridges of foam and there were moments when the air appeared filled with sparkling gems as the rays of the rising sun fell upon the spray that was swept from wave to wave towards the land the view was still more appalling the cliffs but a short halfleague under the lee of the schooner were at all times nearly hid from the eye by the pyramids of water which the furious element so suddenly restrained in its violence cast high into the air as if seeking to overleap the boundaries that nature had fixed to its dominion the whole coast from the distant headland at the south to the wellknown shoals that stretched far beyond their course in the opposite direction displayed a broad belt of foam into which it would have been certain destruction for the proudest ship that ever swam to enter still the ariel floated on the billows lightly and in safety though yielding to the impulses of the waters and at times appearing to be engulfed in the yawning chasm which apparently opened beneath her to receive the little fabric the low rumor of acknowledged danger had found its way through the schooner and the seamen after fastening their hopeless looks on the small spot of canvas that they were still able to show to the tempest would turn to view the dreary line of coast that seemed to offer so gloomy an alternative even dillon to whom the report of their danger had found its way crept from his place of concealment in the cabin and moved about the decks unheeded devouring with greedy ears such opinions as fell from the lips of the sullen mariners  at this moment of appalling apprehension the cockswain exhibited the calmest resignation he knew all had been done that lay in the power of man to urge their little vessel from the land and it was now too evident to his experienced eyes that it had been done in vain but considering himself as a sort of fixture in the schooner he was quite prepared to abide her fate be it for better or for worse the settled look of gloom that gathered around the frank brow of barnstable was in no degree connected with any considerations of himself but proceeded from that sort of parental responsibility from which the seacommander is never exempt the discipline of the crew however still continued perfect and unyielding there had it is true been a slight movement made by one or two of the older seamen which indicated an intention to drown the apprehensions of death in ebriety but barnstable had called for his pistols in a tone that checked the procedure instantly and although the fatal weapons were untouched by him left to lie exposed on the capstan where they had been placed by his servant not another symptom of insubordination appeared among the devoted crew there was even what to a landsman might seem an appalling affectation of attention to the most trifling duties of the vessel and the men who it should seem ought to be devoting the brief moments of their existence to the mighty business of the hour were constantly called to attend to the most trivial details of their profession ropes were coiled and the slightest damages occasioned by the waves which at short intervals swept across the low decks of the ariel were repaired with the same precision and order as if she yet lay embayed in the haven from which she had just been driven in this manner the arm of authority was kept extended over the silent crew not with the vain desire to preserve a lingering though useless exercise of power but with a view to maintain that unity of action that now could alone afford them even a ray of hope  she can make no head against this sea under that rag of canvas said barnstable gloomily addressing the cockswain who with folded arms and an air of cool resignation was balancing his body on the verge of the quarterdeck while the schooner was plunging madly into waves that nearly buried her in their bosom the poor little thing trembles like a frightened child as she meets the water  tom sighed heavily and shook his head before he answered  if we could have kept the head of the mainmast an hour longer we might have got an offing and fetched to windward of the shoals but as it is sir mortal man cant drive a craft to windwardshe sets bodily in to land and will be in the breakers in less than an hour unless god wills that the wind shall cease to blow  we have no hope left us but to anchor our ground tackle may yet bring her up  tom turned to his commander and replied solemnly and with that assurance of manner that long experience only can give a man in moments of great danger  if our sheetcable was bent to our heaviest anchor this sea would bring it home though nothing but her launch was riding by it a northeaster in the german ocean must and will blow itself out nor shall we get the crown of the gale until the sun falls over the land then indeed it may lull for the winds do often seem to reverence the glory of the heavens too much to blow their might in its very face  we must do our duty to ourselves and the country returned barnstable go get the two bowers spliced and have a kedge bent to a hawser well back our two anchors together and veer to the better end of two hundred and forty fathoms it may yet bring her up see all clear there for anchoring and cutting away the mast well leave the wind nothing but a naked hull to whistle over  ay if there was nothing but the wind we might yet live to see the sun sink behind them hills said the cockswain but what hemp can stand the strain of a craft that is buried half the time to her foremast in the water  the order was however executed by the crew with a sort of desperate submission to the will of their commander and when the preparations were completed the anchors and kedge were dropped to the bottom and the instant that the ariel tended to the wind the axe was applied to the little that was left of her long raking masts the crash of the falling spars as they came in succession across the decks of the vessel appeared to produce no sensation amid that scene of complicated danger but the seamen proceeded in silence to their hopeless duty of clearing the wrecks every eye followed the floating timbers as the waves swept them away from the vessel with a sort of feverish curiosity to witness the effect produced by their collision with those rocks that lay so fearfully near them but long before the spars entered the wide border of foam they were hid from view by the furious element in which they floated it was now felt by the whole crew of the ariel that their last means of safety had been adopted and at each desperate and headlong plunge the vessel took into the bosom of the seas that rolled upon her forecastle the anxious seamen thought that they could perceive the yielding of the iron that yet clung to the bottom or could hear the violent surge of the parting strands of the cable that still held them to their anchors while the minds of the sailors were agitated with the faint hopes that had been excited by the movements of their schooner dillon had been permitted to wander about the deck unnoticed his rolling eyes hard breathing and clenched hands excited no observation among the men whose thoughts were yet dwelling on the means of safety but now when with a sort of frenzied desperation he would follow the retiring waters along the decks and venture his person nigh the group that had collected around and on the gun of the cockswain glances of fierce or of sullen vengeance were cast at him that conveyed threats of a nature that he was too much agitated to understand  if ye are tired of this world though your time like my own is probably but short in it said tom to him as he passed the cockswain in one of his turns you can go forward among the men but if ye have need of the moments to foot up the reckning of your doings among men afore yere brought to face your maker and hear the logbook of heaven i would advise you to keep as nigh as possible to captain barnstable or myself  will you promise to save me if the vessel is wrecked exclaimed dillon catching at the first sounds of friendly interest that had reached his ears since he had been recaptured oh if you will i can secure your future ease yes wealth for the remainder of your days  your promises have been too ill kept afore this for the peace of your soul returned the cockswain without bitterness though sternly but it is not in me to strike even a whale that is already spouting blood  the intercessions of dillon were interrupted by a dreadful cry that arose among the men forward and which sounded with increased horror amid the roarings of the tempest the schooner rose on the breast of a wave at the same instant and falling off with her broadside to the sea she drove in towards the cliffs like a bubble on the rapids of a cataract  our groundtackle has parted said tom with his resigned patience of manner undisturbed she shall die as easy as man can make herwhile he yet spoke he seized the tiller and gave to the vessel such a direction as would be most likely to cause her to strike the rocks with her bows foremost  there was for one moment an expression of exquisite anguish betrayed in the dark countenance of barnstable but at the next it passed away and he spoke cheerfully to his men  be steady my lads be calm there is yet a hope of life for youour light draught will let us run in close to the cliffs and it is still falling watersee your boats clear and be steady  the crew of the whaleboat aroused by this speech from a sort of stupor sprang into their light vessel which was quickly lowered into the sea and kept riding on the foam free from the sides of the schooner by the powerful exertions of the men the cry for the cockswain was earnest and repeated but tom shook his head without replying still grasping the tiller and keeping his eyes steadily bent on the chaos of waters into which they were driving the launch the largest boat of the two was cut loose from the gripes and the bustle and exertion of the moment rendered the crew insensible to the horror of the scene that surrounded them but the loud hoarse call of the cockswain to look outsecure yourselves suspended even their efforts and at that instant the ariel settled on a wave that melted from under her heavily on the rocks the shock was so violent as to throw all who disregarded the warning cry from their feet and the universal quiver that pervaded the vessel was like the last shudder of animated nature for a time long enough to breathe the least experienced among the men supposed the danger to be past but a wave of great height followed the one that had deserted them and raising the vessel again threw her roughly still farther on the bed of rocks and at the same time its crest broke over her quarter sweeping the length of her decks with a fury that was almost resistless the shuddering seamen beheld their loosened boat driven from their grasp and dashed against the base of the cliffs where no fragment of her wreck could be traced at the receding of the waters but the passing billow had thrown the vessel into a position which in some measure protected her decks from the violence of those that succeeded it  go my boys go said barnstable as the moment of dreadful uncertainty passed you have still the whaleboat and she at least will take you nigh the shore go into her my boys god bless you god bless you all you have been faithful and honest fellows and i believe he will not yet desert you go my friends while there is a lull  the seamen threw themselves in a mass into the light vessel which nearly sank under the unusual burden but when they looked around them barnstable and merry dillon and the cockswain were yet to be seen on the decks of the ariel the former was pacing in deep and perhaps bitter melancholy the wet planks of the schooner while the boy hung unheeded on his arm uttering disregarded petitions to his commander to desert the wreck dillon approached the side where the boat lay again and again but the threatening countenances of the seamen as often drove him back in despair tom had seated himself on the heel of the bowsprit where he continued in an attitude of quiet resignation returning no other answers to the loud and repeated calls of his shipmates than by waving his hand towards the shore  now hear me said the boy urging his request to tears if not for my sake or for your own sake mr barnstable or for the hope of gods mercy go into the boat for the love of my cousin katherine  the young lieutenant paused in his troubled walk and for a moment he cast a glance of hesitation at the cliffs but at the next instant his eyes fell on the ruin of his vessel and he answered  never boy never if my hour has come i will not shrink from my fate  listen to the men dear sir the boat will be swamped alongside the wreck and their cry is that without you they will not let her go  barnstable motioned to the boat to bid the boy enter it and turned away in silence  well said merry with firmness if it be right that a lieutenant shall stay by the wreck it must also be right for a midshipman shove off neither mr barnstable nor myself will quit the vessel  boy your life has been entrusted to my keeping and at my hands will it be required said his commander lifting the struggling youth and tossing him into the arms of the seamen away with ye and god be with you there is more weight in you now than can go safe to land  still the seamen hesitated for they perceived the cockswain moving with a steady tread along the deck and they hoped he had relented and would yet persuade the lieutenant to join his crew but tom imitating the example of his commander seized the latter suddenly in his powerful grasp and threw him over the bulwarks with an irresistible force at the same moment he cast the fast of the boat from the pin that held it and lifting his broad hands high into the air his voice was heard in the tempest  gods will be done with me he cried i saw the first timber of the ariel laid and shall live just long enough to see it turn out of her bottom after which i wish to live no longer  but his shipmates were swept far beyond the sounds of his voice before half these words were uttered all command of the boat was rendered impossible by the numbers it contained as well as the raging of the surf and as it rose on the white crest of a wave tom saw his beloved little craft for the last time it fell into a trough of the sea and in a few moments more its fragments were ground into splinters on the adjacent rocks the cockswain still remained where he had cast off the rope and beheld the numerous heads and arms that appeared rising at short intervals on the waves some making powerful and welldirected efforts to gain the sands that were becoming visible as the tide fell and others wildly tossed in the frantic movements of helpless despair the honest old seaman gave a cry of joy as he saw barnstable issue from the surf bearing the form of merry in safety to the sands where one by one several seamen soon appeared also dripping and exhausted many others of the crew were carried in a similar manner to places of safety though as tom returned to his seat on the bowsprit he could not conceal from his reluctant eyes the lifeless forms that were in other spots driven against the rocks with a fury that soon left them but few of the outward vestiges of humanity  dillon and the cockswain were now the sole occupants of their dreadful station the former stood in a kind of stupid despair a witness of the scene we have related but as his curdled blood began again to flow more warmly through his heart he crept close to the side of tom with that sort of selfish feeling that makes even hopeless misery more tolerable when endured in participation with another  when the tide falls he said in a voice that betrayed the agony of fear though his words expressed the renewal of hope we shall be able to walk to land  there was one and only one to whose feet the waters were the same as a dry dock returned the cockswain and none but such as have his power will ever be able to walk from these rocks to the sands the old seaman paused and turning his eyes which exhibited a mingled expression of disgust and compassion on his companion he added with reverence had you thought more of him in fair weather your case would be less to be pitied in this tempest  do you still think there is much danger asked dillon  to them that have reason to fear death listen do you hear that hollow noise beneath ye  tis the wind driving by the vessel  tis the poor thing herself said the affected cockswain giving her last groans the water is breaking up her decks and in a few minutes more the handsomest model that ever cut a wave will be like the chips that fell from her timbers in framing  why then did you remain here cried dillon wildly  to die in my coffin if it should be the will of god returned tom these waves to me are what the land is to you i was born on them and i have always meant that they should be my grave  but ii shrieked dillon i am not ready to diei cannot diei will not die  poor wretch muttered his companion you must go like the rest of us when the deathwatch is called none can skulk from the muster  i can swim dillon continued rushing with frantic eagerness to the side of the wreck is there no billet of wood no rope that i can take with me  none everything has been cut away or carried off by the sea if ye are about to strive for your life take with ye a stout heart and a clean conscience and trust the rest to god  god echoed dillon in the madness of his frenzy i know no god there is no god that knows me  peace said the deep tones of the cockswain in a voice that seemed to speak in the elements blasphemer peace  the heavy groaning produced by the water in the timbers of the ariel at that moment added its impulse to the raging feelings of dillon and he cast himself headlong into the sea  the water thrown by the rolling of the surf on the beach was necessarily returned to the ocean in eddies in different places favorable to such an action of the element into the edge of one of these countercurrents that was produced by the very rocks on which the schooner lay and which the watermen call the undertow dillon had unknowingly thrown his person and when the waves had driven him a short distance from the wreck he was met by a stream that his most desperate efforts could not overcome he was a light and powerful swimmer and the struggle was hard and protracted with the shore immediately before his eyes and at no great distance he was led as by a false phantom to continue his efforts although they did not advance him a foot the old seaman who at first had watched his motions with careless indifference understood the danger of his situation at a glance and forgetful of his own fate he shouted aloud in a voice that was driven over the struggling victim to the ears of his shipmates on the sands  sheer to port and clear the undertow sheer to the southward  dillon heard the sounds but his faculties were too much obscured by terror to distinguish their object he however blindly yielded to the call and gradually changed his direction until his face was once more turned towards the vessel the current swept him diagonally by the rocks and he was forced into an eddy where he had nothing to contend against but the waves whose violence was much broken by the wreck in this state he continued still to struggle but with a force that was too much weakened to overcome the resistance he met tom looked around him for a rope but all had gone over with the spars or been swept away by the waves at this moment of disappointment his eyes met those of the desperate dillon calm and inured to horrors as was the veteran seaman he involuntarily passed his hand before his brow to exclude the look of despair he encountered and when a moment afterwards he removed the rigid member he beheld the sinking form of the victim as it gradually settled in the ocean still struggling with regular but impotent strokes of the arms and feet to gain the wreck and to preserve an existence that had been so much abused in its hour of allotted probation  he will soon know his god and learn that his god knows him murmured the cockswain to himself as he yet spoke the wreck of the ariel yielded to an overwhelming sea and after an universal shudder her timbers and planks gave way and were swept towards the cliffs bearing the body of the simplehearted cockswain among the ruins     chapter xxv    let us think of them that sleep   full many a fathom deep   by the wild and stormy steep   elsinore   campbell   long and dreary did the hours appear to barnstable before the falling tide had so far receded as to leave the sands entirely exposed to his search for the bodies of his lost shipmates several had been rescued from the wild fury of the waves themselves and one by one as the melancholy conviction that life had ceased was forced on the survivors they had been decently interred in graves dug on the very margin of that element on which they had passed their lives but still the form longest known and most beloved was missing and the lieutenant paced the broad space that was now left between the foot of the cliffs and the raging ocean with hurried strides and a feverish eye watching and following those fragments of the wreck that the sea still continued to cast on the beach living and dead he now found that of those who had lately been in the ariel only two were missing of the former he could muster but twelve besides merry and himself and his men had already interred more than half that number of the latter which together embraced all who had trusted their lives to the frail keeping of the whaleboat  tell me not boy of the impossibility of his being safe said barnstable in deep agitation which he in vain struggled to conceal from the anxious youth who thought it unnecessary to follow the uneasy motions of his commander as he strode along the sands how often have men been found floating on pieces of wreck days after the loss of their vessel and you can see with your own eyes that the falling water has swept the planks this distance ay a good halfleague from where she struck does the lookout from the top of the cliffs make no signal of seeing him yet  none sir none we shall never see him again the men say that he always thought it sinful to desert a wreck and that he did not even strike out once for his life though he has been known to swim an hour when a whale has stove his boat god knows sir added the boy hastily dashing a tear from his eye by a stolen movement of his hand i loved tom coffin better than any foremast man in either vessel you seldom came aboard the frigate but we had him in the steerage among us reefers to hear his long yarns and share our cheer we all loved him mr barnstable but love cannot bring the dead to life again  i know it i know it said barnstable with a huskiness in his voice that betrayed the depth of his emotion i am not so foolish as to believe in impossibilities but while there is a hope of his living i will never abandon poor tom coffin to such a dreadful fate think boy he may at this moment be looking at us and praying to his maker that he would turn our eyes upon him ay praying to his god for tom often prayed though he did it in his watch standing and in silence  if he had clung to life so strongly returned the midshipman he would have struggled harder to preserve it  barnstable stopped short in his hurried walk and fastened a look of opening conviction on his companion but as he was about to speak in reply the shouts of the seamen reached his ears and turning they saw the whole party running along the beach and motioning with violent gestures to an intermediate point in the ocean the lieutenant and merry hurried back and as they approached the men they distinctly observed a human figure borne along by the waves at moments seeming to rise above them and already floating in the last of the breakers they had hardly ascertained so much when a heavy swell carried the inanimate body far upon the sands where it was left by the retiring waters  tis my cockswain cried barnstable rushing to the spot he stopped suddenly however as he came within view of the features and it was some little time before he appeared to have collected his faculties sufficiently to add in tones of deep horror what wretch is this boy his form is unmutilated and yet observe the eyes they seem as if the sockets would not contain them and they gaze as wildly as if their owner yet had lifethe hands are open and spread as though they would still buffet the waves  the jonah the jonah shouted the seamen with savage exultation as they successively approached the corpse away with his carrion into the sea again give him to the sharks let him tell his lies in the claws of the lobsters  barnstable had turned away from the revolting sight in disgust but when he discovered these indications of impotent revenge in the remnant of his crew he said in that voice which all respected and still obeyed  stand back back with ye fellows would you disgrace your manhood and seamanship by wreaking your vengeance on him whom god has already in judgment a silent but significant gesture towards the earth succeeded his words and he walked slowly away  bury him in the sands boys said merry when his commander was at some little distance the next tide will unearth him  the seamen obeyed his orders while the midshipman rejoined his commander who continued to pace along the beach occasionally halting to throw his uneasy glances over the water and then hurrying onward at a rate that caused his youthful companion to exert his greatest power to maintain the post he had taken at his side every effort to discover the lost cockswain was however after two hours more search abandoned as fruitless and with reason for the sea was never known to give up the body of the man who might be emphatically called its own dead  there goes the sun already dropping behind the cliffs said the lieutenant throwing himself on a rock and the hour will soon arrive to set the dogwatches but we have nothing left to watch over boy the surf and rocks have not even left us a whole plank that we may lay our heads on for the night  the men have gathered many articles on yon beach sir returned the lad they have found arms to defend ourselves with and food to give us strength to use them  and who shall be our enemy asked barnstable bitterly shall we shoulder our dozen pikes and carry england by boarding  we may not lay the whole island under contribution continued the boy anxiously watching the expression of his commanders eye but we may still keep ourselves in work until the cutter returns from the frigate i hope sir you do not think our case so desperate as to intend yielding as prisoners  prisoners exclaimed the lieutenant no no lad it has not got to that yet england has been able to wreck my craft i must concede but she has as yet obtained no other advantage over us she was a precious model merry the cleanest run and the neatest entrance that art ever united on the stem and stern of the same vessel do you remember the time younker when i gave the frigate my topsails in beating out of the chesapeake i could always do it in smooth water with a wholesail breeze but she was a frail thing a frail thing boy and could bear but little  a mortarketch would have thumped to pieces where she lay returned the midshipman  ay it was asking too much of her to expect she could hold together on a bed of rocks merry i loved her dearly did i love her she was my first command and i knew and loved every timber and bolt in her beautiful frame  i believe it is as natural sir for a seaman to love the wood and iron in which he has floated over the depths of the ocean for so many days and nights rejoined the boy as it is for a father to love the members of his own family  quite quite ay more so said barnstable speaking as if he were choked by emotion merry felt the heavy grasp of the lieutenant on his slight arm while his commander continued in a voice that gradually increased in power as his feelings predominated and yet boy a human being cannot love the creature of his own formation as he does the works of god a man can never regard his ship as he does his shipmates i sailed with him boy when everything seemed bright and happy as at your age when as he often expressed it i knew nothing and feared nothing i was then a truant from an old father and a kind mother and he did that for me which no parents could have done in my situationhe was my father and mother on the deephours days even months has he passed in teaching me the art of our profession and now in my manhood he has followed me from ship to ship from sea to sea and has only quitted me to die where i should have diedas if he felt the disgrace of abandoning the poor ariel to her fate by herself  nononotwas his superstitious pride interrupted merry but perceiving that the head of barnstable had sunk between his hands as if he would conceal his emotion the boy added no more but he sat respectfully watching the display of feeling that his officer in vain endeavored to suppress merry felt his own form quiver with sympathy at the shuddering which passed through barnstables frame and the relief experienced by the lieutenant himself was not greater than that which the midshipman felt as the latter beheld large tears forcing their way through the others fingers and falling on the sands at his feet they were followed by a violent burst of emotion such as is seldom exhibited in the meridian of life but which when it conquers the nature of one who has buffeted the chances of the world with the loftiness of his sex and character breaks down every barrier and seems to sweep before it like a rushing torrent all the factitious defences which habit and education have created to protect the pride of manhood merry had often beheld the commanding severity of the lieutenants manner in moments of danger with deep respect he had been drawn towards him by kindness and affection in times of gayety and recklessness but he now sat for many minutes profoundly silent regarding his officer with sensations that were nearly allied to awe the struggle with himself was long and severe in the bosom of barnstable but at length the calm of relieved passions succeeded to his emotion when he arose from the rock and removed his hands from his features his eye was hard and proud his brow lightly contracted and he spoke in a voice so harsh that it startled his companion  come sir why are we here and idle are not yon poor fellows looking up to us for advice and orders how to proceed in this exigency away away mr merry it is not a time to be drawing figures in the sand with your dirk the floodtide will soon be in and we may be glad to hide our heads in some cavern among these rocks let us be stirring sir while we have the sun and muster enough food and arms to keep life in us and our enemies off us until we can once more get afloat  the wondering boy whose experience had not yet taught him to appreciate the reaction of the passions started at this unexpected summons to his duty and followed barnstable towards the group of distant seamen the lieutenant who was instantly conscious how far pride had rendered him unjust soon moderated his long strides and continued in milder tones which were quickly converted into his usual frank communications though they still remained tinged with a melancholy that time only could entirely remove  we have been unlucky mr merry but we need not despairthese lads have gotten together abundance of supplies i see and with our arms we can easily make ourselves masters of some of the enemys smaller craft and find our way back to the frigate when this gale has blown itself out we must keep ourselves close though or we shall have the redcoats coming down upon us like so many sharks around a wreck ah god bless her merry there is not such a sight to be seen on the whole beach as two of her planks holding together  the midshipman without adverting to this sudden allusion to their vessel prudently pursued the train of ideas in which his commander had started  there is an opening into the country but a short distance south of us where a brook empties into the sea he said we might find a cover in it or in the wood above into which it leads until we can have a survey of the coast or can seize some vessel to carry us off  there would be a satisfaction in waiting till the morning watch and then carrying that accursed battery which took off the better leg of the poor ariel said the lieutenantthe thing might be done boy and we could hold the work too until the alacrity and the frigate draw in to land  if you prefer storming works to boarding vessels there is a fortress of stone mr barnstable which lies directly on our beam i could see it through the haze when i was on the cliffs stationing the lookout and  and what boy speak without a fear this is a time for free consultation  why sir the garrison might not all be hostilewe should liberate mr griffith and the marines besides  besides what sir  i should have an opportunity perhaps of seeing my cousin cecilia and my cousin katherine  the countenance of barnstable grew animated as he listened and he answered with something of his usual cheerful manner  ay that indeed would be a work worth carrying and the rescuing of our shipmates and the marines would read like a thing of military discretionha boy all the rest would be incidental younker like the capture of the fleet after you have whipped the convoy  i do suppose sir that if the abbey be taken colonel howard will own himself a prisoner of war  and colonel howards wards now there is good sense in this scheme of thine master merry and i will give it proper reflection but here are our poor fellows speak cheeringly to them sir that we may hold them in temper for our enterprise  barnstable and the midshipman joined their shipwrecked companions with that air of authority which is seldom wanting between the superior and the inferior in nautical intercourse but at the same time with a kindness of speech and looks that might have been a little increased by their critical situation after partaking of the food which had been selected from among the fragments that still lay scattered for more than a mile along the beach the lieutenant directed the seamen to arm themselves with such weapons as offered and also to make sufficient provision from the schooners stores to last them for fourandtwenty hours longer these orders were soon executed and the whole party led by barnstable and merry proceeded along the foot of the cliffs in quest of the opening in the rocks through which the little rivulet found a passage to the ocean the weather contributed as much as the seclusion of the spot to prevent any discovery of the small party which pursued its object with a disregard of caution that might under other circumstances have proved fatal to its safety barnstable paused in his march when they had all entered the deep ravine and ascended nearly to the brow of the precipice that formed one of its sides to take a last and more scrutinizing survey of the sea his countenance exhibited the abandonment of all hope as his eye moved slowly from the northern to the southern boundary of the horizon and he prepared to pursue his march by moving reluctantly up the stream when the boy who still clung to his side exclaimed joyously  sail hoit must be the frigate in the offing  a sail repeated his commander where away do you see a sail in this tempest can there be another as hardy and unfortunate as ourselves  look to the starboard hand of the point of rock to windward cried the boy now you lose itah now the sun falls upon it tis a sail sir as sure as canvas can be spread in such a gale  i see what you mean returned the other but it seems a gull skimming the sea nay now it rises indeed and shows itself like a bellying topsail pass up that glass lads here is a fellow in the offing who may prove a friend  merry waited the result of the lieutenants examination with youthful impatience and did not fail to ask immediately  can you make it out sir is it the ship or the cutter  come there seemeth yet some hope left for us boy returned barnstable closing the glass tis a ship lyingto under her maintopsail if one might but dare to show himself on these heights he would raise her hull and make sure of her character but i think i know her spars though even her topsail dips at times when there is nothing to be seen but her bare poles and they shortened by her top gallantmasts  one would swear said merry laughing as much through the excitement produced by this intelligence as at his conceit that captain munson would never carry wood aloft when he cant carry canvas i remember one night mr griffith was a little vexed and said around the capstan he believed the next order would be to rig in the bowsprit and house lowermasts  ay ay griffith is a lazy dog and sometimes gets lost in the fogs of his own thoughts said barnstable and i suppose old moderate was in a breeze however this looks as if he were in earnest he must have kept the ship away or she would never have been where she is i do verily believe the old gentleman remembers that he has a few of his officers and men on this accursed island this is well merry for should we take the abbey we have a place at hand in which to put our prisoners  we must have patience till the morning added the boy for no boat would attempt to land in such a sea  no boat could land the best boat that ever floated boy has sunk in these breakers but the wind lessens and before morning the sea will fall let us on and find a berth for our poor lads where they can be made more comfortable  the two officers now descended from their elevation and led the way still farther up the deep and narrow dell until as the ground rose gradually before them they found themselves in a dense wood on a level with the adjacent country  here should be a ruin at hand if i have a true reckoning and know my courses and distances said barnstable i have a chart about me that speaks of such a landmark  the lieutenant turned away from the laughing expression of the boys eye as the latter archly inquired  was it made by one who knows the coast well sir of was it done by some schoolboy to learn his maps as the girls work samplers  come younker no sampler of your impudence but look ahead can you see any habitation that has been deserted  ay sir here is a pile of stones before us that looks as dirty and ragged as if it was a soldiers barrack can this be what you seek  faith this has been a whole town in its day we should call it a city in america and furnish it with a mayor aldermen and recorderyou might stow old faneuil hall in one of its lockers  with this sort of careless dialogue which barnstable engaged in that his men might discover no alteration in his manner they approached the mouldering walls that had proved so frail a protection to the party under griffith  a short time was passed in examining the premises when the wearied seamen took possession of one of the dilapidated apartments and disposed themselves to seek that rest of which they had been deprived by the momentous occurrences of the past night  barnstable waited until the loud breathing of the seamen assured him that they slept when he aroused the drowsy boy who was fast losing his senses in the same sort of oblivion and motioned him to follow merry arose and they stole together from the apartment with guarded steps and penetrated more deeply into the gloomy recesses of the place     chapter xxvi    mercury i permit thee to be sosia again   dryden   we must leave the two adventurers winding their way among the broken piles and venturing boldly beneath the tottering arches of the ruin to accompany the reader at the same hour within the more comfortable walls of the abbey where it will be remembered borroughcliffe was left in a condition of very equivocal ease as the earth had however in the interval nearly run its daily round circumstances had intervened to release the soldier from his confinementand no one ignorant of the fact would suppose that the gentleman who was now seated at the hospitable board of colonel howard directing with so much discretion the energies of his masticators to the delicacies of the feast could read in his careless air and smiling visage that those foragers of nature had been so recently condemned for four long hours to the mortification of discussing the barren subject of his own swordhilt borroughcliffe however maintained not only his usual post but his wellearned reputation at the table with his ordinary coolness of demeanor though at times there were fleeting smiles that crossed his military aspect which sufficiently indicated that he considered the matter of his reflection to be of a particularly ludicrous character in the young man who sat by his side dressed in the deepblue jacket of a seaman with the fine white linen of his collar contrasting strongly with the black silk handkerchief that was tied with studied negligence around his neck and whose easy air and manner contrasted still more strongly with this attire the reader will discover griffith the captive paid much less devotion to the viands than his neighbor though he affected more attention to the business of the table than he actually be stowed with a sort of consciousness that it would relieve the blushing maiden who presided the laughing eyes of katherine plowden were glittering by the side of the mild countenance of alice dunscombe and at times were fastened in droll interest on the rigid and upright exterior that captain manual maintained directly opposite to where she was seated a chair had also been placed for dillonof course it was vacant  and so borroughcliffe cried colonel howard with a freedom of voice and a vivacity in his air that announced the increasing harmony of the repast the seadog left you nothing to chew but the cud of your resentment  that and my swordhilt returned the immovable recruiting officer gentlemen i know not how your congress rewards military achievements but if that worthy fellow were in my company he should have a halberd within a weekspurs i would not offer him for he affects to spurn their use  griffith smiled and bowed in silence to the liberal compliment of borroughcliffe but manual took on himself the task of replying  considering the drilling the man has received the conduct has been well enough sir though a welltrained soldier would not only have made prisoners but he would have secured them  i perceive my good comrade that your thoughts are running on the exchange said borroughcliffe goodhumoredly we will fill sir and by permission of the ladies drink to a speedy restoration of rights to both partiesthe status quo ante bellum  with all my heart cried the colonel and cicely and miss katherine will pledge the sentiment in a womans sip will ye not my fair wards mr griffith i honor this proposition of yours which will not only liberate yourself but restore to us my kinsman mr christopher dillon kit had imagined the thing well ha borroughcliffe twas ingeniously contrived but the fortune of war interposed itself to his success and yet it is a deep and inexplicable mystery to me how kit should have been conveyed from the abbey with so little noise and without raising the alarm  christopher is a man who understands the philosophy of silence as well as that of rhetoric returned borroughcliffe and must have learned in his legal studies that it is sometimes necessary to conduct matters sub silentio you smile at my latin miss plowden but really since i have become an inhabitant of this monkish abode my little learning is stimulated to unwonted effortsnay you are pleased to be yet more merry i used the language because silence is a theme in which you ladies take but little pleasure  katherine however disregarded the slight pique that was apparent in the soldiers manner but after following the train of her own thoughts in silent enjoyment for a moment longer she seemed to yield to their drollery and laughed until her dark eyes flashed with merriment cecilia did not assume the severe gravity with which she sometimes endeavored to repress what she thought the unseasonable mirth of her cousin and the wondering griffith fancied as he glanced his eye from one to the other that he could discern a suppressed smile playing among the composed features of alice dunscombe katherine however soon succeeded in repressing the paroxysm and with an air of infinitely comic gravity she replied to the remark of the soldier  i think i have heard of such a process in nautical affairs as towing but i must appeal to mr griffith for the correctness of the term  you could not speak with more accuracy returned the young sailor with a look that sent the conscious blood to the temples of the lady though you had made marine terms your study  the profession requires less thought perhaps than you imagine sir but is this towing often done as captain borroughcliffei beg his pardonas the monks have it sub silentio  spare me fair lady cried the captain and we will establish a compact of mutual grace you to forgive my learning and i to suppress my suspicions  suspicions sir is a word that a lady must defy  and defiance a challenge that a soldier can never receive so i must submit to talk english though the fathers of the church were my companions i suspect that miss plowden has it in her power to explain the manner of mr christopher dillons departure  the lady did not reply but a second burst of merriment succeeded of a liveliness and duration quite equal to the former  hows this exclaimed the colonel permit me to say miss plowden your mirth is very extraordinary i trust no disrespect has been offered to my kinsman mr griffith our terms are that the exchange shall only be made on condition that equally good treatment has been extended to the parties  if mr dillon can complain of no greater evil than that of being laughed at by miss plowden sir he has reason to call himself a happy fellow  i know not sir god forbid that i should forget what is due to my guests gentlemenbut ye have entered my dwelling as foes to my prince  but not to colonel howard sir  i know no difference mr griffith king george or colonel howard colonel howard or king george our feelings our fortunes and our fate are as one with the mighty odds that providence has established between the prince and his people i wish no other fortune than to share at an humble distance the weal or woe of my sovereign  you are not called upon dear sir to do either by the thoughtlessness of us ladies said cecilia rising but here comes one who should turn our thoughts to a more important subjectour dress  politeness induced colonel howard who both loved and respected his niece to defer his remarks to another time and katherine springing from her chair with childish eagerness flew to the side of her cousin who was directing a servant that had announced the arrival of one of those erratic venders of small articles who supply in remote districts of the country the places of more regular traders to show the lad into the diningparlor the repast was so far ended as to render this interruption less objectionable and as all felt the object of cecilia to be the restoration of harmony the boy was ushered into the room without further delay the contents of his small basket consisting chiefly of essences and the smaller articles of female economy were playfully displayed on the table by katherine who declared herself the patroness of the itinerant youth and who laughingly appealed to the liberality of the gentlemen in behalf of her protégé  you perceive my dear guardian that the boy must be loyal for he offers here perfume that is patronized by no less than two royal dukes do suffer me to place a box aside for your especial use you consent i see it in your eye and captain borroughcliffe as you appear to be forgetting the use of your own language here is even a hornbook for you how admirably provided he seems to be you must have had st ruth in view when you laid in your stock child  yes my lady the boy replied with a bow that was studiously awkward i have often heard of the grand ladies that dwell in the old abbey and i have journeyed a few miles beyond my rounds to gain their custom  and surely they cannot disappoint you miss howard that is a palpable hint to your purse and i know not that even miss alice can escape contribution in these troublesome times come aid me child what have you to recommend in particular to the favor of these ladies  the lad approached the basket and rummaged its contents for a moment with the appearance of deep mercenary interest and then without lifting his hand from the confusion he had caused he said while he exhibited something within the basket to the view of his smiling observer  this my lady  katharine started and glanced her eyes with a piercing look at the countenance of the boy and then turned them uneasily from face to face with conscious timidity cecilia had effected her object and had resumed her seat in silent abstractionalice was listening to the remarks of captain manual and the host as they discussed the propriety of certain military usagesgriffith seemed to hold communion with his mistress by imitating her silence but katharine in her stolen glances met the keen look of borroughcliffe fastened on her face in a manner that did not fail instantly to suspend the scrutiny  come cecilia she cried after a pause of a moment we trespass too long on the patience of the gentlemen not only to keep possession of our seats ten minutes after the cloth has been drawn but even to introduce our essences and tapes and needles among the madeira and shall i add cigars colonel  not while we are favored with the company of miss plowden certainly  come my coz i perceive the colonel is growing particularly polite which is a neverfailing sign that he tires of our presence  cecilia rose and was leading the way to the door when katherine turned to the lad and added  you can follow us to the drawingroom child where we can make our purchases without exposing the mystery of our toilets  miss plowden has forgotten my hornbook i believe said borroughcliffe advancing from the standing group who surrounded the table possibly i can find some work in the basket of the boy better fitted for the improvement of a grownup young gentleman than this elementary treatise  cecilia observing him to take the basket from the lad resumed her seat and her example was necessarily followed by katherine though not without some manifest indications of vexation  come hither boy and explain the uses of your wares this is soap and this a penknife i know but what name do you affix to this  that that is tape returned the lad with an impatience that might very naturally be attributed to the interruption that was thus given to his trade  and this  that repeated the stripling pausing with a hesitation between sulkiness and doubt that  come this is a little ungallant cried katherine to keep three ladies dying with impatience to possess themselves of their finery while you detain the boy to ask the name of a tambouringneedle  i should apologize for asking questions that are so easily answered but perhaps he will find the next more difficult to solve returned borroughcliffe placing the subject of his inquiries in the palm of his hand in such a manner as to conceal it from all but the boy and himself this has a name too what is it  thatthatis sometimes calledwhiteline  perhaps you mean a white lie  how sir exclaimed the lad a little fiercely a lie  only a white one returned the captain what do you call this miss dunscombe  we call it bobbin sir generally in the north said the placid alice  ay bobbin or whiteline they are the same thing added the young trader  they are i think now for a professional man you know but little of the terms of your art observed borroughcliffe with an affectation of irony i never have seen a youth of your years who knew less what names now would you affix to this and this and this  while the captain was speaking he drew from his pockets the several instruments that the cockswain had made use of the preceding night to secure his prisoner  that exclaimed the lad with the eagerness of one who would vindicate his reputation is rattlinstuff and this is marline and that is sennit  enough enough said borroughcliffe you have exhibited sufficient knowledge to convince me that you do know something of your trade and nothing of these articles mr griffith do you claim this boy  i believe i must sir said the young seaofficer who had been intently listening to the examination on whatever errand you have now ventured here mr merry it is useless to affect further concealment  merry exclaimed cecilia howard is it you then my cousin are you too fallen into the power of your enemies was it not enough that  the young lady recovered her recollection in time to suppress the remainder of the sentence though the grateful expression of griffiths eye sufficiently indicated that he had in his thoughts filled the sentence with expressions abundantly flattering to his own feelings  hows this again cried the colonel my two wards embracing and fondling a vagrant vagabond peddler before my eyes is this treason mr griffith or what means the extraordinary visit of this young gentleman  is it extraordinary sir said merry himself losing his assumed awkwardness in the ease and confidence of one whose faculties had been early exercised that a boy like myself destitute of mother and sisters should take a like risk on himself to visit the only two female relatives he has in the world  why this disguise then surely young gentleman it was unnecessary to enter the dwelling of old george howard on such an errand clandestinely even though your tender years have been practised on to lead you astray from your allegiance mr griffith and captain manual must pardon me if i express sentiments at my own table that they may find unpleasant but this business requires us to be explicit  the hospitality of colonel howard is unquestionable returned the boy but he has a great reputation for his loyalty to the crown  ay young gentleman and i trust with some justice  would it then be safe to entrust my person in the hands of one who might think it his duty to detain me  this is plausible enough captain borroughcliffe and i doubt not the boy speaks with candor i would now that my kinsman mr christopher dillon were here that i might learn if it would be misprision of treason to permit this youth to depart unmolested and without exchange  inquire of the young gentleman after the cacique returned the recruiting officer who apparently satisfied in producing the exposure of merry had resumed his seat at the table perhaps he is in verity an ambassador empowered to treat on behalf of his highness  how say you demanded the colonel do you know anything of my kinsman  the anxious eyes of the whole party were fastened on the boy for many moments witnessing the sudden change from careless freedom to deep horror expressed in his countenance at length he uttered in an undertone the secret of dillons fate  he is dead  dead repeated every voice in the room  yes dead said the boy gazing at the pallid faces of those who surrounded him  a long and fearful silence succeeded the announcement of this intelligence which was only interrupted by griffith who said  explain the manner of his death sir and where his body lies  his body lies interred in the sands returned merry with a deliberation that proceeded from an opening perception that if he uttered too much he might betray the loss of the ariel and consequently endanger the liberty of barnstable  in the sands was echoed from every part of the room  ay in the sands but how he died i cannot explain  he has been murdered exclaimed colonel howard whose command of utterance was now amply restored to him he has been treacherously and dastardly and basely murdered  he has not been murdered said the boy firmly nor did he meet his death among those who deserve the name either of traitors or of dastards  said you not that he was dead that my kinsman was buried in the sands of the seashore  both are true sir  and you refuse to explain how he met his death and why he has been thus ignominiously interred  he received his interment by my orders sir and if there be ignominy about his grave his own acts have heaped it on him as to the manner of his death i cannot and will not speak  be calm my cousin said cecilia in an imploring voice respect the age of my uncle and remember his strong attachment to mr dillon  the veteran had however so far mastered his feelings as to continue the dialogue with more recollection  mr griffith he said i shall not act hastilyyou and your companions will be pleased to retire to your several apartments i will so far respect the son of my brother harrys friend as to believe your parole will be sacred go gentlemen you are unguarded  the two prisoners bowed low to the ladies and their host and retired griffith however lingered a moment on the threshold to say  colonel howard i leave the boy to your kindness and consideration i know you will not forget that his blood mingles with that of one who is most dear to you  enough enough sir said the veteran waving his hand to him to retire and you ladies this is not a place for you either  never will i quit this child said katherine while such a horrid imputation lies on him colonel howard act your pleasure on us both for i suppose you have the power but his fate shall be my fate  there is i trust some misconception in this melancholy affair said borroughcliffe advancing into the centre of the agitated group and i should hope by calmness and moderation all may yet be explained young gentleman you have borne arms and must know notwithstanding your youth what it is to be in the power of your enemies  never returned the proud boy i am a captive for the first time  i speak sir in reference to our power  you may order me to a dungeon or as i have entered the abbey in disguise possibly to a gibbet  and is that a fate to be met so calmly by one so young  you dare not do it captain borroughcliffe cried katherine involuntarily throwing an arm around the boy as if to shield him from harm you would blush to think of such a coldblooded act of vengeance colonel howard  if we could examine the young man where the warmth of feeling which these ladies exhibit might not be excited said the captain apart to his host we should gain important intelligence  miss howard and you miss plowden said the veteran in a manner that long habit had taught his wards to respect your young kinsman is not in the keeping of savages and you can safely confide him to my custody i am sorry that we have so long kept miss alice standing but she will find relief on the couches of your drawingroom cecilia  cecilia and katherine permitted themselves to be conducted to the door by their polite but determined guardian where he bowed to their retiring persons with the exceeding courtesy that he never failed to use when in the least excited  you appear to know your danger mr merry said borroughcliffe after the door was closed i trust you also know what duty would dictate to one in my situation  do it sir returned the boy you have a king to render an account to and i have a country  i may have a country also said borroughcliffe with a calmness that was not in the least disturbed by the taunting air with which the youth delivered himself it is possible for me however to be lenient even merciful when the interests of that prince to whom you allude are servedyou came not on this enterprise alone sir  had i come better attended captain borroughcliffe might have heard these questions instead of putting them  i am happy sir that your retinue has been so small and yet even the rebel schooner called the ariel might have furnished you with a more becoming attendance i cannot but think that you are not far distant from your friends  he is near his enemies your honor said sergeant drill who had entered the room unobserved for here is a boy who says he has been seized in the old ruin and robbed of his goods and clothes and by his description this lad should be the thief  borroughcliffe signed to the boy who stood in the background to advance and he was instantly obeyed with all that eagerness which a sense of injury on the part of the sufferer could excite the tale of this unexpected intruder was soon told and was briefly this  he had been assaulted by a man and a boy the latter was in presence while arranging his effects in the ruin preparatory to exhibiting them to the ladies of the abbey and had been robbed of such part of his attire as the boy had found necessary for his disguise together with his basket of valuables he had been put into an apartment of an old tower by the man for safe keeping but as the latter frequently ascended to its turret to survey the country he had availed himself of this remissness to escape and to conclude he demanded a restoration of his property and vengeance for his wrongs  merry heard his loud and angry details with scornful composure and before the offended peddler was through his narrative he had divested himself of the borrowed garments which he threw to the other with singular disdain  we are beleaguered mine host beset besieged cried borroughcliffe when the other had ended here is a rare plan to rob us of our laurels ay and of our rewards but hark ye drill they have old soldiers to deal with and we shall look into the matter one would wish to triumph on foot you understand methere was no horse in the battle go fellow i see you grow wiser take this young gentlemanand remember he is a young gentlemanput him in safe keeping but see him supplied with all he wants  borroughcliffe bowed politely to the haughty bend of the body with which merry who now began to think himself a martyr to his country followed the orderly from the room  there is mettle in the lad exclaimed the captain and if he live to get a beard twill be a hardy dog who ventures to pluck it i am glad mine host that this wandering jew has arrived to save the poor fellows feelings for i detest tampering with such a noble spirit i saw by his eye that he had squinted oftener over a gun than through a needle  but they have murdered my kinsmanthe loyal the learned the ingenious mr christopher dillon  if they have done so they shall be made to answer it said borroughcliffe reseating himself at the table with a coolness that furnished an ample pledge of the impartiality of his judgment but let us learn the facts before we do aught hastily  colonel howard was fain to comply with so reasonable a proposition and he resumed his chair while his companion proceeded to institute a close examination of the peddler boy  we shall defer until the proper time may arrive recording the result of his inquiries but shall so satisfy the curiosity of our readers as to tell them that the captain learned sufficient to convince him a very serious attempt was meditated on the abbey and as he thought enough also to enable him to avert the danger     chapter xxvii    i have not seen   so likely an ambassador of love   merchant of venice   cecilia and katherine separated from alice dunscombe in the lower gallery of the cloisters and the cousins ascended to the apartment which was assigned them as a dressingroom the intensity of feeling that was gradually accumulating in the breasts of the ladies as circumstances brought those in whom their deepest interests were centred into situations of extreme delicacy if not of actual danger perhaps in some measure prevented them from experiencing all that concern which the detection and arrest of merry might be supposed to excite the boy like themselves was an only child of one of those three sisters who caused the close connection of so many of our characters and his tender years had led his cousins to regard him with an affection that exceeded the ordinary interest of such an affinity but they knew that in the hands of colonel howard his person was safe though his liberty might be endangered when the first emotions therefore which were created by his sudden appearance after so long an absence had subsided their thoughts were rather occupied by the consideration of what consequences to others might proceed from his arrest than by any reflections on the midshipmans actual condition secluded from the observations of any strange eyes the two maidens indulged their feelings without restraint according to their several temperaments katherine moved to and fro in the apartment with feverish anxiety while miss howard by concealing her countenance under the ringlets of her luxuriant dark hair and shading her eyes with a fair hand seemed to be willing to commune with her thoughts more quietly  barnstable cannot be far distant said the former after a few minutes had passed for he never would have sent that child on such an errand by himself  cecilia raised her mild blue eyes to the countenance of her cousin as she answered  all thoughts of an exchange must now be abandoned and perhaps the persons of the prisoners will be held as pledges to answer for the life of dillon  can the wretch be dead or is it merely a threat or some device of that urchin he is a forward child and would not hesitate to speak and act boldly on emergency  he is dead returned cecilia veiling her face again in horror the eyes of the boy his whole countenance confirmed his words i fear katherine that mr barnstable has suffered his resentment to overcome his discretion when he learned the treachery of dillon surely surely through the hard usages of war may justify so dreadful a revenge on an enemy it was unkind to forget the condition of his own friends  mr barnstable has done neither miss howard said katherine checking her uneasy footsteps her light form swelling with pride mr barnstable is equally incapable of murdering an enemy or of deserting a friend  but retaliation is neither deemed nor called murder by men in arms  think it what you will call it what you will cecilia howard i will pledge my life that richard barnstable has to answer for the blood of none but the open enemies of his country  the miserable man may have fallen a sacrifice to the anger of that terrific seaman who led him hence as a captive  that terrific seaman miss howard has a heart as tender as your own he is  nay katherine interrupted cecilia you chide me unkindly let us not add to our unavoidable misery by such harsh contention  i do not contend with you cecilia i merely defend the absent and the innocent from your unkind suspicions my cousin  say rather your sister returned miss howard their hands involuntarily closing upon each other for we are surely sisters but let us strive to think of something less horrible poor poor dillon now that he has met a fate so terrible i can even fancy him less artful and more upright than we had thought him you agree with me katherine i see by your countenance and we will dwell no longer on the subject katherine my cousin kate what see you  miss plowden as she relinquished her pressure of the hand of cecilia had renewed her walk with a more regulated step but she was yet making her first turn across the room when her eyes became keenly set on the opposite window and her whole frame was held in an attitude of absorbed attention the rays of the setting sun fell bright upon her dark glances which seemed fastened on some distant object and gave an additional glow to the mantling color that was slowly stealing across her cheeks to her temples such a sudden alteration in the manner and appearance of her companion had not failed to catch the attention of cecilia who in consequence interrupted herself by the agitated question we have related katherine slowly beckoned her companion to her side and pointing in the direction of the wood that lay in view she said  see yon tower in the ruin do you observe those small spots of pink and yellow that are fluttering above its walls  i do they are the lingering remnants of the foliage of some tree but they want the vivid tints which grace the autumn of our own dear america  one is the work of god and the other has been produced by the art of man cecilia those are no leaves but they are my own childish signals and without doubt barnstable himself is on that ruined tower merry cannot will not betray him  my life should be a pledge for the honor of our little cousin said cecilia but you have the telescope of my uncle at hand ready for such an event one look through it will ascertain the truth  katherine sprang to the spot where the instrument stood and with eager hands she prepared it for the necessary observation  it is he she cried the instant her eye was put to the glass i even see his head above the stones how unthinking to expose himself so unnecessarily  but what says he katherine exclaimed cecilia you alone can interpret his meaning  the little book which contained the explanations of miss plowdens signals was now hastily produced and its leaves rapidly run over in quest of the necessary number  tis only a question to gain my attention i must let him know he is observed  when katherine as much to indulge her secret propensities as with any hope of its usefulness had devised this plan for communicating with barnstable she had luckily not forgotten to arrange the necessary means to reply to his interrogatories a very simple arrangement of some of the ornamental cords of the windowcurtains enabled her to effect this purpose and her nimble fingers soon fastened the pieces of silk to the lines which were now thrown into the air when these signals in miniature were instantly displayed in the breeze  he sees them cried cecilia and is preparing to change his flags  keep then your eye on him my cousin and tell me the colors that he shows with their order and i will endeavor to read his meaning  he is as expert as yourself there are two more of them fluttering above the stones again the upper is white and the lower black  white over black repeated katherine rapidly to herself as she turned the leaves of her bookmy messenger has he been seento that we must answer the unhappy truth here it is yellow white and redhe is a prisoner how fortunate that i should have prepared such a question and answer what says he cecilia to this news  he is busy making his changes dear nay katherine you shake so violently as to move the glass now he is done tis yellow over black this time  griffith or who he does not understand us but i had thought of the poor boy in making out the numbersah here it is yellow green and redmy cousin merryhe cannot fail to understand us now  he has already taken in his flags the news seems to alarm him for he is less expert than before he shows them nowthey are green red and yellow  the question is am i safe tis that which made him tardy miss howard continued katherine barnstable is ever slow to consult his safety but how shall i answer him should we mislead him now how could we ever forgive ourselves  of andrew merry there is no fear returned cecilia and i think if captain borroughcliffe had any intimation of the proximity of his enemies he would not continue at the table  he will stay there while wine will sparkle and man can swallow said katherine but we know by sad experience that he is a soldier on an emergency and yet ill trust to his ignorance this timehere i have an answer you are yet safe but be wary  he reads your meaning with a quick eye katherine and he is ready with his answer too he shows green over white this time well do you not hear me tis green over white why you are dumbwhat says he dear  still katherine answered not and her cousin raised her eyes from the glass and beheld her companion gazing earnestly at the open page while the glow which excitement had before brought to her cheek was increased to a still deeper bloom  i hope your blushes and his signals are not ominous kate added cecilia can green imply his jealousy as white does your purity what says he coz  he talks like yourself much nonsense said katherine turning to her flags with a pettish air that was singularly contradicted by her gratified countenance but the situation of things requires that i should talk to barnstable more freely  i can retire said cecilia rising from her chair with a grave manner  nay cecilia i do not deserve these lookstis you who exhibit levity now but you can perceive for yourself that evening is closing in and that some other medium for conversation besides the eyes may be adoptedhere is a signal which will answer when the abbey clock strikes nine come with care to the wicket which opens at the east side of the paddock on the road until then keep secret i had prepared this very signal in case an interview should be necessary  well he sees it returned cecilia who had resumed her place by the telescope and seems disposed to obey you for i no longer discern his flags or his person  miss howard now arose from before the glass her observations being ended but katherine did not return the instrument to its corner without fastening one long and anxious look through it on what now appeared to be the deserted tower the interest and anxiety produced by this short and imperfect communication between miss plowden and her lover did not fail to excite reflections in both the ladies that furnished materials to hold them in earnest discourse until the entrance of alice dunscombe announced that their presence was expected below even the unsuspecting alice on entering observed a change in the countenances and demeanor of the two cousins which betrayed that their secret conference had not been entirely without contention the features of cecilia were disturbed and anxious and their expression was not unlike melancholy while the dark flashing eye flushed temples and proud determined step of katherine exhibited in an equal if not a greater degree a very different emotion as no reference to the subject of their conversation was however made by either of the young ladies after the entrance of alice she led the way in silence to the drawingroom  the ladies were received by colonel howard and borroughcliffe with marked attention in the former there were moments when a deep gloom would in spite of his very obvious exertions to the contrary steal over his open generous countenance but the recruiting officer maintained an air of immovable coolness and composure twenty times did he detect the piercing looks of katherine fastened on him with an intentness that a less deliberative man might have had the vanity to misinterpret but even this flattering testimonial of his power to attract failed to disturb his selfpossession it was in vain that katherine endeavored to read his countenance where everything was fixed in military rigidity though his deportment appeared more than usually easy and natural tired at length with her fruitless scrutiny the excited girl turned her gaze upon the clock to her amazement she discovered that it was on the stroke of nine and disregarding a deprecating glance from her cousin she arose and quitted the apartment borroughcliffe opened the door for her exit and while the lady civilly bowed her head in acknowledgment of his attention their eyes once more met but she glided quickly by him and found herself alone in the gallery katherine hesitated more than a minute to proceed for she thought she had detected in that glance a lurking expression that manifested conscious security mingled with secret design it was not her nature however to hesitate when circumstances required that she should be both prompt and alert and throwing over her slight person a large cloak that was in readiness for the occasion she stole warily from the building  although katherine suspected most painfully that borroughcliffe had received intelligence that might prove dangerous to her lover she looked around her in vain on gaining the open air to discover any alteration in the arrangements for the defence of the abbey which might confirm her suspicions or the knowledge of which might enable her to instruct barnstable how to avoid the secret danger every disposition remained as it had been since the capture of griffith and his companion she heard the heavy quick steps of the sentinel who was posted beneath their windows endeavoring to warm himself on his confined post and as she paused to listen she also detected the rattling of arms from the soldier who as usual guarded the approach of that part of the building where his comrades were quartered the night had set in cloudy and dark although the gale had greatly subsided towards the close of the day still the wind swept heavily and at moments with a rushing noise among the irregular walls of the edifice and it required the utmost nicety of ear to distinguish even these wellknown sounds among such accompaniments when katherine however was satisfied that her organs had not deceived her she turned an anxious eye in the direction of what borroughcliffe called his barracks everything in that direction appeared so dark and still as to create a sensation of uneasiness by its very quiet it might be the silence of sleep that now pervaded the ordinarily gay and mirthful apartment or it might be the stillness of a fearful preparation there was no time however for further hesitation and katherine drew her cloak more closely about her form and proceeded with light and guarded steps to the appointed spot as she approached the wicket the clock struck the hour and she again paused while the mournful sounds were borne by her on the wind as if expecting that each stroke on the bell would prove a signal to unmask some secret design of borroughcliffe as the last vibration melted away she opened the little gate and issued on the highway the figure of a man sprang forward from behind an angle of the wall as she appeared and while her heart was still throbbing with the suddenness of the alarm she found herself in the arms of barnstable after the first few words of recognition and pleasure which the young sailor uttered he acquainted his mistress with the loss of his schooner and the situation of the survivors  and now katherine he concluded you have come i trust never to quit me or at most to return no more to that old abbey unless it be to aid in liberating griffith and then to join me again forever  why truly there is so much to tempt a young woman to renounce her home and friends in the description you have just given of your condition that i hardly know how to refuse your request barnstable you are very tolerably provided with a dwelling in the ruin and i suppose certain predatory schemes are to be adopted to make it habitable st ruth is certainly well supplied with the necessary articles but whether we should not be shortly removed to the castle at york or the jail at newcastle is a question that i put to your discretion  why yield your thoughts to such silly subjects lovely trifler said barnstable when the time and the occasion both urge us to be in earnest  it is a womans province to be thrifty and to look after the comforts of domestic life returned his mistress and i would discharge my functions with credit but i feel you are vexed for to see your dark countenance is out of the question on such a night when do you propose to commence housekeeping if i should yield to your proposals  i have not concluded relating my plans and your provoking wit annoys me the vessel i have taken will unquestionably come into the land as the gale dies and i intend making my escape in her after beating this englishman and securing the liberty of miss howard and yourself i could see the frigate in the offing even before we left the cliffs  this certainly sounds better rejoined katherine in a manner that indicated she was musing on their prospects and yet there may exist some difficulties in the way that you little suspect  difficulties there are nonethere can be none  speak not irreverently of the mazes of love mr barnstable when was it ever known to exist unfettered or unembarrassed even i have an explanation to ask of you that i would much rather let alone  of me ask what you will or how you will i am a careless unthinking fellow miss plowden but to you i have little to answer forunless a foolish sort of adoration be an offence against your merits  barnstable felt the little hand that was supported on his arm pressing the limb as katharine replied in a tone so changed from its former forced levity that he started as the first sounds reached his ears merry has brought in a horrid report she said i would i could believe it untrue but the looks of the boy and the absence of dillon both confirm it  poor merry he too has fallen into the trap but they shall yet find one who is too cunning for them is it to the fate of that wretched dillon that you allude  he was a wretch continued katherine in the same voice and he deserved much punishment at your hands barnstable but life is the gift of god and is not to be taken whenever human vengeance would appear to require a victim  his life was taken by him who bestowed it said the sailor is it katherine plowden who would suspect me of the deed of a dastard  i do not suspect youi did not suspect you cried katherine i will never suspect any evil of you again you are not you cannot be angry with me barnstable had you heard the cruel suspicions of my cousin cecilia and had your imagination been busy in portraying your wrongs and the temptations to forget mercy like mine even while my tongue denied your agency in the suspected deed you wouldyou would at least have learned how much easier it is to defend those we love against the open attacks of others than against our own jealous feelings  those words love and jealousy will obtain your acquittal cried barnstable in his natural voice and after uttering a few more consoling assurances to katherine whose excited feelings found vent in tears he briefly related the manner of dillons death  i had hoped i stood higher in the estimation of miss howard than to be subjected to even her suspicions he said when he had ended his explanation griffith has been but a sorry representative of our trade if he has left such an opinion of its pursuits  i do not know that mr griffith would altogether have escaped my conjectures had he been the disappointed commander and you the prisoner returned katherine you know not how much we have both studied the usages of war and with what dreadful pictures of hostages retaliations and military executions our minds are stored but a mountain is raised off my spirits and i could almost say that i am now ready to descend the valley of life in your company  it is a discreet determination my good katherine and god bless you for it the companion may not be so good as you deserve but you will find him ambitious of your praise now let us devise means to effect our object  therein lies another of my difficulties griffith i much fear will not urge cecilia to another flight against herherwhat shall i call it barnstableher caprice or her judgment cecilia will never consent to desert her uncle and i cannot muster the courage to abandon my poor cousin in the face of the world in order to take shelter with even mr richard barnstable  speak you from the heart now katherine  very nearlyif not exactly  then have i been cruelly deceived it is easier to find a path in the trackless ocean without chart or compass than to know the windings of a womans heart  nay nay foolish man you forget that i am but small and how very near my head is to my heart too nigh i fear for the discretion of their mistress but is there no method of forcing griffith and cecilia to their own good without undue violence  it cannot be done he is my senior in rank and the instant i release him he will claim the command a question might be raised at a leisure moment on the merits of such a claimbut even my own men are as you know nothing but a draft from the frigate and they would not hesitate to obey the orders of the first lieutenant who is not a man to trifle on matters of duty  tis vexatious truly said katherine that all my wellconcerted schemes in behalf of this wayward pair should be frustrated by their own willful conduct but after all have you justly estimated your strength barnstable are you certain that you would be successful and that without hazard too if you should make the attempt  morally and what is better physically certain my men are closely hid where no one suspects an enemy to lie they are anxious for the enterprise and the suddenness of the attack will not only make the victory sure but it will be rendered bloodless you will aid us in our entrance katherine i shall first secure this recruiting officer and his command will then surrender without striking a blow perhaps after all griffith will hear reason if he do not i will not yield my authority to a released captive without a struggle  god send that there shall be no fighting murmured his companion a little appalled at the images his language had raised before her imagination and barnstable i enjoin you most solemnly by all your affection for me and by everything you deem most sacred to protect the person of colonel howard at every hazard there must be no excuse no pretence for even an insult to my passionate good obstinate but kind old guardian i believe i have given him already more trouble than i am entitled to give any one and heaven forbid that i should cause him any serious misfortune  he shall be safe and not only he but all that are with him as you will perceive katherine when you hear my plan three hours shall not pass over my head before you will see me master of that old abbey griffith ay griffith must be content to be my inferior until we get afloat again  attempt nothing unless you feel certain of being able to maintain your advantage not only against your enemies but also against your friends said the anxious katherine rely on it both cecilia and griffith are refining so much on their feelings that neither will be your ally  this comes of passing the four best years of his life within walls of brick poring over latin grammars and syntaxes and such other nonsense when he should have been rolling them away in a good box of liveoak and studying at most how to sum up his days work and tell where his ship lies after a blow your college learning may answer well enough for a man who has to live by his wits but it can be of little use to one who is never afraid to read human nature by looking his fellow creatures full in the face and whose hand is as ready as his tongue i have generally found the eye that was good at latin was dull at a compass or in a night squall and yet griff is a seaman though i have heard him even read the testament in greek thank god i had the wisdom to run away from school the second day they undertook to teach me a strange tongue and i believe i am the more honest man and the better seaman for my ignorance  there is no telling what you might have been barnstable under other circumstances retorted his mistress with a playfulness of manner that she could not always repress though it was indulged at the expense of him she most loved i doubt not but under proper training you would have made a reasonably good priest  if you talk of priests katherine i shall remind you that we carry one in the ship but listen to my plan we may talk further of priestcraft when an opportunity may offer  barnstable then proceeded to lay before his mistress a project he had formed for surprising the abbey that night which was so feasible that katharine notwithstanding her recent suspicions of borroughcliffes designs came gradually to believe it would succeed the young seaman answered her objections with the readiness of an ardent mind bent on executing its purposes and with a fertility of resources that proved he was no contemptible enemy in matters that required spirited action of merrys remaining firm and faithful he had no doubt and although he acknowledged the escape of the peddler boy he urged that the lad had seen no other of his party besides himself whom he mistook for a common marauder  as the disclosure of these plans was frequently interrupted by little digressions connected with the peculiar motions of the lovers more than an hour flew by before they separated but katherine at length reminded him how swiftly the time was passing and how much remained to be done when he reluctantly consented to see her once more through the wicket where they parted  miss plowden adopted the same precaution in returning to the house she had used on leaving it and she was congratulating herself on its success when her eye caught a glimpse of the figure of a man who was apparently following at some little distance in her footsteps and dogging her motions as the obscure form however paused also when she stopped to give it an alarmed though inquiring look and then slowly retired towards the boundary of the paddock katherine believing it to be barnstable watching over her safety entered the abbey with every idea of alarm entirely lost in the pleasing reflection of her lovers solicitude     chapter xxviii    he looks abroad and soon appears   oer horncliffehill a plump of spears   beneath a pennon gay   marmion   the sharp sounds of the supperbell were ringing along the gallery as miss plowden gained the gloomy passage and she quickened her steps to join the ladies in order that no further suspicions might be excited by her absencealice dunscombe was already proceeding to the dining parlor as katherine passed through the door of the drawingroom but miss howard had loitered behind and was met by her cousin alone  you have then been so daring as to venture katherine exclaimed cecilia  i have returned the other throwing herself into a chair to recover her agitationi have cecilia and i have met barnstable who will soon be in the abbey and its master  the blood which had rushed to the face of cecilia on first seeing her cousin now retreated to her heart leaving every part of her fine countenance of the whiteness of her polished temples as she said  and we are to have a night of blood  we are to have a night of freedom miss howard freedom to you and to me to andrew merry to griffith and to his companion  what freedom more than we now enjoy katherine is needed by two young women think you i can remain silent and see my uncle betrayed before my eyes his life perhaps endangered  your own life and person will not be held more sacred cecilia howard than that of your uncle if you will condemn griffith to a prison and perhaps to a gibbet betray barnstable as you have threatenedan opportunity will not be wanting at the suppertable whither i shall lead the way since the mistress of the house appears to forget her duty  katharine arose and with a firm step and proud eye she moved along the gallery to the room where their presence was expected by the rest of the family cecilia followed in silence and the whole party immediately took their several places at the board  the first few minutes were passed in the usual attentions of the gentlemen to the ladies and the ordinary civilities of the table during which katherine had so far regained the equanimity of her feelings as to commence a watchful scrutiny of the manners and looks of her guardian and borroughcliffe in which she determined to persevere until the eventful hour when she was to expect barnstable should arrive colonel howard had however so far got the command of himself as no longer to betray his former abstraction in its place katherine fancied at moments that she could discover a settled look of conscious security mingled a little with an expression of severe determination such as in her earlier days she had learned to dread as sure indications of the indignant but upright justice of an honorable mind borroughcliffe on the other hand was cool polite and as attentive to the viands as usual with the alarming exception of discovering much less devotion to the pride of the vineyards than he commonly manifested on such occasions in this manner the meal passed by and the cloth was removed though the ladies appeared willing to retain their places longer than was customary colonel howard filling up the glasses of alice dunscombe and himself passed the bottle to the recruiting officer and with a sort of effort that was intended to rouse the dormant cheerfulness of his guests cried  come borroughcliffe the ruby lips of your neighbors would be still more beautiful were they moistened with this rich cordial and that too accompanied by some loyal sentiment miss alice is ever ready to express her fealty to her sovereign in her name i can give the health of his most sacred majesty with defeat and death to all traitors  if the prayers of an humble subject and one of a sex that has but little need to mingle in the turmoil of the world and that has less right to pretend to understand the subtleties of statesmen can much avail a high and mighty prince like him who sits on the throne then will he never know temporal evil returned alice meekly but i cannot wish death to any one not even to my enemies if any i have and much less to a people who are the children of the same family with myself  children of the same family the colonel repeated slowly and with a bitterness of manner that did not fail to attract the painful interest of katherine children of the same family ay even as absalom was the child of david or as judas was of the family of the holy apostles but let it pass unpledgedlet it pass the accursed spirit of rebellion has invaded my dwelling and i no longer know where to find one of my household that has not been assailed by its malign influence  assailed i may have been among others returned alice but not corrupted if purity in this instance consists in loyalty  what sound is that interrupted the colonel with startling suddenness was it not the crash of some violence captain borroughcliffe  it may have been one of my rascals who has met with a downfall in passing from the festive boardwhere you know i regale them tonight in honor of our successto his blanket returned the captain with admirable indifference or it may be the very spirit of whom you have spoken so freely my host that has taken umbrage at your remarks and is passing from the hospitable walls of st ruth into the open air without submitting to the small trouble of ascertaining the position of doors in the latter case there may be some dozen perches or so of wall to replace in the morning  the colonel who had risen glanced his eyes uneasily from the speaker to the door and was evidently but little disposed to enter into the pleasantry of his guest  there are unusual noises captain borroughcliffe in the grounds of the abbey if not in the building itself he said advancing with a fine military air from the table to the centre of the room and as master of the mansion i will inquire who it is that thus unseasonably disturbs these domains if as friends they shall have welcome though their visit be unexpected and if enemies they shall also meet with such a reception as will become an old soldier  no no cried cecilia entirely thrown off her guard by the manner and language of the veteran and rushing into his arms go not out my uncle go not into the terrible fray my kind my good uncle you are old you have already done more than your duty why should you be exposed to danger  the girl is mad with terror borroughcliffe cried the colonel bending his glistening eyes fondly on his niece and you will have to furnish my goodfornothing gouty old person with a corporals guard to watch my nightcap or the silly child will have an uneasy pillow till the sun rises once more but you do not stir sir  why should i cried the captain miss plowden yet deigns to keep me company and it is not in the nature of one of the th to desert his bottle and his standard at the same moment for to a true soldier the smiles of a lady are as imposing in the parlor as the presence of his colors in the field  i continue undisturbed captain borroughcliffe said katherine because i have not been an inhabitant for so many months of st ruth and not learned to know the tunes which the wind can play among its chimneys and pointed roofs the noise which has taken colonel howard from his seat and which has so unnecessarily alarmed my cousin cicely is nothing but the Æolian harp of the abbey sounding a double bass  the captain fastened on her composed countenance while she was speaking a look of open admiration that brought though tardily the color more deeply to her cheeks and he answered with something extremely equivocal both in his emphasis and his air  i have avowed my allegiance and i will abide by it so long as miss plowden will deign to bestow her company so long will she find me among her most faithful and persevering attendants come who may or what will  you compel me to retire returned katherine rising whatever may have been my gracious intentions in the matter for even female vanity must crimson at an adoration so profound as that which can chain captain borroughcliffe to a suppertable as your alarm has now dissipated my cousin will you lead the way miss alice and myself attend you  but not into the paddock surely miss plowden said the captain the door the key of which you have just turned communicates with the vestibule this is the passage to the drawingroom  the lady faintly laughed as if in derision of her own forgetfulness while she bowed her acknowledgment and moved towards the proper passage she observed  the madness of fear has assailed some i believe who have been able to affect a better disguise than miss howard  is it the fear of present danger or of that which is in reserve asked the captain but as you have stipulated so generously in behalf of my worthy host here and of one also who shall be nameless because he has not deserved such a favor at your hands your safety shall be one of my especial duties in these times of peril  there is peril then exclaimed cecilia your looks announce it captain borroughcliffe the changing countenance of my cousin tells me that my fears are too true  the soldier had now risen also and casting aside the air of badinage which he so much delighted in he came forward into the centre of the apartment with the manner of one who felt it was time to be serious  a soldier is ever in peril when the enemies of his king are at hand miss howard he answered and that such is now the case miss plowden can testify if she will but you are the allies of both parties retire then to your own apartments and await the result of the struggle which is at hand  you speak of danger and hidden perils said alice dunscombe know ye aught that justifies your fears  i know all borroughcliffe coolly replied  all exclaimed katherine  all echoed alice in tones of horror if then you know all you must know his desperate courage and powerful hand when opposedyield in quiet and he will not harm ye believe me believe one who knows his very nature that no lamb can be more gentle than he would be with unresisting women nor any lion more fierce with his enemies  as we happen not to be of the feminine gender returned borroughcliffe with an air somewhat splenetic we must abide the fury of the king of beasts his paw is even now at the outer door and if my orders have been obeyed his entrance will be yet easier than that of the wolf to the respectable female ancestor of the little redriding hood  stay your hand for one single moment said katherine breathless with interest you are the master of my secret captain borroughcliffe and bloodshed may be the consequence i can yet go forward and perhaps save many inestimable lives pledge to me your honor that they who come hither as your enemies this night shall depart in peace and i will pledge to you my life for the safety of the abbey  oh hear her and shed not human blood cried cecilla  a loud crash interrupted further speech and the sounds of heavy footsteps were heard in the adjoining room as if many men were alighting on its floor in quick succession borroughcliffe drew back with great coolness to the opposite side of the large apartment and took a sheathed sword from the table where it had been placed at the same moment the door was burst open and barnstable entered alone but heavily armed  you are my prisoners gentlemen said the sailor as he advanced resistance is useless and without it you shall receive favor ha miss plowden my advice was that you should not be present at this scene  barnstable we are betrayed cried the agitated katherine but it is not yet too late blood has not yet been spilt and you can retire without that dreadful alternative with honor go then delay not another moment for should the soldiers of captain borroughcliffe come to the rescue of their commander the abbey would be a scene of horror  go you away go katherine said her lover with impatience this is no place for such as you but captain borroughcliffe if such be your name you must perceive that resistance is in vain i have ten good pikes in this outer room in twenty better hands and it will be madness to fight against such odds  show me your strength said the captain that i may take counsel with mine honor  your honor shall be appeased my brave soldier for such is your bearing though your livery is my aversion and your cause most unholy heave ahead boys but hold your hands for orders  the party of fiercelooking sailors whom barnstable led on receiving this order rushed into the room in a medley but notwithstanding the surly glances and savage characters of their dress and equipments they struck no blow nor committed any act of hostility the ladies shrank back appalled as this terrific little band took possession of the hall and even borroughcliffe was seen to fall back towards a door which in some measure covered his retreat the confusion of this sudden movement had not yet subsided when sounds of strife were heard rapidly approaching from a distant part of the building and presently one of the numerous doors of the apartment was violently opened when two of the garrison of the abbey rushed into the hall vigorously pressed by twice their number of seamen seconded by griffith manual and merry who were armed with such weapons of offence as had presented themselves to their hands at their unexpected liberation there was a movement on the part of the seamen who were already in possession of the room that threatened instant death to the fugitives but barnstable beat down their pikes with his sword and sternly ordered them to fall back surprise produced the same pacific result among the combatants and as the soldiers hastily sought a refuge behind their own officers and the released captives with their liberators joined the body of their friends the quiet of the hall which had been so rudely interrupted was soon restored  you see sir said barnstable after grasping the hands of griffith and manual in a warm and cordial pressure that all my plans have succeeded your sleeping guard are closely watched in their barracks by one party our officers are released and your sentinels cut off by another while with a third i hold the centre of the abbey and am substantially in possession of your own person in consideration therefore of what is due to humanity and to the presence of these ladies let there be no struggle i shall impose no difficult terms nor any long imprisonment  the recruiting officer manifested a composure throughout the whole scene that would have excited some uneasiness in his invaders had there been opportunity for minute observation but his countenance now gradually assumed an appearance of anxiety and his head was frequently turned as if listening for further and more important interruptions he answered however to this appeal with his ordinary deliberation  you speak of conquests sir before they are achieved my venerable host and myself are not so defenceless as you may chose to imagine while speaking he threw aside the cloth of a side table from beneath which the colonel and himself were instantly armed with a brace of pistols each here are the deathwarrants of four of your party and these brave fellows at my back can account for two more i believe my transatlantic warrior that we are now something in the condition of cortes and the mexicans when the former overran part of your continent i being cortes armed with artificial thunder and lightning and you the indians with nothing but your pikes and sling and such other antediluvian inventions shipwrecks and seawater are fatal dampers of gunpowder  that we are unprovided with firearms i will not deny said barnstable but we are men who are used from infancy to depend on our good right arms for life and safety and we know how to use them though we should even grapple with death as for the trifles in your hands gentlemen you are not to suppose that men who are trained to look in at one end of a thirtytwo pounder loaded with grape while the match is put to the other will so much as wink at their report though you fired them by fifties what say you boys is a pistol a weapon to repel boarders  the discordant and disdainful laughs that burst from the restrained seamen were a sufficient pledge of their indifference to so trifling a danger borroughcliffe noted their hardened boldness and taking the supper bell which was lying near him he rang it for a minute with great violence the heavy tread of trained footsteps soon followed this extraordinary summons and presently the several doors of the apartment were opened and filled with armed soldiers wearing the livery of the english crown  if you hold these smaller weapons in such vast contempt said the recruiting officer when he perceived that his men had possessed themselves of all the avenues it is in my power to try the virtue of some more formidable after this exhibition of my strength gentlemen i presume you cannot hesitate to submit as prisoners of war  the seamen had been formed in something like military array by the assiduity of manual during the preceding dialogue and as the different doors had discovered fresh accessions to the strength of the enemy the marine industriously offered new fronts until the small party was completely arranged in a hollow square that might have proved formidable in a charge bristled as it was with the deadly pikes of the ariel  here has been some mistake said griffith after glancing his eye at the formidable array of the soldiers i take precedence of mr barnstable and i shall propose to you captain borroughcliffe terms that may remove this scene of strife from the dwelling of colonel howard  the dwelling of colonel howard cried the veteran is the dwelling of his king or of the meanest servant of the crown so borroughcliffe spare not the traitors on my behalf accept no other terms than such unconditional submission as is meet to exact from the rebellious subjects of the anointed of the lord  while griffith spoke barnstable folded his arms in affected composure and glanced his eyes expressively at the shivering katherine who with her companions still continued agitated spectators of all that passed chained to the spot by their apprehensions but to this formidable denunciation of the master of the abbey he deemed proper to reply  now by every hope i have of sleeping again on salt water old gentleman if it were not for the presence of these three trembling females i should feel tempted to dispute at once the title of his majesty you may make such a covenant as you will with mr griffith but if it contain one syllable about submission to your king or of any other allegiance than that which i owe to the continental congress and the state of massachusetts you may as well consider the terms violated at once for not an article of such an agreement will i consider as binding on me or on any that shall choose to follow me as leader  here are but two leaders mr barnstable interrupted the haughty griffith the one of the enemy and the other of the arms of america captain borroughclffe to you as the former i address myself the great objects of the contest which now unhappily divides england from her ancient colonies can be in no degree affected by the events of this night while on the other hand by a rigid adherence to military notions much private evil and deep domestic calamity must follow any struggle in such a place we have but to speak sir and these rude men who already stand impatiently handling their instruments of death will aim them at each others lives and who can say that he shall be able to stay their hands when and where he will i know you to be a soldier and that you are not yet to learn how much easier it is to stimulate to blood than to glut vengeance  borroughcliffe unused to the admission of violent emotions and secure in the superiority of his own party both in numbers and equipments heard him with the coolest composure to the end and then answered in his customary manner  i honor your logic sir your premises are indisputable and the conclusion most obvious commit then these worthy tars to the good keeping of honest drill who will see their famished natures revived by divers eatables and a due proportion of suitable fluids while we can discuss the manner in which you are to return to the colonies around a bottle of liquor which my friend manual there assures me has come from the sunny side of the island of madeira to be drunk in a bleak corner of that of britain by my palate but the rascals brighten at the thought they know by instinct sir that a shipwrecked mariner is a fitter companion to a ration of beef and a pot of porter than to such unsightly things as bayonets and boardingpikes  trifle not unseasonably exclaimed the impatient young sailor you have the odds in numbers but whether it will avail you much in a deadly struggle of hand to hand is a question you must put to your prudence we stand not here to ask terms but to grant them you must be brief sir for the time is wasting while we delay  i have offered to you the means of obtaining in perfection the enjoyment of the three most ancient of the numerous family of the arts eating drinking and sleeping what more do you require  that you order these men who fill the pass to the outer door to fall back and give us room i would take in peace these armed men from before the eyes of those who are unused to such sights before you oppose this demand think how easily these hardy fellows could make a way for themselves against your divided force  your companion the experienced captain manual will tell you that such a manoeuvre would be very unmilitary with a superior body in your rear  i have not leisure sir for this folly cried the indignant griffith do you refuse us an unmolested retreat from the abbey  i do  griffith turned with a look of extreme emotion to the ladies and beckoned to them to retire unable to give utterance to his wishes in words after a moment of deep silence however he once more addressed borroughcliffe in the tones of conciliation  if manual and myself will return to our prisons and submit to the will of your government he said can the rest of the party return to the frigate unmolested  they cannot replied the soldier who perceiving that the crisis approached was gradually losing his artificial deportment in the interest of the moment you and all others who willingly invade the peace of these realms must abide the issue  then god protect the innocent and defend the right  amen  give way villains cried griffith facing the party that held the outer door give way or you shall be riddled with our pikes  show them your muzzles men shouted borroughcliffe but pull no trigger till they advance  there was an instant of bustle and preparation in which the rattling of firearms blended with the suppressed execrations and threats of the intended combatants and cecilia and katherine had both covered their faces to veil the horrid sight that was momentarily expected when alice dunscombe advanced boldly between the points of the threatening weapons and spoke in a voice that stayed the hands that were already uplifted  hear me men if men ye be and not demons thirsting for each others blood though ye walk abroad in the semblance of him who died that ye might be elevated to the rank of angels call ye this war is this the glory that is made to warm the hearts of even silly and confiding women is the peace of families to be destroyed to gratify your wicked lust for conquest and is life to be taken in vain in order that ye may boast of the foul deed in your wicked revels fall back then ye british soldiers if ye be worthy of that name and give passage to a woman and remember that the first shot that is fired will be buried in her bosom  the men thus enjoined shrank before her commanding mien and a way was made for her exit through that very door which griffith had in vain solicited might be cleared for himself and party but alice instead of advancing appeared to have suddenly lost the use of those faculties which had already effected so much her figure seemed rooted to the spot where she had spoken and her eyes were fixed in a settled gaze as if dwelling on some horrid object while she yet stood in this attitude of unconscious helplessness the doorway became again darkened and the figure of the pilot was seen on its threshold clad as usual in the humble vestments of his profession but heavily armed with the weapons of naval war for an instant he stood a silent spectator of the scene and then advanced calmly but with searching eyes into the centre of the apartment     chapter xxix    don pedro welcome signior you are almost come to part almost a fray   much ado about nothing   down with your arms you englishmen said the daring intruder and you who fight in the cause of sacred liberty stay your hands that no unnecessary blood may flow yield yourself proud briton to the power of the thirteen republics  ha exclaimed borroughcliffe grasping a pistol with an air of great resolution the work thickensi had not included this man in my estimate of their numbers is he a samson that his single arm can change the face of things so suddenly down with your own weapon you masquerader or at the report of this pistol your body shall be made a target for twenty bullets  and thine for a hundred returned the pilotwithout there wind your call fellow and bring in our numbers we will let this confident gentleman feel his weakness  he had not done speaking before the shrill whistle of a boatswain rose gradually on the ears of the listeners until the sense of hearing became painfully oppressed by the piercing sounds that rang under the arched roof of the hall and penetrated even to the most distant recesses of the abbey a tremendous rush of men followed who drove in before them the terrified fragment of borroughcliffes command that had held the vestibule and the outer room became filled with a dark mass of human bodies  let them hear ye lads cried their leader the abbey is your own  the roaring of a tempest was not louder than the shout that burst from his followers who continued their cheers peal on peal until the very roof of the edifice appeared to tremble with their vibrations numerous dark and shaggy heads were seen moving around the passage some cased in the ironbound caps of the frigates boarders and others glittering with the brazen ornaments of her marine guard the sight of the latter did not fail to attract the eye of manual who rushed among the throng and soon reappeared followed by a trusty band of his own men who took possession of the post held by the soldiers of borroughcliffe while the dialogue was continued between the leaders of the adverse parties  thus far colonel howard had yielded to his guest with a deep reverence for the principles of military subordination the functions of a commander but now that affairs appeared to change so materially he took on himself the right to question these intruders into his dwelling  by what authority sir the colonel demanded is it that you dare thus to invade the castle of a subject of this realm do you come backed by the commission of the lord lieutenant of the county or has your warrant the signature of his majestys secretary for the home department  i bear no commission from any quarter returned the pilot i rank only an humble follower of the friends of america and having led these gentlemen into danger i have thought it my duty to see them extricated they are now safe and the right to command all that hear me rests with mr griffith who is commissioned by the continental congress for such service  when he had spoken he fell back from the position he occupied in the centre of the room to one of its sides where leaning his body against the wainscot he stood a silent observer of what followed  it appears then that it is to you degenerate son of a most worthy father that i must repeat my demand continued the veteran by what right is my dwelling thus rudely assailed and why is my quiet and the peace of those i protect so daringly violated  i might answer you colonel howard by saying that it is according to the laws of arms or rather in retaliation for the thousand evils that your english troops have inflicted between maine and georgia but i wish not to increase the unpleasant character of this scene and i therefore will tell you that our advantage shall be used with moderation the instant that our men can be collected and our prisoners properly secured your dwelling shall be restored to your authority we are no freebooters sir and you will find it so after our departure captain manual draw off your guard into the grounds and make your dispositions for a return march to our boatslet the boarders fall back there out with ye out with yetumble out you boarders  the amicable order of the young lieutenant which was delivered after the stern quick fashion of his profession operated on the cluster of dark figures that were grouped around the door like a charm and as the men whom barnstable had led followed their shipmates into the courtyard the room was now left to such only as might be termed the gentlemen of the invading party and the family of colonel howard  barnstable had continued silent since his senior officer had assumed the command listening most attentively to each syllable that fell from either side but now that so few remained and the time pressed he spoke again  if we are to take boat so soon mr griffith it would be seemly that due preparations should be made to receive the ladies who are to honor us with their presence shall i take that duty on myself  the abrupt proposal produced a universal surprise in his hearers though the abashed and conscious expression of katherine plowdens features sufficiently indicated that to her at least it was not altogether unexpected the long silence that succeeded the question was interrupted by colonel howard  ye are masters gentlemen help yourselves to whatever best suits your inclinations my dwelling my goods and my wards are alike at your disposalor perhaps miss alice here good and kind miss alice dunscombe may suit the taste of some among ye ah edward griffith edward griffith little did i ever  breathe not that name in levity again thou scoffer or even your years may prove a feeble protection said a stern startling voice from behind all eyes turned involuntarily at the unexpected sounds and the muscular form of the pilot was seen resuming its attitude of repose against the wall though every fibre of his frame was working with suppressed passion  when the astonished looks of griffith ceased to dwell on this extraordinary exhibition of interest in his companion they were turned imploringly towards the fair cousins who still occupied the distant corner whither fear had impelled them  i have said that we are not midnight marauders colonel howard he replied but if any there be here who will deign to commit themselves to our keeping i trust it will not be necessary to say at this hour what will be their reception  we have not time for unnecessary compliments cried the impatient barnstable here is merry who by years and blood is a suitable assistant for them in arranging their little baggagewhat say you urchin can you play the ladys maid on emergency  ay sir and better than i acted the peddler boy cried the gay youngster to have my merry cousin kate and my good cousin cicely for shipmates i could play our common grandmother come coz let us be moving you will have to allow a little leeway in time for my awkwardness  stand back young man said miss howard repulsing his familiar attempt to take her arm and then advancing with a maidenly dignity nigher to her guardian she continued i cannot know what stipulations have been agreed to by my cousin plowden in the secret treaty she has made this night with mr barnstable this for myself colonel howard i would have you credit your brothers child when she says that to her the events of the hour have not been more unexpected than to yourself  the veteran gazed at her for a moment with an expression of his eye that denoted reviving tenderness but gloomy doubts appeared to cross his mind again and he shook his head as he walked proudly away  nay then added cecilia her head dropping meekly on her bosom i may be discredited by my uncle but i cannot be disgraced without some act of my own  she slowly raised her mild countenance again and bending her eyes on her lover she continued while a rich rush of blood passed over her fine features  edward griffith i will not i cannot say how humiliating it is to think that you can for an instant believe i would again forget myself so much as to wish to desert him whom god has given me for a protector for one chosen by my own erring passions and you andrew merry learn to respect the child of your mothers sister if not for her own sake at least for that of her who watched your cradle  here appears to be some mistake said barnstable who participated however in no trifling degree in the embarrassment of the abashed boy but like all other mistakes on such subjects it can be explained away i suppose mr griffith it remains for you to speakdamn it man he whispered you are as dumb as a codfishi am sure so fine a woman is worth a little fairweather talkyou are muter than a four footed beasteven an ass can bray  we will hasten our departure mr barnstable said griffith sighing heavily and rousing himself as if from a trance these rude sights cannot but appall the ladies you will please sir to direct the order of our march to the shore captain manual has charge of our prisoners who must all be secured to answer for an equal number of our own countrymen  and our countrywomen said barnstable are they to be forgotten in the selfish recollection of our own security  with them we have no right to interfere unless at their request  by heaven mr griffith this may smack of learning cried the other and it may plead bookish authority as its precedent but let me tell you sir it savors but little of a sailors love  is it unworthy of a seaman and a gentleman to permit the woman he calls his mistress to be so other than in name  well then griff i pity you from my soul i would rather have had a sharp struggle for the happiness that i shall now obtain so easily than that you should be thus cruelly disappointed but you cannot blame me my friend that i avail myself of fortunes favor miss plowden your fair hand colonel howard i return you a thousand thanks for the care you have taken hitherto of this precious charge and believe me sir that i speak frankly when i say that next to myself i should choose to entrust her with you in preference to any man on earth  the colonel turned to the speaker and bowed low while he answered with grave courtesy  sir you repay my slight services with too much gratitude if miss katherine plowden has not become under my guardianship all that her good father captain john plowden of the royal navy could have wished a daughter of his to be the fault unquestionably is to be attributed to my inability to instruct and to no inherent quality in the young lady herself i will not say take her sir since you have her in your possession already and it would be out of my power to alter the arrangement therefore i can only wish that you may find her as dutiful as a wife as she has been hitherto as a ward and a subject  katherine had yielded her hand passively to her lover and suffered him to lead her more into the circle than she had before been but now she threw off his arm and shaking aside the dark curls which she had rather invited to fall in disorder around her brow she raised her face and looked proudly up with an eye that sparkled with the spirit of its mistress and a face that grew pale with emotion at each moment as she proceeded  gentlemen the one may be as ready to receive as the other is to reject but has the daughter of john plowden no voice in this cool disposal of her person if her guardian tires of her presence other habitations may be found without inflicting so severe a penalty on this gentleman as to compel him to provide for her accommodation in a vessel which must be already straitened for room  she turned and rejoined her cousin with such an air of maidenly resentment as a young woman would be apt to discover who found herself the subject of matrimonial arrangement without her own feelings being at all consulted barnstable who knew but little of the windings of the female heart or how necessary to his mistress notwithstanding her previous declarations the countenance of cecilia was to any decided and open act in his favor stood in stupid wonder at her declaration he could not conceive that a woman who had already ventured so much in secret in his behalf and who had so often avowed her weakness should shrink to declare it again at such a crisis though the eyes of a universe were on her he looked from one of the party to the other and met in every face an expression of delicate reserve except in those of the guardian of his mistress and of borroughcliffe  the colonel had given a glance of returning favor at her whom he now conceived to be his repentant ward while the countenance of the entrapped captain exhibited a look of droll surprise blended with the expression of bitter ferocity it had manifested since the discovery of his own mishap  perhaps sir said barnstable addressing the latter fiercely you see something amusing about the person of this lady to divert you thus unseasonably we tolerate no such treatment of our women in america  nor do we quarrel before ours in england returned the soldier throwing back the fierce glance of the sailor with interest but i was thinking of the revolutions that time can produce nothing more i do assure you it is not half an hour since i thought myself a most happy fellow secure in my plans for overreaching the scheme you had laid to surprise me and now i am as miserable a dog as wears a single epaulette and has no hope of seeing its fellow  and in what manner sir can this sudden change apply to me asked katherine with all her spirit  certainly not to your perseverance in the project to assist my enemies madam returned the soldier with affected humility nor to your zeal for their success or your consummate coolness at the suppertable but i find it is time that i should be superannuatedi can no longer serve my king with credit and should take to serving my god like all other wornout men of the world my hearing is surely defective or a paddock wall has a most magical effect in determining sounds  katherine waited not to hear the close of this sentence but walked to a distant part of the room to conceal the burning blushes that covered her countenance the manner in which the plans of barnstable had become known to his foe was no longer a mystery her conscience also reproached her a little with some unnecessary coquetry as she remembered that quite onehalf of the dialogue between her lover and herself under the shadow of that very wall to which borroughcliffe alluded had been on a subject altogether foreign to contention and tumults as the feelings of barnstable were by no means so sensitive as those of his mistress and his thoughts much occupied with the means of attaining his object he did not so readily comprehend the indirect allusion of the soldier but turned abruptly away to griffith and observed with a serious air  i feel it my duty mr griffith to suggest that we have standing instructions to secure all the enemies of america wherever they may be found and to remind you that the states have not hesitated to make prisoners of females in many instances  bravo cried borroughcliffe if the ladies will not go as your mistresses take them as your captives  tis well for you sir that you are a captive yourself or you should be made to answer for this speech retorted the irritated barnstable it is a responsible command mr griffith and must not be disregarded  to your duty mr barnstable said griffith again rousing from deep abstraction you have your orders sir let them be executed promptly  i have also the orders of our common superior captain munson mr griffith and i do assure you sir that in making out my instructions for the arielpoor thing there are no two of her timbers hanging togetherbut my instructions were decidedly particular on that head  and my orders now supersede them  but am i justifiable in obeying a verbal order from an inferior in direct opposition to a written instruction  griffith had hitherto manifested in his deportment nothing more than a cold determination to act but the blood now flew to every vessel in his cheeks and forehead and his dark eyes flashed fire as he cried authoritatively  how sir do you hesitate to obey  by heaven sir i would dispute the command of the continental congress itself should they bid me so far to forget my duty toto  add yourself sirmr barnstable let this be the last of it to your duty sir  my duty calls me here mr griffith  i must act then or be bearded by my own officers mr merry direct captain manual to send in a sergeant and a file of marines  bid him come on himself cried barnstable maddened to desperation by his disappointment tis not his whole corps that can disarm melet them come on hear there you ariels rally around your captain  the man among them who dares to cross that threshold without my order dies cried griffith menacing with a naked hanger the seamen who had promptly advanced at the call of their old commander yield your sword mr barnstable and spare yourself the disgrace of having it forced from you by a common soldier  let me see the dog who dare attempt it exclaimed barnstable flourishing his weapon in fierce anger griffith had extended his own arm in the earnestness of his feelings and their hangers crossed each other the clashing of the steel operated on both like the sound of the clarion on a warhorse and there were sudden and rapid blows and as rapid parries exchanged between the flashing weapons  barnstable barnstable cried katherine rushing into his arms i will go with you to the ends of the earth  cecilia howard did not speak but when griffith recovered his coolness he beheld her beautiful form kneeling at his feet with her pale face bent imploringly on his own disturbed countenance the cry of miss plowden had separated the combatants before an opportunity for shedding blood had been afforded but the young men exchanged looks of keen resentment notwithstanding the interference of their mistresses at this moment colonel howard advanced and raising his niece from her humble posture said  this is not a situation for a child of harry howard though she knelt in the presence and before the throne of her sovereign behold my dear cecilia the natural consequences of this rebellion it scatters discord in their ranks and by its damnable leveling principles destroys all distinction of rank among themselves even these rash boys know not where obedience is due  it is due to me said the pilot who now stepped forward among the agitated group and it is time that i enforce it mr griffith sheathe your sword and you sir who have defied the authority of your senior officer and have forgotten the obligation of your oath submit and return to your duty  griffith started at the sounds of his calm voice as if with sudden recollection and then bowing low he returned the weapon to its scabbard but barnstable still encircled the waist of his mistress with one arm while with the other he brandished his hanger and laughed with scorn at this extraordinary assumption of authority  and who is this he cried who dare give such an order to me  the eyes of the pilot flashed with a terrible fire while a fierce glow seemed to be creeping over his whole frame which actually quivered with passion but suppressing this exhibition of his feelings by a sudden and powerful effort he answered in an emphatic manner  one who has a right to order and who will be obeyed  the extraordinary manner of the speaker contributed as much as his singular assertion to induce barnstable in his surprise to lower the point of his weapon with an air that might easily have been mistaken for submission the pilot fastened his glowing eyes on him for an instant and then turning to the rest of the listeners he continued more mildly  it is true that we came not here as marauders and that our wish is to do no unnecessary acts of severity to the aged and the helpless but this officer of the crown and this truant american in particular are fairly our prisoners as such they must be conducted on board our ship  but the main object of our expedition said griffith  tis lost returned the pilot hastilytis sacrificed to more private feelings tis like a hundred others ended in disappointment and is forgotten sir forever but the interests of the republics must not be neglected mr griffiththough we are not madly to endanger the lives of those gallant fellows to gain a lovesmile from one young beauty neither are we to forget the advantages they may have obtained for us in order to procure one of approbation from another this colonel howard will answer well in a bargain with the minions of the crown and may purchase the freedom of some worthy patriot who is deserving of his liberty nay nay suppress that haughty look and turn that proud eye on any rather than me he goes to the frigate sir and that immediately  then said cecilia howard timidly approaching the spot where her uncle stood a disdainful witness of the dissensions among his captors then will i go with him he shall never be a resident among his enemies alone  it would be more ingenuous and more worthy of my brothers daughter said her uncle coldly if she ascribed her willingness to depart to its proper motive disregarding the look of deep distress with which cecilia received this mortifying rejection of her tender attention the old man on receiving this order rushed into the room in a medley but notwithstanding the surly glances and savage characters of their dress and equipments they struck no blow nor committed any act of hostility the ladies shrank back appalled as this terrific little band took possession of the hall and even borroughcliffe was seen to fall back towards a door which in some measure covered his retreat the confusion of this sudden movement had not yet subsided when sounds of strife were heard rapidly approaching from a distant part of the building and presently one of the numerous doors of the apartment was violently opened when two of the garrison of the abbey rushed into the hall vigorously pressed by twice their number of seamen seconded by griffith manual and merry who were armed with such weapons of offence as had presented themselves to their hands at their unexpected liberation there was a movement on the part of the seamen who were already in possession of the room that threatened instant death to the fugitives but barnstable beat down their pikes with his sword and sternly ordered them to fall back surprise produced the same pacific result among the combatants and as the soldiers hastily sought a refuge behind their own officers and the released captives with their liberators joined the body of their friends the quiet of the hall which had been so rudely interrupted was soon restored  you see sir said barnstable after grasping the hands of griffith and manual in a warm and cordial pressure that all my plans have succeeded your sleeping guard are closely watched in their barracks by one party our officers are released and your sentinels cut off by another while with a third i hold the centre of the abbey and am substantially in possession of your own person in consideration therefore of what is due to humanity and to the presence of these ladies let there be no struggle i shall impose no difficult terms nor any long imprisonment  the recruiting officer manifested a composure throughout it and the latter laughing and indulging those buoyant spirits that a boy of his years and reflection might be supposed to feel even in such a scene it was fortunate for her cousin that katherine had possessed so much forethought for the attention of cecilia howard was directed much more to the comforts of her uncle than to those which were necessary for herself attended by alice dunscombe the young mistress of st ruth moved through the solitary apartments of the building listening to the mild religious consolation of her companion in silence at times yielding to those bursts of mortified feeling that she could not repress or again as calmly giving her orders to her maids as if the intended movement was one of but ordinary interest all this time the party in the dininghall remained stationary the pilot as if satisfied with what he had already done sank back to his reclining attitude against the wall though his eyes keenly watched every movement of the preparations in a manner which denoted that his was the master spirit that directed the whole griffith had however resumed in appearance the command and the busy seamen addressed themselves for orders to him alone in this manner an hour was consumed when cecilia and katherine appearing in succession attired in a suitable manner for their departure and the baggage of the whole party having been already entrusted to a petty officer and a party of his men griffith gave forth the customary order to put the whole in motion the shrill piercing whistle of the boatswain once more rang among the galleries and ceilings of the abbey and was followed by the deep hoarse cry of  away there you shoredraft away there you boarders ahead heave ahead seadogs  this extraordinary summons was succeeded by the roll of a drum and the strains of a fife from without when the whole party moved from the building in the order that had been previously prescribed by captain manual who acted as the marshal of the forces on the occasion  the pilot had conducted his surprise with so much skill and secrecy as to have secured every individual about the abbey whether male or female soldier or civilian and as it might be dangerous to leave any behind who could convey intelligence into the country griffith had ordered that every human being found in the building should be conducted to the cliffs to be held in durance at least until the departure of the last boat to the cutter which he was informed lay close in to the land awaiting their reembarkation the hurry of the departure had caused many lights to be kindled in the abbey and the contrast between the glare within and the gloom without attracted the wandering looks of the captives as they issued into the paddock one of those indefinable and unaccountable feelings which so often cross the human mind induced cecilia to pause at the great gate of the grounds and look back at the abbey with a presentiment that she was to behold it for the last time the dark and ragged outline of the edifice was clearly delineated against the northern sky while the open windows and neglected doors permitted a view of the solitude within twenty tapers were shedding their useless light in the empty apartments as if in mockery of the deserted walls and cecilia turned shuddering from the sight to press nigher to the person of her indignant uncle with a secret impression that her presence would soon be more necessary than ever to his happiness  the low hum of voices in front with the occasional strains of the fife and the stern mandates of the seaofficers soon recalled her however from these visionary thoughts to the surrounding realities while the whole party pursued their way with diligence to the margin of the ocean     chapter xxx    a chieftain to the highlands bound     cries boatman do not tarry   and ill give thee a silver pound     to row us oer the ferry   lord ullins daughter   the sky had been without a cloud during the day the gale having been dry and piercing and thousands of stars were now shining through a chill atmosphere as the eye therefore became accustomed to the change of light it obtained a more distinct view of surrounding objects at the head of the line that was stretched along the narrow pathway marched a platoon of the marines who maintained the regular and steady front of trained warriors they were followed at some little distance by a large and confused body of seamen heavily armed whose disposition to disorder and rude merriment which became more violent from their treading on solid ground was with difficulty restrained by the presence and severe rebukes of their own officers in the centre of this confused mass the whole of the common prisoners were placed but were not otherwise attended to by their nautical guard than as they furnished the subjects of fun and numberless quaint jokes at some distance in their rear marched colonel howard and borroughcliffe arm in arm both maintaining the most rigid and dignified silence though under the influence of very bitter feelings behind these again and pressing as nigh as possible to her uncle was miss howard leaning on the arm of alice dunscombe and surrounded by the female domestics of the establishment of st ruth katherine plowden moved lightly by herself in the shadow of this group with elastic steps but with a maiden coyness that taught her to veil her satisfaction with the semblance of captivity barnstable watched her movements with delight within six feet of her but submitted to the air of caprice in his mistress which seemed to require that he should come no nearer griffith avoiding the direct line of the party walked on its skirts in such a situation that his eye could command its whole extent in order if necessary to direct the movements another body of the marines marched at the close of the procession and manual in person brought up the rear the music had ceased by command and nothing was now audible but the regular tread of the soldiers with the sighs of the dying gale interrupted occasionally by the voice of an officer or the hum of low dialogue  this has been a scotch prize that weve taken muttered a surly old seaman a ship without headmoney or cargo there was kitchentimber enough in the old jug of a place to have given an outfit in crockery and kneebuckles to every lad in the ship but no let a mans mouth water ever so much for food and raiment damme if the officers would give him leave to steal even so good a thing as a spare bible  you may say all that and then make but a short yarn of the truth returned the messmate who walked by his side if there had been such a thing as a readymade prayer handy they would have choused a poor fellow out of the use of iti say ben ill tell ye what its my opinion that if a chap is to turn soldier and carry a musket he should have soldiers play and leave to plunder a littlenow the devil a thing have i laid my hands on tonight except this firelock and my cutlashunless you can call this bit of a tablecloth something of a windfall  ay you have fallen in there with a fresh bolt of duck i see said the other in manifest admiration of the texture of his companions prizewhy it would spread as broad a clew as our mizzenroyal if it was loosened well your luck hasnt been every mans luckfor my part i think this here hat was made for some fellows great toe ive rigged it on my head both fore and aft and athwartships but curse the inch can i drive it downi say sam youll give us a shirt off that table cloth  ay ay you can have one corner of it or for that matter ye can take the full half nick but i dont see that we go off to the ship any richer than we landed unless you may muster shecattle among your prizemoney  no richer interrupted a waggish young sailor who had been hitherto a silent listener to the conversation between his older and more calculating shipmates i think we are set up for a cruise in them seas where the day watches last six months dont you see we have caught a double allowance of midnight  while speaking he laid his hands on the bare and woolly heads of colonel howards two black slaves who were moving near him both occupied in mournful forebodings on the results that were to flow from this unexpected loss of their liberty slew your faces this way gentlemen he added there dont you think that a sight to put out the binnacle lamps theres darkness visible for ye  let the niggers alone grumbled one of the more aged speakers what are ye skylarking with the like of them for the next thing theyll sing out and then youll hear one of the officers in your wake for my part nick i cant see why it is that we keep dodging along shore here with less than ten fathoms under us when by stretching into the broad atlantic we might fall in with a jamaicaman every day or two and have sugar hogsheads and rum puncheons as plenty aboard us as hard fare is now  it is all owing to that pilot returned the other for dye see if there was no bottom there would be no pilots this is dangerous cruisingground where we stretch into five fathoms and then drop our lead on a sandpit or a rock besides they make nightwork of it too if we had daylight for fourteen hours instead of seven a man might trust to feeling his way for the other ten  now ant ye a couple of old horsemarines again interrupted the young sailor dont you see that congress wants us to cut up johnny bulls coasters and that old blowhard has found the days too short for his business and so he has landed a party to get hold of night here we have him and when we get off to the ship we shall put him under hatches and then youll see the face of the sun again come my lilies let these two gentlemen look into your cabin windowswhat you wont then i must squeeze your woolen nightcaps for ye  the negroes who had been submitting to his humors with the abject humility of slavery now gave certain low intimations that they were suffering pain under the rough manipulation of their tormentor  whats that cried a stern voice whose boyish tones seemed to mock the air of authority that was assumed by the speakerwhos that i say raising that cry among ye  the willful young man slowly removed his two hands from the woolly polls of the slaves but as he suffered them to fall reluctantly along their sable temples he gave the ear of one of the blacks a tweak that caused him to give vent to another cry that was uttered with a much greater confidence of sympathy than before  do ye hear there repeated merrywhos skylarking with those negroes  tis no one sir the sailor answered with affected gravity one of the palefaces has hit his shin against a cobweb and it has made his earache  harkye you mr jack joker how came you in the midst of the prisonersdid not i order you to handle your pike sir and to keep in the outer line  ay ay sir you did and i obeyed orders as long as i could but these niggers have made the night so dark that i lost my way  a low laugh passed through the confused crowd of seamen and even the midshipman might have been indulging himself in a similar manner at this specimen of quaint humor from the fellow who was one of those licensed men that are to be found in every ship at length  well sir he said you have found out your false reckoning now so get you back to the place where i bid you stay  ay ay sir im going by all the blunders in the pursers book mr merry but that cobweb has made one of these niggers shed tears do let me stay to catch a little ink sir to write a letter with to my poor old motherdevil the line has she had from me since we sailed from the chesapeake  if ye dont mind me at once mr jack joker ill lay my cutlass over your head returned merry his voice now betraying a much greater sympathy in the sufferings of that abject race who are still in some measure but who formerly were much more the butts of the unthinking and licentious among our low countrymen then ye can write your letter in red ink if ye will  i wouldnt do it for the world said joker sneaking away towards his proper stationthe old lady wouldnt forget the hand and swear it was a forgeryi wonder though if the breakers on the coast of guinea be black as ive heard old seamen say who have cruised in them latitudes  his idle levity was suddenly interrupted by a voice that spoke above the low hum of the march with an air of authority and a severity of tone that could always quell by a single word the most violent ebullition of merriment in the crew  the low buzzing sounds of ay there goes mr griffith and of jack has woke up the first lieutenant he had better now go to sleep himself were heard passing among the men but these suppressed communications soon ceased and even jack joker himself pursued his way with diligence on the skirts of the party as mutely as if the power of speech did not belong to his organization  the reader has too often accompanied us over the ground between the abbey and the ocean to require any description of the route pursued by the seamen during the preceding characteristic dialogue and we shall at once pass to the incidents which occurred on the arrival of the party at the cliffs as the man who had so unexpectedly assumed a momentary authority within st ruth had unaccountably disappeared from among them griffith continued to exercise the right of command without referring to any other for consultation he never addressed himself to barnstable and it was apparent that both the haughty young men felt that the tie which had hitherto united them in such close intimacy was for the present at least entirely severed indeed griffith was only restrained by the presence of cecilia and katherine from arresting his refractory inferior on the spot and barnstable who felt all the consciousness of error without its proper humility with difficulty so far repressed his feelings as to forbear exhibiting in the presence of his mistress such a manifestation of his spirit as his wounded vanity induced him to imagine was necessary to his honor the two however acted in harmony on one subject though it was without concert or communication the first object with both the young men was to secure the embarkation of the fair cousins and barnstable proceeded instantly to the boats in order to hasten the preparations that were necessary before they could receive these unexpected captives the descent of the pilot having been made in such force as to require the use of all the frigates boats which were left riding in the outer edge of the surf awaiting the return of the expedition a loud call from barnstable gave notice to the officer in command and in a few moments the beach was crowded with the busy and active crews of the cutters launches barges jollyboats pinnaces or by whatever names the custom of the times attached to the different attendants of vessels of war had the fears of the ladies themselves been consulted the frigates launch would have been selected for their use on account of its size but barnstable who would have thought such a choice on his part humiliating to his guests ordered the long low barge of captain munson to be drawn upon the sand it being peculiarly the boat of honor the hands of fifty men were applied to the task and it was soon announced to colonel howard and his wards that the little vessel was ready for their reception manual had halted on the summit of the cliffs with the whole body of the marines where he was busily employed in posting pickets and sentinels and giving the necessary instructions to his men to cover the embarkation of the seamen in a style that he conceived to be altogether military the mass of the common prisoners including the inferior domestics of the abbey and the men of borroughcliffe were also held in the same place under a suitable guard but colonel howard and his companion attended by the ladies and their own maids had descended the rugged path to the beach and were standing passively on the sands when the intelligence that the boat waited for them was announced  where is he asked alice dunscombe turning her head as if anxiously searching for some other than those around her  where is who inquired barnstable we are all here and the boat waits  and will he tear meeven me from the home of my infancy the land of my birth and my affections  i know not of whom you speak madam but if it be of mr griffith he stands there just without that cluster of seamen  griffith hearing himself thus named approached the ladies and for the first time since leaving the abbey addressed them i hope i am already understood he said and that it is unnecessary for me to say that no female here is a prisoner though should any choose to trust themselves on board our ship i pledge them to the honor of an officer that they shall find themselves protected and safe  then will i not go said alice  it is not expected of you said cecilia you have no ties to bind you to any here the eyes of alice were still wandering over the listeners go then miss alice and be the mistress of st ruth until my return or she added timidly until colonel howard may declare his pleasure  i obey you dear child but the agent of colonel howard at b will undoubtedly be authorized to take charge of his effects  while no one but his niece alluded to his will the master of the abbey had found in his resentment a sufficient apology for his rigid demeanor but he was far too well bred to bear in silence such a modest appeal to his wishes from so fair and so loyal a subject as alice dunscombe  to relieve you madam and for no other reason will i speak on this subject he said otherwise i should leave the doors and windows of st ruth open as a melancholy monument of rebellion and seek my future compensation from the crown when the confiscated estates of the leaders of this accursed innovation on the rights of princes shall come to the hammer but you miss alice are entitled to every consideration that a lady can expect from a gentleman be pleased therefore to write to my agent and request him to seal up my papers and transmit them to the office of his majestys secretary of state they breathe no treason madam and are entitled to official protection the house and most of the furniture as you know are the property of my landlord who in due time will doubtless take charge of his own interest i kiss your hand miss alice and i hope we shall yet meet at st jamessdepend on it madam that the royal charlotte shall yet honor your merits i know she cannot but estimate your loyalty  here i was born in humble obscurityhere i have lived and here i hope to die in quiet returned the meek alice if i have known any pleasure in late years beyond that which every christian can find in our daily duties it has been my sweet friends in your accidental societysuch companions in this remote corner of the kingdom has been a boon too precious to be enjoyed without alloy it seems and i have now to exchange the past pleasure for present pain adieu my young friend let your trust be in him to whose eyes both prince and peasant the european and the american are alike and we shall meet again though it be neither in the island of britain nor on your own wide continent  that said colonel howard advancing and taking her hand with kindness that is the only disloyal sentiment i have ever heard fall from the lips of miss alice dunscombe is it to be supposed that heaven has established orders among men and that it does not respect the works of its own formation but adieu no doubt if time was allowed us for suitable explanations we should find but little or no difference of opinion on this subject  alice did not appear to consider the matter as worthy of further discussion at such a moment for she gently returned the colonels leavetaking and then gave her undivided attention to her female friends cecilia wept bitterly on the shoulder of her respected companion giving vent to her regret at parting and her excited feelings at the same moment and katherine pressed to the side of alice with the kindliness prompted by her warm but truant heart their embraces were given and received in silence and each of the young ladies moved towards the boat as she withdrew herself from the arms of miss dunscombe colonel howard would not precede his wards neither would he assist them into the barge that attention they received from barnstable who after seeing the ladies and their attendants seated turned to the gentlemen and observed  the boat waits  well miss alice said borroughcliffe in bitter irony you are entrusted by our excellent host with a message to his agent will you do a similar service to me and write a report to the commander of the district and just tell him what a doltay use the plainest terms and say what an ass one captain borroughcliffe has proved himself in this affair you may throw in by way of episode that he has been playing bopeep with a rebellious young lady from the colonies and like a great boy has had his head broken for his pains come my worthy host or rather fellowprisoner i follow you as in duty bound  stay cried griffith captain borroughcliffe does not embark in that boat  ha sir am i to be herded with the common men forget you that i have the honor to bear the commission of his britannic majesty and that  i forget nothing that a gentleman is bound to remember captain borroughcliffe among other things i recollect the liberality of your treatment to myself when a prisoner the instant the safety of my command will justify such a step not only you but your men shall be set at liberty  borroughcliffe started in surprise but his feelings were too much soured by the destruction of those visions of glory in which he had been luxuriously indulging for the last day or two to admit of his answering as became a man he swallowed his emotions therefore by a violent effort and walked along the beach affecting to whistle a low but lively air  well then cried barnstable all our captives are seated the boat waits only for its officers  in his turn griffith walked away in haughty silence as if disdaining to hold communion with his former friend barnstable paused a moment from a deference that long habit had created for his superior officer and which was not to be shaken off by every burst of angry passion but perceiving that the other had no intention to return he ordered the seamen to raise the boat from the sand and bear it bodily into the water the command was instantly obeyed and by the time the young lieutenant was in his seat the barge was floating in the still heavy though no longer dangerous surf and the crew sprang into their places  bear her off boys he cried never mind a wet jacket ive seen many a worthy fellow tumbling on this beach in a worse time than this now you have her head to sea give way my souls give way  the seamen rose simultaneously at their oars and by an united effort obtained the command of their boat which after making a few sudden ascents and as many heavy pitches in the breakers gained the smoother seas of the swelling ocean and stemmed the waters in a direction for the place where the alacrity was supposed to be in waiting     chapter xxxi    his only plot was thisthat much provoked   he raised his vengeful arm against his country   thomson   alice duncombe remained on the sands watching the dark spot that was soon hid amid the waves in the obscurity of night and listening with melancholy interest to the regulated sounds of the oars which were audible long after the boat had been blended with the gloomy outline of the eastern horizon when all traces of her departed friends were to be found only in her own recollections she slowly turned from the sea and hastening to quit the bustling throng that were preparing for the embarkation of the rest of the party she ascended the path that conducted her once more to the summit of those cliffs along which she had so often roved gazing at the boundless element that washed their base with sensations that might have been peculiar to her own situation  the soldiers of borroughcliffe who were stationed at the head of the pass respectfully made way nor did any of the sentinels of manual heed her retiring figure until she approached the rear guard of the marines who were commanded by their vigilant captain in person  who goes there cried manual advancing without the dusky group of soldiers as she approached them  one who possesses neither the power nor the inclination to do ye harm answered the solitary female tis alice dunscombe returning by permission of your leader to the place of her birth  ay muttered manual this is one of griffiths unmilitary exhibitions of his politeness does the man think that there was ever a woman who had no tongue have you the countersign madam that i may know you bear a sufficient warrant to pass  i have no other warrant besides my sex and weakness unless mr griffiths knowledge that i have left him can be so considered  the two former are enough said a voice that proceeded from a figure which had hitherto stood unseen shaded by the trunk of an oak that spread its wide but naked arms above the spot where the guard was paraded  who have we here manual again cried come in yield or you will be fired at  what will the gallant captain manual fire on his own rescuer said the pilot with cool disdain as he advanced from the shadow of the tree he had better reserve his bullets for his enemies than waste them on his friends  you have done a dangerous deed sir in approaching clandestinely a guard of marines i wonder that a man who has already discovered to night that he has some knowledge of tactics by so ably conducting a surprise should betray so much ignorance in the forms of approaching a picket  tis now of no moment returned the pilot my knowledge and my ignorance are alike immaterial as the command of the party is surrendered to other and perhaps more proper hands but i would talk to this lady alone sir she is an acquaintance of my youth and i will see her on her way to the abbey  the step would be unmilitary mr pilot and you will excuse me if i do not consent to any of our expedition straggling without the sentries if you choose to remain here to hold your discourse i will march the picket out of hearing though i must acknowledge i see no ground so favorable as this we are on to keep you within range of our eyes you perceive that i have a ravine to retreat into in case of surprise with this line of wall on my left flank and the trunk of that tree to cover my right a very pretty stand might be made here on emergency for even the oldest troops fight the best when their flanks are properly covered and a way to make a regular retreat is open in their rear  say no more sir i would not break up such a position on any account returned the pilot the lady will consent to retrace her path for a short distance  alice followed his steps in compliance with this request until he had led her to a place at some little distance from the marines where a tree had been prostrated by the late gale she seated herself quietly on its trunk and appeared to wait with patience his own time for the explanation of his motives in seeking the interview the pilot paced for several minutes back and forth in front of the place where she was seated in profound silence as if communing with himself when suddenly throwing off his air of absence he came to her side and assumed a position similar to the one which she herself had taken  the hour is at hand alice when we must part he at length commenced it rests with yourself whether it shall be forever  let it then be forever john she returned with a slight tremor in her voice  that word would have been less appalling had this accidental meeting never occurred and yet your choice may have been determined by prudencefor what is there in my fate that can tempt a woman to wish that she might share it  if ye mean your lot is that of one who can find but few or even none to partake of his joys or to share in his sorrowswhose life is a continual scene of dangers and calamities of disappointments and mishapsthen do ye know but little of the heart of woman if ye doubt of either her ability or her willingness to meet them with the man of her choice  say you thus alice then have i misunderstood your meaning or misinterpreted your acts my lot is not altogether that of a neglected man unless the favor of princes and the smiles of queens are allowed to go for nothing my life is however one of many and fearful dangers and yet it is not filled altogether with calamities and mishaps is it alice he paused a moment but in vain for her answer nay then i have been deceived in the estimation that the world has affixed to my combats and enterprises i am not alice the man i would be or even the man i had deemed myself  you have gained a name john among the warriors of the age she answered in a subdued voice and it is a name that may be said to be written in blood  the blood of my enemies alice  the blood of the subjects of your natural prince the blood of those who breathe the air you first breathed and who were taught the same holy lessons of instruction that you were first taught but which i fear you have too soon forgotten  the blood of the slaves of despotism he sternly interrupted her the blood of the enemies of freedom you have dwelt so long in this dull retirement and you have cherished so blindly the prejudices of your youth that the promise of those noble sentiments i once thought i could see budding in alice dunscombe has not been fulfilled  i have lived and thought only as a woman as become my sex and station alice meekly replied and when it shall be necessary for me to live and think otherwise i should wish to die  ay there lie the first seeds of slavery a dependent woman is sure to make the mother of craven and abject wretches who dishonor the name of man  i shall never be the mother of children good or bad said alice with that resignation in her tones that showed she had abandoned the natural hopes of her sex singly and unsupported have i lived alone and unlamented must i be carried to my grave  the exquisite pathos of her voice as she uttered this placid speech blended as it was with the sweet and calm dignity of virgin pride touched the heart of her listener and he continued silent many moments as if in reverence of her determination her sentiments awakened in his own breast those feelings of generosity and disinterestedness which had nearly been smothered in restless ambition and the pride of success he resumed the discourse therefore more mildly and with a much greater exhibition of deep feeling and less of passion in his manner  i know not alice that i ought situated as i am and contented if not happy as you are even to attempt to revive in your bosom those sentiments which i was once led to think existed there it cannot after all be a desirable fate to share the lot of a rover like myself one who may be termed a quixote in the behalf of liberal principles and who may be hourly called to seal the truth of those principles with his life  there never existed any sentiment in my breast in which you are concerned that does not exist there still and unchanged returned alice with her singlehearted sincerity  do i hear you right or have i misconceived your resolution to abide in england or have i not rather mistaken your early feelings  you have fallen into no error now nor then the weakness may still exist john but the strength to struggle with it has by the goodness of god grown with my years it is not however of myself but of you that i would speak i have lived like one of our simple daisies which in the budding may have caught your eye and i shall also wilt like the humble flower when the winter of my time arrives without being missed from the fields that have known me for a season but your fall john will be like that of the oak that now supports us and men shall pronounce on the beauty and grandeur of the noble stem while standing as well as of its usefulness when felled  let them pronounce as they will returned the proud stranger the truth must be finally known and when that hour shall come they will say he was a faithful and gallant warrior in his day and a worthy lesson for all who are born in slavery but would live in freedom shall be found in his example  such may be the language of that distant people whom ye have adopted in the place of those that once formed home and kin to ye said alice glancing her eye timidly at his countenance as if to discern how far she might venture without awakening his resentment but what will the men of the land of your birth transmit to their children who will be the children of those that are of your own blood  they will say alice whatever their crooked policy may suggest or their disappointed vanity can urge but the picture must be drawn by the friends of the hero as well as by his enemies think you that there are not pens as well as swords in america  i have heard that america called a land john where god has lavished his favors with an unsparing hand where he has bestowed many climes with their several fruits and where his power is exhibited no less than his mercy it is said her rivers are without any known end and that lakes are found in her bosom which would put our german ocean to shame the plains teeming with verdure are spread over wide degrees and yet those sweet valleys which a single heart can hold are not wanting in short john i hear it is a broad land that can furnish food for each passion and contain objects for every affection  ay you have found those alice in your solitude who have been willing to do her justice it is a country that can form a world of itself and why should they who inherit it look to other nations for their laws  i pretend not to reason on the right of the children of that soil to do whatever they may deem most meet for their own welfare returned alice but can men be born in such a land and not know the feelings which bind a human being to the place of his birth  can you doubt that they should be patriotic exclaimed the pilot in surprise do not their efforts in this sacred causetheir patient sufferingstheir long privationsspeak loudly in their behalf  and will they who know so well how to love home sing the praises of him who has turned his ruthless hand against the land of his fathers  forever harping on that word home said the pilot who now detected the timid approaches of alice to her hidden meaning is a man a stick or a stone that he must be cast into the fire or buried in a wall wherever his fate may have doomed him to appear on the earth the sound of home is said to feed the vanity of an english man let him go where he will but it would seem to have a still more powerful charm with english women  it is the dearest of all terms to every woman john for it embraces the dearest of all ties if your dames of america are ignorant of its charm all the favors which god has lavished on their land will avail their happiness but little  alice said the pilot rising in his agitation i see but too well the object of your allusions but on this subject we can never agree for not even your powerful influence can draw me from the path of glory in which i am now treading but our time is growing brief let us then talk of other thingsthis may be the last time i shall ever put foot on the island of britain  alice paused to struggle with the feelings excited by this remark before she pursued the discourse but soon shaking off the weakness she added with a rigid adherence to that course which she believed to be her duty  and now john that you have landed is the breaking up of a peaceful family and the violence ye have shown towards an aged man a fit exploit for one whose object is the glory of which ye have spoken  think you that i have landed and placed my life in the hands of my enemies for so unworthy an object no alice my motive for this undertaking has been disappointed and therefore will ever remain a secret from the world but duty to my cause has prompted the step which you so unthinkingly condemn this colonel howard has some consideration with those in power and will answer to exchange for a better man as for his wards you forget their home their magical home is in america unless indeed they find them nearer at hand under the proud flag of a frigate that is now waiting for them in the offing  you talk of a frigate said alice with sudden interest in the subject is she your only means of escaping from your enemies  alice dunscombe has taken but little heed of passing events to ask such a question of me returned the haughty pilot the question would have sounded more discreetly had it been is she the only vessel with you that your enemies will have to escape from  nay i cannot measure my language at such a moment continued alice with a still stronger exhibition of anxiety it was my fortune to overhear a part of a plan that was intended to destroy by sudden means those vessels of america that were in our seas  that might be a plan more suddenly adopted than easily executed my good alice and who were these redoubtable schemers  i know not but my duty to the king should cause me to suppress this information said alice hesitating  well be it so returned the pilot coolly it may prove the means of saving the persons of some of the royal officers from death or captivity i have already said this may be the last of my visits to this island and consequently alice the last of our interviews  and yet said alice still pursuing the train of her own thoughts there can be but little harm in sparing human blood and least of all in serving those whom we have long known and regarded  ay that is a simple doctrine and one that is easily maintained he added with much apparent indifference and yet king george might well spare some of his servantsthe list of his abject minions is so long  there was a man named dillon who lately dwelt in the abbey but who has mysteriously disappeared continued alice or rather who was captured by your companions know you aught of him john  i have heard there was a miscreant of that name but we have never met alice if it please heaven that this should be the last  he was a captive in the schooner called the ariel she added still unheeding his affected indifference to her communication and when permitted to return to st ruth he lost sight of his solemn promise and of his plighted honor to wreak his malice instead of effecting the exchange that he had conditioned to see made he plotted treason against his captors yes it was most foul treason for his treatment was generous and kind and his liberation certain  he was a most unworthy scoundrel but alice  nay listen john she continued urged to even a keener interest in his behalf by his apparent inattention and yet i should speak tenderly of his failings for he is already numbered with the dead one part of his scheme must have been frustrated for he intended to destroy that schooner which you call the ariel and to have taken the person of the young barnstable  in both of which he has failed the person of barnstable i have rescued and the ariel has been stricken by a hand far mightier than any of this worldshe is wrecked  then is the frigate your only means of escape hasten john and seem not so proud and heedless for the hour may come when all your daring will not profit ye against the machinations of secret enemies this dillon had also planned that expresses should journey to a seaport at the south with the intelligence that your vessels were in these seas in order that ships might be dispatched to intercept your retreat  the pilot lost his affected indifference as she proceeded and before she ceased speaking his eye was endeavoring to anticipate her words by reading her countenance through the dusky medium of the starlight  how know you this alice he asked quicklyand what vessel did he name  chance made me an unseen listener to their plan andi know not but i forget my duty to my prince but john tis asking too much of a weak woman to require that she shall see the man whom she once viewed with eyes of favor sacrificed when a word of caution given in season might enable him to avoid the danger  once viewed with an eye of favor is it then so said the pilot speaking in a vacant manner but alice heard ye the force of the ships or their names give me their names and the first lord of your british admiralty shall not give so true an account of their force as i will furnish from this list of my own  their names were certainly mentioned said alice with tender melancholy but the name of one far nearer to me was ringing in my ears and has driven them from my mind  you are the same good alice i once knew and my name was mentioned what said they of the pirate had his arm stricken a blow that made them tremble in their abbey did they call him coward girl  it was mentioned in terms that pained my heart as i listened for it is never too easy a task to forget the lapse of years nor are the feelings of youth to be easily eradicated  ay there is luxury in knowing that with all their affected abuse the slaves dread me in their secret holds exclaimed the pilot pacing in front of his listener with quick steps this it is to be marked among men above all others in your calling i hope yet to see the day when the third george shall start at the sound of that name even within the walls of his palace  alice dunscombe heard him in deep and mortified silence it was too evident that a link in the chain of their sympathies was broken and that the weakness in which she had been unconsciously indulging was met by no correspondent emotions in him after sinking her head for a moment on her bosom she arose with a little more than her usual air of meekness and recalled the pilot to a sense of her presence by saying in a yet milder voice  i have now communicated all that it can profit you to know and it is meet that we separate  what thus soon he cried starting and taking her hand this is but a short interview alice to precede so long a separation  be it short or be it long it must now end she replied your companions are on the eve of departure and i trust you would be one of the last who would wish to be deserted if ye do visit england again i hope it may be with altered sentiments so far as regards her interests i wish ye peace john and the blessings of god as ye may be found to deserve them  i ask no farther unless it may be the aid of your gentle prayers but the night is gloomy and i will see you in safety to the abbey  it is unnecessary she returned with womanly reserve the innocent can be as fearless on occasion as the most valiant among your warriors but here is no cause for fear i shall take a path that will conduct me in a different way from that which is occupied by your soldiers and where i shall find none but him who is ever ready to protect the helpless once more john i bid ye adieu her voice faltered as she continuedye will share the lot of humanity and have your hours of care and weakness at such moments ye can remember those ye leave on this despised island and perhaps among them ye may think of some whose interest in your welfare has been far removed from selfishness  god be with you alice he said touched with her emotion and losing all vain images in more worthy feelingsbut i cannot permit you to go alone  here we part john she said firmly and forever tis for the happiness of both for i fear we have but little in common she gently wrested her hand from his grasp and once more bidding him adieu in a voice that was nearly inaudible she turned and slowly disappeared moving with lingering steps in the direction of the abbey  the first impulse of the pilot was certainly to follow and insist on seeing her on the way but the music of the guard on the cliffs at that moment sent forth its martial strains and the whistle of the boatswain was heard winding its shrill call among the rocks in those notes that his practised ear well understood to be the last signal for embarking  obedient to the summons this singular man in whose breast the natural feelings that were now on the eve of a violent eruption had so long been smothered by the visionary expectations of a wild ambition and perhaps of fierce resentments pursued his course in deep abstraction towards the boats he was soon met by the soldiers of borroughcliffe deprived of their arms it is true but unguarded and returning peacefully to their quarters the mind of the pilot happily for the liberty of these men was too much absorbed in his peculiar reflections to note this act of griffiths generosity nor did he arouse from his musing until his steps were arrested by suddenly encountering a human figure in the pathway a light tap on his shoulder was the first mark of recognition he received when borroughcliffe who stood before him said  it is evident sir from what has passed this evening that you are not what you seem you may be some rebel admiral or general for aught that i know the right to command having been strangely contested among ye this night but let who will own the chief authority i take the liberty of whispering in your ear that i have been scurvily treated by youi repeat most scurvily treated by you all generally and by you in particular  the pilot started at this strange address which was uttered with all the bitterness that could be imparted to it by a disappointed man but he motioned with his hand for the captain to depart and turned aside to pursue his own way  perhaps i am not properly understood continued the obstinate soldier i say sir you have treated me scurvily and i would not be thought to say this to any gentleman without wishing to give him an opportunity to vent his anger  the eye of the pilot as he moved forward glanced at the pistols which borroughcliffe held in his hands the one by the handle and the other by its barrel and the soldier even fancied that his footsteps were quickened by the sight after gazing at him until his form was lost in the darkness the captain muttered to himself  he is no more than a common pilot after all no true gentleman would have received so palpable a hint with such a start ah here comes the party of my worthy friend whose palate knows a grape of the north side of madeira from one of the south the dog has the throat of a gentleman we will see how he can swallow a delicate allusion to his faults  borroughcliffe stepped aside to allow the marines who were also in motion for the boats to pass and watched with keen looks for the person of the commander manual who had been previously apprised of the intention of griffith to release the prisoners had halted to see that none but those who had been liberated by authority were marching into the country this accidental circumstance gave borroughcliffe an opportunity of meeting the other at some little distance from either of their respective parties  i greet you sir said borroughcliffe with all affection this has been a pleasant forage for you captain manual  the marine was far from being disposed to wrangle but there was that in the voice of the other which caused him to answer  it would have been far pleasanter sir if i had met an opportunity of returning to captain borroughcliffe some of the favors that i have received at his hands  nay then dear sir you weigh my modesty to the earth surely you forget the manner in which my hospitality has already been requitedby some two hours mouthing of my swordhilt with a very unceremonious ricochet into a corner together with a lovetap received over the shoulders of one of my men by so gentle an instrument as the butt of a musket damme sir but i think an ungrateful man only a better sort of beast  had the lovetap been given to the officer instead of the man returned manual with all commendable coolness it would have been better justice and the ramrod might have answered as well as the butt to floor a gentleman who carried the allowance of four thirsty fiddlers under one mans jacket  now that is rank ingratitude to your own cordial of the south side and a most biting insult i really see but one way of terminating this wordy war which if not discreetly ended may lead us far into the morning  elect your own manner of determining the dispute sir i hope however it will not be by your innate knowledge of mankind which has already mistaken a captain of marines in the service of congress for a runaway lover bound to some green place or other  you might just as well tweak my nose sir said borroughcliffe indeed i think it would be the milder reproach of the two will you make your selection of these sir they were loaded for a very different sort of service but i doubt not will answer on occasion  i am provided with a pair that are charged for any service returned manual drawing a pistol from his own belt and stepping backward a few paces  you are destined for america i know said borroughcliffe who stood his ground with consummate coolness but it would be more convenient for me sir if you could delay your march for a single moment  fire and defend yourself exclaimed manual furiously retracing his steps towards his enemy  the sounds of the two pistols were blended in one report and the soldiers of borroughcliffe and the marines all rushed to the place on the sudden alarm had the former been provided with arms it is probable that a bloody fray would have been the consequence of the sight that both parties be held on arriving at the spot which they did simultaneously manual lay on his back without any signs of life and borroughcliffe had changed his cool haughty upright attitude for a recumbent posture which was somewhat between lying and sitting  is the poor fellow actually expended said the englishman in something like the tones of regret well he had a soldiers mettle in him and was nearly as great a fool as myself  the marines had luckily for the soldiers and their captain by this time discovered the signs of life in their own commander who had been only slightly stunned by the bullet which had grazed his crown and who being assisted on his feet stood a minute or two rubbing his head as if awaking from a dream as manual came gradually to his senses he recollected the business in which he had just been engaged and in his turn inquired after the fate of his antagonist  i am here my worthy incognito cried the other with the voice of perfect good nature lying in the lap of mother earth and all the better for opening a vein or two in my right legthough i do think that the same effect might have been produced without treating the bone so roughlybut i opine that i saw you also reclining on the bosom of our common ancestor  i was down for a few minutes i do believe returned manual there is the path of a bullet across my scalp  humph on the head said borroughcliffe dryly the hurt is not likely to be mortal i seewell i shall offer to raffle with the first poor devil i can find that has but one good leg for who shall have both and that will just set up a beggar and a gentlemanmanual give me your hand we have drunk together and we have fought surely there is nothing now to prevent our being sworn friends  why returned manual continuing to rub his head i see no irremovable objectionsbut you will want a surgeon can i order anything to be done there go the signals again to embarkmarch the fellows down at quick time sergeant my own man may remain with me or i can do altogether without assistance  ah you are what i call a wellmade man my dear friend exclaimed borroughcliffe no weak points about your fortress such a man is worthy to be the head of a whole corps instead of a solitary companygently drill gently handle me as if i were made of potters clayi will not detain you longer my friend manual for i hear signal after signal they must be in want of some of your astonishing reasoning faculties to set them afloat  manual might have been offended at the palpable allusions that his new friend made to the firmness of his occiput had not his perception of things been a little confused by a humming sound that seemed to abide near the region of thought as it was he reciprocated the good wishes of the other whom he shook most cordially by the hand and once more renewed his offers of service after exchanging sundry friendly speeches  i thank you quite as much as if i were not at all indebted to you for letting blood thereby saving me a fit of apoplexy but drill has already dispatched a messenger to b for a leech and the lad may bring the whole depot down upon youadieu once more and remember that if you ever visit england again as a friend you are to let me see you  i shall do it without fail and i shall keep you to your promise if you once more put foot in america  trust me for that i shall stand in need of your excellent head to guide me safely among those rude foresters adieu cease not to bear me in your thoughts  i shall never cease to remember you my good friend returned manual again scratching the member which was snapping in a manner that caused him to fancy he heard it once more these worthies shook each other by the hand and again they renewed their promises of future intercourse after which they separated like two reluctant loversparting in a manner that would have put to shame the friendship of orestes and pylades     chapter xxxii    nay answer me stand and unfold yourself   hamlet   during the time occupied by the incidents that occurred after the pilot had made his descent on the land the alacrity now under the orders of mr boltrope the master of the frigate lay off and on in readiness to receive the successful mariners the direction of the wind had been gradually changing from the northeast to the south during the close of the day and long before the middle watches of the night the wary old seaman who it may be remembered had expressed in the council of war such a determined reluctance to trust his person within the realm of britain ordered the man who steered the cutter to stand in boldly for the land whenever the lead told them that it was prudent to tack the course of the vessel was changed and in this manner the seamen continued to employ the hours in patient attendance on the adventurers the sailingmaster who had spent the early years of his life as the commander of divers vessels employed in trading was apt like many men of his vocation and origin to mistake the absence of refinement for the surest evidence of seamanship and consequently he held the little courtesies and punctilios of a manofwar in high disdain his peculiar duties of superintending the expenditure of the ships stores in their several departments of keeping the frigates logbook and of making his daily examinations into the state of her sails and riggingbrought him so little in collision with the gay laughing reckless young lieutenants who superintended the ordinary management of the vessel that he might be said to have formed a distinct species of the animal though certainly of the same genus with his more polished messmates whenever circumstances however required that he should depart from the dull routine of his duty he made it a rule as far as possible to associate himself with such of the crew as possessed habits and opinions the least at variance with his own  by a singular fatality the chaplain of the frigate was as respects associates in a condition nearly assimilated to that of this veteran tar  an earnest desire to ameliorate the situation of those who were doomed to meet death on the great deep had induced an experienced and simple hearted divine to accept this station in the fond hope that he might be made the favored instrument of salvation to many who were then existing in a state of the most abandoned selfforgetfulness neither our limits nor our present object will permit the relation of the many causes that led not only to an entire frustration of all his visionary expectations but to an issue which rendered the struggle of the good divine with himself both arduous and ominous in order to maintain his own claims to the merited distinctions of his sacred office the consciousness of his backsliding had so far lessened the earthly if not the spiritual pride of the chaplain as to induce him to relish the society of the rude master whose years had brought him at times to take certain views of futurity that were singularly affected by the peculiar character of the individual it might have been that both found themselves out of their placesbut it was owing to some such secret sympathy let its origin be what it would that the two came to be fond of each others company on the night in question mr boltrope had invited the chaplain to accompany him in the alacrity adding in his broad rough language that as there was to be fighting on shore his hand might come in play with some poor fellow or other this singular invitation had been accepted as well from a desire to relieve the monotony of a sealife by any change as perhaps with a secret yearning in the breast of the troubled divine to get as nigh to terra firma as possible accordingly after the pilot had landed with his boisterous party the sailingmaster and the chaplain together with a boatswains mate and some ten or twelve seamen were left in quiet possession of the cutter the first few hours of this peaceable intercourse had been spent by the worthy messmates in the little cabin of the vessel over a can of grog the savory relish of which was much increased by a characteristic disquisition on polemical subjects which our readers have great reason to regret it is not our present humor to record when however the winds invited the near approach to the hostile shores already mentioned the prudent sailingmaster adjourned the discussion to another and more suitable time removing himself and the can by the same operation to the quarterdeck  there cried the honest tar placing the wooden vessel with great selfcontentment by his side on the deck this is ships comfort there is a good deal of what i call a lubbers fuss parson kept up on board a ship that shall be nameless but which bears about three leagues distant broad off in the ocean and which is lying to under a closereefed maintopsail a foretopmaststaysail and foresaili call my hand a true one in mixing a cantake another pull at the halyards twill make your eye twinkle like a lighthouse this dark morning you wont well we must give no offence to the englishmans rumafter a potent draught had succeeded this considerate declaration he added you are a little like our first lieutenant parson who drinks as i call it nothing but the elementswhich is water stiffened with air  mr griffith may indeed be said to set a wholesome example to the crew returned the chaplain perhaps with a slight consciousness that it had not altogether possessed its due weight with himself  wholesome cried boltrope let me tell you my worthy leafturner that if you call such a light diet wholesome you know but little of salt water and seafogs however mr griffith is a seaman and if he gave his mind less to trifles and gimcracks he would be by the time he got to about our years a very rational sort of a companionbut you see parson just now he thinks too much of small follies such as man ofwar disciplinenow there is rationality in giving a fresh nip to a rope or in looking well at your mats or even in crowning a cable but damme priest if i see the useluff luff you lubber dont ye see sir you are steering for garmanyif i see the use as i was saying of making a rumpus about the time when a man changes his shirt whether it be this week or next week or for that matter the week after provided it be bad weather i sometimes am mawkish about attending muster and i believe i have as little to fear on the score of behavior as any man lest it should be found i carried my tobacco in the wrong cheek  i have indeed thought it somewhat troublesome to myself at times and it is in a striking degree vexatious to the spirit especially when the body has been suffering under seasickness  why yes you were a little apt to bend your duds wrong for the first month or so said the master i remember you got the marines scraper on your head once in your hurry to bury a dead man then you never looked as if you belonged to the ship so long as those cursed black kneebreeches lasted for my part i never saw you come up the quarter deck ladder but i expected to see your shins give way across the combing of the hatcha man does look like the devil priest scudding about a ships decks in that fashion under bare poles but now the tailor has found out the articles arnt seaworthy and we have got your lower stanchions cased in a pair of pursers slops i am puzzled often to tell your heels from those of a maintopman  i have good reason to be thankful for the change said the humbled priest if the resemblance you mention existed while i was clad in the usual garb of one of my calling  what signifies a calling returned boltrope catching his breath after a most persevering draught a mans shins are his shins let his upper works belong to what sarvice they may i took an early prejudyce against kneebreeches perhaps from a trick ive always had of figuring the devil as wearing them you know parson we seldom hear much said of a man without forming some sort of an idea concerning his rigging and fashionpiecesand so as i had no particular reason to believe that satan went nakedkeep full ye lubber now you are running into the winds eye and be dd to yebut as i was saying i always took a conceit that the devil wore kneebreeches and a cockd hat theres some of our young lieutenants who come to muster on sundays in cockd hats just like soldierofficers but dye see i would sooner show my nose under a nightcap than under a scraper  i hear the sound of oars exclaimed the chaplain who finding this image more distinct than even his own vivid conceptions of the great father of evil was quite willing to conceal his inferiority by changing the discourse is not one of our boats returning  ay ay tis likely if it had been me i should have been landsick before thisware round boys and stand by to heave to on the other tack  the cutter obedient to her helm fell off before the wind and rolling an instant in the trough of the sea came up again easily to her oblique position with her head towards the cliffs and gradually losing her way as her sails were brought to counteract each other finally became stationary during the performance of this evolution a boat had hove up out of the gloom in the direction of the land and by the time the alacrity was in a state of rest it had approached so nigh as to admit of hailing  boat ahoy murmured boltrope through a trumpet which aided by his lungs produced sounds not unlike the roaring of a bull  ay ay was thrown back from a clear voice that swept across the water with a fullness that needed no factitious aid to render it audible  ay there comes one of the lieutenants with his ay ay said boltropepipe the side there you boatswains mate but heres another fellow more on our quarter boat ahoy  alacrityreturned another voice in a direction different from the other  alacrity there goes my commission of captain of this craft in a whiff returned the sailingmaster that is as much as to say here comes one who will command when he gets on board well well it is mr griffith and i cant say notwithstanding his love of kneebuckles and small wares but im glad hes out of the hands of the english ay here they all come upon us at once here is another fellow that pulls like the jollyboat coming up on our leebeam within haillet us see if he is asleepboat ahoy  flag answered a third voice from a small lightrowing boat which had approached very near the cutter in a direct line from the cliffs without being observed  flag echoed boltrope dropping his trumpet in amazementthats a big word to come out of a jollyboat jack manly himself could not have spoken it with a fuller mouth but ill know who it is that carries such a weather helm with a yankee manofwars prize boat ahoy i say  this last call was uttered in those short menacing tones that are intended to be understood as intimating that the party hailing is in earnest and it caused the men who were rowing and who were now quite close to the cutter to suspend their strokes simultaneously as if they dreaded that the cry would be instantly succeeded by some more efficient means of ascertaining their character the figure that was seated by itself in the stern of the boat started at this second summons and then as if with sudden recollection a quiet voice replied  nono  nono and flag are very different answers grumbled boltrope what knownothing have we here  he was yet muttering his dissatisfaction at the ignorance of the individual that was approaching whoever it might be when the jolly boat came slowly to their side and the pilot stepped from her stern sheets on the decks of the prize  is it you mr pilot exclaimed the sailingmaster raising a battle lantern within a foot of the others face and looking with a sort of stupid wonder at the proud and angry eye he encounteredis it you well i should have rated you for a man of more experience than to come booming down upon a manofwar in the dark with such a big word in your mouth when every boy in the two vessels knows that we carry no swallow tailed bunting abroad flag why you might have got a shot had there been soldiers  the pilot threw him a still fiercer glance and turning away with a look of disgust he walked along the quarterdeck towards the stern of the vessel with an air of haughty silence as if disdaining to answer boltrope kept his eyes fastened on him for a moment longer with some appearance of scorn but the arrival of the boat first hailed which proved to be the barge immediately drew his attention to other matters barnstable had been rowing about in the ocean for a long time unable to find the cutter and as he had been compelled to suit his own demeanor to those with whom he was associated he reached the alacrity in no very goodhumored mood colonel howard and his niece had maintained during the whole period the most rigid silence the former from pride and the latter touched with her uncles evident displeasure and katherine though secretly elated with the success of all her projects was content to emulate their demeanor for a short time in order to save appearances barnstable had several times addressed himself to the latter without receiving any other answer than such as was absolutely necessary to prevent the lover from taking direct offence at the same time that she intimated by her manner her willingness to remain silent accordingly the lieutenant after aiding the ladies to enter the cutter and offering to perform the same service to colonel howard which was coldly declined turned with that sort of irritation that is by no means less rare in vessels of war than with poor human nature generally and gave vent to his spleen where he dared  hows this mr boltrope he cried here are boats coming alongside with ladies in them and you keep your gaft swayed up till the leach of the sail is stretched like a fiddlestringsettle away your peak halyards sir settle away  ay ay sir grumbled the master settle away that peak there though the craft wouldnt forge ahead a knot in a month with all her jibs hauled over he walked sulkily forward among the men followed by the meek divine and added i should as soon have expected to see mr barnstable come off with a live ox in his boat as a petticoat the lord only knows what the ship is coming to next parson what between cocked hats and epaulettes and other kneebuckle matters she was a sort of nomans land before and now what with the women and their bandboxes theyll make another noahs ark of her i wonder they didnt all come aboard in a coach and six or a onehorse shay  it was a surprising relief to barnstable to be able to give utterance to his humor for a few moments by ordering the men to make sundry alterations in every department of the vessel in a quick hurried voice that abundantly denoted not only the importance of his improvements but the temper in which they were dictated in his turn however he was soon compelled to give way by the arrival of griffith in the heavily rowing launch of the frigate which was crowded with a larger body of the seamen who had been employed in the expedition in this manner boat after boat speedily arrived and the whole party were once more happily embarked in safety under their national flag  the small cabin of the alacrity was relinquished to colonel howard and his wards with their attendants the boats were dropped astern each protected by its own keeper and griffith gave forth the mandate to fill the sails and steer broad off into the ocean for more than an hour the cutter held her course in this direction gliding gracefully through the glittering waters rising and settling heavily on the long smooth billows as if conscious of the unusual burden that she was doomed to carry but at the end of that period her head was once more brought near the wind and she was again held at rest awaiting the appearance of the dawn in order to discover the position of the prouder vessel on which she was performing the humble duty of a tender more than a hundred and fifty living men were crowded within her narrow limits and her decks presented in the gloom as she moved along the picture of a mass of human heads  as the freedom of a successful expedition was unavoidably permitted loud jokes and louder merriment broke on the silent waters from the reckless seamen while the exhilarating can passed from hand to hand strange oaths and dreadful denunciations breaking forth at times from some of the excited crew against their enemy at length the bustle of reembarking gradually subsided and many of the crew descended to the hold of the cutter in quest of room to stretch their limbs when a clear manly voice was heard rising above the deep in those strains that a seaman most loves to hear air succeeded air from different voices until even the spirit of harmony grew dull with fatigue and verses began to be heard where songs were expected and fleeting lines succeeded stanzas the decks were soon covered with prostrate men seeking their natural rest under the open heavens and perhaps dreaming as they yielded heavily to the rolling of the vessel of scenes of other times in their own hemisphere the dark glances of katherine were concealed beneath her falling lids and even cecilia with her head bowed on the shoulder of her cousin slept sweetly in innocence and peace boltrope groped his way into the hold among the seamen where kicking one of the most fortunate of the men from his berth he established himself in his place with all that cool indifference to the others comfort that had grown with his experience from the time when he was treated thus cavalierly in his own person to the present moment in this manner head was dropped after head on the planks the guns or on whatever first offered for a pillow until griffith and barnstable alone were left pacing the different sides of the quarterdeck in haughty silence  never did a morning watch appear so long to the two young sailors who were thus deprived by resentment and pride of that frank and friendly communion that had for so many years sweetened the tedious hours of their long and at times dreary service to increase the embarrassment of their situation cecilia and katherine suffering from the confinement of the small and crowded cabin sought the purer air of the deck about the time when the deepest sleep had settled on the senses of the wearied mariners they stood leaning against the taffrail discoursing with each other in low and broken sentences but a sort of instinctive knowledge of the embarrassment which existed between their lovers caused a guarded control over every look or gesture which might be construed into an encouragement for one of the young men to advance at the expense of the other twenty times however did the impatient barnstable feel tempted to throw off the awkward restraint and approach his mistress but in each instance was he checked by the secret consciousness of error as well as by that habitual respect for superior rank that forms a part of the nature of a seaofficer on the other hand griffith manifested no intention to profit by this silent concession in his favor but continued to pace the short quarterdeck with strides more hurried than ever and was seen to throw many an impatient glance towards that quarter of the heavens where the first signs of the lingering day might be expected to appear at length katherine with a ready ingenuity and perhaps with some secret coquetry removed the embarrassment by speaking first taking care to address the lover of her cousin  how long are we condemned to these limited lodgings mr griffith she asked truly there is a freedom in your nautical customs which to say the least is novel to us females who have been accustomed to the division of space  the instant that there is light to discover the frigate miss plowden he answered you shall be transferred from a vessel of an hundred to one of twelve hundred tons if your situation there be less comfortable than when within the walls of st ruth you will not forget that they who live on the ocean claim it as a merit to despise the luxuries of the land  at least sir returned katherine with a sweet grace which she well knew how to assume on occasion what we shall enjoy will be sweetened by liberty and embellished by a sailors hospitality to me cicely the air of this open sea is as fresh and invigorating as if it were wafted from our own distant america  if you have not the arm of a patriot you at least possess a most loyal imagination miss plowden said griffith laughing this soft breeze blows in the direction of the fens of holland instead of the broad plains of americathank god there come the signs of day at last unless the currents have swept the ship far to the north we shall surely see her with the light  this cheering intelligence drew the eyes of the fair cousins towards the east where their delighted looks were long fastened while they watched the glories of the sun rising over the water as the morning had advanced a deeper gloom was spread across the ocean and the stars were gleaming in the heavens like balls of twinkling fire but now a streak of pale light showed itself along the horizon growing brighter and widening at each moment until long fleecy clouds became visible where nothing had been seen before but the dim base of the arch that overhung the dark waters this expanding light which in appearance might be compared to a silvery opening in the heavens was soon tinged with a pale flush which quickened with sudden transitions into glows yet deeper until a belt of broad flame bounded the water diffusing itself more faintly towards the zenith where it melted into the pearlcolored sky or played on the fantastic volumes of a few light clouds with inconstant glimmering while these beautiful transitions were still before the eyes of the youthful admirers of their beauties a voice was heard above them crying as if from the heavens  sailho the frigate lies broad off to the seaward sir  ay ay you have been watching with one eye asleep fellow returned griffith or we should have heard you before look a little north of the place where the glare of the sun is coming miss plowden and you will be able to see our gallant vessel  an involuntary cry of pleasure burst from the lips of katherine as she followed his directions and first beheld the frigate through the medium of the fluctuating colors of the morning the undulating outline of the lazy ocean which rose and fell heavily against the bright boundary of the heavens was without any relief to distract the eye as it fed eagerly on the beauties of the solitary ship she was riding sluggishly on the long seas with only two of her lower and smaller sails spread to hold her in command but her tall masts and heavy yards were painted against the fiery sky in strong lines of deep black while even the smallest cord in the mazes of her rigging might be distinctly traced stretching from spar to spar with the beautiful accuracy of a picture at moments when her huge hull rose on a billow and was lifted against the background of the sky its shape and dimensions were brought into view but these transient glimpses were soon lost as it settled into the trough leaving the waving spars bowing gracefully towards the waters as if about to follow the vessel into the bosom of the deep as a clearer light gradually stole on the senses the delusion of colors and distance vanished together and when a flood of day preceded the immediate appearance of the sun the ship became plainly visible within a mile of the cutter her black hull checkered with ports and her high tapering masts exhibiting their proper proportions and hues  at the first cry of a sail the crew of the alacrity had been aroused from their slumbers by the shrill whistle of the boatswain and long before the admiring looks of the two cousins had ceased to dwell on the fascinating sight of morning chasing night from the hemisphere the cutter was again in motion to join her consort it seemed but a moment before their little vessel was in what the timid females thought a dangerous proximity to the frigate under whose lee she slowly passed in order to admit of the following dialogue between griffith and his aged commander  i rejoice to see you mr griffith cried the captain who stood in the channel of his ship waving his hat in the way of cordial greeting you are welcome back captain manual welcome welcome all of you my boys as welcome as a breeze in the calm latitudes as his eye however passed along the deck of the alacrity it encountered the shrinking figures of cecilia and katherine and a dark shade of displeasure crossed his decent features while he added hows this gentlemen the frigate of congress is neither a ballroom nor a church that is to be thronged with women  ay ay muttered boltrope to his friend the chaplain now the old man has hauled out his mizzen youll see him carry a weatherhelm he wakes up about as often as the trades shift their points and thats once in six months but when there has been a neaptide in his temper for any time youre sure to find it followed by a flood with a vengeance let us hear what the first lieutenant can say in favor of his petticoat quality  the blushing sky had not exhibited a more fiery glow than gleamed in the fine face of griffith for a moment but struggling with his disgust he answered with bitter emphasis  twas the pleasure of mr gray sir to bring off the prisoners  of mr gray repeated the captain instantly losing every trace of displeasure in an air of acquiescence cometo sir on the same tack with the ship and i will hasten to order the accommodationladder rigged to receive our guests  boltrope listened to this sudden alteration in the language of his commander with sufficient wonder nor was it until he had shaken his head repeatedly with the manner of one who saw deeper than his neighbors into a mystery that he found leisure to observe  now parson i suppose if you held an almanac in your fist youd think you could tell which way we shall have the wind tomorrow but damn me priest if better calculators than you havent failed because a lubberlyno hes a thorough seaman ill say that for the fellow because a pilot chooses to say bring me off these here women the ship is to be so cluttered with shecattle that a man will be obligated to spend half his time in making his manners now mind what i tell you priest this very frolic will cost congress the price of a years wages for an ablebodied seaman in bunting and canvas for screens besides the wear and tear of runninggear in shortening sail in order that the women need not be stericky in squalls  the presence of mr boltrope being required to take charge of the cutter the divine was denied an opportunity of dissenting from the opinions of his rough companion for the loveliness of their novel shipmates had not failed to plead loudly in their favor with every man in the cutter whose habits and ideas had not become rigidly set in obstinacy  by the time the alacrity was hoveto with her head towards the frigate the long line of boats that she had been towing during the latter part of the night were brought to her side and filled with men a wild scene of unbridled merriment and gayety succeeded while the seamen were exchanging the confinement of the prize for their accustomed lodgings in the ship during which the reins of discipline were slightly relaxed loud laughter was echoed from boat to boat as they glided by each other and rude jests interlarded with quaint humors and strange oaths were freely bandied from mouth to mouth the noise however soon ceased and the passage of colonel howard and his wards was then effected with less precipitancy and due decorum captain munson who had been holding a secret dialogue with griffith and the pilot received his unexpected guests with plain hospitality but with an evident desire to be civil he politely yielded to their service his two convenient staterooms and invited them to partake in common with himself of the comforts of the great cabin     chapter xxxiii    furious press the hostile squadron   furious he repels their rage   loss of blood at length enfeebles   who can war with thousands wage   spanish war song   we cannot detain the narrative to detail the scenes which busy wonder aided by the relation of divers marvelous feats produced among the curious seamen who remained in the ship and their more fortunate fellows who had returned in glory from an expedition to the land for nearly an hour the turbulence of a general movement was heard issuing from the deep recesses of the frigate and the boisterous sounds of hoarse merriment were listened to by the officers in indulgent silence but all these symptoms of unbridled humor ceased by the time the morning repast was ended when the regular seawatch was set and the greater portion of those whose duty did not require their presence on the vessels deck availed themselves of the opportunity to repair the loss of sleep sustained in the preceding night still no preparations were made to put the ship in motion though long and earnest consultations which were supposed to relate to their future destiny were observed by the younger officers to be held between their captain the first lieutenant and the mysterious pilot the latter threw many an anxious glance along the eastern horizon searching it minutely with his glass and then would turn his impatient looks at the low dense bank of fog which stretching across the ocean like a barrier of cloud entirely intercepted the view towards the south to the north and along the land the air was clear and the sea without a spot of any kind but in the east a small white sail had been discovered since the opening of day which was gradually rising above the water and assuming the appearance of a vessel of some size every officer on the quarterdeck in his turn had examined this distant sail and had ventured an opinion on its destination and character and even katherine who with her cousin was enjoying in the open air the novel beauties of the ocean had been tempted to place her sparkling eye to a glass to gaze at the stranger  it is a collier griffith said who has hauled from the land in the late gale and who is luffing up to his course again if the wind holds here in the south and he does not get into that fogbank we can stand off for him and get a supply of fuel before eight bells are struck  i think his head is to the northward and that he is steering off the wind returned the pilot in a musing manner if that dillon succeeded in getting his express far enough along the coast the alarm has been spread and we must be wary the convoy of the baltic trade is in the north sea and news of our presence could easily have been taken off to it by some of the cutters that line the coast i could wish to get the ship as far south as the helder  then we lose this weather tide exclaimed the impatient griffith surely we have the cutter as a lookout besides by beating into the fog we shall lose the enemy if enemy it be and it is thought meet for an american frigate to skulk from her foes  the scornful expression that kindled the eye of the pilot like a gleam of sunshine lighting for an instant some dark dell and laying bare its secrets was soon lost in the usually quiet look of his glance though he hesitated like one who was struggling with his passions before he answered  if prudence and the service of the states require it even this proud frigate must retreat and hide from the meanest of her enemies my advice captain munson is that you make sail and beat the ship to windward as mr griffith has suggested and that you order the cutter to precede us keeping more in with the land  the aged seaman who evidently suspended his orders only to receive an intimation of the others pleasure immediately commanded his youthful assistant to issue the necessary mandates to put these measures in force accordingly the alacrity which vessel had been left under the command of the junior lieutenant of the frigate was quickly under way and making short stretches to windward she soon entered the bank of fog and was lost to the eye in the mean time the canvas of the ship was loosened and spread leisurely in order not to disturb the portion of the crew who were sleeping and following her little consort she moved heavily through the water bearing up against the dull breeze  the quiet of regular duty had succeeded to the bustle of making sail and as the rays of the sun fell less obliquely on the distant land katherine and cecilia were amusing griffith by vain attempts to point out the rounded eminences which they fancied lay in the vicinity of the deserted mansion of st ruth barnstable who had resumed his former station in the frigate as her second lieutenant was pacing the opposite side of the quarterdeck holding under his arm the speakingtrumpet which denoted that he held the temporary control of the motions of the ship and inwardly cursing the restraint that kept him from the side of his mistress at this moment of universal quiet when nothing above low dialogues interrupted the dashing of the waves as they were thrown lazily aside by the bows of the vessel the report of a light cannon burst out of the barrier of fog and rolled by them on the breeze apparently vibrating with the rising and sinking of the waters  there goes the cutter exclaimed griffith the instant the sound was heard  surely said the captain somers is not so indiscreet as to scale his guns after the caution he has received  no idle scaling of guns is intended there said the pilot straining his eyes to pierce the fog but soon turning away in disappointment at his inability to succeedthat gun is shotted and has been fired in the hurry of a sudden signalcan your lookouts see nothing mr barnstable  the lieutenant of the watch hailed the man aloft and demanded if anything were visible in the direction of the wind and received for answer that the fog intercepted the view in that quarter of the heavens but that the sail in the east was a ship running large or before the wind the pilot shook his head doubtingly at this information but still he manifested a strong reluctance to relinquish the attempt of getting more to the southward again he communed with the commander of the frigate apart from all other ears and while they yet deliberated a second report was heard leaving no doubt that the alacrity was firing signalguns for their particular attention  perhaps said griffith he wishes to point out his position or to ascertain ours believing that we are lost like himself in the mist  we have our compasses returned the doubting captain somers has a meaning in what he says  see cried katherine with girlish delight see my cousin see barnstable how beautifully that vapor is wreathing itself in clouds above the smoky line of fog it stretches already into the very heavens like a lofty pyramid  barnstable sprang lightly on a gun as he repeated her words  pyramids of fog and wreathing clouds by heaven he shouted tis a tall ship royals skysails and studdingsails all abroad she is within a mile of us and comes down like a racehorse with a spanking breeze dead before it now know we why somers is speaking in the mist  ay cried griffith and there goes the alacrity just breaking out of the fog hovering in for the land  there is a mighty hull under all that cloud of canvas captain munson said the observant but calm pilot it is time gentlemen to edge away to leeward  what before we know from whom we run cried griffith my life on it there is no single ship king george owns but would tire of the sport before she had played a full game of bowls with  the haughty air of the young man was daunted by the severe look he encountered in the eye of the pilot and he suddenly ceased though inwardly chafing with impatient pride  the same eye that detected the canvas above the fog might have seen the flag of a viceadmiral fluttering still nearer the heavens returned the collected stranger and england faulty as she may be is yet too generous to place a flagofficer in time of war in command of a frigate or a captain in command of a fleet she knows the value of those who shed their blood in her behalf and it is thus that she is so well served believe me captain munson there is nothing short of a ship of the line under that symbol of rank and that broad show of canvas  we shall see sir we shall see returned the old officer whose manner grew decided as the danger appeared to thicken beat to quarters mr griffith for we have none but enemies to expect on this coast  the order was instantly issued when griffith remarked with a more temperate zeal  if mr gray be right we shall have reason to thank god that we are so light of heel  the cry of a strange vessel close aboard the frigate having already flown down the hatches the ship was in an uproar at the first tap of the drum the seamen threw themselves from their hammocks and lashing them rapidly into long hard bundles they rushed to the decks where they were dexterously stowed in the netting to aid the defences of the upper part of the vessel while this tumultuous scene was exhibiting griffith gave a secret order to merry who disappeared leading his trembling cousins to a place of safety in the inmost depths of the ship  the guns were cleared of their lumber and loosened the bulkheads were knocked down and the cabin relieved of its furniture and the gundeck exhibited one unbroken line of formidable cannon arranged in all the order of a naval battery ready to engage armchests were thrown open and the decks strewed with pikes cutlasses pistols and all the various weapons for boarding in short the yards were slung and every other arrangement was made with a readiness and dexterity that were actually wonderful though all was performed amid an appearance of disorder and confusion that rendered the ship another babel during the continuance of the preparations in a very few minutes everything was completed and even the voices of the men ceased to be heard answering to their names as they were mustered at their stations by their respective officers gradually the ship became as quiet as the grave and when even griffith or his commander found it necessary to speak their voices were calmer and their tones more mild than usual the course of the vessel was changed to an oblique line from that in which their enemy was approaching though the appearance of flight was to be studiously avoided to the last moment when nothing further remained to be done every eye became fixed on the enormous pile of swelling canvas that was rising in cloud over cloud far above the fog and which was manifestly moving like driving vapor swiftly to the north presently the dull smoky boundary of the mist which rested on the water was pushed aside in vast volumes and the long taper spars that projected from the bowsprit of the strange ship issued from the obscurity and were quickly followed by the whole of the enormous fabric to which they were merely light appendages for a moment streaks of reluctant vapor clung to the huge floating pile but they were soon shaken off by the rapid vessel and the whole of her black hull became distinct to the eye  one two three rows of teeth said boltrope deliberately counting the tiers of guns that bristled along the sides of the enemy a three decker jack manly would show his stern to such a fellow t and even the bloody scotchman would run  hard up with your helm quartermaster cried captain munson there is indeed no time to hesitate with such an enemy within a quarter of a mile turn the hands up mr griffith and pack on the ship from her trucks to her lower studdingsailbooms be stirring sir be stirring hard up with your helm hard up and be damnd to you  the unusual earnestness of their aged commander acted on the startled crew like a voice from the deep and they waited not for the usual signals of the boatswain and drummer to be given before they broke away from their guns and rushed tumultuously to aid in spreading the desired canvas there was one minute of ominous confusion that to an inexperienced eye would have foreboded the destruction of all order in the vessel during which every hand and each tongue seemed in motion but it ended in opening the immense folds of light duck which were displayed along the whole line of the masts far beyond the ordinary sails overshadowing the waters for a great distance on either side of the vessel during the moment of inaction that succeeded this sudden exertion the breeze which had brought up the threedecker fell fresher on the sails of the frigate and she started away from her dangerous enemy with a very perceptible advantage in point of sailing  the fog rises cried griffith give us but the wind for an hour and we shall run her out of gunshot  these nineties are very fast off the wind returned the captain in a low tone that was intended only for the ears of his first lieutenant and the pilot and we shall have a struggle for it  the quick eye of the stranger was glancing over the movements of his enemy while he answered  he finds we have the heels of him already he is making ready and we shall be fortunate to escape a broadside let her yaw a little mr griffith touch her lightly with the helm if we are raked sir we are lost  the captain sprang on the taffrail of his ship with the activity of a younger man and in an instant he perceived the truth of the others conjecture  both vessels now ran for a few minutes keenly watching each others motions like two skilful combatants the english ship making slight deviations from the line of her course and then as her movements were anticipated by the other turning as cautiously in the opposite direction until a sudden and wide sweep of her huge bows told the americans plainly on which tack to expect her captain munson made a silent but impressive gesture with his arm as if the crisis were too important for speech which indicated to the watchful griffith the way he wished the frigate sheered to avoid the weight of the impending danger both vessels whirled swiftly up to the wind with their heads towards the land and as the huge black side of the threedecker checkered with its triple batteries frowned full upon her foe it belched forth a flood of fire and smoke accompanied by a bellowing roar that mocked the surly moanings of the sleeping ocean the nerves of the bravest man in the frigate contracted their fibres as the hurricane of iron hurtled by them and each eye appeared to gaze in stupid wonder as if tracing the flight of the swift engines of destruction but the voice of captain munson was heard in the din shouting while he waved his hat earnestly in the required direction  meet her meet her with the helm boy meet her mr griffith meet her  griffith had so far anticipated this movement as to have already ordered the head of the frigate to be turned in its former course when struck by the unearthly cry of the last tones uttered by his commander he bent his head and beheld the venerable seaman driven through the air his hat still waving his gray hair floating in the wind and his eye set in the wild look of death  great god exclaimed the young man rushing to the side of the ship where he was just in time to see the lifeless body disappear in the waters that were dyed in its blood he has been struck by a shot lower away the boat lower away the jollyboat the barge the tiger the  tis useless interrupted the calm deep voice of the pilot he has met a warriors end and he sleeps in a sailors grave the ship is getting before the wind again and the enemy is keeping his vessel away  the youthful lieutenant was recalled by these words to his duty and reluctantly turned his eyes away from the bloody spot on the waters which the busy frigate had already passed to resume the command of the vessel with a forced composure  he has cut some of our runninggear said the master whose eye had never ceased to dwell on the spars and rigging of the ship and theres a splinter out of the maintopmast that is big enough for a fid he has let daylight through some of our canvas too but taking it byand large the squall has gone over and little harm done didnt i hear something said of captain munson getting jammed by a shot  he is killed said griffith speaking in a voice that was yet husky with horrorhe is dead sir and carried overboard there is more need that we forget not ourselves in this crisis  dead said boltrope suspending the operation of his active jaws for a moment in surprise and buried in a wet jacket well it is lucky tis no worse for damme if i did not think every stick in the ship would have been cut out of her  with this consolatory remark on his lips the master walked slowly forward continuing his orders to repair the damages with a singleness of purpose that rendered him however uncouth as a friend an invaluable man in his station  griffith had not yet brought his mind to the calmness that was so essential to discharge the duties which had thus suddenly and awfully devolved on him when his elbow was lightly touched by the pilot who had drawn closer to his side  the enemy appear satisfied with the experiment said the stranger and as we work the quicker of the two he loses too much ground to repeat it if he be a true seaman  and yet as he finds we leave him so fast returned griffith he must see that all his hopes rest in cutting us up aloft i dread that he will come by the wind again and lay us under his broadside we should need a quarter of an hour to run without his range if he were anchored  he plays a surer gamesee you not that the vessel we made in the eastern board shows the hull of a frigate tis past a doubt that they are of one squadron and that the expresses have sent them in our wake the english admiral has spread a broad clew mr griffith and as he gathers in his ships he sees that his game has been successful  the faculties of griffith had been too much occupied with the hurry of the chase to look at the ocean but startled at the information of the pilot who spoke coolly though like a man sensible of the existence of approaching danger he took the glass from the other and with his own eye examined the different vessels in sight it is certain that the experienced officer whose flag was flying above the light sails of the threedecker saw the critical situation of his chase and reasoned much in the same manner as the pilot or the fearful expedient apprehended by griffith would have been adopted prudence however dictated that he should prevent his enemy from escaping by pressing so closely on his rear as to render it impossible for the american to haul across his bows and run into the open sea between his own vessel and the nearest frigate of his squadron the unpractised reader will be able to comprehend the case better by accompanying the understanding eye of griffith as it glanced from point to point following the whole horizon to the west lay the land along which the alacrity was urging her way industriously with the double purpose of keeping her consort abeam and of avoiding a dangerous proximity to their powerful enemy to the east bearing off the starboard bow of the american frigate was the vessel first seen and which now began to exhibit the hostile appearance of a ship of war steering in a line converging towards themselves and rapidly drawing nigher while far in the northeast was a vessel as yet faintly discerned whose evolutions could not be mistaken by one who understood the movements of nautical warfare  we are hemmed in effectually said griffith dropping the glass from his eye and i know not but our wisest course would be to haul in to the land and cutting everything light adrift endeavor to pass the broadside of the flagship  provided she left a rag of canvas to do it with returned the pilot sir tis an idle hope she would strip your ship in ten minutes to her plankshears had it not been for a lucky wave on which so many of her shot struck and glanced upwards we should have nothing to boast of left from the fire she has already given we must stand on and drop the threedecker as far as possible  but the frigates said griffith what are we to do with the frigates  fight them returned the pilot in a low determined voice fight them young man i have borne the stars and stripes aloft in greater straits than this and even with honor think not that my fortune will desert me now  we shall have an hour of desperate battle  on that we may calculate but i have lived through whole days of bloodshed you seem not one to quail at the sight of an enemy  let me proclaim your name to the men said griffith twill quicken their blood and at such a moment be a host in itself  they want it not returned the pilot checking the hasty zeal of the other with his hand i would be unnoticed unless i am known as becomes me i will share your danger but would not rob you of a tittle of your glory should we come to grapple he continued while a smile of conscious pride gleamed across his face i will give forth the word as a warcry and believe me these english will quail before it  griffith submitted to the strangers will and after they had deliberated further on the nature of their evolutions he gave his attention again to the management of the vessel the first object which met his eye on turning from the pilot was colonel howard pacing the quarterdeck with a determined brow and a haughty mien as if already in the enjoyment of that triumph which now seemed certain  i fear sir said the young man approaching him with respect that you will soon find the deck unpleasant and dangerous your wards are  mention not the unworthy term interrupted the colonel what greater pleasure can there be than to inhale the odor of loyalty that is wafted from yonder floating tower of the kingand danger you know but little of old george howard young man if you think he would for thousands miss seeing that symbol of rebellion leveled before the flag of his majesty  if that be your wish colonel howard returned griffith biting his lip as he looked around at the wondering seamen who were listeners you will wait in vain but i pledge you my word that when that time arrives you shall be advised and that your own hands shall do the ignoble deed  edward griffith why not this moment this is your moment of probation submit to the clemency of the crown and yield your crew to the royal mercy in such a case i would remember the child of my brother harrys friend and believe me my name is known to the ministry and you misguided and ignorant abettors of rebellion cast aside your useless weapons or prepare to meet the vengeance of yonder powerful and victorious servant of your prince  fall back back with ye fellows cried griffith fiercely to the men who were gathering around the colonel with looks of sullen vengeance if a man of you dare approach him he shall be cast into the sea  the sailors retreated at the order of their commander but the elated veteran had continued to pace the deck for many minutes before stronger interests diverted the angry glances of the seamen to other objects  notwithstanding the ship of the line was slowly sinking beneath the distant waves and in less than an hour from the time she had fired the broadside no more than one of her three tiers of guns was visible from the deck of the frigate she yet presented an irresistible obstacle against retreat to the south on the other hand the ship first seen drew so nigh as to render the glass no longer necessary in watching her movements she proved to be a frigate though one so materially lighter than the american as to have rendered her conquest easy had not her two consorts continued to press on for the scene of battle with such rapidity during the chase the scene had shifted from the point opposite to st ruth to the verge of those shoals where our tale commenced as they approached the latter the smallest of the english ships drew so nigh as to render the combat unavoidable griffith and his crew had not been idle in the intermediate time but all the usual preparations against the casualties of a seafight had been duly made when the drum once more called the men to their quarters and the ship was deliberately stripped of her unnecessary sails like a prizefighter about to enter the arena casting aside the encumbrances of dress at the instant she gave this intimation of her intention to abandon flight and trust the issue to the combat the nearest english frigate also took in her light canvas in token of her acceptance of the challenge  he is but a little fellow said griffith to the pilot who hovered at his elbow with a sort of fatherly interest in the others conduct of the battle though he carries a stout heart  we must crush him at a blow returned the stranger not a shot must be delivered until our yards are locking  i see him training his twelves upon us already we may soon expect his fire  after standing the brunt of a ninetygun ship observed the collected pilot we shall not shrink from the broadside of a twoandthirty  stand to your guns men cried griffith through his trumpetnot a shot is to be fired without the order  this caution so necessary to check the ardor of the seamen was hardly uttered before their enemy became wrapped in sheets of fire and volumes of smoke as gun after gun hurled its iron missiles at their vessel in quick succession ten minutes might have passed the two vessels sheering close to each other every foot they advanced during which time the crew of the american were compelled by their commander to suffer the fire of their adversary without returning a shot this short period which seemed an age to the seamen was distinguished in their vessel by deep silence even the wounded and dying who fell in every part of the ship stifled their groans under the influence of the severe discipline which gave a character to every man and each movement of the vessel and those officers who were required to speak were heard only in the lowest tones of resolute preparation at length the ship slowly entered the skirts of the smoke that enveloped their enemy and griffith heard the man who stood at his side whisper the word now  let them have it cried griffith in a voice that was heard in the remotest parts of the ship  the shout that burst from the seamen appeared to lift the decks of the vessel and the affrighted frigate trembled like an aspen with the recoil of her own massive artillery that shot forth a single sheet of flame the sailors having disregarded in their impatience the usual order of firing the effect of the broadside on the enemy was still more dreadful for a deathlike silence succeeded to the roar of the guns which was only broken by the shrieks and execrations that burst from her like the moanings of the damned during the few moments in which the americans were again loading their cannon and the english were recovering from their confusion the vessel of the former moved slowly past her antagonist and was already doubling across her bows when the latter was suddenly and considering the inequality of their forces it may be added desperately headed into her enemy the two frigates grappled the sudden and furious charge made by the englishman as he threw his masses of daring seamen along his bowsprit and out of his channels had nearly taken griffith by surprise but manual who had delivered his first fire with the broadside now did good service by ordering his men to beat back the intruders by a steady and continued discharge even the wary pilot lost sight of their other foes in the high daring of that moment and smiles of stern pleasure were exchanged between him and griffith as both comprehended at a glance their advantages  lash his bowsprit to our mizzenmast shouted the lieutenant and we will sweep his decks as he lies  twenty men sprang eagerly forward to execute the order among the foremost of whom were boltrope and the stranger  ay now hes our own cried the busy master and we will take an owners liberties with him and break him upfor by the eternal  peace rude man said the pilot in a voice of solemn remonstrance at the next instant you may face your god mock not his awful name  the master found time before he threw himself from the spar on the deck of the frigate again to cast a look of amazement at his companion who with a steady mien but with an eye that lighted with a warriors ardor viewed the battle that raged around him like one who marked its progress to control the result  the sight of the englishmen rushing onward with shouts and bitter menaces warmed the blood of colonel howard who pressed to the side of the frigate and encouraged his friends by his gestures and voice to come on  away with ye old croaker cried the master seizing him by the collar away with ye to the hold or ill order you fired from a gun  down with your arms rebellious dog shouted the colonel carried beyond himself by the ardor of the fray down to the dust and implore the mercy of your injured prince  invigorated by a momentary glow the veteran grappled with his brawny antagonist but the issue of the short struggle was yet suspended when the english driven back by the fire of the marines and the menacing front that griffith with his boarders presented retreated to the forecastle of their own ship and attempted to return the deadly blows they were receiving in their hull from the cannon that barnstable directed a solitary gun was all they could bring to bear on the americans but this loaded with cannister was fired so near as to send its glaring flame into the very faces of their enemies the struggling colonel who was already sinking beneath the arm of his foe felt the rough grasp loosen from his throat at the flash and the two combatants sunk powerless on their knees facing each other  how now brother exclaimed boltrope with a smile of grim fierceness some of that grist has gone to your mill ha  no answer could however be given before the yielding forms of both fell to the deck where they lay helpless amid the din of the battle and the wild confusion of the eager combatants  notwithstanding the furious struggle they witnessed the elements did not cease their functions and urged by the breeze and lifted irresistibly on a wave the american ship was forced through the water still further across the bows of her enemy the idle fastenings of hemp and iron were snapped asunder like strings of tow and griffith saw his own ship borne away from the englishman at the instant that the bowsprit of the latter was torn from its lashings and tumbled into the sea followed by spar after spar until nothing of all her proud tackling was remaining but the few parted and useless ropes that were left dangling along the stumps of her lower masts as his own stately vessel moved from the confusion she had caused and left the dense cloud of smoke in which her helpless antagonist lay the eye of the young man glanced anxiously toward the horizon where he now remembered he had more foes to contend against  we have shaken off the thirtytwo most happily he said to the pilot who followed his motions with singular interest but here is another fellow sheering in for us who shows as many ports as ourselves and who appears inclined for a closer interview besides the hull of the ninety is rising again and i fear she will be down but too soon  we must keep the use of our braces and sails returned the pilot and on no account close with the other frigate we must play a double game sir and fight this new adversary with our heels as well as with our guns  tis time then that we were busy for he is shortening sail and as he nears so fast we may expect to hear from him every minute what do you propose sir  let him gather in his canvas returned the pilot and when he thinks himself snug we can throw out a hundred men at once upon our yards and spread everything alow and aloft we may then draw ahead of him by surprise if we can once get him in our wake i have no fears of dropping them all  a stern chase is a long chase cried griffith and the thing may do clear up the decks here and carry down the wounded and as we have our hands full the poor fellows who have done with us must go overboard at once  this melancholy duty was instantly attended to while the young seaman who commanded the frigate returned to his duty with the absorbed air of one who felt its high responsibility these occupations however did not prevent his hearing the sounds of barnstables voice calling eagerly to young merry bending his head towards the sound griffith beheld his friend looking anxiously up the main hatch with a face grimed with smoke his coat off and his shirt bespattered with human blood tell me boy he said is mr griffith untouched they say that a shot came in upon the quarterdeck that tripped up the heels of half a dozen  before merry could answer the eyes of barnstable which even while he spoke was scanning the state of the vessels rigging encountered the kind looks of griffith and from that moment perfect harmony was restored between the friends  ah you are there griff and with a whole skin i see cried barnstable smiling with pleasure they have passed poor boltrope down into one of his own storerooms if that fellows bowsprit had held on ten minutes longer what a mark i should have made on his face and eyes  tis perhaps best as it is returned griffith but what have you done with those whom we are most bound to protect  barnstable made a significant gesture towards the depths of the vessel as he answered  on the cables safe as wood iron and water can keep themthough katherine has had her head up three times to  a summons from the pilot drew griffith away and the young officers were compelled to forget their individual feelings in the pressing duties of their stations the ship which the american frigate had now to oppose was a vessel of near her own size and equipage and when griffith looked at her again he perceived that she had made her preparations to assert her equality in manful fight  her sails had been gradually reduced to the usual quantity and by certain movements on her decks the lieutenant and his constant attendant the pilot well understood that she only wanted to lessen her distance a few hundred yards to begin the action  now spread everything whispered the stranger  griffith applied the trumpet to his mouth and shouted in a voice that was carried even to his enemy let fallout with your boomssheet homehoist away of everything  the inspiring cry was answered by a universal bustle fifty men flew out on the dizzy heights of the different spars while broad sheets of canvas rose as suddenly along the masts as if some mighty bird were spreading its wings the englishman instantly perceived his mistake and he answered the artifice by a roar of artillery griffith watched the effects of the broadside with an absorbing interest as the shot whistled above his head but when he perceived his masts untouched and the few unimportant ropes only that were cut he replied to the uproar with a burst of pleasure a few men were however seen clinging with wild frenzy to the cordage dropping from rope to rope like wounded birds fluttering through a tree until they fell heavily into the ocean the sullen ship sweeping by them in cold indifference at the next instant the spars and masts of their enemy exhibited a display of men similar to their own when griffith again placed the trumpet to his mouth and shouted aloud  give it to them drive them from their yards boys scatter them with your grapeunreeve their rigging  the crew of the american wanted but little encouragement to enter on this experiment with hearty good will and the close of his cheering words were uttered amid the deafening roar of his own cannon the pilot had however mistaken the skill and readiness of their foe for notwithstanding the disadvantageous circumstances under which the englishman increased his sail the duty was steadily and dexterously performed  the two ships were now running rapidly on parallel lines hurling at each other their instruments of destruction with furious industry and with severe and certain loss to both though with no manifest advantage in favor of either both griffith and the pilot witnessed with deep concern this unexpected defeat of their hopes for they could not conceal from themselves that each moment lessened their velocity through the water as the shot of their enemy stripped the canvas from the yards or dashed aside the lighter spars in their terrible progress  we find our equal here said griffith to the stranger the ninety is heaving up again like a mountain and if we continue to shorten sail at this rate she will soon be down upon us  you say true sir returned the pilot musing the man shows judgment as well as spirit but  he was interrupted by merry who rushed from the forward part of the vessel his whole face betokening the eagerness of his spirit and the importance of his intelligence  the breakers he cried when nigh enough to be heard amid the din we are running dead on a ripple and the sea is white not two hundred yards ahead  the pilot jumped on a gun and bending to catch a glimpse through the smoke he shouted in those clear piercing tones that could be even heard among the roaring of the cannon port port your helm we are on the devils grip pass up the trumpet sir port your helm fellow give it them boysgive it to the proud english dogs griffith unhesitatingly relinquished the symbol of his rank fastening his own firm look on the calm but quick eye of the pilot and gathering assurance from the high confidence he read in the countenance of the stranger the seamen were too busy with their cannon and their rigging to regard the new danger and the frigate entered one of the dangerous passes of the shoals in the heat of a severely contested battle the wondering looks of a few of the older sailors glanced at the sheets of foam that flew by them in doubt whether the wild gambols of the waves were occasioned by the shot of the enemy when suddenly the noise of cannon was succeeded by the sullen wash of the disturbed element and presently the vessel glided out of her smoky shroud and was boldly steering in the centre of the narrow passages for ten breathless minutes longer the pilot continued to hold an uninterrupted sway during which the vessel ran swiftly by ripples and breakers by streaks of foam and darker passages of deep water when he threw down his trumpet and exclaimed  what threatened to be our destruction has proved our salvation keep yonder hill crowned with wood one point open from the church tower at its base and steer east by north you will run through these shoals on that course in an hour and by so doing you will gain five leagues of your enemy who will have to double their tail  the moment he stepped from the gun the pilot lost the air of authority that had so singularly distinguished his animated form and even the close interest he had manifested in the incidents of the day became lost in the cold settled reserve he had affected during his intercourse with his present associates every officer in the ship after the breathless suspense of uncertainly had passed rushed to those places where a view might be taken of their enemies the ninety was still steering bolly onward and had already approached the twoandthirty which lay a helpless wreck rolling on the unruly seas that were rudely tossing her on their wanton billows the frigate last engaged was running along the edge of the ripple with her torn sails flying loosely in the air her ragged spars tottering in the breeze and everything above her hull exhibiting the confusion of a sudden and unlookedfor check to her progress the exulting taunts and mirthful congratulations of the seamen as they gazed at the english ships were however soon forgotten in the attention that was required to their own vessel the drums beat the retreat the guns were lashed the wounded again removed and every individual able to keep the deck was required to lend his assistance in repairing the damages of the frigate and securing her masts  the promised hour carried the ship safely through all the dangers which were much lessened by daylight and by the time the sun had begun to fall over the land griffith who had not quitted the deck during the day beheld his vessel once more cleared of the confusion of the chase and battle and ready to meet another foe at this period he was summoned to the cabin at the request of the ships chaplain delivering the charge of the frigate to barnstable who had been his active assistant no less in their subsequent labors than in the combat he hastily divested himself of the vestiges of the fight and proceeded to obey the repeated and earnest call     chapter xxxiv    whither midst falling dew   while glow the heavens with the last steps of day   far through their rosy depths dost thou pursue   thy solitary way   bryant   when the young seaman who now commanded the frigate descended from the quarterdeck in compliance with the of tenrepeated summons he found the vessel restored to the same neatness as if nothing had occurred to disturb its order the gundeck had been cleansed of its horrid stains and the smoke of the fight had long since ascended through the hatches and mingled with the clouds that flitted above the ship as he walked along the silent batteries even the urgency of his visit could not prevent him from glancing his eyes towards the splintered sides those terrible vestiges by which the paths of the shot of their enemy might be traced and by the time he tapped lightly at the door of the cabin his quick look had embraced every material injury the vessel had sustained in her principal points of defence the door was opened by the surgeon of the frigate who as he stepped aside to permit griffith to enter shook his head with that air of meaning which in one of his profession is understood to imply the abandonment of all hopes and then immediately quitted the apartment in order to attend to those who might profit by his services  the reader is not to imagine that griffith had lost sight of cecilia and her cousin during the occurrences of that eventful day on the contrary his troubled fancy had presented her terror and distress even in the hottest moments of the fight and the instant that the crew were called from their guns he had issued an order to replace the bulkheads of the cabin and to arrange its furniture for their accommodation though the higher and imperious duties of his station had precluded his attending to their comfort in person he expected therefore to find the order of the rooms restored but he was by no means prepared to encounter the scene he was now to witness  between two of the sullen cannon which gave such an air of singular wildness to the real comfort of the cabin was placed a large couch on which the colonel was lying evidently near his end cecilia was weeping by his side her dark ringlets falling in unheeded confusion around her pale features and sweeping in their rich exuberance the deck on which she kneeled katherine leaned tenderly over the form of the dying veteran while her dark tearful eyes seemed to express selfaccusation blended with deep commiseration a few attendants of both sexes surrounded the solemn scene all of whom appeared to be under the influence of the hopeless intelligence which the medical officer had but that moment communicated the servants of the ship had replaced the furniture with a care that mocked the dreadful struggle that so recently disfigured the warlike apartment and the stout square frame of boltrope occupied the opposite settee his head resting on the lap of the captains steward and his hand gently held in the grasp of his friend the chaplain griffith had heard of the wound of the master but his own eyes now conveyed the first intelligence of the situation of colonel howard when the shock of this sudden discovery had a little subsided the young man approached the couch of the latter and attempted to express his regret and pity in a voice that afforded an assurance of his sincerity  say no more edward griffith interrupted the colonel waving his hand feebly for silence it seemeth to be the will of god that this rebellion should triumph and it is not for vain man to impeach the acts of omnipotence to my erring faculties it wears an appearance of mystery but doubtless it is to answer the purpose of his own inscrutable providence i have sent for you edward on a business that i would fain see accomplished before i die that it may not be said that old george howard neglected his duty even in his last moments you see this weeping child at my side tell me young man do you love the maiden  am i to be asked such a question exclaimed griffith  and will you cherish herwill you supply to her the places of father and motherwill you become the fond guardian of her innocence and weakness  griffith could give no other answer than a fervent pressure of the hand he had clasped  i believe you continued the dying man for however he may have forgotten to inculcate his own loyalty worthy hugh griffith could never neglect to make his son a man of honor i had weak and perhaps evil wishes in behalf of my late unfortunate kinsman mr christopher dillon but they have told me that he was false to his faith if this be true i would refuse him the hand of the girl though he claimed the fealty of the british realms but he has passed away and i am about to follow him into a world where we shall find but one lord to serve and it may have been better for us both had we more remembered our duty to him while serving the princes of the earth one thing furtherknow you this officer of your congress wellthis mr barnstable  i have sailed with him for years returned griffith and can answer for him as myself  the veteran made an effort to rise which in part succeeded and he fastened on the youth a look of keen scrutiny that gave to his pallid features an expression of solemn meaning as he continued  speak not now sir as the companion of his idle pleasures and as the unthinking associate commends his fellow but remember that your opinion is given to a dying man who leans on your judgment for advice the daughter of john plowden is a trust not to be neglected nor will my death prove easy if a doubt of her being worthily bestowed shall remain  he is a gentleman returned griffith and one whose heart is not less kind than gallanthe loves your ward and great as may be her merit he is deserving of it alllike myself he has also loved the land that gave him birth before the land of his ancestors but  that is now forgotten interrupted the colonel after what i have this day witnessed i am forced to believe that it is the pleasure of heaven that you are to prevail but sir a disobedient inferior will be apt to make an unreasonable commander the recent contention between you  remember it not dear sir exclaimed griffith with generous zeal twas unkindly provoked and it is already forgotten and pardoned he has sustained me nobly throughout the day and my life on it that he knows how to treat a woman as a brave man should  then am i content said the veteran sinking back on his couch let him be summoned  the whispering message which griffith gave requesting mr barnstable to enter the cabin was quickly conveyed and he had appeared before his friend deemed it discreet to disturb the reflections of the veteran by again addressing him when the entrance of the young sailor was announced the colonel again roused himself and addressed his wondering listener though in a manner much less confiding and familiar than that which he had adopted towards griffith  the declarations you made last night relative to my ward the daughter of the late captain john plowden sir have left me nothing to learn on the subject of your wishes here then gentlemen you both obtain the reward of your attentions let that reverend divine hear you pronounce the marriage vows while i have strength to listen that i may be a witness against ye in heaven should ye forget their tenor  not now not now murmured cecilia oh ask it not now my uncle  katherine spoke not but deeply touched by the tender interest her guardian manifested in her welfare she bowed her face to her bosom in subdued feeling and suffered the tears that had been suffusing her eyes to roll down her cheeks in large drops till they bathed the deck  yes now my love continued the colonel or i fail in my duty i go shortly to stand face to face with your parents my children for the man who dying expects not to meet worthy hugh griffith and honest jack plowden in heaven can have no clear view of the rewards that belong to lives of faithful service to the country or of gallant loyalty to the king i trust no one can justly say that i ever forgot the delicacy due to your gentle sex but it is no moment for idle ceremony when time is shortening into minutes and heavy duties remain to be discharged i could not die in peace children were i to leave you here in the wide ocean i had almost said in the wide world without that protection which becomes your tender years and still more tender characters if it has pleased god to remove your guardian let his place be supplied by those he wills to succeed him  cecilia no longer hesitated but she arose slowly from her knees and offered her hand to griffith with an air of forced resignation katherine submitted to be led by barnstable to her side and the chaplain who had been an affected listener to the dialogue in obedience to an expressive signal from the eye of griffith opened the prayerbook from which he had been gleaning consolation for the dying master and commenced reading in trembling tones the marriage service the vows were pronounced by the weeping brides in voices more distinct and audible than if they had been uttered amid the gay crowds that usually throng a bridal for though they were the irreclaimable words that bound them forever to the men whose power over their feelings they thus proclaimed to the world the reserve of maiden diffidence was lost in one engrossing emotion of solemnity created by the awful presence in which they stood when the benediction was pronounced the head of cecilia dropped on the shoulder of her husband where she wept violently for a moment and then resuming her place at the couch she once more knelt at the side of her uncle katherine received the warm kiss of barnstable passively and returned to the spot whence she had been led  colonel howard succeeded in raising his person to witness the ceremony and had answered to each prayer with a fervent amen he fell back with the last words and a look of satisfaction shone in his aged and pallid features that declared the interest he had taken in the scene  i thank you my children he at length uttered i thank you for i know how much you have sacrificed to my wishes you will find all my papers relative to the estates of my wards gentlemen in the hands of my banker in london and you will also find there my will edward by which you will learn that cicely has not come to your arms an unportioned bride what my wards are in persons and manners your eyes can witness and i trust the vouchers in london will show that i have not been an unfaithful steward to their pecuniary affairs  name it notsay no more or you will break my heart cried katherine sobbing aloud in the violence of her remorse at having ever pained so true a friend oh talk of yourself think of yourself we are unworthyat least i am unworthy of another thought  the dying man extended a hand to her in kindness and continued though his voice grew feebler as he spoke  then to return to myselfi would wish to lie like my ancestors in the bosom of the earthand in consecrated ground  it shall be done whispered griffith i will see it done myself  i thank thee my son said the veteran for such thou art to me in being the husband of cicelyyou will find in my will that i have liberated and provided for all my slavesexcept those ungrateful scoundrels who deserted their masterthey have seized their own freedom and they need not be indebted to me for the same there is edward also an unworthy legacy to the king his majesty will deign to receive itfrom an old and faithful servant and you will not miss the trifling gift a long pause followed as if he had been summing up the account of his earthly duties and found them duly balanced when he added kiss me cicelyand you katherinei find you have the genuine feelings of honest jack your fathermy eyes grow dimwhich is the hand of griffith young gentleman i have given you all that a fond old man had to bestowdeal tenderly with the precious childwe have not properly understood each otheri had mistaken both you and mr christopher dillon i believe perhaps i may also have mistaken my duty to americabut i was too old to change my politics or my religionii i loved the kinggod bless him  his words became fainter and fainter as he proceeded and the breath deserted his body with this benediction on his livid lips which the proudest monarch might covet from so honest a man  the body was instantly borne into a stateroom by the attendants and griffith and barnstable supported their brides into the aftercabin where they left them seated on the sofa that lined the stern of the ship weeping bitterly in each others arms  no part of the preceding scene had been unobserved by boltrope whose small hard eyes were observed by the young men to twinkle when they returned into the state apartment and they approached their wounded comrade to apologize for the seeming neglect that their conduct had displayed  i heard you were hurt boltrope said griffith taking him kindly by the hand but as i know you are not unused to being marked by shot i trust we shall soon see you again on deck  ay ay returned the master youll want no spy glasses to see the old hulk as you launch it into the sea i have had shot as you say before now to tear my runninggear and even to knock a splinter out of some of my timbers but this fellow has found his way into my bread room and the cruise of life is up  surely the case is not so bad honest david said barnstable you have kept afloat to my knowledge with a bigger hole in your skin than this unlucky hit has made  ay ay returned the master that was in my upper works where the doctor could get at it with a plug but this chap has knocked away the shiftingboards and i feel as if the whole cargo was broken up you may say that tourniquet rates me all the same as a dead man for after looking at the shothole he has turned me over to the parson here like a piece of old junk which is only fit to be worked up into something new captain munson had a lucky time of it i think you said mr griffith that the old gentleman was launched overboard with everything standing and that death made but one rap at his door before he took his leave  his end was indeed sudden returned griffith but it is what we seamen must expect  and for which there is so much the more occasion to be prepared the chaplain ventured to add in a low humble and perhaps timid voice  the sailingmaster looked keenly from one to the other as they spoke and after a short pause he continued with an air of great submission  twas his luck and i suppose it is sinful to begrudge a man his lawful luck as for being prepared parson that is your business and not mine therefore as there is but little time to spare why the sooner you set about it the better and to save unnecessary trouble i may as well tell you not to strive to make too much of me for i must own it to my shame i never took learning kindly if you can fit me for some middling berth in the other world like the one i hold in this ship it will suit me as well and perhaps be easier to all hands of us  if there was a shade of displeasure blended with the surprise that crossed the features of the divine at this extraordinary limitation of his duties it entirely disappeared when he considered more closely the perfect expression of simplicity with which the dying master uttered his wishes after a long and melancholy pause which neither griffith or his friend felt any inclination to interrupt the chaplain replied  it is not the province of man to determine on the decrees of the merciful dispensations of the deity and nothing that i can do mr boltrope will have any weight in making up the mighty and irrevocable decree what i said to you last night in our conversation on this very subject must still be fresh in your memory and there is no good reason why i should hold a different language to you now  i cant say that i loggd all that passed returned the master and that which i do recollect fell chiefly from myself for the plain reason that a man remembers his own better than his neighbors ideas and this puts me in mind mr griffith to tell you that one of the fortytwos from the threedecker traveled across the forecastle and cut the best bower within a fathom of the clinch as handily as an old woman would clip her rotten yarn with a pair of tailors shears if you will be so good as to order one of my mates to shift the cable endforend and make a new bend of it ill do as much for you another time  mention it not said griffith rest assured that everything shall be done for the security of the ship in your departmenti will superintend the whole duty in person and i would have you release your mind from all anxiety on the subject to attend to your more important interests elsewhere  why returned boltrope with a little show of pertinacity i have an opinion that the cleaner a man takes his hands into the other world of the matters of duty in this the better he will be fitted to handle anything newnow the parson here undertook to lay down the doctrine last night that it was no matter how well or how ill a man behaved himself so that he squared his conscience by the lifts and braces of faith which i take to be a doctrine that is not to be preached on shipboard for it would play the devil with the best ships company that was ever mustered  oh nonodear mr boltrope you mistook me and my doctrine altogether exclaimed the chaplain at least you mistook  perhaps sir interrupted griffith gently our honest friend will not be more fortunate now is there nothing earthly that hangs upon your mind boltrope no wish to be remembered to any one nor any bequest to make of your property  he has a mother i know said barnstable in a low voice he often spoke of her to me in the nightwatches i think she must still be living  the master who distinctly heard his young shipmates continued for more than a minute rolling the tobacco which he still retained from one side of his mouth to the other with an industry that denoted singular agitation for the man and raising one of his broad hands with the other he picked the worn skin from fingers which were already losing their brownish yellow hue in the fading color of death before he answered  why yes the old woman still keeps her grip upon life which is more than can be said of her son david the old man was lost the time the susan and dorothy was wrecked on the back of cape cod you remember it mr barnstable you were then a lad sailing on whaling voyages from the island well ever since that gale ive endeavored to make smooth water for the old woman myself though she has had but a rough passage of it at the best the voyage of life with her having been pretty much crossed by rugged weather and short stores  and you would have us carry some message to her said griffith kindly  why as to messages continued the master whose voice was rapidly growing more husky and broken there never has been many compliments passed between us for the reasonthat she is not more used to receive themthan i am to make them but if any one of you will overhaulthe pursers books and see what there is standing hereto my side of the leafand take a little pains to get it to the old womanyou will find her moored in the lee side of a houseay here it is no 10 cornhill boston i took careto get her a good warm berth seeing that a woman of eighty wants a snug anchorageat her time of life if ever  i will do it myself david cried barnstable struggling to conceal his emotion i will call on her the instant we let go our anchor in boston harbor and as your credit cant be large i will divide my own purse with her  the sailingmaster was powerfully affected by this kind offer the muscles of his hard weatherbeaten face working convulsively and it was a moment before he could trust his voice in reply  i know you would dicky i know you would he at length uttered grasping the hand of barnstable with a portion of his former strength i know you would give the old woman one of your own limbs if it would do a serviceto the mother of a messmatewhich it would notseeing that i am not the son of acannibal but you are out of your own fathers books and its too often shoal water in your pockets to help any onemore especially since you have just been spliced to a pretty young bodythat will want all your spare coppers  but i am master of my own fortune said griffith and am rich  ay ay i have heard it said you could build a frigate and set her afloat all ataunto without thrusting your handinto any mans purse but your own  and i pledge you the honor of a naval officer continued the young sailor that she shall want for nothing not eyes the care and tenderness of a dutiful son  boltrope appeared to be choking he made an attempt to raise his exhausted frame on the couch but fell back exhausted and dying perhaps a little prematurely through the powerful and unusual emotions that were struggling for boltrope appeared to be choking he made an attempt to raise his exhausted frame on the couch but fell back exhausted and dying perhaps a little prematurely through the powerful and unusual emotions that were struggling for utterance god forgive me my misdeeds he at length said and chiefly for ever speaking a word against your discipline remember the best bowerand look to the slings of the lower yardsandandhell do it dicky hell do it im casting offthe fastsof lifeand so god bless ye alland give ye good weathergoing largeor on a bowline  the tongue of the master failed him but a look of heart felt satisfaction gleamed across his rough visage as its muscles suddenly contracted when the faded lineaments slowly settled into the appalling stiffness of death  griffith directed the body to be removed to the apartment of the master and proceeded with a heavy heart to the upper deck the alacrity had been unnoticed during the arduous chase of the frigate and favored by daylight and her light draught of water she had easily effected her escape also among the mazes of the shoals she was called down to her consort by signal and received the necessary instructions how to steer during the approaching night the british ships were now only to be faintly discovered like white specks on the dark sea and as it was known that a broad barrier of shallow water lay between them the americans no longer regarded their presence as at all dangerous  when the necessary orders had been given and the vessels were fully prepared they were once more brought up to the wind and their heads pointed in the direction of the coast of holland the wind which freshened towards the decline of the day hauled round with the sun and when that luminary retreated from the eye so rapid had been the progress of the mariners it seemed to sink in the bosom of the ocean the land having long before settled into its watery bed all night the frigate continued to dash through the seas with a sort of sullen silence that was soothing to the melancholy of cecilia and katherine neither of whom closed an eye during that gloomy period in addition to the scene they had witnessed their feelings were harrowed by the knowledge that in conformity to the necessary plans of griffith and in compliance with the new duties he had assumed they were to separate in the morning for an indefinite period and possibly forever  with the appearance of light the boatswain sent his rough summons through the vessel and the crew were collected in solemn silence in her gangways to bury the dead the bodies of boltrope of one or two of her inferior officers and of several common men who had died of their wounds in the night were with the usual formalities committed to the deep when the yards of the ship were again braced by the wind and she glided along the trackless waste leaving no memorial in the midst of the everrolling waters to mark the place of their sepulture  when the sun had gained the meridian the vessels were once more hove to and the preparations were made for a final separation the body of colonel howard was transferred to the alacrity whither it was followed by griffith and his cheerless bride while katherine hung fondly from the window of the ship suffering her own scalding tears to mingle with the brine of the ocean after everything was arranged griffith waved his hand to barnstable who had now succeeded to the command of the frigate and the yards of the latter were braced sharp to the wind when she proceeded to the dangerous experiment of forcing her way to the shores of america by attempting the pass of the straits of dover and running the gauntlet through the english ships that crowded their own channel an undertaking however for which she had the successful example of the alliance frigate which had borne the stars of america along the same hazardous path but a few months previously  in the mean while the alacrity steering more to the west drew in swiftly towards the shores of holland and about an hour before the setting of the sun had approached so nigh as to be once more hove into the wind in obedience to the mandate of griffith a small light boat was lowered into the sea when the young sailor and the pilot who had found his way into the cutter unheeded and almost unseen ascended from the small cabin together the stranger glanced his eyes along the range of coast as if he would ascertain the exact position of the vessel and then turned them on the sea and the western horizon to scan the weather finding nothing in the appearance of the latter to induce him to change his determination he offered his hand frankly to griffith and said  here we part as our acquaintance has not led to all we wished let it be your task sir to forget we ever met  griffith bowed respectfully but in silence when the other continued shaking his hand contemptuously towards the land  had i but a moiety of the navy of that degenerate republic the proudest among those haughty islanders should tremble in his castle and be made to feel there is no security against a foe that trusts his own strength and knows the weakness of his enemy but he muttered in a lower and more hurried voice this has been like liverpool and whitehavenand edinburgh and fifty more it is past sir let it be forgotten  without heeding the wondering crew who were collected as curious spectators of his departure the stranger bowed hastily to griffith and springing into the boat he spread her light sails with the readiness of one who had nothing to learn even in the smallest matters of his daring profession once more as the boat moved briskly away from the cutter he waved his hand in adieu and griffith fancied that even through the distance he could trace a smile of bitter resignation lighting his calm features with a momentary gleam for a long time the young man stood an abstracted gazer at his solitary progress watching the small boat as it glided towards the open ocean nor did he remember to order the headsheets of the alacrity drawn in order to put the vessel again in motion until the dark speck was lost in the strong glare that fell obliquely across the water from the setting sun  many wild and extraordinary conjectures were tittered among the crew of the cutter as she slowly drew in towards her friendly haven on the appearance of the mysterious pilot during their late hazardous visit to the coast of britain and on his still more extraordinary disappearance as it were amid the stormy wastes of the north sea griffith himself was not observed to smile nor to manifest any evidence of his being a listener to their rude discourse until it was loudly announced that a small boat was pressing for their own harbor across the forefoot of the cutter under a single lugsail then indeed the sudden and cheerful lighting of his troubled eye betrayed the vast relief that was imparted to his feelings by the interesting discovery     chapter xxxv    come all you kindred chieftains of the deep   in mighty phalanx round your brother bend   hush every murmur that invades his sleep   and guard the laurels that oershade your friend   lines on tripp   here perhaps it would be wise to suffer the curtain of our imperfect drama to fall before the reader trusting that the imagination of every individual can readily supply the due proportions of health wealth and happiness that the rigid rules of poetic justice would award to the different characters of the legend but as we are not disposed to part so coldly from those with whom we have long held amicable intercourse and as there is no portion of that in reservation which is not quite as true as all that has been already related we see no unanswerable reason for dismissing the dramatis personae so abruptly we shall therefore proceed to state briefly the outlines of that which befell them in afterlife regretting at the same time that the legitimate limits of a modern tale will not admit of such dilatation of many a merry or striking scene as might create the pleasing hope of beholding hereafter some more of our rude sketches quickened into life by the spirited pencil of dunlap  following the course of the frigate then towards those shores from which perhaps we should never have suffered our truant pen to have wandered we shall commence the brief task with barnstable and his laughing weeping gay but affectionate bridethe blackeyed katherine the ship fought her way gallantly through swarms of the enemys cruisers to the port of boston where barnstable was rewarded for his services by promotion and a more regular authority to command his vessel  during the remainder of the war he continued to fill that station with ability and zeal nor did he return to the dwelling of his fathers which he soon inherited by regular descent until after peace had established not only the independence of his country but his own reputation as a brave and successful seaofficer when the federal government laid the foundation of its present navy captain barnstable was once more tempted by the offer of a new commission to desert his home and for many years he was employed among that band of gallant seamen who served their country so faithfully in times of trial and high daring happily however he was enabled to accomplish a great deal of the more peaceful part of his service accompanied by katherine who having no children eagerly profited by his consent to share his privations and hardships on the ocean in this manner they passed merrily and we trust happily down the vale of life together katherine entirely discrediting the ironical prediction of her former guardian by making everything considered a very obedient and certainly so far as attachment was concerned a most devoted wife  the boy merry who in due time became a man clung to barnstable and katherine so long as it was necessary to hold him in leadingstrings and when he received his regular promotion his first command was under the shadow of his kinsmans broad pennant he proved to be in his meridian what his youth had so strongly indicated a fearless active and reckless sailor and his years might have extended to this hour had he not fallen untimely in a duel with a foreign officer  the first act of captain manual after landing once more on his native soil was to make interest to be again restored to the line of the army he encountered but little difficulty in this attempt and was soon in possession of the complete enjoyment of that which his soul had so long pined after a steady drill he was in time to share in all the splendid successes which terminated the war and also to participate in his due proportion of the misery of the army his merits were not forgotten however in the reorganization of the forces and he followed both st clair and his more fortunate successor wayne in the western campaigns about the close of the century when the british made their tardy relinquishment of the line of posts along the frontiers captain manual was ordered to take charge with his company of a small stockade on our side of one of those mighty rivers that sets bounds to the territories of the republic in the north the british flag was waving over the ramparts of a more regular fortress that had been recently built directly opposite within the new lines of the canadas manual was not a man to neglect the observances of military etiquette and understanding that the neighboring fort was commanded by a field officer he did not fail to wait on that gentleman in proper time with a view to cultivate the sort of acquaintance that their mutual situations would render not only agreeable but highly convenient the american martinet in ascertaining the rank of the other had not deemed it at all necessary to ask his name but when the redfaced comical looking officer with one leg who met him was introduced as major borroughcliffe he had not the least difficulty in recalling to recollection his quondam acquaintance of st ruth the intercourse between these worthies was renewed with remarkable gusto and at length arrived to so regular a pass that a log cabin was erected on one of the islands in the river as a sort of neutral territory where their feastings and revels might be held without any scandal to the discipline of their respective garrisons here the qualities of many a saddle of savory venison were discussed together with those of sundry pleasant fowls as well as of divers strange beasts that inhabit those western wilds while at the same time the secret places of the broad river were vexed that nothing might be wanting that could contribute to the pleasures of their banquets a most equitable levy was regularly made on their respective pockets to sustain the foreign expenses of this amicable warfare and a suitable division of labor was also imposed on the two commandants in order to procure such articles of comfort as were only to be obtained from those portions of the globe where the art of man had made a nearer approach to the bounties of nature than in the vicinity of their fortifications all liquids in which malt formed an ingredient as well as the deepcolored wines of oporto were suffered to enter the gulf of st lawrence and were made to find their way under the superintendence of borroughcliffe to their destined goal but manual was solely entrusted with the more important duty of providing the generous liquor of madeira without any other restriction on his judgment than an occasional injunction from his coadjutor that it should not fail to be the product of the south side  it was not unusual for the young officers of the two garrisons to allude to the battle in which major borroughcliffe had lost his limbthe english ensign invariably whispering to the american on such occasions that it occurred during the late contest in a desperate affair on the north eastern coast of their island in which the major commanded in behalf of his countrywith great credit and signal success and for which service he obtained his present rank without purchase a sort of national courtesy prevented the two veterans for by this time both had earned that honorable title from participating at all in these delicate allusions though whenever by any accident they occurred near the termination of the revels borroughcliffe would so far betray his consciousness of what was passing as to favor his american friend with a leer of singular significance which generally produced in the other that sort of dull recollection which all actors and painters endeavor to represent by scratching the head in this manner year after year rolled by the most perfect harmony existing between the two posts notwithstanding the angry passions that disturbed their respective countries when an end was suddenly put to the intercourse by the unfortunate death of manual this rigid observer of discipline never trusted his person on the neutral island without being accompanied by a party of his warriors who were posted as a regular picket sustaining a suitable line of sentries a practice which he also recommended to his friend as being highly conducive to discipline as well as a salutary caution against a surprise on the part of either garrison the major however dispensed with the formality in his own behalf but was sufficiently goodnatured to wink at the want of confidence it betrayed in his boon companion on one unhappy occasion when the discussions o£ a new importation had made a heavy inroad on the morning manual left the hut to make his way towards his picket in such a state of utter mental aberration as to forget the countersign when challenged by a sentinel when unhappily he met his death by a shot from a soldier whom he drilled to such an exquisite state of insensibility that the man cared but little whether he killed friend or enemy so long as he kept within military usage and the hallowed limits established by the articles of war he lived long enough however to commend the fellow for the deed and died while delivering an eulogium to borroughcliffe on the high state of perfection to which he had brought his command  about a year before this melancholy event a quartercask of wine had been duly ordered from the south side of the island of madeira which was at the death of manual toiling its weary way up the rapids of the mississippi and the ohio having been made to enter by the port of new orleans with the intention of keeping it as long as possible under a genial sun the untimely fate of his friend imposed on borroughcliffe the necessity of attending to this precious relic of their mutual tastes and he procured a leave of absence from his superior with the laudable desire to proceed down the streams and superintend its farther advance in person the result of his zeal was a high fever that set in the day after he reached his treasure and as the doctor and the major espoused different theories in treating a disorder so dangerous in that climatethe one advising abstemiousness and the other administering repeated draughts of the cordial that had drawn him so far from home the disease was left to act its pleasure borroughcliffe died in three days and was carried back and interred by the side of his friend in the very hut which had so often resounded with their humors and festivities we have been thus particular in relating the sequel of the lives of these rival chieftains because from their want of connection with any kind heart of the other sex no widows and orphans were left to lament their several ends and furthermore as they were both mortal and might be expected to die at a suitable period and yet did not terminate their career until each had attained the mature age of threescore the reader can find no just grounds of dissatisfaction at being allowed this deep glance into the womb of fate  the chaplain abandoned the seas in time to retrieve his character a circumstance which gave no little satisfaction to katherine who occasionally annoyed her worthy husband on the subject of the informality of their marriage  griffith and his mourning bride conveyed the body of colonel howard in safety to one of the principal towns in holland where it was respectfully and sorrowfully interred after which the young man removed to paris with a view of erasing the sad images which the hurried and melancholy events of the few preceding days had left on the mind of his lovely companion from this place cecilia held communion by letter with her friend alice dunscombe and such suitable provision was made in the affairs of her late uncle as the times would permit afterwards when griffith obtained the command which had been offered him before sailing on the cruise in the north sea they returned together to america the young man continued a sailor until the close of the war when he entirely withdrew from the ocean and devoted the remainder of his life to the conjoint duties of a husband and a good citizen  as it was easy to reclaim the estates of colonel howard which in fact had been abandoned more from pride than necessity and which had never been confiscated their joint inheritances made the young couple extremely affluent and we shall here take occasion to say that griffith remembered his promise to the dying master and saw such a provision made for the childless mother as her situation and his character required  it might have been some twelve years after the short cruise which it has been our task to record in these volumes that griffith who was running his eyes carelessly over a file of newspapers was observed by his wife to drop the bundle from before his face and pass his hand slowly across his brow like a man who had been suddenly struck with renewed impressions of some former event or who was endeavoring to recall to his mind images that had long since faded  see you anything in that paper to disturb you griffith said the still lovely cecilia i hope that now we have our confederate government the states will soon recover from their lossesbut it is one of those plans to create a new navy that has met your eye ah truant you sigh to become a wanderer again and pine after your beloved ocean  i have ceased sighing and pining since you have begun to smile he returned with a vacant manner and without removing his hand from his brow  is not the new order of things then likely to succeed does the congress enter into contention with the president  the wisdom and name of washington will smooth the way for the experiment until time shall mature the system cecilia do you remember the man who accompanied manual and myself to st ruth the night we became your uncles prisoners and who afterwards led the party which liberated us and rescued barnstable  surely i do he was the pilot of your ship it was then said and i remember the shrewd soldier we entertained even suspected that he was one greater than he seemed  the soldier surmised the truth but you saw him not on that fearful night when he carried us through the shoals and you could not witness the calm courage with which he guided the ship into those very channels again while the confusion of battle was among us  i heard the dreadful din and i can easily imagine the horrid scene returned his wife her recollections chasing the color from her cheeks even at that distance of time but what of him is his name mentioned in those papers ah they are english prints you called his name gray if i remember  that is the name he bore with us he was a man who had formed romantic notions of glory and wished everything concealed in which he acted a part that he thought would not contribute to his renown  can there have been any connection between him and alice dunscombe said cecilia dropping her work in her lap in a thoughtful manner she met him alone at her own urgent request the night katherine and myself saw you in your confinement and even then my cousin whispered that they were acquainted the letter i received yesterday from alice was sealed with black and i was pained with the melancholy though gentle manner in which she wrote of passing from this world into another  griffith glanced his eye at his wife with a look of sudden intelligence and then answered like one who began to see with the advantages of a clearer atmosphere  cecilia your conjecture is surely true fifty things rushed to my mind at that one surmisehis acquaintance with that particular spothis early lifehis expeditionhis knowledge of the abbey all confirm it he altogether was indeed a man of marked character  why has he not been among us asked cecilia he appeared devoted to our cause  his devotion to america proceeded from desire of distinction his ruling passion and perhaps a little also from resentment at some injustice which he claimed to have suffered from his own countrymen he was a man and not therefore without foiblesamong which may have been reckoned the estimation of his own acts but they were most daring and deserving of praise neither did he at all merit the obloquy that he received from his enemies his love of liberty may be more questionable for if he commenced his deeds in the cause of these free states they terminated in the service of a despot he is now deadbut had he lived in times and under circumstances when his consummate knowledge of his profession his cool deliberate and even desperate courage could have been exercised in a regular and wellsupported navy and had the habits of his youth better qualified him to have borne meekly the honors he acquired in his age he would have left behind him no name in its lists that would have descended to the latest posterity of his adopted countrymen with greater renown  why griffith exclaimed cecilia in a little surprise you are zealous in his cause who was he  a man who held a promise of secrecy while living which is not at all released by his death it is enough to know that he was greatly instrumental in procuring our sudden union and that our happiness might have been wrecked in the voyage of life had we not met the unknown pilot of the german ocean  perceiving her husband to rise and carefully collect the papers in a bundle before he left the room cecilia made no further remark at the time nor was the subject ever revived between them
