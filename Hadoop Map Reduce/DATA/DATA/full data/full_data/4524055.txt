4524055	night watches  by ww jacobs     the three sisters  thirty years ago on a wet autumn evening the household of malletts lodge was gathered round the deathbed of ursula mallow the eldest of the three sisters who inhabited it  the dingy motheaten curtains of the old wooden bedstead were drawn apart the light of a smoking oil lamp falling upon the hopeless countenance of the dying woman as she turned her dull eyes upon her sisters  the room was in silence except for an occasional sob from the youngest sister eunice  outside the rain fell steadily over the steaming marshes  nothing is to be changed tabitha gasped ursula to the other sister who bore a striking likeness to her although her expression was harder and colder this room is to be locked up and never opened  very well said tabitha brusquely though i dont see how it can matter to you then  it does matter said her sister with startling energy  how do you know how do i know that i may not sometimes visit it  i have lived in this house so long i am certain that i shall see it again  i will come back  come back to watch over you both and see that no harm befalls you  you are talking wildly said tabitha by no means moved at her sisters solicitude for her welfare  your mind is wandering you know that i have no faith in such things  ursula sighed and beckoning to eunice who was weeping silently at the bedside placed her feeble arms around her neck and kissed her  do not weep dear she said feebly  perhaps it is best so  a lonely womans life is scarce worth living  we have no hopes no aspirations other women have had happy husbands and children but we in this forgotten place have grown old together  i go first but you must soon follow  tabitha comfortably conscious of only forty years and an iron frame shrugged her shoulders and smiled grimly  i go first repeated ursula in a new and strange voice as her heavy eyes slowly closed but i will come for each of you in turn when your lease of life runs out  at that moment i will be with you to lead your steps whither i now go  as she spoke the flickering lamp went out suddenly as though extinguished by a rapid hand and the room was left in utter darkness a strange suffocating noise issued from the bed and when the trembling women had relighted the lamp all that was left of ursula mallow was ready for the grave  that night the survivors passed together  the dead woman had been a firm believer in the existence of that shadowy borderland which is said to form an unhallowed link between the living and the dead and even the stolid tabitha slightly unnerved by the events of the night was not free from certain apprehensions that she might have been right  with the bright morning their fears disappeared  the sun stole in at the window and seeing the poor earthworn face on the pillow so touched it and glorified it that only its goodness and weakness were seen and the beholders came to wonder how they could ever have felt any dread of aught so calm and peaceful  a day or two passed and the body was transferred to a massive coffin long regarded as the finest piece of work of its kind ever turned out of the village carpenters workshop then a slow and melancholy cortege headed by four bearers wound its solemn way across the marshes to the family vault in the grey old church and all that was left of ursula was placed by the father and mother who had taken that selfsame journey some thirty years before  to eunice as they toiled slowly home the day seemed strange and sabbath like the flat prospect of marsh wilder and more forlorn than usual the roar of the sea more depressing  tabitha had no such fancies  the bulk of the dead womans property had been left to eunice and her avaricious soul was sorely troubled and her proper sisterly feelings of regret for the deceased sadly interfered with in consequence  what are you going to do with all that money eunice she asked as they sat at their quiet tea  i shall leave it as it stands said eunice slowly  we have both got sufficient to live upon and i shall devote the income from it to supporting some beds in a childrens hospital  if ursula had wished it to go to a hospital said tabitha in her deep tones she would have left the money to it herself  i wonder you do not respect her wishes more  what else can i do with it then inquired eunice  save it said the other with gleaming eyes save it  eunice shook her head  no said she it shall go to the sick children but the principal i will not touch and if i die before you it shall become yours and you can do what you like with it  very well said tabitha smothering her anger by a strong effort i dont believe that was what ursula meant you to do with it and i dont believe she will rest quietly in the grave while you squander the money she stored so carefully  what do you mean  asked eunice with pale lips  you are trying to frighten me i thought that you did not believe in such things  tabitha made no answer and to avoid the anxious inquiring gaze of her sister drew her chair to the fire and folding her gaunt arms composed herself for a nap  for some time life went on quietly in the old house  the room of the dead woman in accordance with her last desire was kept firmly locked its dirty windows forming a strange contrast to the prim cleanliness of the others  tabitha never very talkative became more taciturn than ever and stalked about the house and the neglected garden like an unquiet spirit her brow roughened into the deep wrinkles suggestive of much thought  as the winter came on bringing with it the long dark evenings the old house became more lonely than ever and an air of mystery and dread seemed to hang over it and brood in its empty rooms and dark corridors  the deep silence of night was broken by strange noises for which neither the wind nor the rats could be held accountable  old martha seated in her distant kitchen heard strange sounds upon the stairs and once upon hurrying to them fancied that she saw a dark figure squatting upon the landing though a subsequent search with candle and spectacles failed to discover anything  eunice was disturbed by several vague incidents and as she suffered from a complaint of the heart rendered very ill by them  even tabitha admitted a strangeness about the house but confident in her piety and virtue took no heed of it her mind being fully employed in another direction  since the death of her sister all restraint upon her was removed and she yielded herself up entirely to the stern and hard rules enforced by avarice upon its devotees  her housekeeping expenses were kept rigidly separate from those of eunice and her food limited to the coarsest dishes while in the matter of clothes the old servant was by far the better dressed  seated alone in her bedroom this uncouth hardfeatured creature revelled in her possessions grudging even the expense of the candleend which enabled her to behold them  so completely did this passion change her that both eunice and martha became afraid of her and lay awake in their beds night after night trembling at the chinking of the coins at her unholy vigils  one day eunice ventured to remonstrate  why dont you bank your money tabitha she said it is surely not safe to keep such large sums in such a lonely house  large sums repeated the exasperated tabitha large sums  what nonsense is this  you know well that i have barely sufficient to keep me  its a great temptation to housebreakers said her sister not pressing the point  i made sure last night that i heard somebody in the house  did you  said tabitha grasping her arm a horrible look on her face so did i  i thought they went to ursulas room and i got out of bed and went on the stairs to listen  well said eunice faintly fascinated by the look on her sisters face  there was something there said tabitha slowly  ill swear it for i stood on the landing by her door and listened something scuffling on the floor round and round the room  at first i thought it was the cat but when i went up there this morning the door was still locked and the cat was in the kitchen  oh let us leave this dreadful house moaned eunice  what said her sister grimly afraid of poor ursula  why should you be  your own sister who nursed you when you were a babe and who perhaps even now comes and watches over your slumbers  oh said eunice pressing her hand to her side if i saw her i should die  i should think that she had come for me as she said she would o god have mercy on me i am dying  she reeled as she spoke and before tabitha could save her sank senseless to the floor  get some water cried tabitha as old martha came hurrying up the stairs eunice has fainted  the old woman with a timid glance at her retired reappearing shortly afterwards with the water with which she proceeded to restore her much loved mistress to her senses  tabitha as soon as this was accomplished stalked off to her room leaving her sister and martha sitting drearily enough in the small parlour watching the fire and conversing in whispers  it was clear to the old servant that this state of things could not last much longer and she repeatedly urged her mistress to leave a house so lonely and so mysterious  to her great delight eunice at length consented despite the fierce opposition of her sister and at the mere idea of leaving gained greatly in health and spirits  a small but comfortable house was hired in morville and arrangements made for a speedy change  it was the last night in the old house and all the wild spirits of the marshes the wind and the sea seemed to have joined forces for one supreme effort  when the wind dropped as it did at brief intervals the sea was heard moaning on the distant beach strangely mingled with the desolate warning of the bellbuoy as it rocked to the waves  then the wind rose again and the noise of the sea was lost in the fierce gusts which finding no obstacle on the open marshes swept with their full fury upon the house by the creek  the strange voices of the air shrieked in its chimneys windows rattled doors slammed and even the very curtains seemed to live and move  eunice was in bed awake  a small nightlight in a saucer of oil shed a sickly glare upon the wormeaten old furniture distorting the most innocent articles into ghastly shapes  a wilder gust than usual almost deprived her of the protection afforded by that poor light and she lay listening fearfully to the creakings and other noises on the stairs bitterly regretting that she had not asked martha to sleep with her but it was not too late even now  she slipped hastily to the floor crossed to the huge wardrobe and was in the very act of taking her dressinggown from its peg when an unmistakable footfall was heard on the stairs  the robe dropped from her shaking fingers and with a quickly beating heart she regained her bed  the sounds ceased and a deep silence followed which she herself was unable to break although she strove hard to do so  a wild gust of wind shook the windows and nearly extinguished the light and when its flame had regained its accustomed steadiness she saw that the door was slowly opening while the huge shadow of a hand blotted the papered wall still her tongue refused its office  the door flew open with a crash a cloaked figure entered and throwing aside its coverings she saw with a horror past all expression the napkinbound face of the dead ursula smiling terribly at her  in her last extremity she raised her faded eyes above for succour and then as the figure noiselessly advanced and laid its cold hand upon her brow the soul of eunice mallow left its body with a wild shriek and made its way to the eternal  martha roused by the cry and shivering with dread rushed to the door and gazed in terror at the figure which stood leaning over the bedside as she watched it slowly removed the cowl and the napkin and exposed the fell face of tabitha so strangely contorted between fear and triumph that she hardly recognized it  whos there cried tabitha in a terrible voice as she saw the old womans shadow on the wall  i thought i heard a cry said martha entering  did anybody call  yes eunice said the other regarding her closely  i too heard the cry and hurried to her  what makes her so strange  is she in a trance  ay said the old woman falling on her knees by the bed and sobbing bitterly the trance of death  ah my dear my poor lonely girl that this should be the end of it  she has died of fright said the old woman pointing to the eyes which even yet retained their horror  she has seen something devilish  tabithas gaze fell  she has always suffered with her heart she muttered the night has frightened her it frightened me  she stood upright by the foot of the bed as martha drew the sheet over the face of the dead woman  first ursula then eunice said tabitha drawing a deep breath  i cant stay here  ill dress and wait for the morning  she left the room as she spoke and with bent head proceeded to her own martha remained by the bedside and gently closing the staring eyes fell on her knees and prayed long and earnestly for the departed soul overcome with grief and fear she remained with bowed head until a sudden sharp cry from tabitha brought her to her feet  well said the old woman going to the door  where are you cried tabitha somewhat reassured by her voice  in miss eunices bedroom  do you want anything  come down at once  quick  i am unwell  her voice rose suddenly to a scream  quick  for gods sake  quick or i shall go mad  there is some strange woman in the house  the old woman stumbled hastily down the dark stairs  what is the matter  she cried entering the room  who is it  what do you mean  i saw it said tabitha grasping her convulsively by the shoulder  i was coming to you when i saw the figure of a woman in front of me going up the stairs  is itcan it be ursula come for the soul of eunice as she said she would  or for yours  said martha the words coming from her in some odd fashion despite herself  tabitha with a ghastly look fell cowering by her side clutching tremulously at her clothes  light the lamps she cried hysterically light a fire make a noise oh this dreadful darkness  will it never be day  soon soon said martha overcoming her repugnance and trying to pacify her  when the day comes you will laugh at these fears  i murdered her screamed the miserable woman i killed her with fright  why did she not give me the money  twas no use to her  ah look there  martha with a horrible fear followed her glance to the door but saw nothing  its ursula said tabitha from between her teeth  keep her off keep her off  the old woman who by some unknown sense seemed to feel the presence of a third person in the room moved a step forward and stood before her as she did so tabitha waved her arms as though to free herself from the touch of a detaining hand half rose to her feet and without a word fell dead before her  at this the old womans courage forsook her and with a great cry she rushed from the room eager to escape from this house of death and mystery  the bolts of the great door were stiff with age and strange voices seemed to ring in her ears as she strove wildly to unfasten them her brain whirled  she thought that the dead in their distant rooms called to her and that a devil stood on the step outside laughing and holding the door against her  then with a supreme effort she flung it open and heedless of her nightclothes passed into the bitter night the path across the marshes was lost in the darkness but she found it the planks over the ditches slippery and narrow but she crossed them in safety until at last her feet bleeding and her breath coming in great gasps she entered the village and sank down more dead than alive on a cottage doorstep
